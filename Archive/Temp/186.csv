Using an optimized adenovirus-free packaging system, recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors coding for the enhanced green fluorescent protein (AAV/EGFP) and CD40 ligand (AAV/CD40L) were packaged and highly purified resulting in genomic titers up to 3 x 10(11)/mL. Cells obtained from 24 patients with B-CLL were infected with AAV/EGFP or AAV/CD40L at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 resulting in transgene expression in up to 97% of cells as detected by flow cytometry 48 hours after infection. Viral transduction could be specifically blocked by heparin. Transduction with AAV/CD40L resulted in up-regulation of the costimulatory molecule CD80 not only on infected CLL cells but also on noninfected bystander leukemia B cells, whereas this effect induced specific proliferation of HLA-matched allogeneic T cells. Vaccination strategies for patients with B-CLL using leukemia cells infected ex vivo by rAAV vectors now seems possible in the near future.","['Wendtner, Clemens-Martin', 'Kofler, David M', 'Theiss, Hans D', 'Kurzeder, Christian', 'Buhmann, Raymund', 'Schweighofer, Carmen', 'Perabo, Luca', 'Danhauser-Riedl, Susanne', 'Baumert, Jens', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Buning, Hildegard']","['Wendtner CM', 'Kofler DM', 'Theiss HD', 'Kurzeder C', 'Buhmann R', 'Schweighofer C', 'Perabo L', 'Danhauser-Riedl S', 'Baumert J', 'Hiddemann W', 'Hallek M', 'Buning H']","['Medical Clinic III, University Hospital Grosshadern and Gene Center, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'B7-1 Antigen/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/*genetics', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Dependovirus', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Luminescent Proteins', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2002/08/15 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59249-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2002 Sep 1;100(5):1655-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy-one percent of patients received 6MP, 57% received MTX, and 38% received VP. Thirty patients had a relapse at 1.5 to 80 months (median, 12.5 months), 15 in the first year and 7 beyond 3 years. The cumulative incidence of relapse at 10 years was 42% (95% CI, 31%-55%).

Age older than 30 years, more than 4 weeks to attain remission, and high-risk karyotypes, for example, t(9;22) or t(4;11), were adverse features contributing to the identification of 3 prognostic risk groups with 0, 1, and 2 adverse features, respectively: standard (47%), intermediate (36%), and high (17%). The 10-year cumulative incidences of relapse (20%, 48%, 85%; P <.0001) and probabilities of DFS (72%, 41%, 10%; P =.0003) were significantly different among these groups. In Cox analysis of the 71 patients alive and well 120 days after transplantation, those receiving 2 or 3 maintenance chemotherapy agents had significantly lower relapse rates and superior DFS compared with those receiving 0 or 1 agent. Our data suggest that maintenance chemotherapy improves the outcome of patients with ALL undergoing autografting.

Imatinib mesylate (STI571), a selective inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, has significant activity in AP CML. As clonal evolution could allow Bcr-Abl independent proliferation, we analyzed its impact on the outcome of 71 AP patients treated with 600 mg of imatinib mesylate. Fifteen patients had clonal evolution alone (AP-CE), 32 had AP features but no evidence of clonal evolution (HEM-AP), and 24 had AP features plus clonal evolution (HEM-AP + CE). Of the AP-CE patients, 73% had a major cytogenetic response, compared with 31% of the HEM-AP patients (P =.043) and 12.5% of the HEM-AP + CE patients (P =.007). Complete cytogenetic responses were seen in 60% of AP-CE patients, compared with 31% of HEM-AP patients (P =.19) and 8% of HEM-AP + CE patients (P <.001). With mean follow-up of 11.2 months, 35% of all patients failed treatment. The lowest estimated rate of treatment failure at 1 year, 0%, was seen in AP-CE patients, compared with rates of 31% for HEM-AP patients and 69% for HEM-AP + CE patients (P =.0004). After 1 year, 100% of AP-CE patients were still alive, compared with 85% of HEM-AP patients and 67.5% of HEM-AP + CE patients (P =.01). In conclusion, in patients with clonal evolution as the sole criterion of disease acceleration, good responses to imatinib are still possible. Once patients have other signs of acceleration, clonal evolution predicts lower response rates and a shorter time to treatment failure.","[""O'Dwyer, Michael E"", 'Mauro, Michael J', 'Kurilik, Gwen', 'Mori, Motomi', 'Balleisen, Suzanne', 'Olson, Susan', 'Magenis, Ellen', 'Capdeville, Renaud', 'Druker, Brian J']","[""O'Dwyer ME"", 'Mauro MJ', 'Kurilik G', 'Mori M', 'Balleisen S', 'Olson S', 'Magenis E', 'Capdeville R', 'Druker BJ']","['Leukemia Center, Oregon Health and Science University Cancer Institute, Portland, USA. michael.odwyer@whb.ie']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis']",2002/08/15 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-03-0777 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59245-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Sep 1;100(5):1628-33. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-03-0777.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we used cryopreserved umbilical cord blood (UCB) as a strategy to reduce the risks of GVHD and treatment-related mortality (TRM) and improve survival. Data on 102 patients (median age 7.4 years) who received transplants between 1994 and 2001 for the treatment of malignant (n = 65; 68% were high-risk patients) and nonmalignant (n = 37) diseases were evaluated. Log-rank tests and Cox regression analyses were used to determine the effects of various demographic, graft-related, and treatment factors on engraftment, GVHD, TRM, relapse, and survival. As of October 15, 2001, the median follow-up was 2.7 years (range, 0.3-7.2). Incidences of neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 0.88 (CI, 0.81-0.95) and 0.65 (CI, 0.53-0.77), respectively. Notably, incidences of severe acute and chronic GVHD were 0.11 (CI, 0.05-0.17) and 0.10 (CI, 0.04-0.16), respectively. At 1 year after transplantation, proportions of TRM and survival were 0.30 (CI, 0.21-0.39) and 0.58 (CI, 0.48-0.68), respectively. In Cox regression analyses, CD34 cell dose was the one factor consistently identified as significantly associated with rate of engraftment, TRM, and survival. Despite the low incidence of GVHD, the proportion of patients with leukemia relapse at 2 years was 0.17 (CI, 0.00-0.38) and 0.45 (CI, 0.28-0.61) for patients with standard and high-risk disease, respectively. There is a high probability of survival in recipients of UCB grafts that are disparate in no more than 2 human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) when the grafts contain at least 1.7 x 10(5) CD34(+) cells per kilogram of recipient's body weight.

Interactions of SDF-1 with its receptor CXCR4 have been implicated in CD34(+) cell migration and homing. Here it is shown that human SDF-1beta (hSDF-1beta) alone secreted by hSDF-1beta-transduced tumor cells promotes efficacious antitumor responses. The murine C1498 leukemia and B16F1 melanoma models have been studied. For expression of hSDF-1beta by tumor cells (SDF-tumor cells), packaging cell lines secreting retroviruses encoding hSDF-1beta have been used. The results demonstrate that 50% (B16F1) and 90% (C1498) of naive mice injected with SDF-tumor cells reject their tumors. Prophylactic vaccination of naive mice with irradiated SDF-tumor cells leads to systemic immunity, and therapeutic vaccination leads to cure of established tumors. Mice that previously rejected live SDF-tumor cells are immune to the rejected tumor but susceptible to another tumor and have in vitro tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity. SDF-tumor cells are not rejected by immunodeficient scid mice. Immunohistochemistry shows significant infiltration of SDF-1 tumors by T cells, and in vivo T-cell depletion studies indicate that CD4(+) T cells are required for SDF-mediated tumor rejection. In conclusion, the present data suggest that SDF-1/CXCR4 interactions have the potential to regulate efficacious antitumor immune responses; exploitation of these interactions may lead to novel therapeutic interventions.","['Dunussi-Joannopoulos, Kyriaki', 'Zuberek, Krystyna', 'Runyon, Kathlene', 'Hawley, Robert G', 'Wong, Anthony', 'Erickson, Jamie', 'Herrmann, Steve', 'Leonard, John P']","['Dunussi-Joannopoulos K', 'Zuberek K', 'Runyon K', 'Hawley RG', 'Wong A', 'Erickson J', 'Herrmann S', 'Leonard JP']","['Wyeth Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/*immunology/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Stromal Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2002/08/15 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59233-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2002 Sep 1;100(5):1551-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ligand for FLT3 is expressed by marrow stromal cells and other cells and synergizes with other growth factors to stimulate proliferation of stem cells, progenitor cells, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. Mutations of FLT3 have been detected in about 30% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and a small number of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Patients with FLT3 mutations tend to have a poor prognosis. The mutations most often involve small tandem duplications of amino acids within the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor and result in constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Expression of a mutant FLT3 receptor in murine marrow cells results in a lethal myeloproliferative syndrome and preliminary studies suggest that mutant FLT3 cooperates with other leukemia oncogenes to confer a more aggressive phenotype. Taken together, these results suggest that FLT3 is an attractive therapeutic target for kinase inhibitors or other approaches for patients with mutations of this gene.","['Gilliland, D Gary', 'Griffin, James D']","['Gilliland DG', 'Griffin JD']","[""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, MA, USA. gilliland@calvin.bwh.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2002/08/15 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0492 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59231-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Sep 1;100(5):1532-42. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0492.,"['P01 CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK5654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,152,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median times to neutrophil recovery were 19 days and 23 days and the times to platelet recovery were 16 days and 22 days in the peripheral blood and bone marrow groups, respectively (P <.0001 for both comparisons). The cumulative incidence of grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease 100 days after transplantation was 44% in both groups (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.49; P >.9), and the incidence of extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease at 30 months after transplantation was 40% with peripheral blood and 30% with bone marrow (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.96; P =.37). There was no statistically significant difference in the probability of relapse of the underlying disease between the groups. The probabilities of survival at 30 months after transplantation were 68% and 60% in the peripheral blood and bone marrow groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.97; P =.04). In patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplasia undergoing allogeneic transplantation from matched siblings, the use of peripheral blood instead of bone marrow leads to faster hematologic recovery, similar risk of graft-versus-host disease, and improved survival.","['Couban, Stephen', 'Simpson, David R', 'Barnett, Michael J', 'Bredeson, Christopher', 'Hubesch, Lothar', 'Howson-Jan, Kang', 'Shore, Tsiporah B', 'Walker, Irwin R', 'Browett, Peter', 'Messner, Hans A', 'Panzarella, Tony', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H']","['Couban S', 'Simpson DR', 'Barnett MJ', 'Bredeson C', 'Hubesch L', 'Howson-Jan K', 'Shore TB', 'Walker IR', 'Browett P', 'Messner HA', 'Panzarella T', 'Lipton JH']","['Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University and Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, NS, Canada. scouban@is.dal.ca']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Cells/pathology/transplantation', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/08/15 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-01-0048 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59229-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Sep 1;100(5):1525-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-01-0048.,,,,['Canadian Bone Marrow Transplant Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to understand the involvement of Tax protein in HTLV-1 pathogenesis, we constructed a HIV-1 based lentiviral vector containing the central DNA flap sequence and either the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or the HTLV-1 tax genes. Using these vectors, GFP and tax genes were introduced in several primary and immortalized cells of endothelial, lymphoid, astrocytic or macrophagic origin. As assessed by GFP expression, up to 100% efficiency of transduction was obtained for all cell types tested. Tax expression was detected by Western blot and immuno-fluorescence in the transduced cells. After transduction, the Tax transcriptional activity was confirmed by the transactivation of HTLV-1 LTR-lacZ or HTLV-1 LTR-GFP reporter genes. Increased CD25 and HLA DR expression was observed in human peripheral blood lymphocytes transduced with the Tax vector. These results indicate that both pathways of Tax transactivation, CREB (viral LTR) and NF-kappa B (CD25 and HLA DR), are functional after transduction by TRIP Tax vector. Therefore, this vector provides a useful tool for investigating the role of the Tax viral protein in the pathogenesis of diseases linked to HTLV-1 infection.","['Royer-Leveau, Christelle', 'Mordelet, Elodie', 'Delebecque, Frederic', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Charneau, Pierre', 'Ozden, Simona']","['Royer-Leveau C', 'Mordelet E', 'Delebecque F', 'Gessain A', 'Charneau P', 'Ozden S']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, 25-28 rue du Dr Roux, 75724 Paris,Cedex 15 France.""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'HTLV-I Infections/physiopathology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lac Operon/genetics/physiology', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2002/08/15 10:00,2002/11/28 04:00,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0166093402000976 [pii]', '10.1016/s0166-0934(02)00097-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 2002 Aug;105(1):133-40. doi: 10.1016/s0166-0934(02)00097-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Time and dose responses of the human cultured leukemia (HL-60) line were measured for paraquat, styrene oxide (SO), N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU) and puromycin. These toxicants were chosen because of their different predominant mechanisms of action, namely membrane free radical attack, simultaneous membrane and nucleic acid attack, nucleic acid alkylation, and protein synthesis inhibition, respectively. For all treatments, the specific membrane capacitance (C(mem)) of the cells decreased while the specific membrane conductance (G(mem)) increased in dose- and time-dependent manners. The DEP responses correlated sensitively with alterations in cell surface morphology, especially folds, microvilli, and blebs, observed by scanning electron microscopy. The DEP method was more sensitive to agents that had a direct action on the membrane than to agents for which membrane alterations were secondary. The responses to paraquat and SO, which directly damaged the cell membrane, could be detected 15 min after exposure, while those for puromycin and NMU, which acted on intracellular targets, could be detected after 30 min. The detection times and dose sensitivity results showed that the DEP method is much faster and more sensitive than conventional cell and higher organism viability testing techniques.

The aims of the present study were to examine the effects of pregnancy and delivery on plasma kynurenine, a major tryptophan catabolite synthesized after induction of indoleamine-2, 3 dioxygenase (IDO) by pro-inflammatory cytokines. We measured plasma kynurenine and tryptophan and immune markers, such as serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and the leukemia inhibitory factor-receptor (LIF-R) in healthy, nonpregnant and pregnant women at the end of term and one and three days after delivery. Plasma kynurenine was significantly lower in pregnant women at the end of term than in nonpregnant women, findings which may be attributed to lower plasma tryptophan at the end of term. The kynurenine/tryptophan (K/T) quotient was significantly higher in the pregnant women at the end of term and in the early puerperium than in nonpregnant women. In the early puerperium there was a significant increase in plasma kynurenine and the K/T quotient. The increases in plasma kynurenine and the K/T quotient were significantly more pronounced in women whose anxiety and depression scores significantly increased in the puerperium. The changes from the end of term to the early puerperium in plasma kynurenine and the K/T quotient were significantly related to those in the immune markers. It is concluded that 1) lower plasma kynurenine at the end of term is the consequence of lower plasma tryptophan; 2) the increased K/T quotient at the end of term and in the early puerperium indicates inflammation-induced degradation of tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway; and 3) that depressive and anxiety symptoms in the early puerperium are (causally) related to an increased catabolism of tryptophan into kynurenine, a phenomenon which probably results from immune activation.","['Maes, Michael', 'Verkerk, Robert', 'Bonaccorso, Stephania', 'Ombelet, Willem', 'Bosmans, Eugene', 'Scharpe, Simon']","['Maes M', 'Verkerk R', 'Bonaccorso S', 'Ombelet W', 'Bosmans E', 'Scharpe S']","['Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital of Maastricht, Postbus 5800, 6202 AZ Maastricht, The Netherlands. crc-mh@online.be']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '343-65-7 (Kynurenine)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anxiety/*psychology', 'Depression/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity/*physiology', 'Inflammation/blood', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Interleukin-8/blood', 'Kynurenine/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Menstrual Cycle/metabolism', 'Postpartum Period/*psychology', 'Pregnancy', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Tryptophan/*metabolism']",2002/08/15 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0024320502018532 [pii]', '10.1016/s0024-3205(02)01853-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2002 Sep 6;71(16):1837-48. doi: 10.1016/s0024-3205(02)01853-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normally, HIF-1alpha protein, the dominant subunit of HIF-1, is accumulated in nuclei when cells are exposed to hypoxia (1% O2) and rapidly degraded when cells are re-oxygenated. Here, we found that constitutive nuclear expression of HIF-1alpha protein was a general phenomenon in vitro under normoxic conditions in human malignant cells including those derived from the hematopoietic system, such as lymphoma and leukemia cells. In addition, the constitutive expression and induction of HIF-1alpha protein were more heterogeneous and dynamic compared with other transcription factors tested. HIF-2alpha and HIF-1beta proteins showed a limited range of varieties among different cell lines and different extracellular stimuli. Mechanisms involved in sustaining constitutive expression of HIF-1alpha protein in malignant cells at normal oxygen tension warrant further investigation.","['Zhong, Hua', 'Mabjeesh, Nicola', 'Willard, Margaret', 'Simons, Jonathan']","['Zhong H', 'Mabjeesh N', 'Willard M', 'Simons J']","['Winship Cancer Institute, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, 1365 Clifton Road, N.E.

It was the aim of this study to monitor central nervous system treatment with high-dose methotrexate in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia by serial electroencephalographic (EEG) examinations. Electroencephalographic examinations with quantitative computed analysis were performed in 21 children before and on the third day after each of four high-dose methotrexate infusions with leucovorin rescue according to protocol M of trial ALL-BFM 90 of the German Society for Pediatric Haematology and Oncology. Six patients with a medium risk of relapse also received L-asparaginase. In the cohort treated with methotrexate solely, no statistically significant changes of the quantitative EEG parameters could be demonstrated. Only two children with delayed serum methotrexate clearance showed reversible diffuse EEG slowing of a slight to moderate degree. In the group with additional L-asparaginase treatment, slight transient EEG slowing also occurred. Our findings indicate that in patients with a normal methotrexate clearance during central nervous system treatment with high-dose methotrexate according to trial BFM-ALL 90, usually no subacute or cumulative EEG changes have to be expected. If neurologic or psychiatric symptoms or EEG slowing occur, delayed methotrexate clearance must be suspected.","['Korinthenberg, Rudolf', 'Schneider, Annette', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte']","['Korinthenberg R', 'Schneider A', 'Niemeyer C']","['Department of Neuropediatrics and Muscular Disorders, Pediatric University Hospital, Freiburg, Germany. rudokori@kikli.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Child Neurol,Journal of child neurology,8606714,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Brain/*drug effects/physiopathology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/physiopathology/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electroencephalography/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/physiopathology']",2002/08/15 10:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/088307380201700602 [doi]'],ppublish,J Child Neurol. 2002 Jun;17(6):409-12. doi: 10.1177/088307380201700602.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, targeting cytotoxic therapies to FR is a promising strategy for chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FR-targeted liposomal daunorubicin (f-L-DNR) was compared to non-targeted liposomal DNR (L-DNR) for cellular uptake and cytotoxicity in FR-expressing cells. Liposomal DNR retention was evaluated for liposomes loaded with either sodium citrate or ammonium sulfate as the trapping agent. The cellular uptake of liposomal DNR was determined by flow cytometry and fluorometry measurements while cytotoxicity was determined by the 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. RESULTS: Liposomal DNR retention was superior for liposomes prepared using ammonium sulfate. Cellular uptake of f-L-DNR in KB oral carcinoma cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-FR-beta), and KG-1 human acute myelogenous leukemia cells were 9.4, 40, and 4,6-fold higher than non-targeted L-DNR, respectively. The cytotoxicity of f-L-DNR in KB and CHO-FR-beta cells was 18 times and 49 times higher than L-DNR, respectively. Both cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of f-L-DNR could be inhibited by 1 mM folic acid. CONCLUSION: FR-mediated delivery of liposomal DNR to FR-expressing cells increases DNR cellular uptake and cytotoxicity. Therefore, therapeutic evaluation in relevant animal models is warranted.","['Ni, Sandy', 'Stephenson, Stacy M', 'Lee, Robert J']","['Ni S', 'Stephenson SM', 'Lee RJ']","['Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Carriers', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Humans', 'KB Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Liposomes', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/15 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2002 Jul-Aug;22(4):2131-5.,['R0 1 CA79758/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of older patients undergoing operations with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is increasing. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of cardiac surgery using CPB on the long-term course of CLL. METHODS: From 1992 to 2000, a total of 28 patients with CLL underwent heart surgery using CPB at our institution (group I). These patients were compared with 25 patients from the CLL register who were retrospectively matched with regard to preoperative administration of chemotherapy, Binet classification, age, and sex (group II). A time-point was selected for each patient in group II so that the variables for the two groups corresponded in relation to the time of operation of the patients in group I. Midterm follow-up data in both groups were analyzed. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups regarding matched variables. The mean follow-up time was similar in both groups (2.6 +/- 2.2 vs 2.3 +/- 1.3 years, p > 0.5). The 30-day mortality in group I was 14.3%. The mean stay in the intensive care unit was 4.2 +/- 7.5 days; the median number of units of packed red blood cells transfused was three (range 0 to 17). Compared with group II, in group I significantly fewer patients (11 vs 17, p = 0.049) required chemotherapy significantly later (1.98 +/- 2.06 vs 0.84 +/- 1.18 years, p = 0.018). During follow-up, no difference was found between groups regarding severe infections (10 vs 14, p = 0.14). Despite postoperative mortality in group I, the long-term mortality was similar in both groups (p = 0.3). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac surgery using CPB did not have a negative impact on the natural course of CLL. Moreover, this procedure seems to be associated with a decrease in the number of postoperative chemotherapy administrations and with an increase of chemotherapy-free survival time. Although CLL may be a risk factor in the early postoperative period, it is not a contraindication for cardiac surgery using CPB.","['Potapov, Evgenij V', 'Zurbrugg, Heinz R', 'Herzke, Corinna', 'Srock, Stefanie', 'Riess, Hanno', 'Sodian, Ralf', 'Hubler, Sabine', 'Hetzer, Roland']","['Potapov EV', 'Zurbrugg HR', 'Herzke C', 'Srock S', 'Riess H', 'Sodian R', 'Hubler S', 'Hetzer R']","['Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin, Germany. potapov@dhzb.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Ann Thorac Surg,The Annals of thoracic surgery,15030100R,,IM,"['*Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Diseases/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/08/14 10:00,2002/09/28 04:00,['2002/08/14 10:00'],"['2002/08/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-4975(02)03678-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0003-4975(02)03678-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Thorac Surg. 2002 Aug;74(2):384-9. doi: 10.1016/s0003-4975(02)03678-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a single-institution retrospective analysis of the incidence of neutropenic colitis in patients with newly diagnosed AML receiving idarubicin and cytosine arabinoside combination therapy. Using pharmacy records, we identified 78 patients who received idarubicin during the study period of January 1997 to September 1998 and who agreed to a review of their medical records. Patients with preexisting bowel conditions were excluded from this analysis. We used a strict definition of neutropenic colitis that included clinical findings (severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia, and/or peritoneal signs) plus radiographic evidence of bowel inflammation in the absence of an identified bacterial pathogen. RESULTS: Of the 78 patients receiving idarubicin and cytosine arabinoside for treatment of AML, 65 were included in this study. We observed neutropenic colitis in 10 of these 65 AML patients. This complication was followed by sepsis in 3 patients and was the major cause of death in 4 of the 8 patients who died. CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that neutropenic colitis is a frequent and serious complication of idarubicin and cytosine arabinoside treatment.","['Hogan, William J', 'Letendre, Louis', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Hoagland, H Clark', 'Pruthi, Rajiv K', 'Kaufmann, Scott H']","['Hogan WJ', 'Letendre L', 'Litzow MR', 'Tefferi A', 'Hoagland HC', 'Pruthi RK', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn 55905, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Colitis/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/08/14 10:00,2002/08/30 10:01,['2002/08/14 10:00'],"['2002/08/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0025-6196(11)62020-X [pii]', '10.4065/77.8.760 [doi]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 2002 Aug;77(8):760-2. doi: 10.4065/77.8.760.,,['Mayo Clin Proc. 2002 Oct;77(10):1133.

The role of mediastinal radiation therapy in improving local disease control and overall prognosis is not well-known with modern intensive chemotherapy. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of mediastinal radiation therapy in patients who achieve a complete response (CR) to chemotherapy. METHODS: The authors reviewed 47 patients with mediastinal T-cell LBL with or without bone marrow (BM) involvement who presented between 1980 and 1998. The median patient age was 25 years, and 33 patients (70%) were males. BM involvement was present in 16 patients (34%), 5 patients (11%) were in leukemic phase, lymph node involvement in was present 23 patients (49%), hepatosplenomegaly was present in 4 patients (9%), and pleural effusions were present in 22 patients (45%). The initial chemotherapy regimens were fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) in 23 patients; cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone in 9 patients; vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone in 4 patients; cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone in 4 patients; and other in 7 patients. Forty-three patients achieved a CR to chemotherapy and were the subject of this analysis. Nineteen of those patients received adjuvant mediastinal radiation therapy at a dose ranging from 26 grays (Gy) to 39 Gy. RESULTS: There was no difference in patient characteristics between the 19 patients who were treated with mediastinal radiation therapy and the 24 patients who did not receive mediastinal radiation therapy. The median follow-up for all 43 patients was 43 months. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 66%, and the freedom from progression (FFP) rate was 64%. None of 19 patients who received radiation therapy experienced a mediastinal recurrence compared with 8 of 24 patients who did not receive radiation therapy and experienced a mediastinal recurrence. Patients who were treated with mediastinal radiation therapy had a significantly better mediastinal FFP rate (P = 0.01), but the differences in overall FFP and OS rates were not significant (P = 0.14 and P = 0.25, respectively). The effectiveness of the hyper-CVAD regimen seemed to underscore the role of mediastinal radiation therapy; only 2 patients experienced a recurrence among 16 patients who received mediastinal radiation therapy, both outside the mediastinum. This compared with two patients who experienced a recurrence among six patients who did not receive mediastinal radiation therapy, both in the mediastinum. CONCLUSIONS: Local radiation therapy significantly decreased the risk of mediastinal recurrence in adult patients with mediastinal T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. The benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy was particularly evident in patients treated with more intensive chemotherapy regimens.","['Dabaja, Bouthaina S', 'Ha, Chul S', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Wilder, Richard B', 'Gopal, Ramesh', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Hess, Mark A', 'Cox, James D', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Dabaja BS', 'Ha CS', 'Thomas DA', 'Wilder RB', 'Gopal R', 'Cortes J', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Hess MA', 'Cox JD', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Box 97, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA. chulha@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol', 'CVAD protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hepatomegaly/complications', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Pleural Effusion, Malignant/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Splenomegaly/complications', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2002/08/14 10:00,2002/08/31 10:01,['2002/08/14 10:00'],"['2002/08/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/14 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.10552 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2002 May 15;94(10):2738-44. doi: 10.1002/cncr.10552.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently available treatment options are limited and provide only modest benefit. The current study was performed to determine the toxicity and response rate of intra-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alpha interferon (alpha-IFN) in the treatment of patients with NM. METHODS: Twenty two patients (median age, 56 years) with clinical and cytologically documented NM received intra-CSF alpha-IFN. Tumor histologies included: lung (five patients); brain (five patients); non-Hodgkin lymphoma (three patients); breast (three patients); melanoma (two patients); chronic myelogenous leukemia (two patients); colon (one patient); and prostate (one patient). Concurrent involved-field radiotherapy (12 out of 22 patients) or systemic chemotherapy (11 out of 22) was administered based on clinical indications. -alpha-IFN was administered at a fixed dose (1 x 10(6) IU every other day given three times per week for four weeks by induction). Patients were evaluated by CSF cytology and neurologic examination at the conclusion of induction therapy. Responding patients continued to receive alpha-IFN with monthly evaluations. RESULTS: Ten out of 22 patients (45%) treated with alpha-IFN had a cytologic response and either stable or improved neurologic status at the conclusion of induction. Duration of response ranged from 8 to 40 weeks (median, 16 weeks). Toxicity was manifested as transient chemical arachnoiditis (16 out of 22 patients; 60% of all treatment cycles) and chronic fatigue (20 out of 22 patients). No treatment-related hospitalizations or deaths were seen. CONCLUSIONS: alpha-IFN has modest activity against NM. However, it is associated with considerable toxicity at the dose and schedule used in the current study and, as a result, may prove difficult to administer.","['Chamberlain, Marc C']",['Chamberlain MC'],"['Department of Neurology, University of Southern California/Norris Cancer Center, 1441 Eastlake Ave., Suite 3459, Los Angeles, CA 90033-0804, USA. chamberl@usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Brain Neoplasms/complications/secondary', 'Colonic Neoplasms/complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications', 'Lung Neoplasms/complications', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications', 'Male', 'Melanoma/complications', 'Meningitis/cerebrospinal fluid/etiology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/complications', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/08/14 10:00,2002/08/31 10:01,['2002/08/14 10:00'],"['2002/08/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/14 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.10547 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2002 May 15;94(10):2675-80. doi: 10.1002/cncr.10547.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, inhibition of BCR-ABL protein tyrosine kinase activity by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Imatinib mesylate (STI571; formerly CGP57148B), successfully suppressed proliferation/survival of the BCR-ABL positive clones. In clinical studies, hematologic and cytogenetic remissions have been achieved in most patients with chronic phase CML; in accelerated and blastic phases of CML, STI571 appeared less effective. In the current study, the authors tested combinations of STI571 and cytarabine and homoharringtonine (HHT), drugs with documented activity in CML. METHODS: The single agents and their combinations were studied for in vitro effect on proliferation of BCR-ABL positive cell lines KBM5 and KBM7 by 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5 diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay and on primary patient-derived BCR-ABL cells by clonogenic assays. The in vitro additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects of cytarabine and HHT with STI571 were then investigated by computer-assisted analysis using the CalcuSyn software. RESULTS: STI571 consistently suppressed BCR-ABL positive cell proliferation with a dose-effect correlation. In the model system used, STI571/cytarabine and STI571/HHT combinations were more effective in inhibiting KBM5 and KBM7 cell growth than each drug as single agent. These results were also verified in primary CML-derived clonogenic cells in semisolid cultures. CONCLUSIONS: In this experimental system, our studies documented additive or synergistic effects with STI571 plus cytarabine or HHT, supporting the future use of STI571 combinations in clinical trials in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias.","['Scappini, Barbara', 'Onida, Francesco', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Dong, Li', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Beran, Miloslav']","['Scappini B', 'Onida F', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Dong L', 'Verstovsek S', 'Keating MJ', 'Beran M']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Harringtonines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2002/08/14 10:00,2002/08/31 10:01,['2002/08/14 10:00'],"['2002/08/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/14 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.10543 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2002 May 15;94(10):2653-62. doi: 10.1002/cncr.10543.,['T32-CA09666/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MSI has also been observed in hematological malignancies, but whether these hematological malignancies are associated with MMR deficiency is still unclear. Using both biochemical and genetic approaches, this study analysed MMR proficiency in 11 cell lines derived from patients with hematological malignancies and demonstrated that six out of seven hematological cancer cell lines with MSI were defective in strand-specific MMR. In vitro complementation experiments, using characterized MMR mutant extracts or purified proteins, showed that these hematological cancer cells were defective in either hMutS(alpha) (a heterodimer of hMSH2 and hMSH6) or hMutL(alpha) (a heterodimer of hMLH1 and hPMS2). Furthermore, cell lines deficient in hMutS(alpha) showed large deletions or point mutations in hMSH2, while those deficient in hMutL(alpha) exhibited point mutations in hMLH1 or a lack of expression of hPMS2. From these results, we conclude that, as in solid tumors, hematological malignancies with MSI are also associated with MMR deficiency, and that the cause of MMR deficiency in these cell lines is due to a defective MutS(alpha) or MutL(alpha). We also report here, for the first time, that an MSI-positive cell line derived from Burkitt's lymphoma is proficient in MMR.","['Gu, Liya', 'Cline-Brown, Brandee', 'Zhang, Fujian', 'Qiu, Lu', 'Li, Guo-Min']","['Gu L', 'Cline-Brown B', 'Zhang F', 'Qiu L', 'Li GM']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, Kentucky, KY 40536, USA. lgu0@uky.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MLH1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MSH2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutS Homolog 2 Protein)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Base Pair Mismatch', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/13 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2002/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2002/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205695 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Aug 22;21(37):5758-64. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205695.,['CA85377/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This mechanism, called RNA interference (RNAi), is extremely potent and requires only a few dsRNA molecules per cell to silence homologous gene mRNA expression. We used dsRNA targeting the M-BCR/ABL fusion site to kill leukemic cells with such a rearrangement. Transfection of dsRNA specific for the M-BCR/ABL fusion mRNA into K562 cells depleted the corresponding mRNA and the M-BCR/ABL oncoprotein. This was demonstrated by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blots. The BCR/ABL knockdown was accompanied by strong induction of apoptotic cell death. Leukemic cells without BCR/ABL rearrangement were not killed by M-BCR/ABL-dsRNA. In addition, to corroborate the extraordinary sequence specificity of RNAi, we designed another RNA oligo matching the M-BCR/ABL fusion site but having two point mutations within its central region. We show that these two point mutations abolished both p210 reduction and induction of apoptosis in K562 cells. Finally, we compared leukemic cell killing by RNAi to that caused by the ABL kinase tyrosine inhibitor, STI 571, Imatinib. For full induction of apoptosis, dsRNA targeting M-BCR/ABL required 24 h more than Imatinib. This may be caused by the relatively long half-life of the BCR/ABL oncoprotein, which is not targeted by the RNAi mechanism, but is affected by STI 571. When we applied ds M-BCR/ABL RNA and STI 571 in combination, we did not observe a further increase in the induction of apoptosis. Nevertheless, these data may open a field for further studies towards gene-therapeutic approaches using RNA interference to kill tumor cells with specific genetic abnormalities.","['Wilda, Monika', 'Fuchs, Uta', 'Wossmann, Wilhelm', 'Borkhardt, Arndt']","['Wilda M', 'Fuchs U', 'Wossmann W', 'Borkhardt A']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Giessen, 35392 Giessen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', '*Gene Silencing', '*Genes, abl', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",2002/08/13 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2002/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2002/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205653 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Aug 22;21(37):5716-24. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205653.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some chemokines can also reversibly inhibit the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors. We have previously found that the chemokine CCL21 (Exodus-2/SLC/6Ckine/TCA4) is a potent inhibitor of the proliferation of normal hematopoietic progenitors. In this study we sought to determine whether this inhibition of proliferation could be therapeutically exploited by protecting normal marrow progenitors from the cytotoxicity of the S phase-active chemotherapeutic agent Ara-C. METHODS: Untreated and CCL21-pretreated mice were given doses of Ara-C that are toxic to marrow myeloid progenitors. The recovery of these myeloid progenitors was analyzed by colony formation assays. RESULTS: It was found that pretreatment with small doses of CCL21 prevented the death of normal murine marrow progenitors from the toxic effects of Ara-C.

METHODS: A group of 13 patients who showed relapsed of their disease (median follow-up 35 months) were randomly matched with control patients of the same risk group (two control patients to each case), who had received therapy of the same intensity during the same period (median follow-up 70 months). Anti- Erwinia asparaginase antibodies were measured (ELISA method) during maintenance therapy after asparaginase treatment (30,000 IU/m(2) daily for 10 days in all patients plus twice weekly for 2 weeks in intermediate-risk and high-risk ALL patients). RESULTS: The overall incidence of anti- Erwinia asparaginase antibodies was 8% (3 of 39 patients). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of antibody formation between patients who had suffered relapse (1 of 13) and those who had not (2 of 26). In two of the three patients who developed antibodies, the antibodies disappeared after some time, whereas one patient had measurable antibody levels for more than a year after asparaginase therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the development of anti-Erwinia asparaginase antibodies was rare and was unrelated to the risk of relapse.","['Klug Albertsen, Birgitte', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Schroder, Henrik', 'Carlsen, Niels T', 'Rosthoj, Steen', 'Avramis, Vassilios I', 'Jakobsen, Preben']","['Klug Albertsen B', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Schroder H', 'Carlsen NT', 'Rosthoj S', 'Avramis VI', 'Jakobsen P']","['Department of Pharmacology, The Bartholin Building, University of Aarhus, 8000 Aarhus C, Denmark. bka@farm.au.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Bacterial Proteins/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Erwinia/enzymology/*immunology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Random Allocation', 'Risk', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/08/13 10:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-002-0466-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2002 Aug;50(2):117-20. doi: 10.1007/s00280-002-0466-y.

Amongst the analogues which were synthesized to improve both therapeutic index and antitumor activity, the most active ones were those esterified on the 9-OH group such as S 30972-1, the glutaric acid monoester derivative. PURPOSE: To compare the pharmacological profile of S 30972-1 and S 16020-2 in vitro and in vivo and to investigate whether S 30972-1 could act as a prodrug of S 16020-2. METHODS: The two compounds were compared in vitro in terms of their activity in inhibiting cellular proliferation and perturbing the cell cycle and in vivo in terms of their antitumor activity in murine transplantable tumors and human orthotopic models. The plasma concentrations of S 16020-2 and S 30972-1 were determined in mice, in a comparative pharmacokinetic study after i.v. administration, using an HPLC assay. RESULTS: Although tumor cell proliferation and accumulation of cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle were similarly affected by the two compounds after a continuous exposure (IC50 values of 30-50 n M), S 30972-1 was about tenfold less potent than S 16020-2 after short exposures. In vivo, S 30972-1 induced more long-term survivors than S 16020-2 among mice with Lewis lung carcinoma and sensitive or multidrug resistant P388 leukemias. The growth of Colon 38 carcinoma was slightly more inhibited by S 30972-1 than S 16020-2. In the more relevant human orthotopic models, using the optimal doses of each drug, 160 mg/kg S 30972-1 was significantly more active than 80 mg/kg S 16020-2 in the NCI-H460 lung carcinoma. The two compounds were significantly active in A549 lung carcinoma, moderately active in the NIH:OVCAR-3 ovary carcinoma and inactive in the NCI-H125 lung and DU145 prostate carcinomas. Pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that S 30972-1 is a prodrug of S 16020-2: the conversion was rapid and complete within 1 h of the administration of S 30972-1. CONCLUSIONS: The in vivo profile of these two compounds appeared very similar, although S 30972-1 exhibited globally a wider therapeutic index. The rapid conversion of S 30972-1 to S 16020-2 shows that S 30972-1 acts mainly as a prodrug of S 16020-2. This should be taken into account before considering S 30972-1 as a valuable back-up of S 16020-2.","['Kraus-Berthier, Laurence', 'Guilbaud, Nicolas', 'Leonce, Stephane', 'Parker, Tracy', 'Genissel, Patrick', 'Guillonneau, Claude', 'Goldstein, Solo', 'Atassi, Ghanem', 'Pierre, Alain']","['Kraus-Berthier L', 'Guilbaud N', 'Leonce S', 'Parker T', 'Genissel P', 'Guillonneau C', 'Goldstein S', 'Atassi G', 'Pierre A']","['Institut de Recherches Servier, Division de Cancerologie, 11 rue des Moulineaux, 92150 Suresnes, France. laurence.kraus-berthier@fr.netgrs.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Ellipticines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (S 16020-2)', '0 (S30972-1)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'Q6C979R91Y (Vinorelbine)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Congenic', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Ellipticines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Organ Specificity', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Vinblastine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Vinorelbine', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2002/08/13 10:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2002/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-002-0481-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2002 Aug;50(2):95-103. doi: 10.1007/s00280-002-0481-z.

While a subset of pediatric AMKLs is associated with the 1;22 translocation and expression of a mutant fusion protein, the genetic alterations that promote Down syndrome-related AMKL (DS-AMKL) have remained elusive. Here we show that leukemic cells from every individual with DS-AMKL that we examined contain mutations in GATA1, encoding the essential hematopoietic transcription factor GATA1 (GATA binding protein 1 or globin transcription factor 1). Each mutation results in the introduction of a premature stop codon in the gene sequence that encodes the amino-terminal activation domain. These mutations prevent synthesis of full-length GATA1, but not synthesis of a shorter variant that is initiated downstream. We show that the shorter GATA1 protein, which lacks the N-terminal activation domain, binds DNA and interacts with its essential cofactor Friend of GATA1 (FOG1; encoded by ZFPM1) to the same extent as does full-length GATA1, but has a reduced transactivation potential. Although some reports suggest that the activation domain is dispensable in cell-culture models of hematopoiesis, one study has shown that it is required for normal development in vivo. Together, these findings indicate that loss of wildtype GATA1 constitutes one step in the pathogenesis of AMKL in Down syndrome.","['Wechsler, Joshua', 'Greene, Marianne', 'McDevitt, Michael A', 'Anastasi, John', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Crispino, John D']","['Wechsler J', 'Greene M', 'McDevitt MA', 'Anastasi J', 'Karp JE', 'Le Beau MM', 'Crispino JD']","['Ben May Institute for Cancer Research, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZFPM1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/*genetics', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/13 10:00,2002/09/28 04:00,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/ng955 [doi]', 'ng955 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2002 Sep;32(1):148-52. doi: 10.1038/ng955.

Isothermal titration calorimetry results show that this fusion protein binds the Runt domain from Runx1 (CBF alpha) with higher affinity than the native CBF beta protein. NMR studies identify interactions in the CBF beta portion of the molecule, as well as the SMMHC coiled-coil domain.

However, compounds 1 and 3 showed increased genotoxicity towards human lymphocytes (p<0.001) and antileukemic activity towards P388 leukemias (p<0.001), compared to compounds 2 and 4.

Conversely, lower concentrations of compound ranging from 7 to 21 mg/kg did not result in major toxic effects, even after repeated dosing. The antitumor activity studies showed that fractionation dosing, rather than single bolus administration, over 1 week, might prove more active and better tolerated by allowing the achievement of the highest therapeutic total dose of IST-FS 29 (42 mg/kg). Indeed, repeated administrations of IST-FS 29 resulted in marked significant improvement of antitumor activity against B16F10 (50% of tumor volume inhibition, p = 0.0003) and, to a greater extent, 3LL (90% of tumor volume inhibition, p = 0.0001) tumors.

These active antitumor triptych structures have bisquinone functionality, and various bromo, methoxy, methylamino and/or dimethylamino substitutions with or without longer alkyl chains on the amino function. Like the anthracycline quinone antibiotic DAU, these triptycene (TT) bisquinones also inhibit DNA synthesis and induce DNA cleavage in relation with their cytotoxic activities, but have the additional advantage of blocking the cellular transport of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides, an effect which DAU cannot do. As demonstrated by intact chromatin precipitation and agarose gel electrophoresis, the ability of TT bisquinones and DAU to induce DNA fragmentation is biphasic with a peak that shifts to lower concentrations with increasing times of drug exposure. The most effective lead antitumor compound, TT24, induces DNA cleavage in the same concentration-dependent manner as DAU at 24 h (similar peak in response to 1.6 microM) and is nearly equipotent to DAU against L1210 tumor cell viability at day 4 (IC50 values of TT24 and DAU: 48 and 25 nM, respectively). The mechanism by which TT24 induces DNA fragmentation is inhibited by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone, benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone and ZnSO4, suggesting that TT bisquinones trigger apoptosis by caspase and endonuclease activation. Since TT24 is cytotoxic in the nanomolar range of DAU, but might have a more versatile mechanism of action than DAU in wild-type and multidrug-resistant tumor cells, this new class of DNA-damaging quinone antitumor drugs inhibiting nucleoside transport might be valuable to develop new means of polychemotherapy.","['Perchellet, Elisabeth M', 'Sperfslage, Bonnie J', 'Wang, Yang', 'Huang, Xiaodong', 'Tamura, Masafumi', 'Hua, Duy H', 'Perchellet, Jean-Pierre']","['Perchellet EM', 'Sperfslage BJ', 'Wang Y', 'Huang X', 'Tamura M', 'Hua DH', 'Perchellet JP']","['Anti-Cancer Drug Laboratory, Division of Biology, Ackert Hall, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506-4901, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0', ""(6-bromo-7-methoxy-2-N-methylamino-1H,4H,5H,8H-9,10-dihydro-9,10-(1',2')benzenoan"", 'thracene-1,4,5,8-tetraone)', '0', ""(7-bromo-6-methoxy-2-N-methylamino-1H,4H,5H,8H-9,10-dihydro-9,10-(1',2')benzenoan"", 'thracene-1,4,5,8-tetraone)', '0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged-Ring Compounds)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nucleosides)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthraquinones/*pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bridged-Ring Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Nucleosides/*metabolism']",2002/08/13 10:00,2003/02/13 04:00,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-200207000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2002 Jul;13(6):567-81. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200207000-00003.,"['1P20 RR15563-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '1R01 CA86842-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient was diagnosed as t-MDS (refractory anemia with an excess of blasts). Cytogenetic analysis showed complex chromosomal abnormalities including 11q23 rearrangement, which is frequently found in topoisomerase II inhibitor-related hematologic malignancies. Four months later, it was noted that the t-MDS had evolved into an overt t-AML. Cytogenetic analysis showed an evolving pattern with more complex abnormalities.

In this study, we investigated the molecular aspects of the mitotic catastrophe and whether or not it shares the same pathways of apoptosis. For this we studied the effect of CA4P on selected markers of apoptosis [caspases 9 and 3, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), bcl-2, and bax] and G2-M protein regulators (p53, MDM2, 14-3-3sigma, GADD45, cdc2, cdc25, chk1, wee1, p21, and cyclin B1). The chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell line WSU-CLL was used for this purpose. Western blot analysis showed that 24 h of CA4P (5 nM) exposure induces caspase 9 activation and PARP cleavage. However, the addition of Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (a general caspase inhibitor) or Z-Leu-Glu(OMe)-His-Asp(OMe)-CH2F (a caspase 9 inhibitor) before CA4P treatment did not block cell death. No change in bcl-2 or bax protein expression was observed. Exposure of WSU-CLL cells to 4 and 5 nM CA4P was associated with overproduction of total p53 and no dramatic change in MDM2, 14-3-3sigma, GADD45, the cyclin-dependent kinase cdc2, its inhibitory phosphorylation, the cdc2-inhibitory kinase (wee1), chk1, or cdc25 hyperphosphorylation. The overaccumulation of p21 and cyclin B1 protein was obvious at 24 h. Furthermore, CA4P treatment showed an increase in the expression of a marker of mitosis (mitotic protein monoclonal-2 antibody) and an overaccumulation of the cyclin B in the nucleus. Our findings suggest that CA4P induces mitotic catastrophe and arrest of WSU-CLL cells mostly in the M phase independent of p53 and independent of chk1 and cdc2 phosphorylation pathways. Apoptosis is a secondary mechanism of death in a small proportion of cells through activation of caspase 9 and PARP cleavage. The two mechanisms of cell death, i.e., mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis, are independent of each other in our model.","['Nabha, Sanaa M', 'Mohammad, Ramzi M', 'Dandashi, Mahmoud H', 'Coupaye-Gerard, Brigitte', 'Aboukameel, Amro', 'Pettit, George R', 'Al-Katib, Ayad M']","['Nabha SM', 'Mohammad RM', 'Dandashi MH', 'Coupaye-Gerard B', 'Aboukameel A', 'Pettit GR', 'Al-Katib AM']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (SFN protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'I5590ES2QZ (fosbretabulin)']",IM,"['14-3-3 Proteins', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Blotting, Western', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Exonucleases/metabolism', 'Exoribonucleases', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G2 Phase', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Mitosis', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2002/08/13 10:00,2003/02/27 04:00,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/27 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Aug;8(8):2735-41.,['1801CA79837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The WT1 transcript was detected in most of the lung cancer cell lines examined. A WT1-specific, HLA-A24-restricted CTL clone (designated TAK-1) exhibited cytotoxicity against lung cancer cell lines bearing HLA-A24 but did not lyse cells lacking this HLA. This suggests that the target antigen for TAK-1 on HLA-A24-positive lung cancer cells is the naturally processed WT1 peptide. Adoptive transfer of TAK-1 into nude mice that had been engrafted with a HLA-A24-positive lung cancer cell line resulted in inhibition of cancer cell growth and prolonged survival.

Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue and its cytotoxicity is correlated with incorporation into genomic DNA and concomitant inhibition of DNA synthesis. However, it is still unclear by which mechanism(s) gemcitabine incorporation leads to cell death. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used purified oligodeoxynucleotides to study the effects of gemcitabine incorporation on topoisomerase I (top1) activity and tested the role of top1 poisoning in gemcitabine-induced cytotoxicity in cancer cells. RESULTS: We found that top1-mediated DNA cleavage was enhanced when gemcitabine was incorporated immediately 3' from a top1 cleavage site on the nonscissile strand. This position-specific enhancement was attributable to an increased DNA cleavage by top1 and was likely to have resulted from a combination of gemcitabine-induced conformational and electrostatic effects. Gemcitabine also enhanced camptothecin-induced cleavage complexes. We also detected top1 cleavage complexes in human leukemia CEM cells treated with gemcitabine and a 5-fold resistance of P388/CPT45 top1-deficient cells to gemcitabine, indicating that poisoning of top1 can contribute to the antitumor activity of gemcitabine. CONCLUSIONS: The present results extend our recent finding that incorporation of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine into DNA can induce top1 cleavage complexes [P. Pourquier et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 97: 1885-1890, 2000]. The enhancement of camptothecin-induced top1 cleavage complexes may, at least in part, contribute to the synergistic or additive effects of gemcitabine in combination with topotecan and irinotecan in human breast or lung cancer cells.","['Pourquier, Philippe', 'Gioffre, Christopher', 'Kohlhagen, Glenda', 'Urasaki, Yoshimasa', 'Goldwasser, Francois', 'Hertel, Lary W', 'Yu, Shuyuan', 'Pon, Richard T', 'Gmeiner, William H', 'Pommier, Yves']","['Pourquier P', 'Gioffre C', 'Kohlhagen G', 'Urasaki Y', 'Goldwasser F', 'Hertel LW', 'Yu S', 'Pon RT', 'Gmeiner WH', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Division of Basic Sciences, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Chemical', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Time Factors', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/13 10:00,2003/02/27 04:00,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/27 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Aug;8(8):2499-504.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More usually there is a recurrent sinopulmonary infection reflecting a varying degree of humoral and cellular immune deficiency. Autoimmune phenomena may result in haemolytic anaemia or thrombocytopenia. Expanding tumour bulk underlies the lymphadenopathy which may be prominent. Diagnosis is confirmed on morphology of the smear where atypical variants need to be distinguished from other indolent lymphoproliferative disorders. Immunophenotyping is indispensable in classification. Prognosis is predicated by cytogenetics and markers of tumour biology that include beta-2 microglobulin and peripheral blood lymphocyte doubling time. Management is dictated by symptoms and signs of progression superimposed upon performance status that includes age. Disease that is asymptomatic and truly indolent, particularly in the elderly, qualifies for a careful watch-and-wait policy. In other circumstances stratification to therapy requires entry into peer-reviewed protocols if optimal outcome is to be achieved. Established regimens, of demonstrably equal efficacy, are pulsed single-agents exemplified by chlorambucil or combinations of cyclophosphamide with vincristine and prednisone. The purine analogues, particularly when administered with an alkylating agent and mitoxantrone, are emerging as superior options. In selected patients any properly accredited program will make provision for escalation in chemotherapy requiring haematopoietic stem cell transplantation on the one hand or use of serotherapy with CD52 antibodies on the other. Less commonly, but in a defined subgroup, immunoglobulins directed against membrane CD20 may be effective. Perspective for the generalist is anchored in recognising that the previous cavalier approach to drug medication, with or without radiotherapy, is unwise whereas integrated management is now the international standard of practice. The previous anachronism of dabbling by occasional therapists is to be deprecated since this will generally deny patients access to proper diagnosis and risk-adjusted multi-disciplinary treatment.","['Jacobs, Peter', 'Wood, Lucille']","['Jacobs P', 'Wood L']","['The Department of Haematology and Boone Marrow Transplant Unit incorporating the Searll Research Laboratory for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Constantiaberg Medi-Clinic, Cape Town, South Africa. haematol@icon.co.za']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytogenetics', 'Hematology/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/etiology/*therapy']",2002/08/13 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10245330290020108 [doi]', 'RM3BEJMTUR9BJQFE [pii]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2002 Feb;7(1):33-41. doi: 10.1080/10245330290020108.,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigation of the thrombopoietin levels in clonal versus reactive thrombocytosis may help us to understand the interactions of this key regulatory cytokine and the conditions in which abnormally increased platelet formation exist. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thrombopoietin levels were measured in patients with platelet counts greater than 500 x1 0(3) microl(-1). The study population consisted of 21 patients with RT (13 with iron deficiency anemia, and 8 with rheumatoid arthritis), 24 patients with clonal thrombocytosis (six with essential thrombocytosis, three with myelofibrosis, eight with chronic myelogenous leukemia, and seven with polycythemia vera (PV)) and 16 healthy subjects were used as controls. RESULTS: The median plasma thrombopoietin concentration was 100.5 pg ml(-1) in patients with RT, 467 pg ml(-1) in patients with clonal thrombocytosis and 62.65 pg ml(-1) in the control group. The thrombopoietin concentration was found to be higher in the patients with primary thrombocytosis when compared to the control group (p=0.001), as well as in patients with RT (p=0.002). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the patients with RT and the control group (p=0.14). There was no correlation between thrombopoietin levels and the platelet counts in patients with clonal thrombocytosis, including essential thrombocythemia (ET). CONCLUSIION: Increased levels of thrombopoietin were found in patients with clonal thrombocytosis versus patients with RT and control subjects as well. Defective clearance of thrombopoietin by megakaryocytes and platelets due to a reduced number of thrombopoietin receptors may be the causative mechanism behind this. These results indicate that plasma thrombopoietin levels may be helpful in distinguishing between clonal and reactive thrombocytosis.","['Karakus, Sema', 'Ozcebe, Osman I', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim C', 'Goker, Hakan', 'Ozatli, Duzgun', 'Kosar, Ali', 'BuyukasIk, Yahya', 'Ertugrul, Derun', 'SayInalp, Nilgun', 'KirazlI, Serafettin', 'Dundar, Semra V']","['Karakus S', 'Ozcebe OI', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Goker H', 'Ozatli D', 'Kosar A', 'BuyukasIk Y', 'Ertugrul D', 'SayInalp N', 'KirazlI S', 'Dundar SV']","['Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey. haznedar@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/diagnosis', 'Thrombocytosis/blood/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Thrombopoietin/*blood']",2002/08/13 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10245330290020081 [doi]', 'BDYYC42LTLFD1N02 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2002 Feb;7(1):9-12. doi: 10.1080/10245330290020081.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These latter are sometimes difficult to differentiate from chronic nonleukemic proliferations of the index cells.

As the majority of patients have reduced thymic function due to age, hormonal changes, as well as the damage caused by conditioning and GvHD, immune recovery is often delayed and incomplete. Following graft infusion there is rapid proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells that appear to proceed directly from the hematopoietic stem cell. B-cell function is dependent on specific maturation development in the BM micro-environment, as well as CD4 help. The CD8 population expands rapidly due to proliferation of many memory cells that react against Class I Ags, as well as viral molecules. Expansion of T-helper cells originates mainly from the memory pool that is present in the bone marrow graft. Naive cells require competent thymus hence the CD4 cell counts may be subnormal with clinical immunodeficiency. Controversy remains as to the capacity of the thymus to recover and thus extra thymic proliferation of T cells have been postulated. However these cells appear to have a limited capacity to expand and a fixed repertoire. DISCUSSION: Donor lymphocyte infusions may contribute a competent CD4 population that can cause GvHD, but have limitations in the capacity to respond to new antigens. Future research needs to be concentrated on improving the capacity of the thymus to reconstitute a functional naive population.","['Novitzky, N', 'Davison, G M']","['Novitzky N', 'Davison GM']","['The University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre and the Department of Haematology, Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology', 'Cytokines/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*drug effects/immunology/physiopathology', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy/immunology/prevention & control', 'Recovery of Function/*drug effects/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/*drug effects/immunology/physiopathology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/methods']",2002/08/13 10:00,2002/12/04 04:00,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/146532401753174043 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(01)70982-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2001;3(3):211-20. doi: 10.1080/146532401753174043.,,,78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We undertook a retrospective analysis of infectious episodes in patients who underwent allogeneic BM (n = 77) or PBSC (n = 29) grafting from HLA identical siblings. T-cell depletion of the stem-cell grafts with anti CD 52 (CAMPATH-1) Abs was employed for the prevention of GvHD. RESULTS: Patients' median age was 30 (4-54) years. Antibiotic prophylaxis was with oral amphotericin, ofloxacin and i.v. or oral acyclovir. Fever was treated empirically with a third generation cephalosporin and aminoglucosides until results of microbiological cultures became available. Six patients died of graft failure. GvHD was observed in 18% but in no case was it > Grade II. Only seven patients did not develop pyrexia during the initial admission or within 60 days following graft infusion. Median duration of pyrexia was 10 (range 2-49) days. A microbial source was detected in 42% and it was Gram (+) in 86%, Gram (-) in 11% and fungal in 3%. In 16 patients, indwelling venous catheters were removed due to severe infection. Subsequent to the recovery of the blood parameters, the most prevalent infection was by herpes varicella/zoster in 20; another 17 developed herpes simplex. In total 40/102 were re-hospitalized for pyrexia, which in four cases was of unknown origin. Bacterial infections with Staphylococcus Aureus and S. Epidermitis were seen in 10 and seven patients respectively. CMV was detected in seven patients. Thirteen patients died of sepsis and in 10, it was related to GvHD or graft failure. Another 20 died following recurrence of the malignancy. Overall, 39 patients died and 63% survived at a median DFS of 1992 (range 623-5092) days. DISCUSSION: We conclude that during the initial neutropenic period the dominant infections are by Gram (+) organisms, often associated with indwelling catheters. Once the BM has recovered, the main morbidity is by viral infections, but Gram+ organisms still remain common bacterial pathogens.","['Novitzky, N', 'Rouskova, A']","['Novitzky N', 'Rouskova A']","['The University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre, Department of Haematology, Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Bacterial Infections/chemically induced/drug therapy/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Catheters, Indwelling/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*adverse effects/methods', 'Infections/*chemically induced/immunology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/chemically induced/drug therapy/immunology', 'Opportunistic Infections/chemically induced/drug therapy/immunology', 'Recovery of Function/drug effects/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Treatment Failure', 'Virus Diseases/chemically induced/drug therapy/immunology']",2002/08/13 10:00,2002/12/04 04:00,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/146532401753173990 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(01)70977-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2001;3(3):165-73. doi: 10.1080/146532401753173990.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These complications can effectively be prevented by depletion of T lymphocytes from both donor and recipient. However, donor lymphocytes might contribute an anti-leukemia effect and lymphocyte depletion may exacerbate problems with immune reconstitution. There is a fine balance between the risks of GvHD and host-versus-graft reactions, relapse and infection. METHODS: Clinical outcomes for 4264 patients were reported to a central registry and analyzed by univariate and multivariate methods to determine the superior protocols. Various protocols of lymphocyte depletion were tested, using either CAMPATH-1M (IgM) plus complement or CAMPATH-1G (IgG2b) to treat the donor BM ex vivo and CAMPATH-1G in vivo to treat the recipient. The humanized antibody CAMPATH-1H has recently replaced CAMPATH-1G. A meeting of the clinical collaborators was convened to discuss the results and to review the experiences of individual centers. RESULTS: Interest focused on the use of mobilized PBSC for transplantation and on the use of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens ('mini' or 'non-Correspondence myeloablative' transplants). These approaches are likely to become increasingly important in the future and will allow transplant procedures to be used for relatively older patients. The use of CAMPATH-1G or CAMPATH-1H was associated with a low incidence of GvHD or rejection, though there were some differences that might be related to the longer half-life of the humanized antibody. An unexpected and apparently paradoxical effect of post-transplant CYA was observed - it appeared to reduce the risk of dying from infection after 6 months. Although part of the benefit could be explained by a reduction in GvHD, the effect was still evident when patients with GvHD or graft rejection were excluded from analysis. DISCUSSION: CAMPATH-1H appears to have a useful role in the prevention of graft rejection and GvHD, particularly in patients who are at high risk of these complications. It can equally well be used by admixture with the infused stem cells, or by administration to the patient prior to the transplant. Future studies will seek to understand the mechanism of the CYA effect and to improve the quality of immune reconstitution.","['Hale, G', 'Cobbold, S', 'Novitzky, N', 'Bunjes, D', 'Willemze, R', 'Prentice, H G', 'Milligan, D', 'MacKinnon, S', 'Waldmann, H']","['Hale G', 'Cobbold S', 'Novitzky N', 'Bunjes D', 'Willemze R', 'Prentice HG', 'Milligan D', 'MacKinnon S', 'Waldmann H']","['Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Congress', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*adverse effects/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*adverse effects/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*adverse effects/*methods', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Patient Selection', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/08/13 10:00,2002/12/04 04:00,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/146532401753173981 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(01)70976-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2001;3(3):145-64. doi: 10.1080/146532401753173981.,,,,['CAMPATH Users'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obtaining this effect with reduced toxicity has been possible by non-myeloablative (NMA) alloHCT. Once mixed chimeric status, and host versus graft with graft versus host tolerance are achieved, further strengthening of chimerism and graft-versus-malignancy effect can be obtained by donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) when needed. METHODS: The patient group consisted of 13 patients with advanced hematological malignancies: seven had CML, four of them in blastic-, two in chronic- and the remainder in accelerated-phase; four patients with AML, refractory or in second remission state; one patient with primary refractory secondary AML; and one patient with ALL relapsed after alloHCT. Conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine 30 mg/m(2)/day for 6 days and anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATG) 10 mg/kg/day for 4 days as immunosuppressive. Ara-C or Bu or melphalan were used as the cytoreductive component. All transplants were performed using HLA-identical sibling donors' peripheral blood hematopoietic cells, after priming with filgrastim. Post-transplant GvHD prophylaxis was achieved with CsA alone in 10 patients, and with CsA plus mycophenolate mofetil in the last three patients. RESULTS: Median follow-up is 3 months (range, 0-20) for all the patients and 6 months (range, 2-15) for the live patients. Donor chimerism was shown in 10 patients, not regarding any pretransplant feature. DLIs were performed in seven patients after transplantation and two of them achieved complete chimeric status and molecular remission. Two CML patients in blastic phase (CML-BP), and the primary refractory secondary AML patient did not respond to procedure. In four patients, drug therapy in conventional doses was added to post-transplant DLIs for their relapsed or refractory diseases. Two patients with AML in second CR, and another CML-BP patient, relapsed or progressed after transplantation. A patient with CML-BP achieved CR and full donor chimerism after transplantation, but developed refractory post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease in the 19th month. Two patients with refractory AML, one patient with relapsed ALL and two patients with CML in chronic phase were in complete chimeric status and free of disease signs. Acute GvHD, Grade II-III, was observed in five patients, and two of them developed secondary progressive chronic GvHD subsequently. We observed one early death in a platelet transfusion refractory blastic phase CML patient due to intracranial hemorrhage. Procedure-related severe toxicity was not observed, either in standard-risk patients or stem-cell donors. DISCUSSION: Establishing engraftment with donor chimerism was the first successful step in this approach. The second step, which was the result of the graft-versus-malignancy effect, could be seen in most of the patients, but was not sustained in all of them because of the aggressiveness of their malignancy. It can be suggested that the immunotherapeutic efficacy of this approach could be more successful, and with acceptable toxicity, when performed in patients with minimal residual disease. The role of NMA conditioning, and of the treatment in standard disease indications, remains to be determined in further studies.","['Gurman, G', 'Arat, M', 'Ilhan, O', 'Konuk, N', 'Beksac, M', 'Celebi, H', 'Ozcan, M', 'Arslan, O', 'Ustun, C', 'Akan, H', 'Uysal, A', 'Koc, H']","['Gurman G', 'Arat M', 'Ilhan O', 'Konuk N', 'Beksac M', 'Celebi H', 'Ozcan M', 'Arslan O', 'Ustun C', 'Akan H', 'Uysal A', 'Koc H']","['Ankara University Medical School, Department of Hematology and Transplantation Unit, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Purging/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/physiopathology', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/*immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*immunology/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Host vs Graft Reaction/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Postoperative Complications/etiology/physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Transplantation Chimera/immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Failure']",2002/08/13 10:00,2002/09/06 10:01,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/146532401317070880 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(01)70988-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2001;3(4):253-60. doi: 10.1080/146532401317070880.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GVHD is due to donor lymphocytes that are cotransplanted with donor stem cells. These donor lymphocytes are primed by histocompatibility differences between donors and recipients and activated by a cytokine storm caused by the conditioning regimen. The most efficient method for prevention of GVHD consists of T-cell depletion (TCD) of the graft. However, TCD usually leads to an increased risk of leukemia relapse because of the loss of the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Several groups have studied the feasibility of preemptive donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) to lessen the impact of TCD on leukemia relapse. Preemptive DLI is given several weeks to months after the transplantation, ie, after the cytokine storm and after the patient has recovered from conditioning-regimen-related toxicities. After briefly discussing various techniques of TCD of the graft and the efficacy of DLI, this article reviews the first clinical studies evaluating a strategy of TCD of the graft followed by preemptive DLI.","['Baron, F', 'Beguin, Y']","['Baron F', 'Beguin Y']","['Department of Medicine, University of Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods']",2002/08/13 10:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879102500203 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm12171481 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2002;8(7):351-9. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm12171481.,,,98,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ANIMALS: 20 FeLV infected, 5 FeLV-FIV coinfected, and 19 retrovirus-free cats. PROCEDURES: A client-owned cat, coinfected with FeLV and Hfsm, was the source for Hfsm. Inoculum 1 (FeLV free) was obtained by passage of source Hfsm through 4 FeLV-resistant cats. Inoculum 2 was obtained by further passage of Hfsm (inoculum 1) through 2 specific pathogen-free cats. RESULTS: A mild-to-moderate anemia started 21 days after inoculation, with its nadir occurring at 35 to 42 days after inoculation. Infection with Hfsm induced greater decrease in hemoglobin concentration in FeLV infected cats, compared with retrovirus free cats. Reticulocytosis, macrocytosis, and polychromasia of erythrocytes developed in anemic cats regardless of retrovirus infection status. Mean neutrophil counts decreased during the hemolytic episode. For most cats, the anemia was transient. Four FeLV infected cats, 1 of which was also FIV infected, developed fatal FeLV-associated myeloproliferative diseases. Of the surviving cats, 8 died over the next 24 months from other FeLV-related diseases. Hemolysis did not recur after the initial episode. Inoculum 1 induced more severe anemia than inoculum 2. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results support the clinical observation that cats coinfected with FeLV and H felis develop more severe anemia than cats infected with H felis alone. Infection with Hfsm may induce myeloproliferative disease in FeLV infected cats. The small variant of H felis may lose pathogenicity by passage through FeLV-free cats.","['George, Jeanne W', 'Rideout, Bruce A', 'Griffey, Stephen M', 'Pedersen, Niels C']","['George JW', 'Rideout BA', 'Griffey SM', 'Pedersen NC']","['Department of Medicine and Epidemiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis 95616, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Anaplasmataceae/*pathogenicity', 'Anaplasmataceae Infections/complications/*veterinary/virology', 'Anemia/microbiology/veterinary', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Erythrocyte Count/veterinary', 'Female', 'Hematocrit/veterinary', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', '*Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline', 'Lentivirus Infections/complications/microbiology/*veterinary', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Leukemia, Feline/*complications/microbiology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count/veterinary', 'Male', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms']",2002/08/13 10:00,2003/02/05 04:00,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2460/ajvr.2002.63.1172 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 2002 Aug;63(8):1172-8. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.2002.63.1172.,['AI-25802-05/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 3-fold increase in full-length Bcl-2 protein conferred substantial resistance to ara-C-associated lethality, but not to FP-mediated cytochrome c release, caspase-3 and-9 activation and apoptosis. In a second clonal line, a 6-fold increase in Bcl-2 expression delayed but did not ultimately prevent FP-associated apoptosis. In marked contrast, cells ectopically expressing the Bcl-2 loop-deleted protein (32-80) were highly resistant to FP-mediated cytochrome c release, caspase-3, -8, and -9 activation, Bid and PARP cleavage, and apoptosis despite relatively low levels of protein expression. The loop-deleted Bcl-2, but not full-length Bcl-2 protein also protected clonogenic cells from FP-mediated lethality. Finally, in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells, FP lethality was not attenuated by the caspase-8 inhibitor IETD-FMK, arguing against a role for the extrinsic, receptor-mediated pathway in circumventing Bcl-2-associated resistance. Collectively, these findings indicate that FP induces cytochrome c release in leukemic cells despite overexpression of Bcl-2, and suggest that this event may be modulated by negative regulatory factors residing within the N-terminal phosphorylation loop region.","['Decker, Roy H', 'Wang, Shujie', 'Dai, Yun', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Decker RH', 'Wang S', 'Dai Y', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Biochemistry, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/physiology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/chemistry/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2002/08/13 10:00,2002/08/24 10:01,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4161/cbt.58 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2002 Mar-Apr;1(2):136-44. doi: 10.4161/cbt.58.,"['CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 83705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells with low doses of retinoids induces gradual proliferation arrest with phenotypic markers of senescence. cDNA microarray hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that retinoid-induced growth arrest in MCF-7 cells in associated with strong induction of 13 genes. Four of these genes (IGF-binding protein 3, EPLIN, beta IG-H3 and FAT10) have antiproliferative activity; EPLIN and beta IG-H3 are also known to be selectively inhibited in transformed relative to normal cells. The functions of the induced genes may also account for other cellular effects of retinoids, including the proteasome-mediated protein degradation, increased cell adhesion, and retinoic acid synthesis. Only one of 13 strongly induced genes (ring finger protein TRIM31) contains a putative retinoid response element in its promoter; TRIM31 also shows the most rapid kinetics of induction by retinoids. In contrast, the antiproliferative genes contain no identifiable retinoid response elements in their promoters and show more gradual induction kinetics, suggesting that these genes are indirectly induced by retinoids. Elucidation of the mechanisms that mediate co-induction of growth-inhibitory genes in retinoid-treated cells may suggest an approach to reproducing the growth-inhibitory effect of retinoids in retinoid-insensitive human cancers.","['Dokmanovic, Milos', 'Chang, Bey-Dih', 'Fang, Jing', 'Roninson, Igor B']","['Dokmanovic M', 'Chang BD', 'Fang J', 'Roninson IB']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois at Chicago, 900 South Ashland Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60607-7170, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '0 (LIMA1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (UBD protein, human)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '148710-76-3 (betaIG-H3 protein)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', '*Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Female', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', '*Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology', '*Ubiquitins']",2002/08/13 10:00,2002/12/18 04:00,['2002/08/13 10:00'],"['2002/08/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4161/cbt.1.1.35 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2002 Jan-Feb;1(1):24-7. doi: 10.4161/cbt.1.1.35.,"['R01 CA62099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA89636/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA40333/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Cancer Biol Ther. 2002 Jan-Feb;1(1):28-30.

Drugs directed at the cell cycle include flavopiridol and UCN-01. The proteasome plays a pivotal role in cellular protein regulation and activation of NFkappaB, which maintains cell viability through the transcription of inhibitors of apoptosis. PS-341 is a specific, selective inhibitor of the 26S proteasome which induces apoptosis and has activity in cell types characterized by overexpression of Bcl-2. Response rates of 50%, including complete remissions, have been reported using this agent in patients with refractory multiple myeloma. Studies are ongoing in NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. G3139, an antisense oligonucleotide, has shown promise in early studies. Rituximab has revolutionized the treatment of NHL.

The treatment options for patients with CLL have increased with the introduction of purine analogs, and promising results have been reported with fludarabine and cladribine when these agents are used in newly diagnosed and relapsed disease. Monoclonal antibodies such as alemtuzumab and rituximab are also clinically active in CLL. The use of purine analogs in combination with monoclonal antibodies may provide additional treatment options and this strategy is being studied in patients with relapsed and refractory CLL. Bendamustine is an alkylating agent with properties of a purine analog and is a promising agent in the treatment of CLL. Bendamustine reduces the number of circulating B lymphocytes by over 90% and shows only partial cross-resistance with other alkylating agents, making it an ideal candidate for the treatment of CLL and for use in combination with other alkylating agents. Bendamustine monotherapy can be given to patients whose disease is refractory to standard therapies. The results of a trial using bendamustine as a salvage treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory, heavily pretreated CLL are discussed here. Bendamustine 100 mg/m(2) (days 1 and 2) was found to be an effective treatment for older patients with advanced CLL, with 14 of 21 patients responding. Complete hematologic remission was achieved in six of 21 patients and a further eight patients achieved a partial hematologic remission.

Both of these viruses replicate in specific human cell types. To test whether the formation of such viruses can be detected and controlled with current routine procedures, we have analyzed the replication of these amphotropic MLV mutants in Mus dunni fibroblasts.

Although a number of vector elements have been shown to affect expression in specific experimental situations, the results can vary depending on the specific cDNA being expressed, the individual retroviral elements included in vectors, the promoter, or the inclusion of selectable markers. In previous experiments with the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase, silencing has occurred in more than 95% of transduced cells regardless of the position of the expression unit within the vector, whether a eukaryotic or viral promoter was used, whether a bacterial selectable marker gene was present or not, the target cell type, or the species of the host. It has been a consistent finding that a small number of continuously expressing cells persist for long periods after transplantation. In this study we found that deletion of all the transcriptional regulatory elements from the vector LTR, inclusion of a permissive primer binding site sequence, and use of a eukaryotic housekeeping promoter could greatly increase the number of expressing cells in fibroblast grafts in subcutaneous neo-organs and in the brain. Furthermore, the level of enzyme expression was increased five-fold on a per positive cell basis, indicating that the deleted regulatory elements were exerting a negative effect on expression in the few cells that were positive before modification of the vector. This resulted in more than a 50-fold increase in total activity compared with the previous highest expressing vector.","['Prasad Alur, R K', 'Foley, B', 'Parente, M K', 'Tobin, D K', 'Heuer, G G', 'Avadhani, A N', 'Pongubala, J', 'Wolfe, J H']","['Prasad Alur RK', 'Foley B', 'Parente MK', 'Tobin DK', 'Heuer GG', 'Avadhani AN', 'Pongubala J', 'Wolfe JH']","['Department of Pathobiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,['EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/*enzymology', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Glucuronidase/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic/methods', 'Transfection/methods']",2002/08/10 10:00,2002/09/19 10:01,['2002/08/10 10:00'],"['2002/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3301777 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 2002 Sep;9(17):1146-54. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301777.,"['DK07748/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK42707/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK46637/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07170/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'MH12285/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,['Gene Ther 2002 Dec;9(23):1645'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Since these mRNAs are produced by the alternative splicing of exon 9, we devised a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method using primers from exons 8 and 10 to demonstrate that VP-16 stimulates the production of exon 9-containing sequences, irrespective of active transcription. However, this effect is specific of the 3'-end of the CASP-2 gene since no difference in the relative amounts of the 5'-end of the mRNA species is detected. Nevertheless, the level of full-length casp-2L mRNA together with that of procaspase-2L protein, which is pro-apoptotic, are decreased under VP-16 treatment, suggesting that an early cell response to treatment by cytotoxic agents is to down-regulate expression of selected pro-apoptotic proteins.","['Wotawa, Anne', 'Solier, Stephanie', 'Logette, Emmanuelle', 'Solary, Eric', 'Corcos, Laurent']","['Wotawa A', 'Solier S', 'Logette E', 'Solary E', 'Corcos L']","[""INSERM U517, IFR 100, Faculty of Medicine, 7 boulevard Jeanne d'Arc, 21000, Dijon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Caspase 2', 'Caspases/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Enzyme Precursors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'U937 Cells/drug effects/enzymology']",2002/08/10 10:00,2002/12/18 04:00,['2002/08/10 10:00'],"['2002/08/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0304383502002872 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(02)00287-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2002 Nov 28;185(2):181-9. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(02)00287-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether overexpression of heat shock/stress proteins (HSP) is involved in the mast cell-dependent reactivity, we examined the adaptive responses of RBL-2H3 cells to classical stress conditions such as heat shock or oxidative injury produced by an aqueous extract of tobacco smoke. METHODS: HSP were determined by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. Degranulation was confirmed as the release of beta-hexosaminidase, determined spectrophotometrically, and by electron microscopy experiments. RESULTS: We found that RBL-2H3 cells respond to heat shock or oxidative injury by the synthesis of both the inducible 72 kDa HSP (Hsp70), and the oxidation-specific 32 kDa heme oxygenase (HO)-1. Heat shock induced mainly Hsp70 in a cell growth-dependent manner, whereas oxidative stress induced mainly HO-1 in a cell growth-independent manner. However, heat shock or oxidative stress had no significant effects on degranulation. CONCLUSION: Stress-mediated synthesis of HSP was not associated with RBL-2H3 degranulation and likewise, degranulation did not induce HSP.","['Bachelet, M', 'Marchand, F', 'Souil, E', 'Francois, D', 'Mariethoz, E', 'Weyer, A', 'Polla, B S']","['Bachelet M', 'Marchand F', 'Souil E', 'Francois D', 'Mariethoz E', 'Weyer A', 'Polla BS']","['Laboratoire de Physiologie Respiratoire et de Biologie Cellulair, UFR Cochin Port-Royal, 24, rue de Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,"['0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Ionophores)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing))', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', '*Cell Degranulation', 'Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)/*biosynthesis', 'Heme Oxygenase-1', '*Hot Temperature', 'Hypersensitivity/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Rats', 'Tobacco', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",2002/08/10 10:00,2002/12/04 04:00,['2002/08/10 10:00'],"['2002/08/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['2o3665 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1398-9995.2002.23665.x [doi]']",ppublish,Allergy. 2002 Sep;57(9):791-7. doi: 10.1034/j.1398-9995.2002.23665.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The telomeres were longest in normal leukocytes, shorter in patient samples and still shorter in malignant hematopoietic cell lines. TRF1 mRNA, TRF2 mRNA and TIN2 mRNA in three myeloblastic cell lines and six lymphoblastic cell lines were significantly less abundant than in the corresponding normal cell types. In patients with acute myeloid leukemia, expression of these gene was also less than in normal cells. In additional studies in culture, HL-60 cells with initially high telomerase activity and low expression of TRF mRNA and TIN2 mRNA differentiated into granulocytic and monocytic cells with low telomerase activity and high expression of these mRNAs. CONCLUSION: In hematopoietic carcinogenesis, gene expression for suppressors of telomerase activity, such as TRF and TIN2, is decreased.

The antiproliferative effects of momordin I appear to be attributable to its induction of apoptotic cell death, as momordin I induced nuclear morphology changes and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and it increased the proportion of hypodiploid cells. Momordin I treatment also gradually decreased the expression of.the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, but increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. In addition, momordin I treatment increased the activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase.

Several new tropane alkaloid aromatic esters obtained from extracts of Erythroxylum pervillei Baillon (Erythroxylaceae) (1-8) and Erythroxylum rotundifolium Lunan (Erythroxylaceae) (9-12) by means of bioassay-directed fractionation were found to restore vinblastine sensitivity with cultured multidrug-resistant KB-VI cells.

By contrast, augmented caspase-3 activity, an effector caspase, may be indicative of drug sensitivity due to increased cellular apoptosis. We have reported the development of an in vitro human T-lymphoblastic leukemia model resistant to ara-C and/or native E. coli L-asparaginase (ASNase), mimicking the drug resistance to the Capizzi II regimen. We have investigated the potential drug synergism between Idarubicin (IDA) and Taxotere (TXR) that may be active in the ara-C and ASNase double drug-resistant cell lines. The additive or synergistic activity between IDA and TXR is drug concentration-dependent in inducing caspase-3 activation and cellular apoptosis. We exposed two human drug-resistant cell lines that do not express the MDRI phenotype, one resistant to ASNase alone (CEM/ASNase-1-3) and the other resistant to both ara-C and ASNase (CEM/ara-C/I/ASNase-0.5-2), to physiologically achievable concentrations of IDA, TXR, or their combination. Both lines showed either synergistic drug activity to the combination regimen in comparison to either drug used alone, as determined by MTT assay, or additivity as demonstrated by flow cytometry after Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining. After exposure of the ASNase-resistant line to various concentrations, the intracellular levels of Bcl-2 protein decreased to near zero relative to untreated control cells. The Bcl-2 protein reductions in these cells ranged from 30% to <1%, 49% to <1%, and 27% to 3% when treated with IDA or TXR as a single drug or IDA + TXR combination, respectively. Similarly, intracellular Bcl-2 levels in the double-resistant cell line decreased with reductions ranging from 24% to <1%, 87% to <1%, and 46% to <1% of the untreated control after treatment with IDA, TXR, or their combination, respectively. Conversely, the caspase-3 activity increased in a dose-dependent manner and inversely-correlated with loss of cell viability (r= 0.91) after exposure to IDA + TXR combination in the double drug-resistant line to both ara-C and ASNase. We conclude that the combination of the IDA + TXR regimen is highly synergistic or additive in drug resistant human leukemic cell clones. The molecular mechanism of action is due to the down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein and up-regulation of caspase-3 activity. This drug combination warrants further investigation for use in the treatment of patients with ara-C and/or ASNase refractory leukemias.","['Majlessipour, F', 'Avramis, I A', 'Kwock, R', 'Weinberg, K I', 'Avrami, V I']","['Majlessipour F', 'Avramis IA', 'Kwock R', 'Weinberg KI', 'Avrami VI']","['Department of Pediatrics, USC School of Medicine, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, California 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Asparaginase/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2002/08/10 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/08/10 10:00'],"['2002/08/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/10 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2002 May-Jun;22(3):1361-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

May-Grunwald-Giemsa-stained blood specimens were taken from thirty patients with infectious mononucleosis, non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and from ten healthy individuals. Blood specimens were analyzed by spectral imaging. Seventeen distinct spectra were collected into a spectral library and a distinct pseudo color was assigned to each one of them. The library was used to scan all the cells in the database and to create a spectrally classified image of each cell. The spectral map, per cell, reveals distinct spectral-response regions in each cellular compartment, via the distinct region colors. Computational analysis of the spectral maps allows for the objective quantification of a set of parameters, or features, representing the cell. The features used in this work include the area and perimeter of the nucleus, circularity, edginess and the spectral pattern. The analysis pursued showed that each class of cells is associated with a set of unique parameters.

In the present study, we determined the molecular pathways that lead to apoptosis after treatment of cells with arsenic trioxide. Arsenic trioxide treatment of U937 cells leads to apoptosis, which is accompanied by activation of caspase 3 (as measured by decreased levels of the 32 kDa inactive form and increased proteolytic cleavage of PLC-gamma1). The broad-range caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk inhibits this induction of apoptosis, supporting a direct link between caspase activation and arsenic trioxide induction of apoptosis. This activation of apoptosis is accompanied by release of cytochrome c, down-regulation of cIAP1, and inactivation of Akt. Bcl-2 overexpression attenuates arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis in U937 cells by inhibition of caspase 3 activity, but not inhibition of Akt. In addition, arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis was caused by the generation of reactive oxygen species, which was prevented by antioxidant NAC (N-acetyl-cysteine). Co-treatment with NAC markedly prevented dephosphorylation of Akt, activation of caspase 3, and down-regulation of cIAP1. These data indicate that arsenic trioxide can cause cell damage by inactivating the Akt-related cell survival pathway and generating the reactive oxygen species, providing a new mechanism for arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis.","['Choi, Yun-Jung', 'Park, Jong-Wook', 'Suh, Seong-Il', 'Mun, Kyo Cheol', 'Bae, Jae Hoon', 'Song, Dae-Kyu', 'Kim, Sang-Pyo', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu']","['Choi YJ', 'Park JW', 'Suh SI', 'Mun KC', 'Bae JH', 'Song DK', 'Kim SP', 'Kwon TK']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 194 Dong San-Dong Jung-Gu, Taegu 700-712, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2002/08/09 10:00,2003/03/26 04:00,['2002/08/09 10:00'],"['2002/08/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/09 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2002 Sep;21(3):603-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the early methods of cell cycle analysis, the flow cytometry relied on DNA content, and therefore, the cell cycle could be only broken into three stages: G(0)/G(1), S, and G(2)/M phase. It could not distinguish the G(0), G(1), G(2), and M phase cells, let alone the sub-phases in G(1) phase. In cell cycle, expression of cyclin E living up to the maximal level in the cells undergoing transition from G(1) to S phase, and G(2) + M cells are cyclin E negative. Expression of cyclin A is progressively increasing during S phase and is maximal in G(2) phase cells. Therefore, in the current study we established a cyclin E + A/DNA multiparameter flow cytometric technique by using a mixture of cyclin E and cyclin A antibodies, which can identify six stages in the whole cell cycle: G(0), early G(1), late G(1), S, G(2), and M phase. Furthermore, we found that cyclin E + A/DNA multiparameter flow cytometry could also be used for stathmokinetic analysis of lymphocyte leukemia MOLT-4 cells after addition of the stathmokinetic agent vinblastine to cultures of exponentially growing MOLT-4 cells. We believe that this new technique will provide a much better tool for molecular cell biology research and especially for cell proliferation kinetics investigations.","['Qin, Jichao', 'Tao, Deding', 'Duan, Rui', 'Leng, Yan', 'Shen, Manli', 'Zhou, Hui', 'Feng, Yongdong', 'Gao, Chun', 'Yu, Yuan', 'Li, Qingdi Q', 'Hu, Junbo', 'Gong, Jianping']","['Qin J', 'Tao D', 'Duan R', 'Leng Y', 'Shen M', 'Zhou H', 'Feng Y', 'Gao C', 'Yu Y', 'Li QQ', 'Hu J', 'Gong J']","['Molecular Medical Center and Department of Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, P.R.

For this reason, the expressions of 10 proteins including proto-oncogene and tumor suppressor gene products, proliferative factors and resistance parameters in 104 initial cases of childhood ALL were analyzed and the proteins correlated with ALL patients who experienced relapses. Applying immunocytochemical assays, we found that 4 out of the 10 parameters revealed a relationship to developing relapses (Fisher's exact tests). These were the oncogene product Fos (p=0.002), the drug resistance proteins glutathione S-transferase (p=0.008) and P-glycoprotein (P-pg/MDR1) (p=0.07) and protein kinase C (p=0.01). By means of hierarchical cluster analysis, we were able to show that the patients could be separated according to their protein expression profile into clusters consisting of patients whose ALL relapsed later and of patients who did not show relapses in the future.","['Volm, M', 'Sauerbrey, A', 'Zintl, F', 'Koomagi, R', 'Efferth, T']","['Volm M', 'Sauerbrey A', 'Zintl F', 'Koomagi R', 'Efferth T']","['German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/08/09 10:00,2003/03/21 04:00,['2002/08/09 10:00'],"['2002/08/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.9.5.965 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2002 Sep-Oct;9(5):965-9. doi: 10.3892/or.9.5.965.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A substantial fraction of eIF4E forms nuclear bodies that colocalize with those associated with the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML. Overexpression studies indicate that nuclear eIF4E promotes the transport of cyclin D1 mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and that PML is a key negative regulator of this function. Since previous studies used overexpression methods, the physiological relevance of eIF4E mRNA transport function or its interaction with PML remained unknown. Therefore, we monitored whether eIF4E-dependent transport could be modulated in response to environmental conditions. Here we report that cadmium treatment, which disperses PML nuclear bodies, leaves eIF4E bodies intact, leading to increased transport of cyclin D1 mRNA and increased cyclin D1 protein levels. Removal of cadmium allows PML to reassociate with eIF4E nuclear bodies, leading to decreased cyclin D1 transport and reduced cyclin D1 protein levels. In contrast, we show that treating cells with interferon increased the levels of PML protein at the PML-eIF4E nuclear body, leading to nuclear retention of cyclin D1 transcripts and reduced cyclin D1 protein levels. Neither interferon nor cadmium treatment altered cyclin D1 levels in PML(-/-) cells. Consistently, overexpression of a series of PML and eIF4E mutant proteins established that PML eIF4E interaction is required for the observed effects of cadmium and interferon treatment. The present study provides the first evidence that physiological factors modulate the mRNA transport functions of eIF4E and that this regulation is PML dependent.","['Topisirovic, Ivan', 'Capili, Allan D', 'Borden, Katherine L B']","['Topisirovic I', 'Capili AD', 'Borden KL']","['Structural Biology Program, Department of Physiology & Biophysics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York University, New York, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'J6K4F9V3BA (Cadmium Chloride)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cadmium Chloride/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin D1/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Organelles/drug effects', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Stress, Physiological/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/08/09 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/08/09 10:00'],"['2002/08/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.22.17.6183-6198.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2002 Sep;22(17):6183-98. doi: 10.1128/MCB.22.17.6183-6198.2002.,"['CA 80728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 88991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA088991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA080728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 S10 RR09145-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC134012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a randomized trial to compare voriconazole with amphotericin B for primary therapy of invasive aspergillosis. METHODS: In this randomized, unblinded trial, patients received either intravenous voriconazole (two doses of 6 mg per kilogram of body weight on day 1, then 4 mg per kilogram twice daily for at least seven days) followed by 200 mg orally twice daily or intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate (1 to 1.5 mg per kilogram per day). Other licensed antifungal treatments were allowed if the initial therapy failed or if the patient had an intolerance to the first drug used. A complete or partial response was considered to be a successful outcome. RESULTS: A total of 144 patients in the voriconazole group and 133 patients in the amphotericin B group with definite or probable aspergillosis received at least one dose of treatment. In most of the patients, the underlying condition was allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation, acute leukemia, or other hematologic diseases. At week 12, there were successful outcomes in 52.8 percent of the patients in the voriconazole group (complete responses in 20.8 percent and partial responses in 31.9 percent) and 31.6 percent of those in the amphotericin B group (complete responses in 16.5 percent and partial responses in 15.0 percent; absolute difference, 21.2 percentage points; 95 percent confidence interval, 10.4 to 32.9). The survival rate at 12 weeks was 70.8 percent in the voriconazole group and 57.9 percent in the amphotericin B group (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.88). Voriconazole-treated patients had significantly fewer severe drug-related adverse events, but transient visual disturbances were common with voriconazole (occurring in 44.8 percent of patients). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with invasive aspergillosis, initial therapy with voriconazole led to better responses and improved survival and resulted in fewer severe side effects than the standard approach of initial therapy with amphotericin B.","['Herbrecht, Raoul', 'Denning, David W', 'Patterson, Thomas F', 'Bennett, John E', 'Greene, Reginald E', 'Oestmann, Jorg-W', 'Kern, Winfried V', 'Marr, Kieren A', 'Ribaud, Patricia', 'Lortholary, Olivier', 'Sylvester, Richard', 'Rubin, Robert H', 'Wingard, John R', 'Stark, Paul', 'Durand, Christine', 'Caillot, Denis', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Chandrasekar, Pranatharthi H', 'Hodges, Michael R', 'Schlamm, Haran T', 'Troke, Peter F', 'de Pauw, Ben']","['Herbrecht R', 'Denning DW', 'Patterson TF', 'Bennett JE', 'Greene RE', 'Oestmann JW', 'Kern WV', 'Marr KA', 'Ribaud P', 'Lortholary O', 'Sylvester R', 'Rubin RH', 'Wingard JR', 'Stark P', 'Durand C', 'Caillot D', 'Thiel E', 'Chandrasekar PH', 'Hodges MR', 'Schlamm HT', 'Troke PF', 'de Pauw B']","[""Departement d'Hematologie et d'Oncologie, Hopital de Hautepierre, Strasbourg, France. raoul.herbrecht@chru-strasbourg.fr""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/*drug therapy/microbiology/mortality', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Triazoles/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",2002/08/09 10:00,2002/08/15 10:01,['2002/08/09 10:00'],"['2002/08/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1056/NEJMoa020191 [doi]', '347/6/408 [pii]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2002 Aug 8;347(6):408-15. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa020191.,,"['N Engl J Med. 2002 Dec 19;347(25):2080-1; author reply 2080-1.

We have investigated the effect of CPA on gene expression of various CYP enzymes as well as beta-actin in the human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60S) and its multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype HL-60R. Cells were incubated at different concentrations of CPA ranging between 50 micro g/ml and 5 mg/ml. In determination of cytotoxicity and resistance factor (RF: IC(50) HL-60R/IC(50) HL-60S), concentrations of 100 and 500 micro g/ml CPA were selected to treat HL-60S and HL-60R up to 72 h. CYP gene expression in the cells prior to and after treatment with CPA was determined using semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR. Unexposed cell lines did not contain measurable levels of mRNA for CYP2B6, CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 and no induction was observed after exposure. However, CYP1B1-specific mRNA, which is predominantly expressed in HL-60 cell line, was suppressed after exposure to CPA in a concentration-dependent manner. Beta-actin gene expression was also decreased. The HL-60 RF to CPA was calculated to 0.71, indicating that the multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype is not involved in the mechanism of resistance to CPA. No CYPs were induced by CPA in vitro, which probably indicates that the CYP inducibility in blood cells is poor. Our study suggests that suppression of beta-actin gene expression contributes or is involved in the CPA cytotoxicity.","['Xie, Han-Jing', 'Lundgren, Stefan', 'Broberg, Ulrika', 'Finnstrom, Niklas', 'Rane, Anders', 'Hassan, Moustapha']","['Xie HJ', 'Lundgren S', 'Broberg U', 'Finnstrom N', 'Rane A', 'Hassan M']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences and Technology, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Actins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP1B1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'Actins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/*pharmacology', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/08/09 10:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2002/08/09 10:00'],"['2002/08/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0014299902019957 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-2999(02)01995-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2002 Aug 9;449(3):197-205. doi: 10.1016/s0014-2999(02)01995-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, delayed virus clearance is associated with age-related decreases in type 1 and type 2 cytokines and a shift in the primary source of at least one cytokine.","['Elrefaei, Mohamed', 'Blank, Kenneth J', 'Murasko, Donna M']","['Elrefaei M', 'Blank KJ', 'Murasko DM']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, MCP Hahnemann University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19129, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aging/*immunology', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Count', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-10/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",2002/08/09 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/09 10:00'],"['2002/08/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['S004268220291367X [pii]', '10.1006/viro.2002.1367 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2002 Jul 20;299(1):8-19. doi: 10.1006/viro.2002.1367.,['AG14913/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A series of highly potent, specific, orally active, small molecule kinase inhibitors directed against members of PDGFR receptor have been developed through modifications of the novel quinazoline template I. Systematic modifications in the A-bicyclic ring and D-rings of protype I were carried out to afford potent analogues, which display IC(50) values of <250 nM in cellular betaPDGFR phosphorylation assays. An optimized analogue in this series, 75 (CT53518), inhibits Flt-3, betaPDGFR, and c-Kit receptor phosphorylation with IC(50) values of 50-200 nM, whereas 15-20-fold less potent activity against CSF-1R was observed. This analogue also inhibits autophosphorylation of Flt-3 ligand-stimulated wild-type Flt-3 and a constitutively activated Flt-3/internal tandem duplication (ITD) with IC(50) values of 30-100 nM.

The goal of immunosuppressive therapy with UD-HSCT is an effective prevention of graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) on one hand. On the other hand an optimal balance with immunocompetence of the transplanted bone marrow is desirable in order to prevent graft failure, infection and, in the case of leukaemic diseases, potentially control the underlying disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1992 and 2000 49 patients aged 11 months to 16.7 years received an UD-HSCT in Hamburg. Underlying diseases were leukaemia or MDS in 35, of these ALL in 21, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in 9, immunodeficiency or inborn error of metabolism in 5 patients. GvHD-prophylaxis consisted of a combination of Cyclosporin A (CSA), methotrexate (MTX), metronidazole, IgM-enriched iv-immunoglobulin (ivIg) (Pentaglobin(R)) or ivIgG and anti-thymocyte-globulin (ATG). Within the same time span 10 patients with ALL received a matched related donor HSCT (MRD-HSCT). GvHD-prophylaxis in these patients was done without ATG in 8 of 10 cases. UD-HSCT were analyzed for survival, relapse and toxicity. Probability of survival of the patients with ALL after UD-HSCT was compared with results of MRD-HSCT in children with ALL. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier estimates of three year overall-survival (OS) were 74 % for all patients. Probability of disease-free survival (DFS) at three years was 62 % for leukaemia/MDS-patients and 100 % for the HLH-patients. Acute GvHD (aGvHD) grades II or III occurred in 51 % of patients. Chronic GvHD (cGvHD) occurred in 22 % of patients. There were 5 cases of treatment-related mortality (TRM). Probability of DFS for patients with ALL at three years was 65 % after UD-HSCT and 30 % in the patients after MRD-HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: UD-HSCT in children is an effective and safe therapy. A GvHD-prophylaxis regimen combining the standard immunosuppressive agents CSA and MTX with ivIg, metronidazole and serotherapy using ATG may result in a low incidence of severe GvHD-complications and low TRM rate without increase in relapse rates.","['Graf Finckenstein, F', 'Zabelina, T', 'Durken, M', 'Dahlke, J', 'Kroger, N', 'Kruger, W', 'Janka-Schaub, G', 'Erttmann, R', 'Zander, A R', 'Kabisch, H']","['Graf Finckenstein F', 'Zabelina T', 'Durken M', 'Dahlke J', 'Kroger N', 'Kruger W', 'Janka-Schaub G', 'Erttmann R', 'Zander AR', 'Kabisch H']","['Universitatsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Klinik, Germany. finckens@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '140QMO216E (Metronidazole)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '97794-27-9 (pentaglobulin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Immunoglobulin M/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Metronidazole/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Prognosis', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/08/08 10:00,2002/12/05 04:00,['2002/08/08 10:00'],"['2002/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2002-33177 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2002 Jul-Aug;214(4):206-11. doi: 10.1055/s-2002-33177.,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hamatopoetische Stammzelltransplantation vom Fremdspender bei Kindern: Niedrige Toxizitat durch GvHD-Prophylaxe mit CSA, MTX, Metronidazol, iv-Immunglobulin und ATG.",,,,,,,,,,

It was recently shown by us that patients who develop increasing quantities of autologous hematopoietic cells in peripheral blood (increasing mixed chimerism, in-MC) after allo-SCT do significantly more often relapse (P < 0.0001) than patients with a complete chimerism (CC). In a small series of patients with in-MC, the relapse rate could be significantly reduced by administration of donor lymphocytes (DLI). METHODOLOGY: A prospective multicenter study was initiated under the question whether number of relapses can be significantly reduced either by withdrawal of post-transplant immunosuppression and/or by DLI in the critical stage of in-MC. RESULTS: Highly repetitive determination of the genetic status of 114 children with acute leukemias or MDS (ALL: n = 41, AML: n = 39, MDS: n = 34) revealed 55 cases with CC and 43 with in-MC. Relapses occurred significantly (P < 0.0001) more often in patients with in-MC (25/43) than in patients with CC (12/55). In-MC-patients showed a significantly (P < 0.01) enhanced event free survival rate (11/24) when DLI was given and/or post-transplant immunosuppression was stopped compared to patients which did not receive such an interventional regimen (1/19). Two in-MC-patients developed fatal GVHD after immunological intervention.

Liposomal daunorubicin (L-DNR) is thought to be less cardiotoxic without impairment of efficacy. METHODS: The AML-BFM REZ 97 study included two reinduction blocks with L-DNR (2 x 60 mg/m (2) n = 38, since 2/1999 3 x 60 mg/m (2) n = 31) combined with cytarabine (500 mg/m (2) 4 d). Children who achieved a second blast clearance were allocated to allogeneic stem cell transplantation either from a matched related (MRD) or a matched unrelated donor (MUD). Lack of a donor justified haploidentical SCT in early relapse (1st remission < 1 year) and autologous SCT in late relapse. PATIENTS: Between 1/1997 and 9/2001, 69 children were enrolled in the AML-BFM 97 relapse study. The median duration of first remission was 0.9 years. Forty-one patients had a remission of less than one year, 28 of more than a year. RESULTS: 46 children (67 %) achieved a second remission, defined as clearance of blasts in bone marrow and at least a partial hematological reconstitution. Seventeen of these children are alive (12 of 25 children receiving allogeneic SCT (MFD/MUD); 1 of 8 children after haploidentical SCT; 1 of 4 patients after autologous SCT and 3 of 9 patients treated with chemotherapy only). Further three children without 2nd remission survived after MFD-SCT (n = 2) or chemotherapy (n = 1; follow-up 0.3 to 0.7 years). Duration of first remission remains a significant prognostic factor. The pharmacokinetic investigation showed a high overall AUC of 234.6 mg/l h at a dose of 60 mg/m (2), and a volume of distribution of 1.98 l/m (2), which is much lower in comparison to conventional Daunorubicin. Regarding toxicity, the combination of L-DNR and cytarabine followed by SCT was feasible in experienced centers, however, acute complications like infection or septicemia in aplasia, mucositis and GvHD were common. By contrast, no clinical relevant cardiotoxicity was seen so far, but definitive results in long-term cardiotoxicity await a longer follow-up. In conclusion, L-DNR/cytarabine treatment induced a 2nd remission in most of the children with relapsed or refractory AML. It has to be followed by allogeneic SCT which enables long-term survival.","['Reinhardt, D', 'Hempel, G', 'Fleischhack, G', 'Schulz, A', 'Boos, J', 'Creutzig, U']","['Reinhardt D', 'Hempel G', 'Fleischhack G', 'Schulz A', 'Boos J', 'Creutzig U']","['Padiatrische Hamatologie/Onkologie, Universitat Munster, Germany. drein@uni-muenster.de']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Liposomes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate']",2002/08/08 10:00,2002/12/05 04:00,['2002/08/08 10:00'],"['2002/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2002-33185 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2002 Jul-Aug;214(4):188-94. doi: 10.1055/s-2002-33185.,,,,,,,,,,,,Effektive Rezidivtherapie der akuten myeloischen Leukamie im Kindesalter mit liposomalem Daunorubicin und Cytarabin.,,,,,,,,,,

However, the impact on treatment stratification is not established. The AML-BFM 98 MRD study started in 1/2000 in order to evaluate, standardize and establish immunophenotyping in AML in children. METHODS: In a first phase the participating laboratories in Muenster, Goettingen, Vienna and Prague agreed on identical antibody-panels and standardized procedures of sample processing, analysis and data management. The consensus panel was evaluated and adapted to 3- and 4-color flowcytometry. The complete panel was applied to each follow-up sample in orderto minimize the risk offalse negative results due to the loss or shift of antigens during treatment, a known phenomenon in myeloid blasts. Between 1/2000 and 9/2001 165 of 198 protocol patients were analysed at diagnosis, in 149 children at least two follow-up samples were available. RESULTS: Three kinds of immunophenotypes could be defined. Asynchronous expression of stem cell and myeloid antigens i. e. CD34/CD117 combined with CD13/CD15 had a low specificity because precursors in regenerating or normal bone marrow expressed this pattern in 0.47 % (0.1 to 1.5 %). The aberrant co-expression of stem cell antigens and lymphatic antigens such as CD7 or CD2 showed a median level of specificity (0.07 % (0.04 to 0.19 %). Aberrant expression ofstem cell antigens combined with B-lymphatic (CD19, CD10) or NK-cell antigen (CD56) showed the best specificity. The maximal level in normal bone marrow was 0.05 %. Sensitivity of different immunophenotypes was evaluated by diluting known leukemic blasts in regenerating bone marrow. Minimal level of sensitivity was found to be at 10 (-3) to 5 x 10 (-4). According to these data highiy specific immunophenotypes could be detected in 33 %, median specificity was seen in 71 % and low specificity was seen in 88 % of the protocol patients. Two laboratories analyzed simultaneously 17 samples of children with AML from diagnosis and during therapy. A high correlation of blast quantification could be demonstrated (correlation r (2) = 0.98; blasts < 5 % r (2) = 0.91). In addition, two independent explorers quantified the raw data of 16 samples. All results correlated well (r (2) = 0.97; blasts < 5 % r (2) = 90.94). CONCLUSION: The prospective study phase, started 1/2002, aims to test the impact of MRD diagnostics as an independent prognostic factor in AML in children. This might facilitate future treatment stratification and consequently optimize outcome.","['Reinhardt, D', 'Langebrake, C', 'Creutzig, U', 'Vormoor, J', 'Brune, C', 'Thorwesten, M', 'Ingiliz, P', 'Hrusak, O', 'Dworzak, M', 'Griesinger, F']","['Reinhardt D', 'Langebrake C', 'Creutzig U', 'Vormoor J', 'Brune C', 'Thorwesten M', 'Ingiliz P', 'Hrusak O', 'Dworzak M', 'Griesinger F']","['Padiatrische Hamatologie/Onkologie, Universitat Munster, Germany. dreinh@uni-muenster.de']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ICE protocol 4']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2002/08/08 10:00,2002/12/05 04:00,['2002/08/08 10:00'],"['2002/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2002-33181 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2002 Jul-Aug;214(4):179-87. doi: 10.1055/s-2002-33181.,,,,,,,,,,,,Minimale Resterkrankung bei der akuten myeloischen Leukamie (AML) im Kindesalter - Etablierung und Standardisierung der Immunphanotypisierung in der Therapiestudie AML-BFM-98.,,,,,,,,,,

However, certain low penetrance pRB mutants substantially reduce tumor incidence despite having a minimal ability to bind E2F. These low penetrance mutants retain the ability to induce a senescence-like state, suggesting that they may suppress tumorigenesis through a senescence-associated process. Here, we identify a novel pRB function that is associated with senescence and which is retained by non-E2F binding low penetrance pRB mutants. It was found that pRB and these mutants substantially increased the production of PML nuclear bodies (NBs). In keeping with the role of PML in transcriptional repression, pRB also promoted PML-dependent transcriptional repression by the c-Myc antagonist Mad1. In a series of pRB-p130 chimeric proteins, the ability to increase NB production correlated with the ability to induce a senescence-like phenotype. However, neither NB formation nor PML function were required for pRB to induce the senescence-like response. Together, these observations indicate that a pRB-induced increase in PML NB formation is coordinated with, but separable from, the pRB-induced senescence program. The data further suggest that PML may contribute to an E2F-independent tumor suppressor function of pRB.","['Fang, Weizhao', 'Mori, Takahiro', 'Cobrinik, David']","['Fang W', 'Mori T', 'Cobrinik D']","['Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MXD1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Plasmids', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Zinc Fingers']",2002/08/08 10:00,2002/09/20 10:01,['2002/08/08 10:00'],"['2002/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2002/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205666 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Aug 15;21(36):5557-65. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205666.,['P30CA 13696/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Polish population aged 0-17 years is estimated at approximately 10 million children and adolescents, thus ca. 1100-1300 new cases can be expected every year. In 1995, we started a national childhood cancer registry. MATERIAL/METHODS: Information on the new diagnoses of childhood cancers was collected in 11 regional centers and submitted to the national center in Lublin. All data were verified carefully and standardized incidence rates were calculated. RESULTS: In 1995, we registered 1028 newly diagnosed malignant neoplasms, in 1996 and 1997 - 1036 cases, in 1998 - 1007, and in 1999 - 1158 new cases. The estimated incidence rates were: 102.4; 109.5; 111.9; 111.6 and 118.3 per 1 million children, respectively. The most frequent childhood cancers include leukemia, which accounts for 28% of cancer cases, lymphoma (14.3%) and C. N. S. tumors (16.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Neoplasms of the hematopoietic system (leukemias and lymphomas) account for about 42% of all childhood cancers. Malignant lymphomas, bone tumors and germinal tumors are more frequently diagnosed in Poland, but the incidence of central nervous system tumors is lower than in other countries.","['Kowalczyk, Jerzy R', 'Dudkiewicz, Ewa', 'Balwierz, Walentyna', 'Boguslawska-Jaworska, Janina', 'Rokicka-Milewska, Roma']","['Kowalczyk JR', 'Dudkiewicz E', 'Balwierz W', 'Boguslawska-Jaworska J', 'Rokicka-Milewska R']","['Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Poland/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies']",2002/08/08 10:00,2003/03/22 04:00,['2002/08/08 10:00'],"['2002/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['1843 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2002 Aug;8(8):CR587-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukocyte activation induces rapid endoproteolytic cleavage of L-selectin from the cell surface, generating soluble L-selectin (sL-selectin). Because human sL-selectin retains ligand-binding activity in vitro, mouse sL-selectin and its in vivo relevance were characterized. Comparable with humans, sL-selectin was present in adult C57BL/6 mouse sera at approximately 1.7 micro g/ml. Similar levels of sL-selectin were present in sera from multiple mouse strains, despite their pronounced differences in cell surface L-selectin expression levels. Adhesion molecule-deficient mice prone to spontaneous chronic inflammation and mice suffering from leukemia/lymphoma had 2.5- and 20-fold increased serum sL-selectin levels, respectively. By contrast, serum sL-selectin levels were reduced by 70% in Rag-deficient mice lacking mature lymphocytes. The majority of serum sL-selectin had a molecular mass of 65-75 kDa, consistent with its lymphocyte origin. Slow turnover may explain the relatively high levels of sL-selectin in vivo. The t(1/2) of sL-selectin, assessed by transferring sera from wild-type mice into L-selectin-deficient mice and monitoring serum sL-selectin levels by ELISA, was >20 h, and it remained detectable for longer than 1 wk. Short-term in vivo lymphocyte migration assays demonstrated that near physiologic levels ( approximately 0.9 micro g/ml) of sL-selectin decreased lymphocyte migration to peripheral lymph nodes by >30%, with dose-dependent inhibition occurring with increasing sL-selectin concentrations. These results suggest that sL-selectin influences lymphocyte migration in vivo and that the increased sL-selectin levels present in certain pathologic conditions may adversely affect leukocyte migration.","['Tu, LiLi', 'Poe, Jonathan C', 'Kadono, Takafumi', 'Venturi, Guglielmo M', 'Bullard, Daniel C', 'Tedder, Thomas F', 'Steeber, Douglas A']","['Tu L', 'Poe JC', 'Kadono T', 'Venturi GM', 'Bullard DC', 'Tedder TF', 'Steeber DA']","['Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Movement', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*physiology', 'Humans', 'L-Selectin/blood/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukocytes/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Protein Isoforms/blood']",2002/08/08 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/08/08 10:00'],"['2002/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.4.2034 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Aug 15;169(4):2034-43. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.4.2034.,"['CA54464/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81776/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the relative importance of membrane-distal (residues 6-11) and membrane-proximal (residues 38-43) ITIMs in mediating the inhibitory signal, we made site-directed mutants of NKG2A at the Y (Y8F, Y40F, Y8F/Y40F) and the residues two positions N-terminal (Y-2) of Y (V6A, I38A, V6A/I38A) in each motif. Wild-type (wt) and mutated NKG2A were then cotransfected with CD94 into rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 cells. Immunochemical analyses after pervanadate treatment showed that each of the mutant molecules could be phosphorylated to expected levels relative to wt NKG2A and that all the mutations significantly reduced the avidity of SH2 domain-bearing tyrosine phosphatase-1 for NKG2A. Confocal microscopy was used to determine whether SH2 domain-bearing tyrosine phosphatase-1 and CD94/NKG2A colocalized intracellularly after receptor ligation. Only the Y8F/Y40F and Y8F mutant NKG2A molecules failed to show a dramatic colocalization. In agreement with this result, the Y8F/Y40F mutant was unable to inhibit FcepsilonRI-mediated serotonin release and the Y8F mutant was relatively ineffective compared with wt NKG2A. In contrast, the Y40F mutant was 70% as effective as wt in mediating inhibition, and the Y-2 mutations did not remarkably affect inhibitory function. These results show that, like KIR, both NKG2A ITIMs are required for mediating the maximal inhibitory signal, but opposite to KIR, the membrane-distal ITIM is of primary importance rather than the membrane-proximal ITIM. This probably reflects the opposite orientation of the ITIMs in type II vs type I proteins.","['Kabat, Juraj', 'Borrego, Francisco', 'Brooks, Andrew', 'Coligan, John E']","['Kabat J', 'Borrego F', 'Brooks A', 'Coligan JE']","['National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Rockville, MD 20852, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KLRC1 protein, human)', '0 (KLRD1 protein, human)', '0 (Klrd1 protein, rat)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, rat)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', '*Lectins, C-Type', 'Mast Cells/immunology/physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Models, Immunological', 'Mutation', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tyrosine/chemistry']",2002/08/08 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/08/08 10:00'],"['2002/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.4.1948 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Aug 15;169(4):1948-58. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.4.1948.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aberrant expression of annexin II was found on the APL cell surface in the present study. We investigated patients with APL receiving all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) treatment, contributing to the downregulation of the expression of annexin II on APL cells, and decreasing the generation of plasmin by tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Notably, the clinical improvement of hyperfibrinolysis paralleled the correction of plasma fibrinogen level and amelioration of bleeding. Consistent with in vivo findings, annexin II on NB(4) cell surface and its mRNA content were downregulated with 1 microM As(2)O(3) or 1 microM ATRA, while 2 microg Ara-c enhanced the expression of annexin II and the generation of cell-surface plasmin before its induction of apoptosis. Our data indicate that the inhibition of annexin II expression with ATRA is transcriptionally mediated while As(2)O(3) induces an accelerated degradation of annexin II mRNA. Western blot analysis under treatment conditions showed that both ATRA and As(2)O(3) markedly decreased the production of annexin II, reaching a level near the baseline at 5 and 7 days after treatment, respectively. Annexin II expression of APL cells may be downregulated by ATRA and As(2)O(3.)

Importantly, treatment of the poorly killed leukaemia cells with TNF-alpha augmented both phosphoinositide-dependent and -independent cytolysis.","['Reid, G S D', 'Bharya, S', 'Klingemann, H-G', 'Schultz, K R']","['Reid GS', 'Bharya S', 'Klingemann HG', 'Schultz KR']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of British Columbia and BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism/pharmacology']",2002/08/08 10:00,2002/09/12 10:01,['2002/08/08 10:00'],"['2002/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['1919 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2249.2002.01919.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2002 Aug;129(2):265-71. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2249.2002.01919.x.,,,,,PMC1906454,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the inflammatory reaction of adherent cells on the surface has not been discussed sufficiently. We hypothesized that the inflammatory reaction of adherent cells on PLGA might occur and could be reduced by blending a 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) polymer (PMEH) with the PLGA. PLGA/PMEH blend membranes were prepared by a solvent evaporation technique. The thermal properties of the PLGA/PMEH membrane were determined using a differential scanning calorimeter. The glass transition temperature of the PLGA/PMEH membranes was slightly decreased compared to that of a PLGA membrane. X-ray photoelectron spectrum analysis revealed that the MPC unit was exposed on the PLGA/PMEH membrane and that the surface concentration of the MPC unit on the membrane was increased with an increase in the concentration of the PMEH in the blended membrane. NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblast cells were cultured on the PLGA/ PMEH membrane for 2 days. The number of adherent cells on the PLGA/PMEH membrane was decreased with an increase in the concentration of the PMEH. Using the RT-PCR method, the amount of an inflammatory cytokine, IL-1beta, mRNA expressed from adherent human premyelocytic leukemia cells on PLGA and PLGA/PMEH membranes were determined. On a PLGA/PMEH membrane containing 0.2 wt% of PMEH, the expression of IL-1beta mRNA was significantly lower than that on PLGA, but no difference in the number of adherent cells was found. Therefore, the MPC polymer was a useful additive for reducing the inflammatory reaction of adherent cells on PLGA.","['Iwasaki, Yasuhiko', 'Sawada, Shin-ichi', 'Ishihara, Kazuhiko', 'Khang, Gilson', 'Lee, Hai Bang']","['Iwasaki Y', 'Sawada S', 'Ishihara K', 'Khang G', 'Lee HB']","['Institute of Biomaterials and Bioengineering, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Kanda-surugadai, Japan. yasu.org@tmd.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biomaterials,Biomaterials,8100316,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Biocompatible Materials)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Methacrylates)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '1SIA8062RS (Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer)', '26009-03-0 (Polyglycolic Acid)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '59RU860S8D (2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Biocompatible Materials', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Electron Probe Microanalysis', '*Foreign-Body Reaction', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Lactic Acid/*chemistry', 'Methacrylates/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Models, Chemical', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/*chemistry', 'Polyglycolic Acid/*chemistry', 'Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer', 'Polymers/*chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/08 10:00,2003/02/22 04:00,['2002/08/08 10:00'],"['2002/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0142-9612(02)00135-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0142-9612(02)00135-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomaterials. 2002 Sep;23(18):3897-903. doi: 10.1016/s0142-9612(02)00135-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, several aspects of this procedure remain as yet undefined; therefore, several attempts have been made to modify the standard technique to try to optimize the procedure. Herein we analyze our experience with 105 laparoscopic splenectomies. METHODS: From 1993 to 2000, 105 patients underwent LS at our hospital. Twelve of these patients also underwent a concomitant cholecystectomy. There were 66 women and 39 men whose ages ranged between 4 and 78 years (median, 27.7). All patients underwent an elective laparoscopic splenectomy. Seventy five patients had thrombocytopenia (ITP), 14 had hereditary spherocytosis, eight were affected by b-thalassemia, two had splenic cysts, two had lymphoma, (two had myeloid chronic leukemia, one patient presented with a splenic abscess and one had incurred an iatrogenic spleen lesion during adrenalectomy. The first patients in this series were positioned in dorsal decubitus; however, as the team's experience increased, the right lateral decubitus became the position of choice because it provides better exposure of the splenic hilum. This procedure requires the use of only four trocars. RESULTS: Mean operating time was 95 min (range, 35-320). Hospital stay ranged from 2 to 21 days (median, 4.5). There was only one conversion to open surgery. One patient died in the postoperative period due to the evolution of a preexisting malignant disease. We recorded nine complications-four subphrenic abscesses, two cases of pleuritis, two episodes of postoperative bleeding, and one intestinal infarction 16 days after surgery. Only two patients needed redo surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the laparoscopic approach is a valid alternative to open splenectomy, but mastery of some of the technical details of this procedure could greatly help avoid its complications. On the basis of our experience, it seems that the lateral approach should be considered the position of choice because it provides exposure and easier dissection of the splenic hilar structures. We also found that a 30 degrees scope and an ultrasonic dissector allowed for perfect vision and optimal hemostasis during the procedure. At the end of procedure, the spleen should be fragmented and then extracted using an extraction bag.","['Corcione, F', 'Esposito, C', 'Cuccurullo, D', 'Settembre, A', 'Miranda, L', 'Capasso, P', 'Piccolboni, D']","['Corcione F', 'Esposito C', 'Cuccurullo D', 'Settembre A', 'Miranda L', 'Capasso P', 'Piccolboni D']","['Division of General and Laparoscopic Surgery, Monaldi Hospital, Via Bianchi 10, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Surg Endosc,Surgical endoscopy,8806653,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Laparoscopy/methods/*standards', 'Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications/epidemiology', 'Splenectomy/methods/*standards']",2002/08/07 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/08/07 10:00'],"['2001/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2001/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00464-001-9007-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Surg Endosc. 2002 Jun;16(6):972-4. doi: 10.1007/s00464-001-9007-8.

Through associated chromatin changes and silencing, such epigenetic states can influence cellular physiology and affect disease risk and severity. Our studies of CpG island methylation in normal colorectal mucosa revealed progressive age-related increases at multiple gene loci, suggesting genome-wide molecular alterations with potential to silence gene expression. However, there was considerable variation in the degree of methylation among individuals of comparable ages. Such variation could be related to genetic factors, lifestyle, or environmental exposures. Studies in ulcerative colitis and hepatocellular cirrhosis and neoplasia revealed that chronic inflammatory states are accompanied by marked increases in CpG island methylation in normal-appearing tissues, confirming the hypothesis that proinflammatory exposures could account for part of the epigenetic variation in human populations. Preliminary data also suggest potential influences of lifestyle and exposure factors on CpG island methylation. It is suggested that epigenetic variation related to aging, lifestyle, exposures and possibly genetic factors, is one of the modulators of acquired, age-related human diseases, including neoplasia.","['Issa, Jean-Pierre']",['Issa JP'],"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA. jpissa@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,,IM,"['*CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Silencing', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Phenotype']",2002/08/07 10:00,2002/09/06 10:01,['2002/08/07 10:00'],"['2002/08/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jn/132.8.2388S [doi]'],ppublish,J Nutr. 2002 Aug;132(8 Suppl):2388S-2392S. doi: 10.1093/jn/132.8.2388S.,,,65,,,,,,,,10.1093/jn/132.8.2388S [doi],,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the role of some radical scavengers (N-acetylcysteine, vitamin C, vitamin E and folate) on the reduction of HcyT-induced apoptosis was investigated. Preincubation of HcyT-treated HL-60 cells with vitamin C (Vit C; 100 micro mol/L) or vitamin E (Vit E; 100 micro mol/L) for 2 h significantly reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells with hypodiploid DNA contents or with membrane phosphatidylserine exposure, and attenuated the apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Preincubation of cells with N-acetylcysteine (NAC; 5 mmol/L) for 2 h significantly reduced HcyT-promoted apoptosis measured by membrane phosphatidylserine exposure only. The reduction of HcyT-induced apoptosis by NAC, Vit C or Vit E occurred simultaneously with a significant decrease in intracellular H(2)O(2) levels and reduced caspase-3 enzymatic activity. In contrast, folate had no H(2)O(2) scavenging capacity and did not suppress caspase-3 activity 6 h after HcyT treatment, although folate exhibited antioxidant behavior toward superoxide anions, hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite. Preincubation of cells with folate (10 micro mol/L) for 3 d did not affect the extent of HcyT-promoted apoptotic damage. Taken together, our findings suggest that antioxidant pretreatment with NAC, Vit C or Vit E exerts more beneficial effects than folate on reducing apoptotic cell damage induced by homocysteine thiolactone.","['Huang, Rwei-Fen S', 'Huang, Sheu-Mai', 'Lin, Bo-Shiou', 'Hung, Chien-Ya', 'Lu, Hsing-Te']","['Huang RF', 'Huang SM', 'Lin BS', 'Hung CY', 'Lu HT']","['Department of Nutrition and Food Sciences, Fu-Jen University, Hsin-Chuang, Taiwan, ROC. rweifen@mails.fju.edu.tw']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'D5H88XF24X (homocysteine thiolactone)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Folic Acid/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Homocysteine/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Vitamin E/*pharmacology']",2002/08/07 10:00,2002/09/06 10:01,['2002/08/07 10:00'],"['2002/08/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jn/132.8.2151 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nutr. 2002 Aug;132(8):2151-6. doi: 10.1093/jn/132.8.2151.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An autoimmune serum specific for PML NBs was identified and used in immunoprecipitation experiments. NDH II was present in the immunoprecipitates as shown by mass spectrometry and by immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence and ultrastructural studies showed that NDH II colocalizes with a small subset of PML NBs in control cells, however, colocalizes with practically all bodies in interferon-alpha-stimulated cells. After interferon stimulation, more PML NBs were found to contain newly synthesized RNA, as indicated by bromouridine incorporation. PML NBs also contain RNA polymerase II. The association of NDH II with PML NBs was transcriptionally dependent, and NDH II was present in all bodies with nascent RNA. Blocking of mRNA synthesis caused NDH II relocalization from nucleoplasm to nucleoli.

It was first implicated in cancer biology as part of a chromosomal translocation in leukemia. Here we report that HIP1 is expressed in prostate and colon tumor cells, but not in corresponding benign epithelia. The relationship between HIP1 expression in primary prostate cancer and clinical outcomes was evaluated with tissue microarrays. HIP1 expression was significantly associated with prostate cancer progression and metastasis. Conversely, primary prostate cancers lacking HIP1 expression consistently showed no progression after radical prostatectomy. In addition, the expression of HIP1 was elevated in prostate tumors from the transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer (TRAMP). At the molecular level, expression of a dominant negative mutant of HIP1 led to caspase-9-dependent apoptosis, suggesting that HIP1 is a cellular survival factor. Thus, HIP1 may play a role in tumorigenesis by allowing the survival of precancerous or cancerous cells. HIP1 might accomplish this via regulation of clathrin-mediated trafficking, a fundamental cellular pathway that has not previously been associated with tumorigenesis. HIP1 represents a putative prognostic factor for prostate cancer and a potential therapy target in prostate as well as colon cancers.","['Rao, Dinesh S', 'Hyun, Teresa S', 'Kumar, Priti D', 'Mizukami, Ikuko F', 'Rubin, Mark A', 'Lucas, Peter C', 'Sanda, Martin G', 'Ross, Theodora S']","['Rao DS', 'Hyun TS', 'Kumar PD', 'Mizukami IF', 'Rubin MA', 'Lucas PC', 'Sanda MG', 'Ross TS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Hip1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/07 10:00,2002/09/25 06:00,['2002/08/07 10:00'],"['2002/08/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI15529 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2002 Aug;110(3):351-60. doi: 10.1172/JCI15529.,,,,,PMC151092,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other than benzene, radiation, and chemotherapy, which account for a small proportion of cases, there are few identified risk factors for adult leukemia. Although recent data from animal studies indicate a potentially protective role for dietary restriction in leukemogenesis, few data exist on dietary relationships in adult leukemia. Food frequency data collected at baseline (1986) were analyzed from the prospective Iowa Women's Health Study to begin to address the role of diet in adult leukemia. Data from 35,221 women ages 55-69 years were analyzed. A total of 138 women developed leukemia during the 14-year follow-up period of 1986 to 1999. With the exception of an inverse association (P trend = 0.08) with increasing consumption of all vegetables (relative risk, 0.56 and 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.88; relative risk, 0.69 and 95% confidence interval, 0.44-1.07 for medium and high consumption, respectively), there was little evidence of an important role for other dietary factors in leukemogenesis. Analyses that excluded cases diagnosed in the first 2 years from baseline did not notably alter the results. Leukemia subgroups, including acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, were also analyzed, but no statistically significant associations with dietary factors were revealed. This study provides evidence that increased vegetable consumption may decrease the risk of adult leukemia. However, given that our study focused on older women from a defined geographical area, analyses of prospective studies in other populations are needed to confirm or refute these results.","['Ross, Julie A', 'Kasum, Christine M', 'Davies, Stella M', 'Jacobs, David R', 'Folsom, Aaron R', 'Potter, John D']","['Ross JA', 'Kasum CM', 'Davies SM', 'Jacobs DR', 'Folsom AR', 'Potter JD']","['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology & Clinical Research, University of Minnesota Department of Pediatrics, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. ross@epi.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', '*Diet', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iowa/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Vegetables']",2002/08/07 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/08/07 10:00'],"['2002/08/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/07 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2002 Aug;11(8):777-81.,"['CA79940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-39742/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA09607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adherent stromal layers from 13 patients with AML and from six non-leukemic controls were established with 3ng/ml of FGF-4, EGF or TGF-beta1. Established stromal layers were washed three times and irradiated, followed by recharge of allogenic peripheral CD34 positive cells as an indicator of supportive function. Progenitor-outputs into supernatant were evaluated at biweekly interval with colony-forming assay until 6 weeks. The results showed that both leukemic and non-leukemic stromal cells established with FGF-4, but not with EGF, showed significantly higher progenitor cell-outputs compared with control stromal cells. By contrast, stromal cells developed with TGF-beta1 showed significantly lower progenitor cell-outputs compared with control. These differences were significant at later than 4 weeks after the recharge of indicator cells, suggesting that the stromal layer developed with EGF or TGF-beta1 preferentially affected the primitive progenitors rather than committed ones.

BM biopsy was performed in order to assess the incidence, degree and prognostic significance of histological data of the disease. BM features studied were reticular fibrosis, total cellularity, residual hematopoiesis, mitotic activity, and blastic infiltration. T-cell lineage ALL were diagnosed in 23% of the cases, while B-cell lineage ALL represented 70% of the cases. There were 7% of non-T-non-B-cell lineage ALL. The percentage of BM leukemic cells was related to cellularity (P=0.02), while it was related to the disappearance of normal cell lines (P<0.0001). BM cellularity was related to the percentage of circulating leukemic cells at diagnosis (P=0.006). Residual hematopoiesis was related to a higher initial granulocyte count (P=0.04) and lower percentage of circulating blasts (P=0.04). The degree of fibrosis was inversely related to that of BM cellularity (P=0.04). All patients, but four, received standard ALL induction chemotherapy according to different successive protocols. In this whole cohort of patients, complete remission (CR) rate was 78%. Median disease-free survival (DFS) and median overall survival (OS) were 13.7 months and 20.2 months, respectively. In univariate analysis, CR rate was positively affected by mitotic activity (P=0.01) and residual hematopoiesis (P=0.008). OS was positively influenced by a higher leukemic cell mitotic activity (P=0.03) and the persistence of more than two residual normal cell lines in BM (P=0.04). Patients presenting with both of those characteristics had better outcome than patients who did not, as well as, in terms of CR (P=0.03), or DFS (P=0.002), or OS (P=0.003). T-cell lineage ALL and L3 ALL did not significantly influence those results. Our findings did not confirm that among marrow features, reticular fibrosis has any prognostic value. A multivariate analysis of both clinical and histological data was performed to test their prognostic relevance. In a model including age, immunophenotype, Philadelphia chromosome status, mitotic index, and level of normal residual hematopoiesis, the only significant predictor of CR achievement were the persistence of normal residual hematopoietic cell lines (P=0.01) and the mitotic activity of leukemic cells (P=0.002). Philadelphia chromosome status (P=0.03) and age (P<0.0001) were of prognostic value, respectively for DFS and OS. We conclude that some characteristics of BM biopsy afford not only descriptive but also prognostic information for predicting the outcome. The persistence of normal residual hematopoiesis and intense leukemic cells mitotic activity were both factors of favorable outcome, while BM fibrosis did not display any prognostic value.","['Thomas, Xavier', 'Le, Quoc-Hung', 'Danaila, Catalin', 'Lheritier, Veronique', 'Ffrench, Martine']","['Thomas X', 'Le QH', 'Danaila C', 'Lheritier V', 'Ffrench M']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France. xavier.thomas@chu-lyon.fr""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cytodiagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/08/07 10:00,2002/10/18 04:00,['2002/08/07 10:00'],"['2002/08/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212602000346 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00034-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2002 Oct;26(10):909-18. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00034-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proper classification is pivotal for evaluating treatment results, and most studies performed a decade ago lump together different disease entities and cannot be interpreted. With improved use of immunophenotyping and molecular methods for these disorders, their exact nature is better defined in the Revised European-American Lymphoma and subsequent World Health Organization (WHO) classifications. The WHO classification of post- thymic T/natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoma consists of 15 entities, including about 30% that are unclassified cases. A wide range in incidence exists between different populations, but it is likely to be lower than previously estimated. Certain entities, like nasal/nasal-type T/NK-cell lymphoma and human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus 1, are much more prevalent in certain racial groups and show exquisite viral association. In these entities as a group, prognosis and treatment seem inferior to those of their B-cell counterparts, but treatment must be tailored to the exact pathologic diagnosis and prognostic index.

Similar numbers of long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) and SRC could be transduced using AFT024-conditioned medium (AFT-CM) or a defined medium that had been supplemented with factors identified in AFT-CM. Finally, using our best condition based on transduction with the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV)-pseudotyped vector, we demonstrate a 33-fold higher level of gene transfer (p < 0.001) in SRC using an RD114-pseudotyped vector. In summary, using an optimized protocol with low doses of cytokines, and transduction with an RD114 compared to a GaLV-pseudotyped retroviral vector, the overall number of transduced cells in NOD/SCID mice could be improved 144-fold, with a gene-transfer efficiency in SRC of 16.3% (13.3-19.9; n = 6).","['van der Loo, Johannes C M', 'Liu, B L', 'Goldman, A I', 'Buckley, S M', 'Chrudimsky, K S']","['van der Loo JC', 'Liu BL', 'Goldman AI', 'Buckley SM', 'Chrudimsky KS']","['University of Minnesota Stem Cell Institute, Cancer Center, Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. vande077@tc.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Fetus', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Liver/cytology/embryology', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/07 10:00,2003/02/04 04:00,['2002/08/07 10:00'],"['2002/08/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303402760128540 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2002 Jul 20;13(11):1317-30. doi: 10.1089/104303402760128540.,['5 P01-CA65493-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical benefits included reductions in infections, anti-infective therapy and length of hospital stay. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this economic analysis is 2-fold. First, it aims to determine if the observed clinical benefits from the use of filgrastim would lead to cost savings from the perspective of a healthcare institution in the UK. Second, the analysis compares the results of two methods on collection of resource use data. DESIGN: A retrospective cost-minimisation analysis was undertaken based on the clinical results of all UK patients enrolled in the trial. Two cost models were developed: a model based only on the medical resource use collected in the case report forms (the CRF model); and a model based on all medical resources collected from patient medical files (the PF Model). Treatment costs of AML between filgrastim and the placebo arm were compared for the first induction cycle as well as the first induction and the first consolidation cycles combined. Results from the two models were compared. SETTING AND PATIENTS: The CRF model was applied to two samples of patients: all UK patients (n = 82) and patients enrolled at one centre [the Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI) (n = 30)], whereas the PF model was applied to the MRI patient sample only. RESULTS: For all UK patients, using the CRF model, the filgrastim-treated arm produced cost savings of 747 pounds sterling (9.0%) and 2135 pounds sterling (14.4%) [1998 values] per patient in the first induction cycle and in the induction and consolidation cycles combined, respectively. For the patients at MRI the CRF model resulted in cost savings with filgrastim of 177 pounds sterling (2.2%) and 414 pounds sterling (3.2%) per patient respectively. Using the PF model the savings at MRI were 910 pounds sterling (8.6%) and 1285 pounds sterling (8.0%) per patient, respectively. CONCLUSION: Use of filgrastim in the treatment of AML in the UK may result in net cost savings. A retrospective analysis using total resources obtained through patient files produced higher cost savings estimates than that obtained by resources noted in the CRFs.

The barrier also plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of the brain microenvironment necessary for the stable and co-ordinated activity of neurones. The BBB phenotype develops under the influence of associated brain cells, especially astrocytic glia, and consists of more complex tight junctions than in other capillary endothelia, and a number of specific transport and enzyme systems which regulate molecular traffic across the endothelial cells. Transporters characteristic of the BBB phenotype include both uptake mechanisms (e.g. GLUT-1 glucose carrier, L1 amino acid transporter) and efflux transporters (e.g. P-glycoprotein). In addition to a role in long-term barrier induction and maintenance, astrocytes and other cells can release chemical factors that modulate endothelial permeability over a time-scale of seconds to minutes. Cell culture models, both primary and cell lines, have been used to investigate aspects of barrier induction and modulation. Conditioned medium taken from growing glial cells can reproduce some of the inductive effects, evidence for involvement of diffusible factors. However, for some features of endothelial differentiation and induction, the extracellular matrix plays an important role. Several candidate molecules have been identified, capable of mimicking aspects of glial-mediated barrier induction of brain endothelium; these include TGFbeta, GDNF, bFGF, IL-6 and steroids. In addition, factors secreted by brain endothelial cells including leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) have been shown to induce astrocytic differentiation. Thus endothelium and astrocytes are involved in two-way induction. Short-term modulation of brain endothelial permeability has been shown for a number of small chemical mediators produced by astrocytes and other nearby cell types. It is clear that endothelial cells are involved in both long- and short-term chemical communication with neighbouring cells, with the perivascular end feet of astrocytes being of particular importance. The role of barrier induction and modulation in normal physiology and in pathology is discussed.","['Abbott, N Joan']",['Abbott NJ'],"[""Centre for Neuroscience Research, King's College London, UK. joan.abbott@kcl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Anat,Journal of anatomy,0137162,,IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/*physiology', 'Capillary Permeability/*physiology', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Junctions/physiology']",2002/08/07 10:00,2002/09/24 06:00,['2002/08/07 10:00'],"['2002/08/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00064.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Anat. 2002 Jun;200(6):629-38. doi: 10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00064.x.,,,85,,PMC1570746,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcl-2 protein inhibits apoptosis and confers resistance to treatment with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Oblimersen sodium (G3139, Genasense, Genta Inc., Berkeley Heights, NJ) is an antisense oligonucleotide (AS-ON) compound designed to specifically bind to the first 6 codons of the human bcl-2 mRNA sequence, resulting in degradation of bcl-2 mRNA and subsequent decrease in Bcl-2 protein translation. Oblimersen is the first oligonucleotide to demonstrate proof of principle of an antisense effect in human tumors by the documented downregulation of the target Bcl-2 protein. A growing body of preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that oblimersen synergizes with many cytotoxic and biologic/immunotherapeutic agents against a variety of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Randomized clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of oblimersen in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, malignant melanoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. In addition, nonrandomized trials are under way to evaluate oblimersen in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Preclinical data also support the clinical evaluation of oblimersen in additional tumor types, including chronic myelogenous leukemia and breast, small cell lung, gastric, colon, bladder, and Merkel cell cancers. Enhancement of the efficacy of anticancer treatments with oblimersen Bcl-2 antisense therapy represents a promising new apoptosis-modulating strategy, and ongoing clinical trials will test this therapeutic approach.","['Klasa, Richard J', 'Gillum, Amanda M', 'Klem, Robert E', 'Frankel, Stanley R']","['Klasa RJ', 'Gillum AM', 'Klem RE', 'Frankel SR']","['Department of Advanced Therapeutics, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev,Antisense & nucleic acid drug development,9606142,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",2002/08/07 10:00,2003/01/23 04:00,['2002/08/07 10:00'],"['2002/08/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/108729002760220798 [doi]'],ppublish,Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2002 Jun;12(3):193-213. doi: 10.1089/108729002760220798.,,,124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have investigated an agent, phenylbutyric acid, that ameliorates cell death in murine astrocytes infected with ts1 MoMuLV (ts1). Phenylbutyric acid, an aromatic short chain fatty acid, was shown to prevent the loss of catalase that occurs in ts1 infected astrocytes, and to prevent ts1-mediated cell death. Cell cotransfection studies demonstrated that phenylbutyric acid activates peroxisome proliferator receptors (PPARs) in astrocytes, and binds to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha and gamma. This observation suggests that the effects of PBA may be mediated by PPARs in astrocytes. Phenylbutyric acid also maintained catalase protein levels in brain of ts1-infected mice, and delayed the hindlimb paralysis caused by ts1 infection. Because PBA activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and prevents loss of catalase, we suggest that ts1-induced oxidative stress in infected astrocytes that is alleviated by PBA is mediated via PPARalpha and/or PPARgamma.","['Liu, Na', 'Qiang, Wenan', 'Kuang, Xianghong', 'Thuillier, Philippe', 'Lynn, William S', 'Wong, Paul K Y']","['Liu N', 'Qiang W', 'Kuang X', 'Thuillier P', 'Lynn WS', 'Wong PK']","['University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park-Research Division, Smithville, Texas 78957, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurovirol,Journal of neurovirology,9508123,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phenylbutyrates)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '7WY7YBI87E (4-phenylbutyric acid)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Astrocytes/cytology/enzymology/*virology', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hindlimb', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Paralysis/drug therapy/pathology/virology', 'Phenylbutyrates/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2002/08/06 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/08/06 10:00'],"['2002/08/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13550280290100699 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurovirol. 2002 Aug;8(4):318-25. doi: 10.1080/13550280290100699.,"['AI28283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'ES07784/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'MH57181/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that stroke, caused by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in adult rats, leads to a marked increase of cell proliferation in the subventricular zone. Stroke-generated new neurons, as well as neuroblasts probably already formed before the insult, migrate into the severely damaged area of the striatum, where they express markers of developing and mature, striatal medium-sized spiny neurons. Thus, stroke induces differentiation of new neurons into the phenotype of most of the neurons destroyed by the ischemic lesion.

The activity of these cytokines is modified by soluble receptors such as the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R). gp130 is a signal transduction molecule common to the receptor complexes of this family, and its soluble form (sgp130) antagonizes their actions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether secretion of IL-6, LIF, sIL-6R, and sgp130 was different in the endometrium of women with primary unexplained infertility compared with normal fertile women. Endometrial biopsies were taken between d LH+6 and +13 and cultured in serum-free medium for 4 h. Secretion of IL-6, LIF, sIL-6R, and sgp130 was measured in the supernatant by ELISA. We also measured the secretion of IL-6, sIL-6R, and sgp130 by endometrial biopsies taken throughout the menstrual cycle in normal fertile women. Secretion of sgp130 increased 20-fold between d 20 and 26 of the cycle, coinciding with the implantation window (proliferative phase, median, 27.0 pg/ml.mg; range, 23-36; d 20-26, median, 501.5 pg/ml x mg; range, 26.1-1344; P = 0.03). RT-PCR showed that none of the known splice variants of gp130 were present in endometrium, indicating that sgp130 is produced by proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound form. IL-6 secretion varied considerably between patients and was greatest during the secretory phase and at menstruation. No significant change was seen in sIL-6R during the cycle. Between LH+6 and +13, secretion of sgp130 was significantly reduced in the infertile group (median, 93.1 pg/ml.mg; range, 28.5-256; compared with the fertile group, median, 223 pg/ml x mg; range, 63-534; U-statistic = 37; P = 0.017). Secretion of IL-6, LIF, and sIL-6R did not differ between the two groups. Immunolocalization of gp130, IL-6R, and the LIF receptor showed that the glandular epithelium and also endothelial cells are targets for IL-6 and LIF. These findings show that during a normal menstrual cycle, sgp130 secretion is greatly increased between d LH+6 and +13, due to proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound gp130.

Some of these diseases are exclusive to megakaryocytes and platelets, while in others the pathology extends to other cell types. Although the defective genes, coding for membrane glyoproteins, cytoskeleton components and intracellular signaling pathways, as well as transcription factors, have been identified in most cases, the pathophysiology of these disorders is often unknown. This review describes recent contributions to clinical and diagnostic aspects, biology and treatments of familial thrombocytopenias. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The information presented here derives from literature and the experience of the authors. The most relevant studies are critically analyzed and discussed. STATE OF ART: The clinical and laboratory features of most of the inherited thrombocytopenias have been reviewed. The different forms have been classified into 3 groups depending on platelet volume. Although this criterion is not completely satisfactory, it is one of the most useful in diagnostic algorithms. We report on recent advances in Wiskott-Aldrich and Bernard-Soulier syndromes, as well as in MYH9-related diseases, a new nosological entity that groups old distinct forms known as May-Hegglin anomaly, Sebastian, Fetchner, and Epstein syndromes. Other, less frequent forms are also discussed, including non-syndromic forms of mild thrombocytopenia that are genetically heterogeneous. PERSPECTIVES: In the past, inherited thrombocytopenias were considered exceedingly rare and the number of well-defined forms was very small. In the last few years, the widespread diffusion of electronic cell counters has allowed these conditions to be detected more frequently and several new entities have been identified through the co-ordinated efforts of physicians, biologists and geneticists. The pathogenesis of many new and old forms is being unraveled, thus providing insights on the molecular basis of platelet production and function. This knowledge will be a valuable resource for clinicians in the diagnostic approaches to such disorders.","['Balduini, Carlo L', 'Iolascon, Achille', 'Savoia, Anna']","['Balduini CL', 'Iolascon A', 'Savoia A']","['Medicina Interna, IRCCS San Matteo, Piazzale Golgi, 27100 Pavia, Italy. c.balduini@smatteo.pv.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (MYH9 protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Motor Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Bernard-Soulier Syndrome/genetics', 'Blood Platelets/ultrastructure', 'Cell Size', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/deficiency/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', '*Molecular Motor Proteins', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/deficiency/genetics', 'Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary/genetics', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Radius/abnormalities', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Syndrome', 'Thrombocytopenia/classification/*genetics/therapy', 'Ulna/abnormalities', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome/genetics', 'X Chromosome/genetics']",2002/08/06 10:00,2002/12/18 04:00,['2002/08/06 10:00'],"['2002/08/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/06 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Aug;87(8):860-80.,"['GP0019Y01/Telethon/Italy', 'TGM06S01/Telethon/Italy']",,140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some trials showed that increasing the dosage of anthracyclines within induction therapy improved treatment outcome substantially. We, therefore, tried to escalate induction therapy further in a group of young elderly AML patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: In a multicenter trial 33 patients aged 61-65 years with de novo or secondary AML were treated with double induction therapy including high dose mitoxantrone, etoposide and ara-C (MAV) in the first course and m-amsacrine together with high dose ara-C (MAMAC) in the second course. Treatment results were compared to those in 39 AML patients older than 65 years receiving conventional double induction therapy including daunorubicin and ara-C (DA I and DA II) within the same time period. RESULTS: Compared to results achieved with conventional induction therapy, intensified double induction therapy did not significantly improve CR rates, overall or disease-free survival. Hematologic toxicity was not different between the two groups, but non-hematologic toxicity was significantly higher with MAV/MAMAC. This was mainly due to gastro-intestinal or liver toxicity. The rate of early mortality (death within the first 12 weeks) was 42% in the group receiving intensified therapy and 18% in that given conventional induction therapy (p=0.04). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: Intensification of double induction therapy using high dose mitoxantrone and high dose ara-C in AML patients aged 61-65 years did not lead to improved treatment outcome and conferred an unacceptable early death rate due to high non-hematologic toxicity. Risk-adapted or alternative treatment strategies are needed to improve treatment outcome in these young elderly AML patients.","['Schaich, Markus', 'Illmer, Thomas', 'Aulitzky, Walter', 'Bodenstein, Heinrich', 'Clemens, Michael', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Repp, Roland', 'Schakel, Ulrike', 'Soucek, Silke', 'Wandt, Hannes', 'Ehninger, Gerhard']","['Schaich M', 'Illmer T', 'Aulitzky W', 'Bodenstein H', 'Clemens M', 'Neubauer A', 'Repp R', 'Schakel U', 'Soucek S', 'Wandt H', 'Ehninger G']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universit tsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307 Dresden, Germany. schaich@mk1.med.tu-dresden.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'MAV protocol']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/etiology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/08/06 10:00,2002/12/18 04:00,['2002/08/06 10:00'],"['2002/08/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/06 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Aug;87(8):808-15.,,['Haematologica. 2002 Aug;87(8):786.

Amifostine is a cytoprotective compound that has been shown to protect against the acute cytotoxicities of anthracyclines in animal models. We report the results of a phase I study of dose escalation of idarubicin with amifostine and high-dose ara-C in patients with relapsed or refractory AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). DESIGN AND METHODS: The continuous reassessment method was used to predict the probability of toxicity. RESULTS: Five patients were treated at an idarubicin dose of 18 mg/m2/day x 3, three of whom developed grade 3 diarrhea or mucositis. Subsequently, three additional patients were treated at a dose of 15 mg/m2 x 3 days, all of whom experienced grade 3 diarrhea or mucositis.

Although monoclonal antibodies have been developed that specifically identify these epitopes, few studies have evaluated the distribution and quantitative expression of such epitopes on leukemic blasts. DESIGN AND METHODS: We report here a prospective multicenter study in which we examined and quantified the expression of the 3 classes of CD34 on fresh leukemic blast cells from 300 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The binding of monoclonal antibodies was studied by flow cytometry, allowing evaluation of blast cell positivity as well as their mean fluorescence intensity. These quantitative data were made comparable between centers by means of a calibration curve established with the same reagents in all laboratories. RESULTS: Quantitative expression of class I epitope was significantly higher than that of class II and class III epitopes (p<0.0001). The three classes were more frequently expressed in M0 and M1 and less in M3 and M5. The highest levels of CD34 expression were observed in M2, M0 and M1 and the lowest in M3, M5 and BAL for class II and III. CD34 expression was lower for all classes in cases with a normal karyotype, compared to in cases with structural or numerical abnormalities. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In cases with a t(9;22) the expression of class I was significantly higher than that of class II and III and the opposite was observed in AML with t(15;17). Moreover, as a whole, a high intensity of class III CD34 appeared to be a marker of good prognosis.","['Maynadie, Marc', 'Gerland, Luc', 'Aho, Serge', 'Girodon, Francois', 'Bernier, Michel', 'Brunet, Corinne', 'Campos, Lydia', 'Daliphard, Sylvie', 'Deneys, Veronique', 'Falkenrodt, Annie', 'Jacob, Marie-Christine', 'Kuhlein, Emilienne', 'LeCalvez, Genevieve', 'Moskovtchenko, Philippe', 'Philip, Patrick', 'Carli, Paule-Marie', 'Faure, Gilbert C', 'Bene, Marie-Christine']","['Maynadie M', 'Gerland L', 'Aho S', 'Girodon F', 'Bernier M', 'Brunet C', 'Campos L', 'Daliphard S', 'Deneys V', 'Falkenrodt A', 'Jacob MC', 'Kuhlein E', 'LeCalvez G', 'Moskovtchenko P', 'Philip P', 'Carli PM', 'Faure GC', 'Bene MC']","[""Service d'Hematologie biologique, CHU de Dijon, 2 Boulevard Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, 21034 Dijon Cedex, France. mmaynadie@chu-dijon.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Calibration', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Epitopes/classification/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/instrumentation/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2002/08/06 10:00,2002/12/18 04:00,['2002/08/06 10:00'],"['2002/08/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/06 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Aug;87(8):795-803.,,['Haematologica. 2003 Jun;88(6):ELT22; author reply ELT23.

ETV6/ABL1 chimeric proteins have been detected both in lymphoid and myeloid disorders. Our objective was to study two new cases of ETV6/ABL1-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and to focus on bone marrow morphology and on molecular cytogenetics of eosinophilic cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed in two AML cases with different translocations, i.e. t(8;12)(p21;p13) and t(9;12) (q34; p13). We used probes for the short arm of chromosome 12, for ABL1 and BCR, for centromeric regions, and for whole chromosome arms. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out by applying primers selected for the ETV6 gene. RESULTS: In both cases, bone marrow morphology was characterized by trilineage dysplasia and increased abnormal eosinophils. FISH showed the 5'ETV6 translocated to chromosome 8 in patient #1, and to chromosome 9 in patient #2. A 3' PCR identified chimeric products resulting from fusion between ETV6 exon 4 or exon 5, and ABL1 exon 2. Accordingly, an ETV6/ABL1 fusion signal was detected on der(8) in patient #1, and on der(9) in patient #2. Using interphase FISH abnormal bone marrow eosinophils were proved to belong to the neoplastic clone, carrying the ETV6 rearrangement. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide new information on the heterogeneity of conventional cytogenetics in ETV6/ABL1 positive leukemias, and indicate the putative target cell in this AML is an immature precursor capable of terminally differentiating towards eosinophils.","['La Starza, Roberta', 'Trubia, Maurizio', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Belloni, Elena', 'Crescenzi, Barbara', 'Martelli, Massimo', 'Flandrin, Georges', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Mecucci, Cristina']","['La Starza R', 'Trubia M', 'Testoni N', 'Ottaviani E', 'Belloni E', 'Crescenzi B', 'Martelli M', 'Flandrin G', 'Pelicci PG', 'Mecucci C']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Policlinico Monteluce, University of Perugia, via Brunamonti, 06122 Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (TEL-ABL fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/complications', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Clone Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Eosinophilia/etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Eosinophils/enzymology/*pathology', 'Genes, abl', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/complications/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2002/08/06 10:00,2002/12/18 04:00,['2002/08/06 10:00'],"['2002/08/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/06 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Aug;87(8):789-94.,,['Haematologica. 2002 Aug;87(8):785-6.

These processes directly effect the number of oocytes available to a female throughout her reproductive life. Once the pool of primordial follicles is depleted a series of physiological changes known as menopause begins in humans. The inappropriate coordination of these processes contributes to ovarian pathologies such as premature ovarian failure. Studies demonstrate primordial follicle assembly and development are coordinated by locally produced paracrine and autocrine factors. Factors have been identified that influence follicular assembly such as neurotropins. Several local factors that promote the primordial to primary follicle transition have also recently been identified. These include growth factors such as kit-ligand, leukemia inhibitory factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. Interestingly, recent studies demonstrate Mullerian inhibitory substance appears to inhibit the primordial to primary follicle transition. Therefore, observations suggest a mechanism for both positive and negative control of the primordial to primary follicle transition. The studies reviewed regarding the control of primordial follicle assembly and the primordial to primary follicle transition help elucidate these poorly understood aspects of ovarian biology.","['Kezele, Phillip', 'Nilsson, Eric', 'Skinner, Michael K']","['Kezele P', 'Nilsson E', 'Skinner MK']","['Center for Reproductive Biology, School of Molecular Biosciences, Washington State University, Pullman WA 99164-4231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Front Biosci,Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,9709506,['0 (Growth Substances)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication', 'Female', 'Growth Substances/physiology', 'Ovarian Follicle/anatomy & histology/*cytology/*growth & development', 'Ovary/growth & development']",2002/08/06 10:00,2002/08/31 10:01,['2002/08/06 10:00'],"['2002/08/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2741/kezele [doi]'],epublish,Front Biosci. 2002 Sep 1;7:d1990-6. doi: 10.2741/kezele.,,,58,,,,20020901,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that satratoxin G-treated human leukemia HL-60 cells underwent apoptosis through the action of caspase-3 which was activated by both caspase-8 and caspase-9. Western blot analysis of caspase-3 in the satratoxin G-treated cells apparently indicated the appearance of a catalytically active fragment of 17 kDa. Increased caspase-3 activity was also detected by using a fluorogenic substrate, DEVD-AMC. Next, exposure to satratoxin G led to cleavage of PARP from its native 116 kDa form to a 85 kDa product. Moreover, DFF-45/ICAD were cleaved into a 12.5 kDa fragment via satratoxin G treatment. Enzymic assay on IETD-AMC revealed that caspase-8 is strongly activated by exposure to satratoxin G while T-2 toxin (T-2) could not activate caspase-8 at an early stage of apoptosis. Furthermore, satratoxin G caused a release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol and increased the activity of caspase-9 against LEHD-AMC. These findings indicate that satratoxin G-induced apoptosis involves activation of caspase-3 and DFF-40/CAD through both activation of caspase-8 and cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c along with activation of caspase-9.","['Nagase, Masahiro', 'Shiota, Tetsuya', 'Tsushima, Akiko', 'Murshedul Alam, Mohammad', 'Fukuoka, Satoshi', 'Yoshizawa, Takumi', 'Sakato, Nobuo']","['Nagase M', 'Shiota T', 'Tsushima A', 'Murshedul Alam M', 'Fukuoka S', 'Yoshizawa T', 'Sakato N']","['Department of Life Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagawa University, 2393 Ikenobe, Miki, Kagawa 761-0795, Japan. nagase@ag.kagawa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Trichothecenes)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-amino-4-methylcoumarin)', '53126-63-9 (satratoxin G)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.1.- (DFFB protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Coumarins', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/toxicity', 'Oligopeptides', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Sick Building Syndrome/etiology', 'Stachybotrys/pathogenicity', 'Trichothecenes/*toxicity']",2002/08/06 10:00,2003/03/18 04:00,['2002/08/06 10:00'],"['2002/08/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['S016524780200127X [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2478(02)00127-x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 2002 Oct 21;84(1):23-7. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2478(02)00127-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this review is to consider the management of hyphemas that occur after closed globe trauma. Complications of traumatic hyphema include increased intraocular pressure, peripheral anterior synechiae, optic atrophy, corneal bloodstaining, secondary hemorrhage, and accommodative impairment. The reported incidence of secondary anterior chamber hemorrhage, that is, rebleeding, in the setting of traumatic hyphema ranges from 0% to 38%. The risk of secondary hemorrhage may be higher in African-Americans than in whites. Secondary hemorrhage is generally thought to convey a worse visual prognosis, although the outcome may depend more directly on the size of the hyphema and the severity of associated ocular injuries. Some issues involved in managing a patient with hyphema are: use of various medications (e.g., cycloplegics, systemic or topical steroids, antifibrinolytic agents, analgesics, and antiglaucoma medications); the patient's activity level; use of a patch and shield; outpatient vs. inpatient management; and medical vs. surgical management. Special considerations obtain in managing children, patients with hemoglobin S, and patients with hemophilia. It is important to identify and treat associated ocular injuries, which often accompany traumatic hyphema. We consider each of these management issues and refer to the pertinent literature in formulating the following recommendations. We advise routine use of topical cycloplegics and corticosteroids, systemic antifibrinolytic agents or corticosteroids, and a rigid shield.

Expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6 was regulated by a transcription factor, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. The iridoid glycoside, aucubin, has been found as a natural constituent of many traditional oriental medicinal plants. We studied the effect of aucubin on the TNF-alpha and IL-6 expression in Ag-stimulated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 mast cells. We show that aucubin inhibited Ag-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 production and expression in a dose-dependent manner with IC(50) of 0.101 and 0.19 microg/ml, respectively. Maximal inhibition of TNF-alpha and IL-6 production was 73 +/- 4.3% and 88.8 +/- 5%, respectively. Aucubin also inhibited Ag-induced nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and degradation of IkappaBalpha. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by aucubin might be specific since activator protein-1 binding activity was not affected. In conclusion, these results suggest that aucubin is a specific inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation in mast cells, which might explain its beneficial effect in the treatment of chronic allergic inflammatory diseases.","['Jeong, Hyun-Ja', 'Koo, Hyun-Na', 'Na, Ho-Jeong', 'Kim, Mi-Sun', 'Hong, Seung-Heon', 'Eom, Jung-Woo', 'Kim, Kyung-Suk', 'Shin, Tae-Yong', 'Kim, Hyung-Min']","['Jeong HJ', 'Koo HN', 'Na HJ', 'Kim MS', 'Hong SH', 'Eom JW', 'Kim KS', 'Shin TY', 'Kim HM']","['Department of Oriental Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy and Korea Institute of Oriental Pharmacy, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Chonbuk, 570-749, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Glucosides)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Iridoid Glucosides)', '0 (Iridoids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nfkbia protein, rat)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '2G52GS8UML (aucubin)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glucosides/*pharmacology', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Interleukin-6/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Iridoid Glucosides', 'Iridoids/*pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",2002/08/06 10:00,2003/03/12 04:00,['2002/08/06 10:00'],"['2002/08/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/12 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['S104346660290894X [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.2002.0894 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2002 Jun 7;18(5):252-9. doi: 10.1006/cyto.2002.0894.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the identification and characterization of G(I)-protein coupled receptor independent pathways would enable researchers to pursue novel cellular events that could direct or promote preconditioning. In this regard recent work has begun to explore the role of the innate immune system in intrinsic cardioprotection against both viral myocarditis and ischemia. Interestingly, cytokines such as TNFalpha, IL-1beta and leukemia inhibitory factor, which are components of innate immunity, have been shown to mimic ischemic preconditioning. Thus as the innate immune system functions via a diverse array of G(I)-protein independent receptors, the study of this immunological system in the heart may provide new insight into mechanisms driving and promoting ischemic preconditioning. We propose that innate immunity is indeed an integral part of ischemic preconditioning. In this review, we provide an overview of the innate immune system, describe the studies whereby cytokines mimic ischemic preconditioning and finally postulate some mechanisms whereby innate immunity may promote cardioprotection as a component of preconditioning.","['Smith, Robert M', 'Lecour, Sandrine', 'Sack, Michael N']","['Smith RM', 'Lecour S', 'Sack MN']","['Hatter Institute for Cardiology Research, MRC Inter-University Cape Heart Group, University of Cape Town Medical School, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Cardiovasc Res,Cardiovascular research,0077427,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/*physiology', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', '*Ischemic Preconditioning, Myocardial', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Models, Animal', 'Myocardial Ischemia/*immunology', 'Myocardium/*immunology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Toll-Like Receptors']",2002/08/06 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/06 10:00'],"['2002/08/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0008636302002882 [pii]', '10.1016/s0008-6363(02)00288-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Res. 2002 Aug 15;55(3):474-82. doi: 10.1016/s0008-6363(02)00288-2.,,,95,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have identified multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC) in postnatal human and rodent BM that copurify with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). BM MAPC proliferate without senescence and differentiate into mesodermal, neuroectodermal, and endodermal cell types. We hypothesized that cells with characteristics similar to BM MAPC can be selected and cultured from tissues other than BM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BM, whole brain, and whole muscle tissue was obtained from mice. Cells were plated on Dulbecco modified Eagle medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum and 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10 ng/mL platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), and 1000 units/mL leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) for more than 6 months. Cells were maintained between 0.5 and 1.5 x 10(3) cells/cm(2). At variable time points, we tested cell phenotype by FACS and evaluated their differentiation into endothelial cells, neuroectodermal cells, and endodermal cells in vitro. We also compared the expressed gene profile in BM, muscle, and brain MAPC by Affimetrix gene array analysis. RESULTS: Cells could be cultured from BM, muscle, and brain that proliferated for more than 70 population doublings (PDs) and were negative for CD44, CD45, major histocompatibility complex class I and II, and c-kit. Cells from the three tissues differentiated to cells with morphologic and phenotypic characteristics of endothelium, neurons, glia, and hepatocytes. The expressed gene profile of cells derived from the three tissues was identical (r(2) > 0.975). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that cells with MAPC characteristics can be isolated not only from BM, but also from brain and muscle tissue. Whether MAPC originally derived from BM are circulating or all organs contain stem cells with MAPC characteristics currently is being studied. Presence of MAPC in multiple tissues may help explain the ""plasticity"" found in multiple adult tissues.","['Jiang, Yuehua', 'Vaessen, Ben', 'Lenvik, Todd', 'Blackstad, Mark', 'Reyes, Morayma', 'Verfaillie, Catherine M']","['Jiang Y', 'Vaessen B', 'Lenvik T', 'Blackstad M', 'Reyes M', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Stem Cell Institute, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/growth & development', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Brain/*cytology/growth & development', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Ectoderm/cytology', 'Endoderm/cytology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Muscle Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*cytology/growth & development', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Organ Specificity', '*Stem Cells/cytology']",2002/08/06 10:00,2002/09/17 10:01,['2002/08/06 10:00'],"['2002/08/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X0200869X [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00869-x [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Aug;30(8):896-904. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00869-x.,['R01-DG67932/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,['Exp Hematol. 2006 Jun;34(6):809'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The metabolism of a novel phosphodiesterase-IV inhibitor (V11294) was studied in human liver microsomal and cytosol preparations and in cDNA-expressed human hepatic CYP forms. 2. Human liver microsomes, but not cytosol, catalysed the NADPH-dependent metabolism of V11294 to V10331 (formed by hydroxylation of the cyclopentyl ring), V10332 (N-desethyl V11294) and V11689 (formed by hydroxylation of the isopropyl side chain). In addition, smaller amounts of a secondary metabolite V11690 (which can be formed from either V10332 or V11689) were also produced. 3. Kinetic analysis of V11294 metabolism to V10331, V10332 and V11689 in two preparations of pooled human liver microsomes revealed average K(m) = 2.5, 8.1 and 3.9 micro M, respectively. 4. The metabolism of V11294 was determined with a characterized bank of 16 individual human liver microsomal preparations employing a V11294 substrate concentration of 8 micro M (i.e. approximately the K(m) for V10332 formation and around twice the K(m) for V10331 and V11689 formation). Good correlations (r(2) = 0.570-0.903) were observed between V10331, V10332 and V11689 formation and markers of CYP3A forms. In contrast, poorer correlations (r(2) = 0.0002-0.428) were observed with markers of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP4A9/11. 5. Using human B-lymphoblastoid cell microsomes containing cDNA-expressed CYP forms, V11294 (8 micro M) was metabolized by cDNA-expressed CYP3A4 to V10331, V10332 and V11689, with lower amounts of V11690 also being formed. Lower rates of V11294 metabolism to some V11294 metabolites were also observed with cDNA-expressed CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, whereas only very low or undetectable rates of V11294 metabolism were observed with cDNA-expressed CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2E1. 6. The metabolism of V11294 (8 micro M) to V10331, V10332 and V11689 was markedly inhibited by the CYP3A mechanism-based inhibitor troleandomycin. In contrast, V11294 metabolism was not significantly affected by inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 or by the CYP2C19 substrate S-mephenytoin. 7. In summary, by correlation analysis, chemical inhibition studies and the use of cDNA-expressed CYPs, V11294 metabolism in human liver to V10331, V10332 and V11689 appears to be primarily catalysed by CYP3A forms.","['Subrahmanyam, V', 'Renwick, A B', 'Walters, D G', 'Price, R J', 'Tonelli, A P', 'Lake, B G']","['Subrahmanyam V', 'Renwick AB', 'Walters DG', 'Price RJ', 'Tonelli AP', 'Lake BG']","['Purdue Pharma L.P., 444 Sawmill River Road, Ardsley, NY 10502, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Xenobiotica,Xenobiotica; the fate of foreign compounds in biological systems,1306665,"['0 (3-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-6-ethylamino-8-isopropyl-3H-purine)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4)']",IM,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/*antagonists & inhibitors"", 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Liver/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/enzymology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Purines/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/06 10:00,2002/09/19 10:01,['2002/08/06 10:00'],"['2002/08/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00498250210128684 [doi]'],ppublish,Xenobiotica. 2002 Jun;32(6):521-34. doi: 10.1080/00498250210128684.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was demonstrated to have a wide range of anti-metabolic activities when tested against cultured cancer cells and to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent for acute myelogenous leukemia. However, because of 5-azacytidine's general toxicity, other nucleoside analogs were favored as therapeutics. The finding that 5-azacytidine was incorporated into DNA and that, when present in DNA, it inhibited DNA methylation, led to widespread use of 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Decitabine) to demonstrate the correlation between loss of methylation in specific gene regions and activation of the associated genes. There is now a revived interest in the use of Decitabine as a therapeutic agent for cancers in which epigenetic silencing of critical regulatory genes has occurred. Here, the current status of our understanding of the mechanism(s) by which 5-azacytosine residues in DNA inhibit DNA methylation is reviewed with an emphasis on the interactions of these residues with bacterial and mammalian DNA (cytosine-C5) methyltransferases. The implications of these mechanistic studies for development of less toxic inhibitors of DNA methylation are discussed.","['Christman, Judith K']",['Christman JK'],"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and UNMC/Eppley Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 984525 University Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, NE 68198-4525, USA. jchristm@unmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/*therapy']",2002/08/03 10:00,2002/08/23 10:01,['2002/08/03 10:00'],"['2002/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205699 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Aug 12;21(35):5483-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205699.,['R21 CA091315-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,146,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, like restriction of murine leukemia virus in humans, the block is before reverse transcription.

Imatinib mesylate (also known as STI-571 and Gleevec), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown encouraging results in CML clinical trials and has become a paradigm for targeted cancer therapeutics. Recent reports of resistance to imatinib argue for further development of therapies for CML. During studies of signal transduction, we observed that the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD173955 inhibited Bcr-Abl-dependent cell growth. Subsequently, a related compound, PD180970, was reported as a potent inhibitor of Bcr-Abl. We have compared the potency of these two compounds and four other analogues with imatinib on Bcr-Abl-dependent cell growth, cytokine-dependent cell growth, and tyrosine kinase inhibition. PD173955 inhibited Bcr-Abl-dependent cell growth with an IC(50) of 2-35 nM in different cell lines. Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analyses of cells treated with PD173955 showed cell cycle arrest in G(1). PD173955 has an IC(50) of 1-2 nM in kinase inhibition assays of Bcr-Abl, and in cellular growth assays it inhibits Bcr-Abl-dependent substrate tyrosine phosphorylation. Of the six pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine analogues studied, PD166326 was the most potent inhibitor of Bcr-Abl-dependent cell growth. PD173955 inhibited kit ligand-dependent c-kit autophosphorylation (IC(50) = approximately 25 nM) and kit ligand-dependent proliferation of M07e cells (IC(50) = 40 nM) but had a lesser effect on interleukin 3-dependent (IC(50) = 250 nM) or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (IC(50) = 1 microM)-dependent cell growth. These compounds are potent inhibitors of both the Bcr-Abl and c-kit receptor tyrosine kinases and deserve further study as potential treatments for both CML and for diseases in which c-kit has a role.","['Wisniewski, David', 'Lambek, Caryl L', 'Liu, Chongyuan', 'Strife, Annabel', 'Veach, Darren R', 'Nagar, Bhushan', 'Young, Matthew A', 'Schindler, Thomas', 'Bornmann, William G', 'Bertino, Joseph R', 'Kuriyan, John', 'Clarkson, Bayard']","['Wisniewski D', 'Lambek CL', 'Liu C', 'Strife A', 'Veach DR', 'Nagar B', 'Young MA', 'Schindler T', 'Bornmann WG', 'Bertino JR', 'Kuriyan J', 'Clarkson B']","['Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (PD 173955)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'TSO2IAD7WJ (PD 180970)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Pyridones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2002/08/03 10:00,2002/09/12 10:01,['2002/08/03 10:00'],"['2002/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Aug 1;62(15):4244-55.,"['P01 CA064593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Small molecule inhibitors of Bcr-Abl that bind to the kinase domain can be used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia. We report crystal structures of the kinase domain of Abl in complex with two such inhibitors, imatinib (also known as STI-571 and Gleevec) and PD173955 (Parke-Davis). Both compounds bind to the canonical ATP-binding site of the kinase domain, but they do so in different ways. As shown previously in a crystal structure of Abl bound to a smaller variant of STI-571, STI-571 captures a specific inactive conformation of the activation loop of Abl in which the loop mimics bound peptide substrate. In contrast, PD173955 binds to a conformation of Abl in which the activation loop resembles that of an active kinase. The structure suggests that PD173955 would be insensitive to whether the conformation of the activation loop corresponds to active kinases or to that seen in the STI-571 complex. In vitro kinase assays confirm that this is the case and indicate that PD173955 is at least 10-fold more inhibitory than STI-571. The structures suggest that PD173955 achieves its greater potency over STI-571 by being able to target multiple forms of Abl (active or inactive), whereas STI-571 requires a specific inactive conformation of Abl.","['Nagar, Bhushan', 'Bornmann, William G', 'Pellicena, Patricia', 'Schindler, Thomas', 'Veach, Darren R', 'Miller, W Todd', 'Clarkson, Bayard', 'Kuriyan, John']","['Nagar B', 'Bornmann WG', 'Pellicena P', 'Schindler T', 'Veach DR', 'Miller WT', 'Clarkson B', 'Kuriyan J']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (PD 173955)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Piperazines/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Pyridones/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2002/08/03 10:00,2002/09/12 10:01,['2002/08/03 10:00'],"['2002/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Aug 1;62(15):4236-43.,['CA64593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Prospective study over 16 weeks of children randomized to receive Pred (40 mg/m2) or Dex (6.5 mg/m2) for the first 5 weeks as part of the MRC-ALL97/99 induction chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). MEASUREMENTS: Lower leg length velocity (LLLV) and weight, serum IGF-I, serum bone alkaline phosphatase (bALP) levels and creatinine-adjusted, urinary excretion of deoxypyridinoline cross-links (DPD). SUBJECTS: Nineteen children (eight boys, 11 girls) with a median age of 5.9 years (range 2.6-13) and with a diagnosis of ALL. RESULTS: At week 2 of therapy, median LLLV in the Dex group was -1.5 mm/week (range 0.7 to -2.1) and significantly lower than the LLLV in the Pred group which was -0.1 mm/week (range 0.20 to -0.28; P < 0.05). In the Dex group, LLLV remained lower at week 8 (med LLLV, -0.3 mm/week, range 0 to -1.3) compared to LLLV in the Pred group at 0.3 mm/week (range 0.2-1.0; P < 0.05). Body weight showed an increase after week 2 and reached a peak in both groups of children at week 6. The change in weight from baseline was greater in the Dex group than the Pred group reaching a maximum change by week 5 of 17.5% (range 5-25) and 8.7% (range -3 to 18), respectively (P < 0.05). At presentation, median IGF-I level for the whole group was 83.5 micro g/l (range 31.8-293). IGF-I levels fell markedly during Dex therapy and continued to remain lower than baseline. At weeks 4, 6 and 8, median change in IGF-I from baseline was lower in the Dex group than the Pred group. From week 1 to week 3, median change in bALP was 72% (range -8 to 304) in the Pred group, whereas in the Dex group change in bALP was -1% (range 23 to -28; P < 0.005). By week 3, median bALP was higher in the Pred group at 65 U/l (range 36-187) than in the Dex group at 39 U/l (range 26-60; P < 0.05) but by week 6 median bALP in the Pred group had fallen to a similar level to the Dex group. At presentation, median DPD was 22 nmol/l (range 17-38) and 20 nmol/l (range 12-26) in the Pred and Dex groups, respectively (ns), reaching a nadir between weeks 3 and 6. The median percentage change in DPD in the Pred and Dex group from week 1 to week 3 was -34% (range -7 to 14) and -53% (range -6 to -69), respectively (ns). By week 8, DPD excretion had started to rise more dramatically in the Pred group such that the median DPD was 35 nmol/l (range 10-53) in the Pred group and 22 (range 9-30) in the Dex group (P < 0.05). On average, between weeks 2 and 8, LLLV was three times lower, percentage gain in weight was three times higher, bALP was 1.3 times lower and DPD was 1.5 times lower in the Dex group than the Pred group. CONCLUSION: Pred and Dex both affect short-term growth and bone turnover. The mechanism of the effect on bone formation may be different between the two drugs. Dex may be about 18 times more potent than Pred at suppressing short-term linear growth and stimulating weight gain, and about nine times more potent at suppressing bone turnover. Glucocorticoids have a variable effect on different parameters of growth and bone turnover and the intensity may depend on the steroid used.","['Ahmed, S F', 'Tucker, P', 'Mushtaq, T', 'Wallace, A M', 'Williams, D M', 'Hughes, I A']","['Ahmed SF', 'Tucker P', 'Mushtaq T', 'Wallace AM', 'Williams DM', 'Hughes IA']","['Department of Child Health, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Yorkhill, Glasgow, UK. gcl328@clinmed.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '90032-33-0 (deoxypyridinoline)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/blood', 'Amino Acids/urine', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Bone Remodeling/*drug effects', 'Bone and Bones/enzymology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Growth/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/analysis', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Prednisolone/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies']",2002/08/03 10:00,2002/09/28 04:00,['2002/08/03 10:00'],"['2002/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']","['1580 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2265.2002.01580.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2002 Aug;57(2):185-91. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2265.2002.01580.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Angiogenesis is an indispensable prerequisite for the progression and metastasis of solid malignancies, which is modulated by tumor suppressors and oncogenes. We have addressed the possibility that N-myc oncogene might regulate angiogenesis in neuroblastoma. Here, we report that experimental N-Myc overexpression results in down-regulation of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a modulator of endothelial cell proliferation. Reporter assays using the LIF promoter and a series of N-Myc mutants clearly demonstrated that down-regulation of the LIF promoter was independent of Myc/Max interaction and required a contiguous N-terminal N-Myc domain. STAT3, a downstream signal transducer, was essential for LIF activity as infection with adenoviruses expressing a phosphorylation-deficient STAT3 mutant rendered endothelial cells insensitive to the antiproliferative action of LIF. LIF did not influence neuroblastoma cell proliferation suggesting that, at least in the context of neuroblastoma, LIF is involved in paracrine rather than autocrine interactions. Our data shed light on the mechanisms by which N-myc oncogene amplification enhances the malignant phenotype in neuroblastoma.","['Hatzi, Elissavet', 'Murphy, Carol', 'Zoephel, Andreas', 'Ahorn, Horst', 'Tontsch, Ulrike', 'Bamberger, Ana-Maria', 'Yamauchi-Takihara, Keiko', 'Schweigerer, Lothar', 'Fotsis, Theodore']","['Hatzi E', 'Murphy C', 'Zoephel A', 'Ahorn H', 'Tontsch U', 'Bamberger AM', 'Yamauchi-Takihara K', 'Schweigerer L', 'Fotsis T']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, Medical School, University of Ioannina, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endothelium/cytology/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/03 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/08/03 10:00'],"['2002/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']","['3066 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03066.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 2002 Aug;269(15):3732-41. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03066.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fine tuning of combinatorial multi-domain elements.,3607-18,"Haematopoiesis, the differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors into various lineages, involves complex interactions of transcription factors that modulate the expression of downstream genes and mediate proliferation and differentiation signals. Commitment of pluripotent haematopoietic stem cells to the erythroid lineage induces erythropoiesis, the production of red blood cells. This process involves a concerted progression through an erythroid burst forming unit (BFU-E), an erythroid colony forming unit (CFU-E), proerythroblast and an erythroblast. The terminally differentiated erythrocytes, in mammals, lose their nucleus yet function several more months. A well-coordinated cohort of transcription factors regulates the formation, survival, proliferation and differentiation of multipotent progenitor into the erythroid lineage. Here, we discuss broad-spectrum factors essential for self-renewal and/or differentiation of multipotent cells as well as specific factors required for proper erythroid development. These factors may operate solely or as part of transcriptional complexes, and exert activation or repression. Sequence comparisons reveal evolutionarily conserved modular composition for these factors; X-ray crystallography demonstrates that they include multidomain elements (e.g. HLH or zinc finger motifs), consistent with their complex interactions with other proteins. Finally, transfections and genomic studies show that the timing of each factor's expression during the hematopoietic process, the cell lineages affected and the existing combination of other factors determine the erythroid cell fate.","['Perry, Chava', 'Soreq, Hermona']","['Perry C', 'Soreq H']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, The Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (KLF17 protein, Xenopus)', '0 (KLF3 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Metalloproteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Milk Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Xenopus Proteins']",2002/08/03 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/08/03 10:00'],"['2002/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']","['2999 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.02999.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 2002 Aug;269(15):3607-18. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.02999.x.,,,98,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various pattern recognition methods have been successfully applied to gene expression data. However, these methods are not optimal, rather they are high-performance classifiers that emphasize only classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose an approach for the construction of the optimal linear classifier using gene expression data. Two linear classification methods, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and discriminant partial least-squares (DPLS), are applied to distinguish acute leukemia subtypes. These methods are shown to give satisfactory accuracy. Moreover, we determined optimally the number of genes participating in the classification (a remarkably small number compared to previous results) on the basis of the statistical significance test. Thus, the proposed method constructs the optimal classifier that is composed of a small size predictor and provides high accuracy.","['Cho, Ji-Hoon', 'Lee, Dongkwon', 'Park, Jin Hyun', 'Kim, Kunwoo', 'Lee, In-Beum']","['Cho JH', 'Lee D', 'Park JH', 'Kim K', 'Lee IB']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, San 31 Hyoja-Dong, Pohang 790-784, Korea, P&I Consulting Company, Ltd., San 31 Hyoja-Dong, Pohang 790-784, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biotechnol Prog,Biotechnology progress,8506292,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/*genetics', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2002/08/03 10:00,2003/02/13 04:00,['2002/08/03 10:00'],"['2002/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']","['bp025517o [pii]', '10.1021/bp025517o [doi]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Prog. 2002 Jul-Aug;18(4):847-54. doi: 10.1021/bp025517o.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Viresolve NFR filter was designed to meet the critical requirement of manufacturing a safe and virus-free therapeutic by retaining RVLPs by a minimum of six log reduction value (LRV). The NFR designation refers to retrovirus removal in a normal flow format. To qualify the product, we tested two model viruses: the 78 nm diameter phi6 bacteriophage and the 80-110 nm diameter Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus (X-MuLV). Robust retention was demonstrated over a wide range of process parameters. Viresolve NFR filters also retain other model adventitious viruses including 70-85 nm diameter Reovirus 3 (Reo3), 70-90 nm diameter Adenovirus 2 (Ad2), and 53 nm diameter PR772 by >6 LRV. In addition to these model viruses, the filter retains >7 LRV of both the mycoplasma Acholeplasma laidlawii and the bacterium Brevundimonas diminuta. Protein passage is shown to be consistently high (95-100%) for a variety of therapeutic protein products, including monoclonal antibodies. Characterization of the filter in specific applications is made simple by availability of ultralow surface area (5 cm(2)) disks, which are shown to scale linearly to the manufacturing scale pleated-filters. Viresolve NFR filters provide consistent water permeability performance (34-37 LMH/psi) and show very little plugging for all feedstocks evaluated. The Viresolve NFR filter incorporates Retropore, a unique asymmetric polyethersulfone membrane, the surface of which has been modified to minimize protein binding.","['Brough, Helene', 'Antoniou, Chris', 'Carter, Jeffrey', 'Jakubik, Jocelyn', 'Xu, Yuan', 'Lutz, Herbert']","['Brough H', 'Antoniou C', 'Carter J', 'Jakubik J', 'Xu Y', 'Lutz H']","['Millipore Corporation, Bioprocess Division, 80 Ashby Road, Bedford, Massachusetts 01730, and Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biotechnol Prog,Biotechnology progress,8506292,"['0 (Buffers)', '0 (Membranes, Artificial)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Solutions)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Biotechnology/instrumentation/*methods', 'Buffers', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Drug Contamination/*prevention & control', 'Filtration/*instrumentation/*methods', 'Membranes, Artificial', 'Particle Size', 'Permeability', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Solutions/chemistry', 'Time Factors', 'Viruses/classification/*isolation & purification']",2002/08/03 10:00,2003/02/13 04:00,['2002/08/03 10:00'],"['2002/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']","['bp010193+ [pii]', '10.1021/bp010193+ [doi]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Prog. 2002 Jul-Aug;18(4):782-95. doi: 10.1021/bp010193+.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This tumor is often associated with hypogammaglobulinemia and infections. This review focuses on recently reported mechanisms underlying the humoral immunodeficiency occurring in B-CLL. Tumoral cells provoke several alterations to normal regulatory T cells, which, in turn, can impair the correct maturation of B cells. In addition, the direct inhibitory effect of B-CLL cells on immunoglobulin (Ig)-secreting plasma cells (PC) may account for the humoral immunodeficiency. This phenomenon is mediated by the interaction of CD95L molecules expressed by B-CLL cells with the death receptor CD95 that is up-regulated on patients' PC, leading to PC apoptosis and subsequently to hypogammaglobulinemia. Furthermore, the presence of CD95L on B-CLL cells could play an additional role in tumoral immune-escape, as reported in other neoplasms.","['Sampalo, Almudena', 'Brieva, Jose A']","['Sampalo A', 'Brieva JA']","['Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar, Cadiz, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinemia/*etiology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Escape/*immunology', 'fas Receptor/analysis/*physiology']",2002/08/03 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/03 10:00'],"['2002/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290017033 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Apr;43(4):881-4. doi: 10.1080/10428190290017033.,,,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these factors was purified as a homologue of nm23. The nm23 gene was isolated as a metastasis-suppressor gene that exhibits low expression in high-level metastatic cancer cells. The nm23 gene was overexpressed in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells and a higher level of nm23-H1 expression was correlated with a poor prognosis in AML. Multivariate analysis of putative prognostic factors revealed that elevated nm23-H1 mRNA levels significantly contributed to the prognosis of patients with AML. The overexpression of nm23-H1 was also observed in various hematological neoplasms. To use nm23 overexpression to determine the prognosis for lymphoma, we established an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique to determine the serum level of nm23-H1 protein. This assay is far simpler than that used to determine nm23 mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using this system, we measured nm23-H1 protein levels in many hematological malignancies. Serum nm23-HI levels were significantly higher in patients with all of the hematological neoplasms tested (AML, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, (ALL) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and malignant lymphomas) than in normal controls. An elevated serum nm23-H1 protein concentration predicted a poor outcome for AML and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Especially in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), seram nm23-H1 protein levels were an important prognostic factor in planning an appropriate treatment strategy for DLBCL. The serum nm23-H I protein levels probably depend on the total mass of malignant cells overexpressing nm23-H1.","['Okabe-Kado, Junko']",['Okabe-Kado J'],"['Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Ina, Japan. jkado@cancer-c.pref.saitama.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (EBNA-3C, epstein-barr virus)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (NME1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nme1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*blood/mortality', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/analysis/*blood/genetics', 'NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases', '*Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase', 'Prognosis', 'Telomere', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*blood/genetics']",2002/08/03 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/03 10:00'],"['2002/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290017006 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Apr;43(4):859-67. doi: 10.1080/10428190290017006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intracellular retinoid signaling induced by endogenous or exogenous RA is regulated by retinoid binding proteins such as CRBPI, CRABPI and CRABPII and there are data suggesting that the expression of these proteins can influence the sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of ATRA. In this study, we investigated the basal and ATRA-induced expression of CRBPI and CRABPI and II in leukemic cell lines and in cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CRBPI as well as CRABPI and II were expressed in all tested cell lines and in leukemic cells from all 18 AML-patients. CRABPII mRNA expression was more abundant than CRBPI and CRABPI in both the cell lines and the patient cells but the levels compared the house keeping gene was lower in the patient cells. In all cell lines and in 69% of the patient samples, ATRA did upregulate CRABPII whereas CRBPI exhibited a varying response and CRABPI was more commonly downregulated. The sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of ATRA did not correlate with the basal expression of any of these proteins. However, ATRA-induced upregulation of CRABPII did significantly correlate with the ATRA sensitivity (p < 0.005) as well as with ATRA-induced upregulation of the retinoid receptor RARbeta (p < 0.05).

A 3.5 kb human Helios cDNA clone was isolated from a human T-cell cDNA library derived from the human T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line JURKAT. This cDNA clone had a unique open reading frame (ORF) encoding a novel 304 amino acid (AA) peptide, which was designated as Helios 3. The sequence of the 289 AA C-terminal portion of Helios 3 downstream of V-16 is identical to the corresponding sequence found in Helios 1 and 2 and contains two zinc fingers. By contrast, the 15 AA N-terminal portion of Helios 3 is unique and does not contain the N-terminal zinc finger motifs that are conserved in Helios 1 and 2 as well as other previously identified members of the Ikaros family. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA fragments of the human Helios gene locus showed that Helios 3 is encoded by the same genomic locus as Helios 1 and 2. The expression of Helios 3 mRNA was not restricted to T-lineage ALL cells or another immunophenotypically distinct subset of leukemias. Helios 3 mRNA was expressed in freshly obtained primary leukemic cells from six of 15 children with newly diagnosed ALL.

Nevertheless, the definition of this syndrome is imprecise. To better understand how the 5q-syndrome is related to other ""5q- only"" myeloid disorders, we searched our conventional cytogenetics file for cases with 5q- as the sole karyotypic abnormality. 31 cases of ""5q- only"" myeloid disorders were found, and they were refractory anemia (n = 16), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) (n = 5), RAEB in transformation (n = 1), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n = 1) and acute myeloid leukemia (n = 8). They included 15 men and 16 women, with a median age of 67 years (range, 40-84 years). The marrow blast count was < or = 11% in 22 cases and > or = 25% in the remaining nine cases. The following morphologic features were common in the marrow: megakaryocytic hypolobation (30/31, 97%), erythroid hypoplasia (26/31, 84%), basophilia (19/31, 62%) and eosinophilia (16/31, 52%). Of those with < or = 11% blasts, 7/22 cases met the criteria of the 5q-syndrome, as defined by high mean corpuscle volume (MCV), normal/high platelet counts, and megakaryocytic hypolobation. Except for the two defining parameters for the 5q-syndrome (MCV and platelet count), there was no significant difference in hematologic parameters between the 5q-syndrome and other cases with < or = 11% blasts.

As its presence determines treatment outcome in several forms of leukemias, it is imperative that clinical laboratories provide the most useful data on its expression. Here, a brief review is provided on the pathomechanism and diagnostics of MDR. From the diagnostic point of view it is fortunate that MDR proteins display similar effluxing activity towards many dissimilar agents some of which can be used in fluorescent assays. These tests mimic the real clinical problem i.e. the extrusion activity of MDR proteins towards xenobiotics. Thus, we believe that functional assays when carried out in a standardized way and particularly combined with labeling for various surface markers can be recommended as a front-line test in MDR measurement.","['Kappelmayer, Janos', 'Karaszi, Eva', 'Telek, Bela', 'Jakab, Katalin']","['Kappelmayer J', 'Karaszi E', 'Telek B', 'Jakab K']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Molecular Pathology, Budapest, Hungary. kappelmayer@jaguar.dote.hu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis/physiology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy']",2002/08/03 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/03 10:00'],"['2002/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290016791 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Apr;43(4):711-7. doi: 10.1080/10428190290016791.,,,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cytokine has been used for many years in the management of patients in the chronic phase of the disease, but the mechanisms by which it induces growth inhibitory effects in CML-cells have not been elucidated. Understanding the signaling mechanisms by which the Type I IFN receptor transduces growth inhibitory signals in BCR-ABL expressing cells should prove very valuable, as it may result in the design of new, more specific pharmacological compounds that target the same cellular cascades. Recent evidence indicates that, in addition to the classic IFN-activated Jak-Stat pathway, the Type I IFN receptor engages in its signaling cascade the CrkL-adapter protein, which is also a substrate for the kinase activity of the BCR-ABL oncogene. In addition, it appears that activation of a member of the Map kinase (MAPK) family of proteins, the p38 MAPK, is essential for the generation of the antileukemic effects of IFNalpha.

Permeability-glycoprotein (P-gp), the best characterized of the human drug efflux pumps, has been shown to be associated with poor treatment outcome in AML patients. Besides P-gp, in addition the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) appeared to contribute to the observed resistance in AML. Alternative transporter proteins, such as the MRP1 homologues MRP2, MRP3, MRP5 and MRP6, and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), have been shown to be expressed at variable levels in AML patient cells. The latter proteins have been described to confer resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, such as daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, etoposide and 6-mercaptopurine, which are generally used in the treatment of AML patients; however, theyhave not yet proven to play a role in drug resistance in AML.

Although FISH is the most accurate quantitative molecular tool for the determination of the exact donor/recipient-T-cell numbers at any time points post-transplant, it has the disadvantage of being limited to sex mismatched donor/recipient pairs.

We evaluated its activity as a single agent and combining it with cisplatin in relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Sixteen patients with advanced MM received intravenous gemcitabine 1250 mg/mq (days 1, 8 and 15) as a single agent for a total of 3 monthly courses. The responders received another three courses, and the non-responders received three courses of gemcitabine 1000 mg/mq (days 1, 8 and 15) plus cisplatin 80 mg/mq (day 1). No grade 4 hematological toxicity was seen after gemcitabine treatment, whereas > or = 3 grade neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were seen in 21 and 13% of the gemcitabine-cisplatin infusions, respectively. Non-hematological toxicity was negligible for both the regimens. After three courses of gemcitabine as a single agent, th e response rate was 31% (1 complete response, 1 partial response and 3 minimal response). Eight patients (50%) achieved stable disease and 3 (19%) had disease progression. Ten patients received gemcitabine-cisplatin and were evaluable for the response. Two patients progressed, four maintained stable disease whereas four patients, unresponsive to gemcitabine, obtained a response (3 partial response and 1 minimal response). With a median follow-up of 13 months (range 8-17.5), 7 patients (44%) died, 5 (31%) had disease progression, 1 (6%) relapsed, 1 was still in partial response (+11 months) and 2 (13%) had a stable disease. Median time to treatment failure (TTF) was 8 months (CI95%: 7.6-8.4) and median overall survival (OS) was 16 months (CI95%: 10-22). These results showed that gemcitabine and gemcitabine-cisplatin were feasible regimens and well tolerated in advanced relapsed-refractory MM. The response rates, the TTF and OS were similar to other salvage chemotherapy regimens; nevertheless, the quality of response was modest particularly after gemcitabine alone. Better results might be obtained combining gemcitabine with other chemotherapy compounds or with biologically based therapies.","['Offidani, M', 'Mele, A', 'Corvatta, L', 'Marconi, M', 'Malerba, L', 'Olivieri, A', 'Rupoli, S', 'Alesiani, F', 'Leoni, P']","['Offidani M', 'Mele A', 'Corvatta L', 'Marconi M', 'Malerba L', 'Olivieri A', 'Rupoli S', 'Alesiani F', 'Leoni P']","['Clinica di Ematologia, Ancona University, Umberto I Hospital, Italy. clinemat@popcsi.unian.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Remission Induction', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/08/03 10:00,2003/01/14 04:00,['2002/08/03 10:00'],"['2002/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290026330 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Jun;43(6):1273-9. doi: 10.1080/10428190290026330.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After treatment with thalidomide marked anti-myeloma activity was observed, but it was associated with rapid progression of the MDS clone to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This paradoxical effect of thalidomide is concerning because there is increasing use of thalidomide in relapsed, heavily treated multiple myeloma patients who already have a higher propensity to develop MDS. The leukemic transformation in our cases most probably reflects the natural progression of MDS, though it clearly demonstrates that thalidomide is ineffective in controlling blast proliferation in t-MDS. More concerning, however, is the possibility that thalidomide, while suppressing the myeloma clone, eliminates inhibitory signals and subsequently stimulates the proliferation of the leukemic clone. The use of thalidomide should be carefully assessed in relapsed multiple myeloma patients with clinical and cytogenetic evidence of t-MDS.","['Badros, Ashraf', 'Morris, Christopher', 'Zangari, Maurizio', 'Barlogie, Bart', 'Tricot, Guido']","['Badros A', 'Morris C', 'Zangari M', 'Barlogie B', 'Tricot G']","['Myeloma and Transplantation Research Center, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, USA. abadros@umm.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'DCEP protocol', 'DT-PACE protocol', 'VAD protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/*drug therapy/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/complications/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2002/08/03 10:00,2003/01/14 04:00,['2002/08/03 10:00'],"['2002/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290026321 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Jun;43(6):1267-71. doi: 10.1080/10428190290026321.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High or increasing levels of MRD are associated with an increased risk of relapse but low levels may persist in patients with prolonged or even durable remission. In adult patients with AML the increased risk of relapse has also been demonstrated using flow cytometry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We evaluated the presence of MRD among pediatric patients with AML during and after the cessation of therapy. We were able to establish a clonal marker for the follow-up in 80% of our cases; 11 of the 15 with a clonal marker had detectable MRD at some point during follow-up while 4/15 relapsed 12-14 months after diagnosis. In two there was hematological relapse preceded by an increase in their FISH-detectable number of clonal cells. In 7 of the 11 remaining in CR1 there were small (< 1%) numbers of clonal cells detectable at one or more time-points. Out of the group of 15 pediatric patients with AML, 12 are currently alive in CCR with a median follow-up of 44 months (range 7-63 months). Our data establish the role of metaphase-FISH in the follow-up of AML in children and emphasize the importance of an increasing level of MRD in predicting a relapse.

There are several potential agents for modulating Pgp-mediated multi-drug resistance, such as cyclosporin A and PSC833, which are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. An alternative therapeutic strategy is to increase the use of drugs which are unaffected by Pgp. However, in this review, we explain why this may be more difficult than it appears. Evidence from in vitro studies of primary AML blasts supports the commonly held supposition that chemoresistance may be linked to apoptosis-resistance. We have found that Pgp has a drug-independent role in the inhibition of in vitro apoptosis in AML blasts. Modulation of cytokine efflux, signalling lipids and intracellular pH have all been suggested as ways by which Pgp may affect cellular resistance to apoptosis; these are discussed in this review. For a chemosensitising agent to be successful, it may be more important for it to enhance apoptosis than to increase drug uptake.","['Pallis, Monica', 'Turzanski, Julie', 'Higashi, Yutaro', 'Russell, Nigel']","['Pallis M', 'Turzanski J', 'Higashi Y', 'Russell N']","['Academic Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital, Nottingham, UK. monica.pallis@nottingham.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Ceramides/physiology', 'Child', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lovastatin/pharmacology', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2002/08/03 10:00,2003/01/14 04:00,['2002/08/03 10:00'],"['2002/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290026277 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Jun;43(6):1221-8. doi: 10.1080/10428190290026277.,,,95,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel methods to induce antigen-specific T-cell tolerance provide promise to ensure engraftment and reduce GVHD without producing generalized and other toxicities caused by myeloablative conditioning regimens. Compelling experimental evidence indicates that the antigen receptors on T-lymphocytes have dual potential to transmit crucial activation signals for initiating immune responses and to discharge equally potent inactivating signals to abort or inhibit immune responses. Many events impact on this fundamental decision-making process and one of the great challenges for modern immunology is to decipher the molecular wiring that integrates and converts the extrinsic and intrinsic variables into positive or negative cellular responses termed immunity and anergy, respectively. Our currently expanding understanding of the biochemical and molecular basis of T-cell anergy provides great promise to improve our ability to design novel clinical therapeutic approaches in order to induce antigen-specific tolerance in vivo. Importantly, strategies now exist to segregate graft versus tumor (GVT) effects from GVHD. Therefore, achievement of limited and specific tolerance to host alloantigens by selectively inactivating the indicated subsets of alloantigen-specific T-lymphocytes will prevent GVHD but retain the GVT effect of the graft. Such treatment approaches will expand the donor pool, because they will allow transplantation between individuals with increasing human leukocyte antigen (HLA) disparity, enable reduction of the need for non-specific immunosuppression, and reduce the risk of opportunistic infections and relapse of leukemia.","['Appleman, Leonard J', 'Tzachanis, Dimitrios', 'Grader-Beck, Thomas', 'Van Puijenbroek, Andre A F L', 'Boussiotis, Vassiliki A']","['Appleman LJ', 'Tzachanis D', 'Grader-Beck T', 'Van Puijenbroek AA', 'Boussiotis VA']","['Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Cd86 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '7D0YB67S97 (Abatacept)']",IM,"['Abatacept', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/physiology', 'B7-1 Antigen/physiology', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'CD28 Antigens/physiology', 'CD40 Antigens/physiology', 'CD40 Ligand/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/physiology', 'Clonal Anergy', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/pharmacology', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*methods', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*immunology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/physiology']",2002/08/03 10:00,2003/01/14 04:00,['2002/08/03 10:00'],"['2002/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290026213 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Jun;43(6):1159-67. doi: 10.1080/10428190290026213.,"['AI41584/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI43552/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI46548/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,73,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our efforts to identify disease specific markers for ALL, we have affinity-purified IgM directed against O-AcSGs that reacts with three disease specific O-AcSGs present on membrane proteins derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of ALL patients. Antibody specificity towards O-AcSGs was confirmed by selective binding to erythrocytes bearing surface O-AcSGs, decreased binding with de-O-acetylated BSM and following pretreatment with O-acetyl esterase. Competitive inhibition ELISA demonstrated a higher avidity of IgM for O-AcSG than IgG. Flow cytometry demonstrated the diagnostic potential of purified O-AcSA IgM as binding was specific with ALL patients and minimal with other haematological disorders and normal individuals. It therefore may be adopted as a non-invasive approach for detection of childhood ALL. Taken together, the data indicates that carbohydrate epitopes having terminal O-AcSA alpha2 --> 6 GalNAc determinants induce disease specific IgG and IgM, potentially useful molecular markers for childhood ALL.","['Pal, S', 'Chatterjee, M', 'Bhattacharya, D K', 'Bandhyopadhyay, S', 'Mandal, C', 'Mandal, C']","['Pal S', 'Chatterjee M', 'Bhattacharya DK', 'Bandhyopadhyay S', 'Mandal C', 'Mandal C']","['Immunobiology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Calcutta 700032, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Glycoconj J,Glycoconjugate journal,8603310,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (O-acetyl sialic acid)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)']",IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Blotting, Western', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology']",2002/08/02 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/02 10:00'],"['2002/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1019692329568 [doi]'],ppublish,Glycoconj J. 2001 Jul;18(7):529-37. doi: 10.1023/a:1019692329568.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the well characterized role of p27 as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, its mechanism of tumor suppression is unknown. We used Moloney murine leukemia virus to induce lymphomas in p27+/+ and p27-/- mice and observed that lymphomagenesis was accelerated in the p27-/- animals. To identify candidate oncogenes that collaborate with p27 loss, we used a high-throughput strategy to sequence 277 viral insertion sites derived from two distinct sets of p27-/- lymphomas and determined their chromosomal location by comparison with the Celera and public (Ensembl) mouse genome databases. This analysis identified a remarkable number of putative protooncogenes in these lymphomas, which included loci that were novel as well as those that were overrepresented in p27-/- tumors. We found that Myc activations occurred more frequently in p27-/- lymphomas than in p27+/+ tumors. We also characterized insertions within two novel loci: (i) the Jun dimerization protein 2 gene (Jundp2), and (ii) an X-linked locus termed Xpcl1. Each of the loci that we found to be frequently involved in p27-/- lymphomas represents a candidate oncogene collaborating with p27 loss. This study illustrates the power of high-throughput insertion site analysis in cancer gene discovery.","['Hwang, Harry C', 'Martins, Carla P', 'Bronkhorst, Yvon', 'Randel, Erin', 'Berns, Anton', 'Fero, Matthew', 'Clurman, Bruce E']","['Hwang HC', 'Martins CP', 'Bronkhorst Y', 'Randel E', 'Berns A', 'Fero M', 'Clurman BE']","['Division of Clinical Research and Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Deletion', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', '*Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'X Chromosome']",2002/08/02 10:00,2002/09/28 04:00,['2002/08/02 10:00'],"['2002/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.162356099 [doi]', '162356099 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Aug 20;99(17):11293-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.162356099.

Schwann cells could play a key role in this process by regulating macrophage infiltration. We show here that medium conditioned by primary denervated Schwann cells or the Schwannoma cell line RN22 produces chemotactic activity for macrophages. The presence of blocking antibodies to macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) reduced this activity to approximately 35 and 65% of control levels, respectively, and only 15% remained in the presence of both antibodies. The presence of chemotactic LIF in Schwann cell-conditioned medium was confirmed by using cells from lif-/- mice. Although interleukin-6 (IL-6) is not itself a chemotactic factor, we found that medium from il-6-/- nerves showed only 40% of the activity secreted by wild-type nerves. Furthermore, IL-6 rapidly induced LIF mRNA in primary Schwann cells, and LIF rapidly induced MCP-1 mRNA expression. Treatment of RN22 Schwannoma cells with IL-6 or LIF enhanced the secretion of the chemotactic activity of these cells. These observations show that Schwann cells attract macrophages by secreting MCP-1 and LIF. They also provide evidence for an autocrine-signaling cascade involving IL-6, LIF, and MCP-1, which amplifies the Schwann cell-derived chemotactic signals gradually, in agreement with the delayed entry of macrophages to injured nerves.","['Tofaris, George K', 'Patterson, Paul H', 'Jessen, Kristjan R', 'Mirsky, Rhona']","['Tofaris GK', 'Patterson PH', 'Jessen KR', 'Mirsky R']","['Cambridge Centre for Brain Repair and Department of Neurology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 2PY, United Kingdom. gt223@cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Blocking/pharmacology', 'Autocrine Communication/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Denervation', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/cytology/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neurilemmoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Schwann Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism']",2002/08/02 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/08/02 10:00'],"['2002/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['20026699 [doi]', '22/15/6696 [pii]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2002 Aug 1;22(15):6696-703. doi: 20026699.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,PMC6758146,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, mechanisms by which this polyphenol inhibits tumor cell growth, and its therapeutic potential are poorly understood. Using various human leukemia cells, we have first defined the anti-tumoral doses of this compound. RES inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of all tested lymphoid and myeloid leukemia cells with IC(50) = 5-43 microM. Prior to apoptosis, RES-induced caspase activity in a dose-dependent manner and cell cycle arrest in G(2)/M-phase, correlating with a significant accumulation of cyclins A and B. Leukemia cell death with RES required both caspase-dependent and -independent proteases, as it was significantly inhibited by simultaneous addition of Z-VAD-FMK and leupeptin to these cultures. While RES did not affect non-activated normal lymphocytes, this agent decreased the growth and induced the apoptosis of cycling normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes at lower concentrations (IC(50) <8 microM) than those required for most leukemia cells. RES also induced the apoptosis of early normal human CD34(+) cells and decreased the number of colonies generated by these precursor cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC(50) = 60 microM). Together, the data point to the complexity of RES-mediated signaling pathways and revealed the high anti-proliferative and proapoptotic activities of RES in normal cycling hemopoietic cells.","['Ferry-Dumazet, Helene', 'Garnier, Olivier', 'Mamani-Matsuda, Maria', 'Vercauteren, Joseph', 'Belloc, Francis', 'Billiard, Christian', 'Dupouy, Maryse', 'Thiolat, Denis', 'Kolb, Jean Pierre', 'Marit, Gerald', 'Reiffers, Josy', 'Mossalayi, M Djavad']","['Ferry-Dumazet H', 'Garnier O', 'Mamani-Matsuda M', 'Vercauteren J', 'Belloc F', 'Billiard C', 'Dupouy M', 'Thiolat D', 'Kolb JP', 'Marit G', 'Reiffers J', 'Mossalayi MD']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation and Hematology Laboratories, CNRS UMR5540, EA 482 and GESNIT-EA 491, Victor Segalen Bordeaux-2 University, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Stilbenes)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology']",2002/08/02 10:00,2002/09/06 10:01,['2002/08/02 10:00'],"['2002/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/23.8.1327 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2002 Aug;23(8):1327-33. doi: 10.1093/carcin/23.8.1327.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcription of the pronapsin A gene in normal human lung tissue was not appreciably altered in lung carcinomas and comparable pronapsin A mRNA levels were also quantified in lung epithelial cell lines and in tumour cell lines originating from human lung epithelium. Pronapsin A may thus have considerable diagnostic value as a marker for primary lung cancer. In contrast, the pronapsin B gene, which lacks an in-frame stop codon and so may be a transcribed pseudogene, is expressed at comparable levels in normal human spleen, thymus, cytotoxic and helper T-lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells and B-lymphocytes. The mRNA levels quantified in B-cells from adults with chronic lymphoblastic leukaemia were not significantly different from those measured in B-cells from healthy individuals. Similarly, comparable levels of expression were quantified in monocytes from healthy individuals and from a patient with acute myeloid leukaemia, whereas in alveolar macrophages, which are terminally differentiated myeloid cells, transcription of the pronapsin B gene was down-regulated by approximately one order of magnitude. Reciprocally, an approximately 20-fold up-regulation in expression of the procathepsin D gene in the macrophages relative to the circulating monocytes was revealed by quantitative measurements made in parallel throughout all of this study for the respective mRNAs encoding the intracellular aspartic proteinases, procathepsin D and procathepsin E. Thus, while there appears to be little difference in expression of the pronapsin A and B genes between healthy and malignant human cells and tissues, the reciprocal alterations in the levels of transcription of the pronapsin B and procathepsin D genes may have significance in the developmental processes associated with myeloid cell differentiation into macrophages.","['Cook, Matthew', 'Buhling, Frank', 'Ansorge, Siegfried', 'Tatnell, Peter J', 'Kay, John']","['Cook M', 'Buhling F', 'Ansorge S', 'Tatnell PJ', 'Kay J']","['School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, P.O.

In this study, we first show that apoptotic cell death is associated with antitumor activity of L-canavanine against human acute leukemia Jurkat T cells. When Jurkat T cells were treated with 1.25-5.0mM L-canavanine for 36 h, apoptotic cell death accompanying several biochemical events such as caspase-3 activation, degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and apoptotic DNA fragmentation was induced in a dose-dependent manner; however, cytochrome c release from mitochondria was not detected. Under these conditions, the expression of Bcl-2 and its functional homolog Bcl-xL was markedly upregulated. The L-canavanine-induced caspase-3 activation, degradation of PARP, and apoptotic DNA fragmentation were suppressed by ectopic expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, both of which are known to play roles as anti-apoptotic regulators. These results demonstrate that the cytotoxic effect of L-canavanine on Jurkat T cells is attributable to the induced apoptosis and that L-canavanine-induced apoptosis is mediated by a cytochrome c-independent caspase-3 activation pathway that can be interrupted by Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL.","['Jang, Myung Ho', 'Jun, Do Youn', 'Rue, Seok Woo', 'Han, Kyu hyun', 'Park, Wan', 'Kim, Young Ho']","['Jang MH', 'Jun DY', 'Rue SW', 'Han Kh', 'Park W', 'Kim YH']","['Laboratory of Immunobiology, Department of Microbiology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Taegu 702-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '3HZV514J4B (Canavanine)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Arginine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Canavanine/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/08/02 10:00,2002/08/30 10:01,['2002/08/02 10:00'],"['2002/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X02006502 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(02)00650-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2002 Jul 12;295(2):283-8. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(02)00650-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 49 AL cases and 22 MDS cases were analyzed by methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) for methylation patterns in CpG islands of the p15(INK4B) gene. RESULTS: Hypermethylation of the p15(INK4B) gene was found in 90% (26/29) of newly diagnosed AL, including 46% with complete methylation and 54% with partial methylation. All 3 evolved AL from MDS and 9 relapsed AL showed a methylated p15(INK4B) gene and the proportion of complete methylation was 67% and 56% respectively. Only 5 of 11 (45%) AL in remission, including 2 in complete remission (CR) and 3 in partial remission (PR), were partially methylated. The frequency of p15(INK4B) gene methylation in newly diagnosed or relapsed AL was significantly higher than that in AL in the remission stage (P = 0.002) p15(INK4B) gene methylation was found in 5 of 13 (38%) low-risk MDS (RA/RAS) patients and 80% of them showed only partial methylation. However, p15(INK4B) gene methylation was found in all 9 cases in the high-risk group (RAEB/RAEB-T), including complete methylation in 56%, significantly different from the low-risk MDS group (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Hypermethylation of the p15(INK4B) gene occurs frequently in leukemia and high-risk MDS. It is possible that hypermethylation of this gene is related to the pathogenesis and development of AL and MDS. It may be used as a gene marker to detect minimal residual disease, relapse of AL and leukemic transformation in MDS.","['Chen, Hua', 'Wu, Shulan']","['Chen H', 'Wu S']","['Department of Hematology, First Hospital of Peking University, Beijing 100034, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/08/02 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/08/02 10:00'],"['2002/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2002 Jul;115(7):987-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical trials of patients receiving stomatotoxic chemotherapy followed by a haematopoietic stem cell transplant show iseganan reduces the occurrence of oral mucositis and ameliorates sequelae such as mouth pain, throat pain and difficulty swallowing. Iseganan is well-tolerated, which is partly attributable to a lack of systemic absorption following topical oral administration.

RESULTS: The cells were negative for TdT and CD99. This unusual immunophenotype has been described as ""transitional pre-B-cell"", in that the cells express both immature markers (CD34) and mature markers (sIg).

It is also a frequent complication in transplant recipients. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of CMV and EBV infections among hospitalized children. Specific antibodies against CMV and EBV were detected in serum by ELISA test. Presence of CMV DNA was determined in leucocytes by Murex Hybrid Capture System. CMV and EBV infections were defined as the presence in serum IgM-class specific antibodies. Obtained results indicate that CMV and EBV infections are frequent in immunocompromised patients. Among patients with CMV or EBV infection, 40% have been diagnosed with cancer, most of whom with hematologic malignancies: leukemia or lymphoma. CMV and EBV coinfection was detected in 14% of infected children. Of all patients with CMV, 50% were neonates and infants. Congenital infection was diagnosed only in one case.

Although p53 exerts many of its effects through regulation of transcription, this protein is also found in association with ribosomes and several mRNAs have been identified that are translationally controlled in a p53-dependent manner. We have utilized murine erythroleukemic cells that express a temperature-sensitive p53 protein to determine whether p53 also functions at the level of translation. The data presented here demonstrate that p53 causes a rapid decrease in translation initiation. Analysis of several potential mechanisms for regulating protein synthesis shows that p53 has selective effects on the phosphorylation of the eIF4E-binding protein, 4E-BP1, and the activity of the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase. These data provide evidence that modulation of translational activity constitutes a further mechanism by which the growth inhibitory effects of p53 may be mediated.","['Horton, Lynn E', 'Bushell, Martin', 'Barth-Baus, Diane', 'Tilleray, Vivienne J', 'Clemens, Michael J', 'Hensold, Jack O']","['Horton LE', 'Bushell M', 'Barth-Baus D', 'Tilleray VJ', 'Clemens MJ', 'Hensold JO']","['The Department of Medicine, University/Ireland Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, 10900 Euclid Ave.-BRB 333, Cleveland, Ohio, OH 44106-4937, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acids/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Kinases', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/*metabolism', 'Ribosomes/metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Temperature', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2002/08/01 10:00,2002/08/31 10:01,['2002/08/01 10:00'],"['2002/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2002/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205662 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Aug 8;21(34):5325-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205662.,"['DK43414/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HK07147-21A1/HK/PHITPO CDC HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our observations suggest a functional relationship between ICAM-1 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) whereby ICAM-1 provides a cell surface docking mechanism for proMMP-9, which, upon activation, proteolytically cleaves the extracellular domain of ICAM-1 leading to its release from the cell surface.

Mutations of Thr-315 in the Abl kinase domain to Ile (T315I) were previously described in STI-571-resistant patients and likely cause resistance from steric interference with drug binding. Here we identify mutations of Tyr-253 in the nucleotide-binding (P) loop of the Abl kinase domain to Phe or His in patients with advanced CML and acquired STI-571 resistance. Bcr-Abl Y253F demonstrated intermediate resistance to STI-571 in vitro and in vivo when compared with Bcr-Abl T315I. The response of Abl proteins to STI-571 was influenced by the regulatory state of the kinase and by tyrosine phosphorylation. The sensitivity of purified c-Abl to STI-571 was increased by a dysregulating mutation (P112L) in the Src homology 3 domain of Abl but decreased by phosphorylation at the regulatory Tyr-393. In contrast, the Y253F mutation dysregulated c-Abl and conferred intrinsic but not absolute resistance to STI-571 that was independent of Tyr-393 phosphorylation. The Abl P-loop is a second target for mutations that confer resistance to STI-571 in advanced CML, and the Y253F mutation may impair the induced-fit interaction of STI-571 with the Abl catalytic domain rather than sterically blocking binding of the drug. Because clinical resistance induced by the Y253F mutation might be overcome by dose escalation of STI-571, molecular genotyping of STI-571-resistant patients may provide information useful for rational therapeutic management.","['Roumiantsev, Sergei', 'Shah, Neil P', 'Gorre, Mercedes E', 'Nicoll, John', 'Brasher, Bradley B', 'Sawyers, Charles L', 'Van Etten, Richard A']","['Roumiantsev S', 'Shah NP', 'Gorre ME', 'Nicoll J', 'Brasher BB', 'Sawyers CL', 'Van Etten RA']","['Center for Blood Research and Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, 200 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115-5717, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Phenylalanine/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Tyrosine/*genetics/metabolism']",2002/08/01 10:00,2002/09/24 06:00,['2002/08/01 10:00'],"['2002/08/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.162140299 [doi]', '162140299 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Aug 6;99(16):10700-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.162140299.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Identification of MLL PTD was performed centrally using Southern blot analysis in pretreatment samples from 525 of 683 assessable patients. PTD was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the PCR products. RESULTS: MLL PTD was identified in none of the 129 patients with t(8;21), inv(16), and t(15;17); in 19 (7.7%) of 247 patients with normal karyotype; and in 10 (8.5%) of 119 patients with all other abnormalities, with 30 cases of t(11q23) excluded. In the group of patients with a normal karyotype, there was no difference in the presenting clinical features between the PTD-positive and the PTD-negative cases. Sixteen (89%) of the 18 assessable PTD-positive patients and 158 (78%) of the 203 PTD-negative patients achieved a complete remission. After a median follow-up time of 19 months, 11 of the 16 PTD-positive patients relapsed compared with 54 of the 158 PTD-negative patients; the median remission durations of the PTD-positive and the PTD-negative groups were 7.75 months and 19 months, respectively (P <.001). Multivariate analysis identified the MLL PTD status as the single prognostic factor for remission duration. CONCLUSION: Within the subgroup of young adult AML patients with normal karyotype, MLL PTD is associated with short remission duration.","['Dohner, Konstanze', 'Tobis, Karen', 'Ulrich, Regina', 'Frohling, Stefan', 'Benner, Axel', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Dohner, Hartmut']","['Dohner K', 'Tobis K', 'Ulrich R', 'Frohling S', 'Benner A', 'Schlenk RF', 'Dohner H']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Robert-Koch-Strasse 8, 89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Duplication', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', '*Transcription Factors']",2002/08/01 10:00,2002/09/07 10:01,['2002/08/01 10:00'],"['2002/08/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2002.09.088 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Aug 1;20(15):3254-61. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.09.088.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inwardly rectifying CRAC channels admit monovalent cations when external divalent ions are removed. Removal of internal Mg(2+) exposes an outwardly rectifying current (Mg(2+)-inhibited cation [MIC]) that also admits monovalent cations when external divalent ions are removed. Here we demonstrate that CRAC and MIC currents are separable by ion selectivity and rectification properties: by kinetics of activation and susceptibility to run-down and by pharmacological sensitivity to external Mg(2+), spermine, and SKF-96365. Importantly, selective run-down of MIC current allowed CRAC and MIC current to be characterized under identical ionic conditions with low internal Mg(2+). Removal of internal Mg(2+) induced MIC current despite widely varying Ca(2+) and EGTA levels, suggesting that Ca(2+)-store depletion is not involved in activation of MIC channels. Increasing internal Mg(2+) from submicromolar to millimolar levels decreased MIC currents without affecting rectification but did not alter CRAC current rectification or amplitudes. External Mg(2+) and Cs(+) carried current through MIC but not CRAC channels. SKF-96365 blocked CRAC current reversibly but inhibited MIC current irreversibly. At micromolar concentrations, both spermine and extracellular Mg(2+) blocked monovalent MIC current reversibly but not monovalent CRAC current. The biophysical characteristics of MIC current match well with cloned and expressed TRPM7 channels. Previous results are reevaluated in terms of separate CRAC and MIC channels.","['Kozak, J Ashot', 'Kerschbaum, Hubert H', 'Cahalan, Michael D']","['Kozak JA', 'Kerschbaum HH', 'Cahalan MD']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Gen Physiol,The Journal of general physiology,2985110R,"['0 (Buffers)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Cations, Monovalent)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying)', '1KSV9V4Y4I (Cesium)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'I61V87164A (1-(2-(3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy)-4-methoxyphenylethyl)-1H-imidazole)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Buffers', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Calcium Channels/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cations, Divalent/metabolism', 'Cations, Monovalent/metabolism', 'Cesium/metabolism', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Magnesium/pharmacology/physiology', 'Permeability', 'Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying/physiology', 'Rats', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Spermine/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/01 10:00,2003/02/05 04:00,['2002/08/01 10:00'],"['2002/08/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1085/jgp.20028601 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Physiol. 2002 Aug;120(2):221-35. doi: 10.1085/jgp.20028601.,"['R01 NS014609/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 NS014609/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-14609/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC2234455,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential role of MCL1 as a fortilin chaperone.,37430-8,"Myeloid cell leukemia 1 protein (MCL1) is an anti-apoptotic protein that is structurally related to Bcl-2. Unlike other Bcl-2 family proteins that are constitutively expressed, MCL1 is inducibly expressed in cells that are recently exposed to growth and differentiation stimuli. Here, we report the identification of fortilin as a novel MCL1-interacting protein by screening of a yeast two-hybrid library with MCL1 as bait. Fortilin specifically interacted with MCL1 both in vitro and in vivo. The intracellular localization of fortilin was predominantly nuclear and identical to that of MCL1, as shown by immunostaining and confocal microscopy analysis. Fortilin, like MCL1, was rapidly inducible in serum-stimulated human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. Although the depletion of intracellular fortilin by small interfering RNA (siRNA) against fortilin (siRNA-fortilin) did not affect intracellular MCL1 level, the depletion of intracellular MCL1 by siRNA-MCL1 was associated with the significant reduction of the fortilin protein level, without affecting the fortilin transcript numbers. In addition, a pulse-chase experiment showed that the depletion of MCL1 by siRNA-MCL1 was associated with the rapid degradation of fortilin protein, which was found quite stable in the presence of MCL1. Furthermore, the half-life of fortilin(R21A), a point mutant of fortilin lacking the binding to MCL1, was significantly shorter than that of wild-type fortilin as shown by a pulse-chase experiment. These data suggest that MCL1, in addition to being an anti-apoptotic molecule, serves as a chaperone of fortilin, binding and stabilizing fortilin in vivo. Taken together with our previous observation that fortilin overexpression prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis (Li, F., Zhang, D., and Fujise, K. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 47542-47549), it is likely that MCL1, an anti-apoptotic protein inducible by growth and differentiation stimuli, stabilizes another anti-apoptotic protein fortilin maximizing the prosurvival environment in cells.","['Zhang, Di', 'Li, Franklin', 'Weidner, Douglas', 'Mnjoyan, Zakar H', 'Fujise, Ken']","['Zhang D', 'Li F', 'Weidner D', 'Mnjoyan ZH', 'Fujise K']","['Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Institute of Molecular Medicine for the Prevention of Human Diseases, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Neoplasms', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Osteosarcoma', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/chemistry/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1']",2002/08/01 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/01 10:00'],"['2002/08/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M207413200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)36463-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Oct 4;277(40):37430-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M207413200.

Treatment of neutrophils with anti-LacCer antibody, T5A7 or Huly-m13, induced superoxide generation from the cells, which was blocked by PP1, a Src kinase inhibitor; wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitor; SB203580, a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor; and H7, an inhibitor for protein kinase C. When promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells were differentiated into neutrophilic lineage by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) treatment, they acquired superoxide-generating activity but did not respond to anti-LacCer antibodies. Density gradient centrifugation revealed that LacCer and Lyn were recovered in detergent-insoluble membrane (DIM) of neutrophils and DMSO-treated HL-60 cells. However, immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that LacCer was associated with Lyn in neutrophils but not in DMSO-treated HL-60 cells. Interestingly, T5A7 induced the phosphorylation of Lyn in neutrophils but not in DMSO-treated HL-60 cells. Moreover, T5A7 induced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in neutrophils. T5A7-induced Lyn phosphorylation in neutrophil DIM fraction was significantly enhanced by cholesterol depletion or sequestration with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin or nystatin. Collectively, these data suggest that neutrophils are characterized by the presence of cell surface LacCer-enriched glycosphingolipid signaling domain coupled with Lyn and that the ligand binding to LacCer induces the activation of Lyn, which may be suppressibly regulated by cholesterol, leading to superoxide generation through the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-, p38 MAPK-, and protein kinase C-dependent signal transduction pathway.","['Iwabuchi, Kazuhisa', 'Nagaoka, Isao']","['Iwabuchi K', 'Nagaoka I']","['Department of Biochemistry, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. iwabuchi@med.juntendo.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cyclodextrins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Lactosylceramides)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (beta-Cyclodextrins)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '1400-61-9 (Nystatin)', '4682-48-8 (CDw17 antigen)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'JV039JZZ3A (betadex)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', '*Antigens, CD', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Cyclodextrins/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Glycosphingolipids/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lactosylceramides/analysis/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lipids/analysis', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/enzymology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Nystatin/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', '*beta-Cyclodextrins', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'src-Family Kinases/analysis/metabolism']",2002/08/01 10:00,2002/09/13 10:01,['2002/08/01 10:00'],"['2002/08/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59342-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2002 Aug 15;100(4):1454-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In lpr/lpr mice and children with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, defective apoptosis is due to Fas mutations. Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a clonal lymphoproliferative disorder associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Leukemic LGLs are resistant to Fas-dependent apoptosis despite expressing high levels of Fas. Such resistance can be overcome by activating leukemic LGLs in vitro, suggesting inhibition of Fas signaling in leukemic cells. We report that sera from patients with LGL leukemia contain high levels of soluble Fas. Ten of these 33 patients with LGL leukemia also had rheumatoid arthritis. Cloning and sequencing revealed expression of multiple Fas messenger RNA variants in leukemic LGL. These Fas variants, including 3 newly described here, encode soluble Fas molecules. Supernatants from cells transfected with these Fas variants blocked Fas-dependent apoptosis of leukemic LGLs. These results suggest that blockade of Fas-signaling by soluble Fas may be a mechanism leading to apoptosis resistance in leukemic LGLs.","['Liu, Jin Hong', 'Wei, Sheng', 'Lamy, Thierry', 'Li, Yongxiang', 'Epling-Burnette, P K', 'Djeu, Julie Y', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Liu JH', 'Wei S', 'Lamy T', 'Li Y', 'Epling-Burnette PK', 'Djeu JY', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['Hematologic Malignancies and Immunology Programs, H.

Germ-line mutations in the ATM gene cause ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), a multisystem disorder associated with predisposition to lymphoma and acute leukemia. Moreover, somatic ATM mutations have been identified in T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In this study, the entire ATM coding sequence was examined in genomic DNA from 120 lymphoid neoplasms. Novel mutations and mutations implicated in cancer and/or A-T were found in 9 of 45 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), 2 of 24 follicular lymphomas, and 1 of 27 adult acute lymphoblastic leukemias, whereas no such mutations were detected among 24 peripheral T-cell lymphomas. The mutational spectrum consisted of 2 nonsense mutations, 1 mutation affecting RNA splicing, and 10 missense variants. Most of these mutations were associated with loss or mutation of the paired ATM allele, consistent with biallelic inactivation of ATM. Of the 9 DLBCLs with ATM mutations, 7 also carried TP53 mutations and/or deletions of the INK4a/ARF locus (P =.003). The ATM 735C>T substitution previously considered a rare normal variant was found to be 5.6 times more frequent in individuals with DLBCL than in random individuals (P =.026), suggesting that it may predispose to B-cell lymphoma. Our data suggest that ATM mutations contribute to the development of DLBCL, and that ATM and the ARF-p53 tumor suppressor pathway may cooperate in the pathogenesis of this malignancy.","['Gronbaek, Kirsten', 'Worm, Jesper', 'Ralfkiaer, Elisabeth', 'Ahrenkiel, Vibeke', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Guldberg, Per']","['Gronbaek K', 'Worm J', 'Ralfkiaer E', 'Ahrenkiel V', 'Hokland P', 'Guldberg P']","['Institute of Cancer Biology, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Mutation, Missense', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'RNA Splicing/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/08/01 10:00,2002/09/13 10:01,['2002/08/01 10:00'],"['2002/08/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0382 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59339-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Aug 15;100(4):1430-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0382.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Reed-Sternberg (R-S) cells in the Hodgkin component also strongly express TIA-1 but differ from the anaplastic large cells by the expression of CD15 and TARC and the presence of a prominent lymphocytic infiltrate.

The overall incidence of genomic aberrations was similar in the V(H) unmutated and V(H) mutated subgroups. High-risk genomic aberrations such as 17p- and 11q- occurred almost exclusively in the V(H) unmutated subgroup, whereas favorable aberrations such as 13q- and 13q- as single abnormalities were overrepresented in the V(H) mutated subgroup.

However, disruption of the p53 pathway can occur through mechanisms other than TP53 mutation, and we have recently developed a simple screening test that detects p53 dysfunction due to mutation of the genes encoding either p53 or ATM, a kinase that regulates p53. The present study was conducted to examine the predictive value of this test and to establish the relationship between p53 dysfunction, CD38 expression, and IgV(H) mutation. CLL cells from 71 patients were examined for IgV(H) mutation, CD38 expression, and p53 dysfunction (detected as an impaired p53/p21 response to ionizing radiation). Survival data obtained from 69 patients were analyzed according to each of these parameters. Relative lack of IgV(H) mutation (less than 5%; n = 45), CD38 positivity (antigen expressed on more than 20% of malignant cells; n = 19), and p53 dysfunction (n = 19) were independently confirmed as adverse prognostic factors.

Moreover, patients with p53 dysfunction and/or CD38 positivity (n = 31) accounted for the short survival of the less mutated group. These findings indicate that the poor outcome associated with having less than 5% IgV(H) mutation may be due to the overrepresentation of high-risk patients with p53 dysfunction and/or CD38 positivity within this group, and that CD38(-) patients with functionally intact p53 may have a prolonged survival regardless of the extent of IgV(H) mutation.","['Lin, Ke', 'Sherrington, Paul D', 'Dennis, Michael', 'Matrai, Zoltan', 'Cawley, John C', 'Pettitt, Andrew R']","['Lin K', 'Sherrington PD', 'Dennis M', 'Matrai Z', 'Cawley JC', 'Pettitt AR']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', '*Mutation', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",2002/08/01 10:00,2002/09/13 10:01,['2002/08/01 10:00'],"['2002/08/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2001-11-0066 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59335-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Aug 15;100(4):1404-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2001-11-0066.,,['Blood. 2002 Aug 15;100(4):1110-1.

Full DNPS inhibition was associated with greater antileukemic effects compared with partial or no inhibition (-63% +/- 4% vs -37% +/- 4%; P <.0001) in patients with nonhyperdiploid B-lineage and T-lineage ALL. HDMTX plus MP yielded 2-fold higher MTX polyglutamate concentrations than LDMTX plus MP (2148 +/- 298 vs 1075 +/- 114 pmol/10(9) cells; P <.01) and a higher percentage of patients with full DNPS inhibition (78% vs 53%; P <.001). Thus, the extent of DNPS inhibition was related to in vivo antileukemic effects, and a single dose of intravenous MP produced minimal DNPS inhibition and antileukemic effects, whereas MTX plus MP produced greater antileukemic effects and DNPS inhibition, with full inhibition more frequent after HDMTX.","['Dervieux, Thierry', 'Brenner, Timothy L', 'Hon, Yuen Y', 'Zhou, Yinmei', 'Hancock, Michael L', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Rivera, Gaston K', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Boyett, James M', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Evans, William E']","['Dervieux T', 'Brenner TL', 'Hon YY', 'Zhou Y', 'Hancock ML', 'Sandlund JT', 'Rivera GK', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Boyett JM', 'Pui CH', 'Relling MV', 'Evans WE']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital and University of Tennessee, Memphis, 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Purines)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Purines/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis']",2002/08/01 10:00,2002/09/13 10:01,['2002/08/01 10:00'],"['2002/08/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0495 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59315-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Aug 15;100(4):1240-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0495.,"['CA 36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HuM195, a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody, specifically targets myeloid leukemia cells and has activity against minimal disease. When labeled with the beta-emitters (131)I and (90)Y, HuM195 can eliminate large leukemic burdens in patients, but it produces prolonged myelosuppression requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at high doses. To enhance the potency of native HuM195 yet avoid the nonspecific cytotoxicity of beta-emitting constructs, the alpha-emitting isotope (213)Bi was conjugated to HuM195. Eighteen patients with relapsed and refractory acute myelogenous leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia were treated with 10.36 to 37.0 MBq/kg (213)Bi-HuM195. No significant extramedullary toxicity was seen. All 17 evaluable patients developed myelosuppression, with a median time to recovery of 22 days. Nearly all the (213)Bi-HuM195 rapidly localized to and was retained in areas of leukemic involvement, including the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. Absorbed dose ratios between these sites and the whole body were 1000-fold greater than those seen with beta-emitting constructs in this antigen system and patient population. Fourteen (93%) of 15 evaluable patients had reductions in circulating blasts, and 14 (78%) of 18 patients had reductions in the percentage of bone marrow blasts. This study demonstrates the safety, feasibility, and antileukemic effects of (213)Bi-HuM195, and it is the first proof-of-concept for systemic targeted alpha particle immunotherapy in humans.","['Jurcic, Joseph G', 'Larson, Steven M', 'Sgouros, George', 'McDevitt, Michael R', 'Finn, Ronald D', 'Divgi, Chaitanya R', 'Ballangrud, Ase M', 'Hamacher, Klaus A', 'Ma, Dangshe', 'Humm, John L', 'Brechbiel, Martin W', 'Molinet, Roger', 'Scheinberg, David A']","['Jurcic JG', 'Larson SM', 'Sgouros G', 'McDevitt MR', 'Finn RD', 'Divgi CR', 'Ballangrud AM', 'Hamacher KA', 'Ma D', 'Humm JL', 'Brechbiel MW', 'Molinet R', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA. jurcicj@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', 'U015TT5I8H (Bismuth)']",IM,"['Alpha Particles/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacokinetics', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Bismuth/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Leukopenia/etiology', 'Radioisotopes/administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",2002/08/01 10:00,2002/09/13 10:01,['2002/08/01 10:00'],"['2002/08/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59314-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2002 Aug 15;100(4):1233-9.,"['P01 CA33049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CCA55349/CC/ODCDC CDC HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, TNF-alpha levels were determined in 150 patients with CLL and correlated with disease characteristics, prognostic factors, and survival. The mean TNF-alpha plasma concentration in the patients with CLL was significantly higher than in the healthy control population (16.4 versus 8.7 pg/mL; P <.0001). Patients having an elevated TNF-alpha level had more advanced Rai and Binet stage disease, higher serum beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)M) levels, a greater percentage of cells expressing CD38, and lower hemoglobin and platelet levels. Patients having chromosomal abnormalities such as 11q deletion, trisomy 12, and chromosome 17 aberrations had a higher mean TNF-alpha level (27.5 pg/mL) than patients having a diploid karyotype or other miscellaneous cytogenetic abnormalities (14.2 pg/mL; P <.001). The TNF-alpha level was a predictor of survival when the Cox proportional hazards model was used with TNF-alpha entered as a continuous variable (P =.0001). Also, patients having a TNF-alpha level above the mean value of 14 pg/mL had significantly shorter survival duration (P =.00001). The TNF-alpha level remained predictive of survival in Cox multivariate analysis independent of Rai staging and beta(2)M, hemoglobin, prior therapy, white cell count, and platelet level (P =.005). We conclude that the TNF-alpha level serves as a prognostic factor in patients with CLL and that inhibition of TNF-alpha in these patients could have therapeutic importance.","['Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Dey, Amanda', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Koller, Charles A', 'Kurzrock, Razelle', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Lerner, Susan', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Albitar, Maher']","['Ferrajoli A', 'Keating MJ', 'Manshouri T', 'Giles FJ', 'Dey A', 'Estrov Z', 'Koller CA', 'Kurzrock R', 'Thomas DA', 'Faderl S', 'Lerner S', ""O'Brien S"", 'Albitar M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

However, only a few studies specifically focused on children, and little information is available on the antileukemic effect of cGVHD and its impact on disease-free survival (DFS) in children. We retrospectively analyzed 696 children given allogeneic HSCT for malignant (n = 450) or nonmalignant (n = 246) diseases. The donor was an HLA-identical sibling in 461 cases and an alternative donor in 235. Bone marrow was the stem cell source in 647 cases, peripheral blood in 17, and cord blood (CB) in 32. cGVHD developed in 173 children (25%) at a median of 116 days after HSCT. Three-year cGVHD probability was 27%. In multivariate analysis, variables predicting cGVHD were donor and recipient age, grade II to IV acute GVHD, female donor for male recipient, diagnosis of malignancy, and use of total body irradiation; CB transplants had a very low risk of cGVHD (RR = 0.07, P =.0001). cGVHD occurrence increased transplant-related mortality (P <.05). Nevertheless, in hematologic malignancies, patients with cGVHD had a reduced relapse probability compared with children without cGVHD (16% +/- 3% versus 39% +/- 3%, P =.0001) and a better DFS (68% +/- 4% versus 54% +/- 3%, P =.01). The antileukemic effect of cGVHD was observed mainly in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study provides novel data on cGVHD in childhood. Use of CB stem cells and preparative regimens without radiotherapy may prevent its development. In patients affected by ALL, cGVHD was associated with a strong graft-versus-leukemia effect, improving DFS.","['Zecca, Marco', 'Prete, Arcangelo', 'Rondelli, Roberto', 'Lanino, Edoardo', 'Balduzzi, Adriana', 'Messina, Chiara', 'Fagioli, Franca', 'Porta, Fulvio', 'Favre, Claudio', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Locatelli, Franco']","['Zecca M', 'Prete A', 'Rondelli R', 'Lanino E', 'Balduzzi A', 'Messina C', 'Fagioli F', 'Porta F', 'Favre C', 'Pession A', 'Locatelli F']","['Oncoematologia Pediatrica, Universita di Pavia, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy. m.zecca@smatteo.pv.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematologic Diseases/mortality/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*Treatment Outcome']",2002/08/01 10:00,2002/09/13 10:01,['2002/08/01 10:00'],"['2002/08/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2001-11-0059 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59308-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Aug 15;100(4):1192-200. doi: 10.1182/blood-2001-11-0059.,,,,"['AIEOP-BMT Group.

However, the interaction between HTLV-1 and T cells in the pathogenesis of these diseases is poorly understood. Mouse cells have been reported to be resistant to cell-free HTLV-1 infection. However, we recently reported that HTLV-1 DNA could be observed 24 h after cell-free HTLV-1 infection of mouse cell lines. To understand HTLV-1 replication in these cells in detail, we concentrated the virus produced from c77 feline kidney cell line and established an efficient infection system. The amounts of adsorption of HTLV-1 are larger in mouse T cell lines, EL4 and RLm1, than those in human T cell lines, Molt4 and HUT78, and are similar to that in human kidney cell line, 293T. Unexpectedly, however, the amounts of entry of HTLV-1 are about 10-fold larger in the two mouse cell lines than those in the three human cell lines employed. Moreover, viral DNA was detectable from 1 h in EL4 and RLm1 cells, but only from 2 - 3 h in 293T, Molt4 and HUT78 cells. However, the amount of viral DNA in EL4 cells became smaller than that in Molt4 cells. HTLV-1 expression could be detected until day 1 - 2 in RLm1 and EL4 cells, and until day 4 in Molt4 cells. Our results suggest that mouse cell experiments would give useful information to dissect the early steps of cell-free HTLV-1 infection.","['Sun, Binlian', 'Nitta, Takayuki', 'Shoda, Momoko', 'Tanaka, Masakazu', 'Hanai, Shuji', 'Hoshino, Hiroo', 'Miwa, Masanao']","['Sun B', 'Nitta T', 'Shoda M', 'Tanaka M', 'Hanai S', 'Hoshino H', 'Miwa M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Oncology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan. m-miwa@md.tsukuba.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Cell-Free System', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Time Factors']",2002/08/01 10:00,2003/08/23 05:00,['2002/08/01 10:00'],"['2002/08/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/23 05:00 [medline]', '2002/08/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2002.tb01317.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2002 Jul;93(7):760-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2002.tb01317.x.,,,,,PMC5927073,,,,,['Jpn J Cancer Res. 2002 Aug;93(8):952'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Timed sequential chemotherapy using the topoisomerase I-inhibitor topotecan before the topoisomerase II-inhibitors, etoposide+mitoxantrone (T-EM) treatment is proposed to induce topoisomerase II protein levels and potentiate the cytotoxic activity of the topoisomerase II-directed drugs. Fourteen patients had refractory and three had recurrent acute leukemia. The majority of patients were heavily pre-treated with greater than three re-induction chemotherapy regimens. Ten patients responded to T-EM treatment (59%). Four of seventeen (24%) had a complete remission and one had a partial remission. Four additional patients (24%) who scored complete leukemia clearance had no evidence of disease with complete white and red blood cell recovery but with platelet counts less than 100,000. The lack of platelet recovery in one patient having a partial response was scored as a partial leukemia clearance. The toxicity profile included major non-hematological toxicity including grade 3 mucositis (29%) and neutropenic fever (65%). Paired measurements of intracellular levels of topoisomerase II isoforms alpha and beta in leukemia blast cells (bone marrow) collected before (day 0) and after topotecan treatment (day 4) showed that a relative increase of topoisomerase IIalpha (Topo IIalpha) > or = 40% strongly correlated with response after T-EM treatment. Increased Topo IIalpha levels also corresponded to increased DNA fragmentation. Two patients who had an increase of Topo IIalpha of 20-25% had either a PR or PLC while patients with a < 10% increase showed no response to T-EM treatment. We conclude that timed sequential chemotherapy using topotecan followed by etoposide+mitoxantrone is an effective regimen for patients with refractory acute leukemia, and demonstrate Topo IIalpha protein level increases after topotecan treatment.","['Mainwaring, M G', 'Rimsza, L M', 'Chen, S F', 'Gomez, S P', 'Weeks, F W', 'Reddy, V', 'Lynch, J', 'May, W S', 'Kahn, S', 'Moreb, J', 'Leather, H', 'Braylan, R', 'Rowe, T C', 'Fieniewicz, K J', 'Wingard, J R']","['Mainwaring MG', 'Rimsza LM', 'Chen SF', 'Gomez SP', 'Weeks FW', 'Reddy V', 'Lynch J', 'May WS', 'Kahn S', 'Moreb J', 'Leather H', 'Braylan R', 'Rowe TC', 'Fieniewicz KJ', 'Wingard JR']","['University of Florida College of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Gainesville, USA. mark.mainwaring@med.va.gov']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*analysis/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Topotecan/administration & dosage']",2002/08/01 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/01 10:00'],"['2002/08/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290021339 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 May;43(5):989-99. doi: 10.1080/10428190290021339.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only a small number of shared antigens expressed by CML cells have been identified as potential targets for T cell-mediated immune responses which might be exploited for immunotherapy. It may be that unique antigens expressed by individual tumours are more potent rejection antigens if the patient's own T cells could be encouraged to react against them. Work is reviewed here which documents that in vitro mixed cultures between autologous T cells and dendritic cells of chronic-phase CML patients can give rise to sensitised T cells capable of recognising the patient's tumour cells. Additionally, mixed autologous tumour cell/lymphocyte cultures, modified by the addition of cytokine cocktails, may also result in the generation of similarly sensitised T cells. These results could be exploited for adoptive immunotherapy, and possibly, after identification of the antigens recognised, also for active immunotherapy, i.e. including therapeutic vaccination.","['Muller, Ludmila', 'Pawelec, Graham']","['Muller L', 'Pawelec G']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, University of Tubingen Medical School, Germany. ludmila.mueller@uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cytokines)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/physiology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Dendritic Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2002/08/01 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/01 10:00'],"['2002/08/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290021687 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 May;43(5):943-51. doi: 10.1080/10428190290021687.,,,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All-trans-retinoic acid therapy induces complete clinical remissions (CRs) in most of patients with APL. However, chronic daily oral administration of ATRA results in accelerated metabolism of ATRA, leading to a progressive decline in plasma drug concentrations. These lower drug levels are associated with relapses and resistance to oral ATRA in patients with APL; thus the use of ATRA as a single agent is precluded. Liposomal ATRA (Lipo-ATRA) was designed to maintain high and stable plasma concentrations and to further improve the outcome of the APL disease by overcoming the development of ATRA resistance. Liposomal ATRA was shown to circumvent accelerated drug metabolism in the liver of rats in an animal model. In a phase I clinical study, intravenous (i.v.) administration of lipo-ATRA was shown to produce a significantly better pharmacokinetic profile than oral ATRA (non-liposomal) and to maintain higher and sustained plasma drug concentrations, with a similar side effects. More importantly, lipo-ATRA as a single agent induces PCR-negative molecular remissions in a high proportion of newly diagnosed patients with APL and maintain remissions up to 15-17 months or longer. In this review, we discuss the pharmacological features of lipo-ATRA and the molecular remissions induced by lipo-ATRA in newly diagnosed patients with APL or patients previously treated with ATRA or chemotherapy, and the possible impact of lipo-ATRA on the outcome of APL.","['Ozpolat, B', 'Lopez-Berestein, G']","['Ozpolat B', 'Lopez-Berestein G']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, The University of Texas M.

Activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and cleavage of poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were observed during As2O3 treatment. Furthermore, prior exposure to a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor blocked As2O3-induced apoptosis but not G1 phase accumulation.

Tryptases (alpha- and beta-type) are lineage-restricted serine proteases primarily expressed in mast cells (MC). We have analyzed expression of tryptase in 89 de novo MDS patients (refractory anemia (RA), n = 30; RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), n = 21; RA with excess of blasts (RAEB/RAEB-t), n = 27; chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), n = 11). Serum levels of total tryptase (alpha - protryptase + beta - tryptase) were measured by FIA. The numbers of tryptase+ cells were determined in paraffin-embedded bone marrow (bm) sections by immunohistochemistry and morphometry. In healthy individuals, serum total tryptase levels ranged between < 1 and 15 ng/ml (5.6 +/- 2.8 ng/ml). Tryptase levels of > 20 ng/ml were detected in 5/22 patients with RA (22.7%), 4/17 with RARS (23.5%), 0/16 with RAEB/RAEB-t, and 3/8 with CMML (37.5%). Thus, serum tryptase concentrations were higher in RA (16.6 +/- 14.3 ng/ml), RARS (12.9 +/- 8.2), and CMML (16.5 +/- 7.6) compared to RAEB/-t (8.7 +/- 3.8). By morphometry, elevated numbers of tryptase+ bm cells were detected in all MDS groups (RA: 139 +/- 131; RARS: 118 +/- 98; RAEB/RAEB-t: 80 +/- 79; CMML: 105 +/- 114 cells/mm2) compared to controls (54 +/- 51 cells/mm2). As assessed by Northern blotting and protein analysis, bm cells in MDS primarily produced alpha-(pro)tryptase, but little or no beta-tryptase. Together, our data show that elevated levels of tryptase are detectable in a group of patients with MDS probably because of an increase in neoplastic (mast) cells producing the enzyme(s). In addition, serum tryptase levels appear to correlate with MDS variants. Follow up studies should clarify whether an elevated tryptase concentration in MDS is of prognostic significance.","['Sperr, W R', 'Stehberger, B', 'Wimazal, F', 'Baghestanian, M', 'Schwartz, L B', 'Kundi, M', 'Semper, H', 'Jordan, J H', 'Chott, A', 'Drach, J', 'Jager, U', 'Geissler, K', 'Greschniok, A', 'Horny, H P', 'Lechner, K', 'Valent, P']","['Sperr WR', 'Stehberger B', 'Wimazal F', 'Baghestanian M', 'Schwartz LB', 'Kundi M', 'Semper H', 'Jordan JH', 'Chott A', 'Drach J', 'Jager U', 'Geissler K', 'Greschniok A', 'Horny HP', 'Lechner K', 'Valent P']",['wolfgang.r.sperr@univie.ac.at'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*enzymology/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*blood/genetics', 'Trisomy', 'Tryptases']",2002/08/01 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/01 10:00'],"['2002/08/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290021470 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 May;43(5):1097-105. doi: 10.1080/10428190290021470.,"['AI20487/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AR45441/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HCQ had marked selective cytotoxicity when compared with normal blood mononuclear cells, in which the LC50 was >100 microg/ml at 24 h.

Although NHLs carrying a t(14;18) typically begin as low-grade, follicular lymphomas, they have a tendency towards transformation to more aggressive disease, something that is accompanied, presumably caused, by the acquisition of secondary chromosomal changes. One such common change is add(1)(p36), in which material of unknown origin is added to the tip of the short arm of chromosome 1. We used multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH), a new FISH-based screening technique, to better characterize the rearrangement. Whenever doubt persisted after M-FISH, hybridization with chromosome-specific probes was also performed.

To further elucidate the importance of phenoxyacetic acids and other pesticides in the etiology of NHL a pooled analysis was performed on two case-control studies, one on NHL and another on hairy cell leukemia (HCL), a rare subtype of NHL. The studies were population based with cases identified from cancer registry and controls from population registry. Data assessment was ascertained by questionnaires supplemented over the telephone by specially trained interviewers. The pooled analysis of NHL and HCL was based on 515 cases and 1141 controls. Increased risks in univariate analysis were found for subjects exposed to herbicides (OR 1.75, CI 95% 1.26-2.42), insecticides (OR 1.43, CI 95% 1.08-1.87), fungicides (OR 3.11, CI 95% 1.56-6.27) and impregnating agents (OR 1.48, CI 95% 1.11-1.96).

This activation can be further enhanced by chemotherapy. The study comprised of 46 patients with AL, randomly divided into two groups. Twenty-three patients received prophylactic doses of nadroparin (Fraxiparine). Thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT), prothrombin fragment (F1 + 2), D-dimer (DD), plasmin-antiplasmin complexes (PAP) and antithrombin III (AT III) activity were determined in all patients. The tests were performed before treatment, and on the 3rd and 8th days of chemotherapy. The TAT, F1 + 2, DD and PAP concentrations were found to be elevated in 83% of patients already at the time of diagnosis. No significant difference between either groups test results was noted when either tested before treatment or on the third day of therapy. DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) syndrome appeared in two patients receiving heparin prophylaxis and in three patients to whom this treatment was not administered. The concentrations of activation markers on the eighth day of chemotherapy were lower than at the beginning of treatment in most of the patients receiving nadroparin. At this time there were no laboratory signs of DIC in any of the patients receiving heparin prophylaxis. IN CONCLUSION: although the application of prophylactic doses of nadroparin does not prevent DIC syndrome during first days of chemotherapy, it may limit the intravascular activation of the coagulation system during later chemotherapy.","['Chojnowski, Krzysztof', 'Trelinski, Jacek', 'Wawrzyniak, Ewa', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Chojnowski K', 'Trelinski J', 'Wawrzyniak E', 'Robak T']","['Department of Hematology, Institute of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, Poland. krzycho17@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Nadroparin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anticoagulants/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Coagulation/*drug effects', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy', 'Nadroparin/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies']",2002/08/01 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/01 10:00'],"['2002/08/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190290022164 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 May;43(5):1021-8. doi: 10.1080/10428190290022164.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presented study is the first, which investigated the frequencies of DNA-typed alleles of all relevant human leukocyte antigens (HLA) loci in CLL patients with regard to gender and age at disease onset. The most remarkable result was the higher frequency of homozygosity for MHC class II loci in female patients. Particularly, an increased frequency of overall homozygosity for the DRB3/4/5 loci was observed in female patients compared to gender matched controls (RR = 2.8) and male patients. The previously demonstrated association of DQB1 homozygosity with CLL in general was found to be specific for female patients (RR = 4.4). Considering the lack of an a priori hypothesis which made it virtually impossible to obtain statistical significance it was not unexpected that none of the observed differences remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons. However, these results suggest a recessive, gender-specific susceptibility factor for CLL within or in vicinity of the human MHC class II region and should serve as an a priori hypothesis for future studies focusing on these gene loci. Furthermore, an increased frequency for HLA-Cw*06 was seen in patients with an early onset age (RR = 2.7) but lost significance after correction for multiple comparisons. The previously reported association of HLA-DRB4*0103 with CLL in general was observed in all groups irrespective of gender and age.

As a consequence, the fused cells could undergo neoplastic transformation. In order to give an experimental support to such an hypothesis, mononuclear cells and granulocytes were isolated from the white blood cells of the same individual, mixed (at 1/1 ratio) and fused, using polyethylen glycol (PEG). The fused cells were then cultured into a suitable medium, supplemented with phytohemoagglutinin (PHE), a lectin which is able to stimulate at least one of the nuclei. Samples from these cultures were withdrawn at progressive time-intervals and stained with May Grumwald-Giemsa.

The pancreatic location and recurrence, aside from any context of malignant hemopathy, are exceptional. OBSERVATION: A 31-year-old woman developed an isolated and recurrent granulocyte sarcoma of the pancreas, without any context of a malignant hemopathy. The diagnosis retained on extemporaneous examination was an adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, because of the non-specific necrotic nature of the tumor. The immuno-histochemical exploration corrected the diagnosis. Despite local surgery, an isolated tumor recurred 6 months later. This relapse was treated with radiotherapy followed by heavy chemotherapy, identical to that applied in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Ten months later, remission was stable and complete.

Suppression of p33(ING1b) expression is associated with the loss of cellular growth control and immortalisation, whereas its overexpression causes cell cycle arrest. Moreover, normal p33(ING1b) expression is essential for optimal function of p53. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy of childhood, accounting for one third of all childhood malignancies. A variety of cytogenetic abnormalities have been described but there is no single abnormality common to all cases. Deregulation of the TP53 pathway is a common genetic abnormality in human malignancies. However, TP53 mutations are uncommon in ALL. It is possible that alternative mechanisms of regulation of the TP53 apoptosis pathway, such as modulation of p33(ING1b) expression, may be important in ALL. The aim of this study was to assess the expression of p33(ING1b) in childhood ALL. METHODS: One hundred and forty five patients with childhood ALL were investigated in this immunohistochemical study of the expression of p33(ING1b). RESULTS: Loss of nuclear expression of p33(ING1b) was seen in 78% of cases. This was associated with increased cytoplasmic expression of the protein. Kaplan Meier survival analysis demonstrated a trend towards a better prognosis for patients with tumours that had lost nuclear p33(ING1b). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the loss of nuclear p33(ING1b) expression may be an important molecular event in the pathogenesis of childhood ALL.","['Nouman, G S', 'Anderson, J J', 'Wood, K M', 'Lunec, J', 'Hall, A G', 'Reid, M M', 'Angus, B']","['Nouman GS', 'Anderson JJ', 'Wood KM', 'Lunec J', 'Hall AG', 'Reid MM', 'Angus B']","['Pathology Department, Royal Victoria Infirmary, University of Newcastle, Queens Victoria Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 4PH, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ING1 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Growth Protein 1)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Inhibitor of Growth Protein 1', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/07/31 10:00,2002/09/24 06:00,['2002/07/31 10:00'],"['2002/07/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2002/07/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.55.8.596 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2002 Aug;55(8):596-601. doi: 10.1136/jcp.55.8.596.,,,,,PMC1769716,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper describes a series from a population based study of 24 patients with L3 ALL presenting over 17 years. METHODS: Clinical data were collected prospectively from all adult patients presenting with acute leukaemia in the Northern region since 1982. Data from all patients diagnosed with FAB type L3 ALL were analysed. RESULTS: Overall, L3 ALL accounts for 8.6% of all adult ALL and it is more common in the elderly than has hitherto been recognised. In addition to classic Burkitt-type translocations (11 of 24 cases), the t(14;18) translocation, which is characteristically found in lower grade lymphomas such as follicular lymphoma, is frequently present (five of 24 cases). CONCLUSION: The presence of L3 ALL is often associated with non-Burkitt-type translocations and the presence of a t(14;18) translocation may indicate that in some cases a clinically non-apparent lymphoproliferative disorder, such as a low grade follicular lymphoma, has transformed to a more aggressive form and, thus, presents as a de novo acute leukaemia.","['Velangi, M R', 'Reid, M M', 'Bown, N', 'Jackson, G H', 'Summerfield, G P', 'Proctor, S J', 'Taylor, P R A']","['Velangi MR', 'Reid MM', 'Bown N', 'Jackson GH', 'Summerfield GP', 'Proctor SJ', 'Taylor PR']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4LP, UK.

Trimidox (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzamidoxime) was identified as a potent inhibitor of this enzyme and was shown to significantly decrease deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) pools in HL-60 leukemia cells. We now investigated the ability of trimidox to increase the antitumor effect of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl cytosine (Ara-C). Ara-C is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase, which is subject to negative allosteric regulation by dCTP. Therefore, a decrease of dCTP may cause increased Ara-C phosphorylation and enhanced incorporation of Ara-C into DNA. Ara-C incorporation indeed increased 1.51- and 1.89-fold after preincubation with 75 and 100 microM trimidox, respectively. This was due to the significantly increased 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl cytosine triphosphate pools (1.9- and 2.5-fold) after preincubation with trimidox. We also investigated the effects of a combination of trimidox and Ara-C on the colony formation of HL-60 cells. A synergistic potentiation of the effect of Ara-C could be observed, when trimidox was added. Trimidox, which decreases intracellular deoxynucleoside triphosphate concentrations thus leading to apoptosis, enhanced the induction of apoptosis caused by Ara-C. We conclude, that trimidox is capable of synergistically enhancing the effects of Ara-C and therefore this drug combination might be further tested in animals.","['Fritzer-Szekeres, Monika', 'Salamon, Alexandra', 'Grusch, Michael', 'Horvath, Zsuzsanna', 'Hochtl, Thomas', 'Steinbrugger, Richard', 'Jager, Walter', 'Krupitza, Georg', 'Elford, Howard L', 'Szekeres, Thomas']","['Fritzer-Szekeres M', 'Salamon A', 'Grusch M', 'Horvath Z', 'Hochtl T', 'Steinbrugger R', 'Jager W', 'Krupitza G', 'Elford HL', 'Szekeres T']","['Clinical Institute for Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, General Hospital of Vienna, Medical School, University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzamidoxime)', '0 (Benzamidines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Benzamidines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2002/07/31 10:00,2002/09/06 10:01,['2002/07/31 10:00'],"['2002/07/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295202011863 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01186-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2002 Aug 1;64(3):481-5. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01186-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence based on mice lacking the SHIP2 gene has demonstrated its predominant role in the control of insulin sensitivity. However, SHIP2 expression in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells suggests additional functions. SHIP2 was previously identified in chronic myelogenous progenitor cells, in which its constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation was reported by Wisniewski et al., [Blood 93 (1999) 2707-2720]. Here, we further investigated the function of SHIP2 in this hematopoietic and malignant context. A detailed analysis of the substrate specificity of SHIP2 indicated that this phosphatase is primarily directed towards PI(3,4,5)P(3) both in vitro and in K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells. The SHIP2-mediated decrease in PI(3,4,5)P(3) levels and increase in phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P(2)) was accompanied by a reduction of cell proliferation, characterized by an accumulation of the cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Thus, in addition to its role in the control of insulin sensitivity, SHIP2 may also play a role in cell proliferation, at least in chronic myelogenous progenitor cells.","['Giuriato, Sylvie', 'Blero, Daniel', 'Robaye, Bernard', 'Bruyns, Catherine', 'Payrastre, Bernard', 'Erneux, Christophe']","['Giuriato S', 'Blero D', 'Robaye B', 'Bruyns C', 'Payrastre B', 'Erneux C']","['Interdisciplinary Research Institute (IRIBHN), Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Campus Erasme, 808 Route de Lennik, 1070, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPPL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Division', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Substrate Specificity']",2002/07/31 10:00,2002/09/07 10:01,['2002/07/31 10:00'],"['2002/07/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X02007878 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(02)00787-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2002 Aug 9;296(1):106-10. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(02)00787-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For more than 20 years in our laboratory, a differential agglutination method using the coil planet centrifuge and polyclonal anti-A or anti-B has been used. However, it is now difficult to obtain polyclonal antisera, and it is unknown whether MoAbs can take the place of polyclonal antisera in the coil planet centrifuge method. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Polyclonal antisera and MoAbs were filled into a coil first and then unsensitized packed RBCs from ABO variants, and from chimeras and patients after ABO-incompatible HPC trans- plantation (HPCT) were loaded. After centrifugation, agglutinated and nonagglutinated RBCs were collected, hemolyzed, and subjected to colorimetric analysis for quantitation. RESULTS: ABO chimerism was quantitatively estimated with detection as low as 0.1 percent. ABO variants showed different patterns of agglutination and nonagglutination. The reconstitution status of the erythroid lineage after ABO-mismatched HPCT was also quantitatively evaluated. CONCLUSION: A modified coil planet centrifuge method is established by which ABO chimerism could quantitatively be analyzed and ABO variants identified to the same degree of accuracy as the other differential methods and flow cytometry.

STUDY DESIGN: Samples were from seven cases of serum anti-ATL antibody (ATLA)-positive T-cell lymphoma and three from ATLA-negative T-cell lymphoma. Six of the seven ATLA-positive cases were confirmed to be ATLL by Southern blotting. From the seventh case a fresh sample for blotting could not obtained. DNA was extracted from the cytologic smear slides of all 10 cases; they had been stained with Papanicolaou or May-Giemsa stain, digested with proteinase K and precipitated with phenol and ethanol. The target sequence in the pX region of the HTLV-I gene was amplified by PCR. RESULTS: All seven ATLA-positive cases, including one that had not yet been confirmed by Southern blotting, showed a single band, as predicted, while the three ATLA-negative cases showed no band. CONCLUSION: If cytologic smear slides are available but a fresh sample is not, the PCR method should provide evidence that the virus is present since in our study sufficient DNA templates were successfully extracted from the stained cytologic smear slides for detection of the virus.","['Kashima, Kenji', 'Nagahama, Junji', 'Sato, Keiji', 'Tanamachi, Hiroyuki', 'Gamachi, Ayako', 'Daa, Tsutomu', 'Nakayama, Iwao', 'Yokoyama, Shigeo']","['Kashima K', 'Nagahama J', 'Sato K', 'Tanamachi H', 'Gamachi A', 'Daa T', 'Nakayama I', 'Yokoyama S']","['Department of Pathology, Oita Medical University Hospital, First Department of Pathology, Oita Medical University, Oita, Japan. kkashima@oita-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Biopsy, Needle', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis/isolation & purification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/07/31 10:00,2002/08/17 10:01,['2002/07/31 10:00'],"['2002/07/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000326980 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Cytol. 2002 Jul-Aug;46(4):709-12. doi: 10.1159/000326980.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrations of receptor type tyrosine kinases are known to arise from FLT3 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, and c-Kit mutations in mast cell tumors. BCR/ABL found in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a hallmark of the constitutively active forms of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Downstream of the tyrosine kinase is the RAS GTP-binding protein, and genetic mutations related to this protein have been found in a wide variety of malignant tumors including hematopoietic tumors. In the nucleus, transcription factor-encoding genes are frequently detected as the targets of chromosomal translocations found in specific types of leukemias. For instance, the AML1 gene generates AML1/MTG8 chimera by t (8;21) translocation in AML (M2), AML1/EVI-1 chimera by t (3;21) translocation in blastic crisis of CML, and TEL/AML1 chimera in t (12;21) translocation (pre-B cell type acute lymphoblastic leukemia). Another example of abnormal transcription factors is PML/RAR alpha generated by t (15;17) translocation found in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Mutations or deletions of tumor suppressor genes are frequently found in cell cycle regulators such as p53, RB and p16 genes. Therefore, mutations of any molecules involved in the signal transduction pathways from growth factor receptors to inside the nucleus are thought to contribute to neoplastic transformation of hematopoietic cells.","['Mitani, Kinuko']",['Mitani K'],"['Dept. of Hematology, Dokkyo University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

We describe the establishment of the new continuous leukemia cell line MUTZ-8 from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML): MUTZ-8 was derived from the peripheral blood of a 63-year-old woman with AML M4 (25 years after onset of myelodysplastic syndromes, MDS). DNA fingerprinting confirmed authenticity and derivation of the cell line. The immunoprofiling as determined by flow cytometry showed that MUTZ-8 is positive mainly for myeloid but also some monocytic and megakaryocytic markers, whereas it is negative for T cell, B cell and erythroid markers. The cell line is constitutively cytokine-dependent, proliferation requiring externally added cytokines. The cytokine response profiles showed a two- to 10-fold growth stimulation of the cells by various cytokines, whereas other cytokines led to growth inhibition. Cytogenetic analysis confirmed the common clonal derivation of the cell line and the malignant clone predominating at the times of sampling. MUTZ-8 displays a deletion of the 5q31 AML/MDS region effected by a non-reciprocal translocation, t(5;11)(q21;q10). The scientific utility of MUTZ-8 lies (1) in its cluster of pathognomonic cytogenetic alterations including a 5q31 breakpoint and (2) in its absolute cytokine dependency and proliferative response to various cytokines.","['Hu, Z-B', 'MacLeod, R A F', 'Meyer, C', 'Quentmeier, H', 'Drexler, H G']","['Hu ZB', 'MacLeod RA', 'Meyer C', 'Quentmeier H', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)']",IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Clone Cells/chemistry/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/08/20 10:01,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2001/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402601 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Aug;16(8):1556-61. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402601.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined RB1/centromere 17 copy number by fluorescent in situ hybridisation, and pRB expression/phosphorylation by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunoblotting (IB) in 66 cases of B cell NHL. Thirteen cases had lost one RB1 copy relative to centromere 17 copy number and total DNA content. Case 458/88 had no RB1 copies. pRB levels were heterogeneous as assessed by IB (0.04-1.12 relative units), but all tumours, except for case 458/88, expressed pRB localised to the nucleus in >75% of the tumour cells by IHC. The fraction of phosphorylated pRB was correlated with pRB expression (r(2)= 0.56, P < 0.001). The 14 cases with loss of RB1 had lower pRB expression (median 0.25) than those without (median 0.48, P < 0.001), but a correlation with S phase fraction (r(2) = 0.43, P < 0.001; previously published data for tumour-specific S phase and apoptotic fractions) indicated that the variation in pRB expression was due to differences in proliferative activity. Furthermore, the regression lines for pRB expression vs S phase fraction were not different for the cases with or without loss of one RB1 copy (P = 0.5). Cases 154/88 (one RB1 copy) and 258/88 (two RB1 copies), in addition to case 458/88, had low expression of (hypophosphorylated) pRB (0.04, 0.08 and 0.04), despite their high S phase fractions (21%, 17% and 21%). There was no association between pRB expression/RB1 copy number and apoptotic fraction. Neither pRB expression nor loss of RB1 had prognostic value, but cases 154/88, 258/88, and 458/88 had short survival times (5, 3 and 46 months, respectively) compared to the others (median survival: 44 months, P = 0.03).

We applied a NOD/SCID mouse fetal thymus organ culture (FTOC) for leukemic cells from fresh (one case) and frozen (seven cases) bone marrow (BM) samples of children with T-ALL. Cell growth was observed in all seven samples in the culture, reaching a proliferational peak at 4 weeks, and it was calculated that the proliferation potential was 212-to 319-fold. The FTOC-derived T-ALL cells showed similarity to the original cells morphologically and immunophenotypically, still possessed clonalities and were able to regenerate overt leukemia in NOD/SCID mice. These FTOC-derived T-ALL cells differed from ordinary cell lines because they always need FTOC support. Thus, we established a new in vitro culture for T-ALL cells. A comparison of the original and FTOC-derived T-ALL cells revealed that the proportion of cells expressing IL-7R increased in all seven cases. Sorting and re-seeding of FTOC-derived IL-7R+ and IL-7R- cells into secondary FTOC resulted in a predominant generation of IL-7R+ cells from both fractions, while IL-7R- cells proliferated more potently than did IL-7R+ cells, suggesting that a pathway for the conversion of IL-7R- to IL-7R+ exists during the proliferation of T-ALL lymphoblasts. Addition of exogenous IL-7 or neutralization with anti-IL-7 antibody did not influence the growth pattern of T-ALL cells in FTOC. The current study provides a unique assay system for the exploration of the hierarchy within human T-lymphoid leukemic cells, and should facilitate the establishment of novel therapeutic modalities.","['Ma, F', 'Manabe, A', 'Wang, D', 'Ito, M', 'Kikuchi, A', 'Wada, M', 'Ito, M', 'Ohara, A', 'Hosoya, R', 'Asano, S', 'Tsuji, K']","['Ma F', 'Manabe A', 'Wang D', 'Ito M', 'Kikuchi A', 'Wada M', 'Ito M', 'Ohara A', 'Hosoya R', 'Asano S', 'Tsuji K']","['Division of Cellular Therapy, The Advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Organ Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/analysis', 'Thymus Gland/*embryology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/cytology']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/08/20 10:01,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2001/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2002/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402547 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Aug;16(8):1541-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402547.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a therapeutic approach, we previously reported that herbimycin A (HA) inhibited the growth of tandemly duplicated FLT3 (TDFLT3)-transformed cells (Leukemia 2000; 14: 374). Here, we have investigated the mechanism behind the cytotoxicity of HA, an ansamycin derivative which is now known to target Hsp90. The treatment with HA or another Hsp90 inhibitor, radicicol, induced selective apoptosis in TDFLT3-transformed 32D cells (TDFLT3/32D). The tyrosine-phosphorylation of TDFLT3 was inhibited by HA, whereas FLT3 ligand-induced phosphorylation of wild-type FLT3 (WtFLT3) was not. The downstream signal molecules MAPK, Akt and STAT5a were also dephosphorylated by HA in TDFLT3/32D. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that TDFLT3 but not WtFLT3 formed a complex with Hsp90, and that the HA treatment dissociated TDFLT3 from the Hsp90 chaperone complex. These findings imply that targeting of Hsp90 will facilitate the development of anti-TDFLT3 therapy, and that Hsp90 is closely involved in the oncogenic activation of FLT3.","['Minami, Y', 'Kiyoi, H', 'Yamamoto, Y', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Ueda, R', 'Saito, H', 'Naoe, T']","['Minami Y', 'Kiyoi H', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Yamamoto K', 'Ueda R', 'Saito H', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat5a protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'I60EH8GECX (monorden)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzoquinones', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Macrolides', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/08/20 10:01,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2001/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402558 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Aug;16(8):1535-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402558.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibitors of Flt3 tyrosine kinase activity are, therefore, of interest as potential therapeutic compounds.

Several bis(1H-2-indolyl)-1-methanone derivatives, represented by the compounds D-64406 and D-65476, are also potent inhibitors of Flt3. They inhibit proliferation of TEL-Flt3-transfected BA/F3 cells with IC(50) values of 0.2-0.3 microM in the absence of IL-3 but >10 microM in the presence of IL-3. Ligand-stimulated autophosphorylation of Flt3 in EOL-1 cells and corresponding downstream activation of Akt/PKB are effectively inhibited by bis(1H-2-indolyl)-1-methanones whereas autophosphorylation of c-Kit/SCF receptor or c-Fms/CSF-1 receptor is less sensitive or insensitive, respectively. Flt3 kinase purified by different methods is potently inhibited in vitro, demonstrating a direct mechanism of inhibition. 32D cells, expressing a constitutively active Flt3 variant with internal tandem duplication are greatly sensitized to radiation-induced apoptosis in the presence of D-64406 or D-65476 in the absence but not in the presence of IL-3.

A novel synthetic vitamin D(3)derivative, 22-oxa-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (OCT: oxacarcitriol) shows a more potent differentiation-inducing ability among myeloid leukemia cells in vitro with much lesser extent of the induction of hypercalcemia in vivo as compared to the effects of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3). In the present study, we focused on the effects of a combination of OCT plus VK2 on leukemia cells. Treatment of HL-60 cells with OCT for 72 h induces monocytic differentiation. A combination of OCT plus VK2 dramatically enhances monocytic differentiation as assessed by morphologic features, positivity for non-specific esterase staining, and cell surface antigen expressions. This combined effect far exceeds the maximum differentiation induction ability at the optimal concentrations of either OCT or VK2 alone. In addition, pronounced accumulation of the cells in the G0/G1 phase is observed by combined treatment with OCT plus VK2 as compared with each vitamin alone. In contrast to cell differentiation, caspase-3 activation and apoptosis induction in response to VK2 are significantly suppressed in the presence of OCT in HL-60 cells. These data suggest that monocytic differentiation and apoptosis induction of HL-60 cells are inversely regulated. Furthermore, pronounced induction of differentiation by combined treatment with VK2 plus OCT was also observed in four out of six cases of primary cultured acute myeloid leukemia cells in vitro, suggesting that VK2 plus OCT might be a potent combination for the differentiation-based therapy for acute myeloid leukemias.","['Funato, K', 'Miyazawa, K', 'Yaguchi, M', 'Gotoh, A', 'Ohyashiki, K']","['Funato K', 'Miyazawa K', 'Yaguchi M', 'Gotoh A', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine (Hematology/Oncology), Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '11032-49-8 (Vitamin K 2)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'N2UJM5NBF6 (maxacalcitol)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcitriol/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects', 'Vitamin K 2/*pharmacology']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/08/20 10:01,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2001/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402614 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Aug;16(8):1519-27. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402614.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A functional retroviral cDNA library-based screen was employed to identify genes that prevent growth factor withdrawal-mediated apoptosis in the myeloid progenitor cell 32Dcl3. This approach identified three classes of genes: those with known roles in apoptosis (bcl-X(L) and ornithine decarboxylase); genes previously identified but not linked directly to apoptotic signaling (O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase); and a previously uncharacterized gene we termed SPIN-2. In 32Dcl3 cells, expression of exogenous SPIN-2 provides 25% protection from apoptosis following growth factor withdrawal compared to controls which show approximately 1-2% survival. SPIN-2 overexpression slows cell growth rates and increases the percentage of cells in G(2)/M (32% vs control cells at 12%). Immunolocalization studies indicate that myc-epitope tagged SPIN-2 proteins, which retain their anti-apoptotic function, reside in the nucleus, whereas a C-terminal deletion mutant that loses its anti-apoptotic activity is located in the cytoplasm. These studies suggest that SPIN-2 is a novel nuclear protein that functions to regulate cell cycle progression and this activity is related to the inhibition of apoptosis following the removal of essential growth factors.","['Fletcher, B S', 'Dragstedt, C', 'Notterpek, L', 'Nolan, G P']","['Fletcher BS', 'Dragstedt C', 'Notterpek L', 'Nolan GP']","['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Florida, College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610-0267, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SPIN2A protein, human)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Cell Line/cytology/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Library', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells/cytology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'X Chromosome/genetics']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/08/20 10:01,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2001/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402557 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Aug;16(8):1507-18. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402557.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF356353'],,,,,,,,,

Angiogenesis is a possible therapeutic target in hematologic tumors. Thus, we addressed the possibility that 6-TG may also act as an anti-angiogenic molecule. 6-TG inhibited endothelial cell proliferation triggered by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and delayed the repair of a mechanically wounded endothelial cell monolayer. Also, 6-TG inhibited sprouting within fibrin gel, morphogenesis on Matrigel, and collagen gel invasion by endothelial cells. 2-Aminopurine was ineffective. In vivo, 6-TG inhibited basal, VEGF-induced, and FGF2-induced vascularization in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane and prevented neovascularization triggered by leukemia LIK cells or their conditioned medium. Finally, bone marrow vascularization in AML patients was decreased to control values in the early remission phase and persisted unvaried after 8-12 months of maintenance therapy with 6-TG. Thus, 6-TG inhibits different steps of the angiogenesis process in vitro and exerts a potent anti-angiogenic activity in vivo. Its anti-angiogenic activity, together with its antimetabolite activity towards tumor cells, may contribute to its action during maintenance therapy in AML.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CML patients cultured with IFN-alpha and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) developed a dendritic morphology. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated that the DCs harbored the bcr/abl translocation. The DCs prepared with IFN-alpha/GM-CSF expressed significantly higher levels of class I and II HLA than those grown in interleukin-4 (IL-4) and GM-CSF. The DCs prepared from newly diagnosed CML patients using IFN-alpha/GM-CSF expressed immunoregulatory proteins at levels comparable to normal DCs. In contrast, DCs cultured from CML patients who did not achieve a cytogenetic response to IFN-alpha expressed significantly lower levels of class I HLA, CD40, CD54, CD80 and CD86 than normal DCs. The expression of CD86 by CML DCs was enhanced when they were cultured with IFN-alpha/IL-4/GM-CSF, or when IFN-alpha/GM-CSF-treated cells were induced to mature by CD40 ligand. The DCs from IFN-alpha failures were less stimulatory than normal DCs in the allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction. CML patients who had a cytogenetic response to IFN-alpha initially had low numbers of bone marrow DCs that increased significantly with treatment, while nonresponders had more prevalent DCs at baseline that showed no consistent change with treatment. Therefore, IFN-alpha can induce DC differentiation from CML progenitor cells both in vitro and in vivo. The therapeutic activity of IFN-alpha in CML may be due to its ability to stimulate the generation of DCs that can present CML-specific antigens. Resistance to IFN-alpha may result when DC differentiation becomes impaired.","['Paquette, R L', 'Hsu, N', 'Said, J', 'Mohammed, M', 'Rao, N P', 'Shih, G', 'Schiller, G', 'Sawyers, C', 'Glaspy, J A']","['Paquette RL', 'Hsu N', 'Said J', 'Mohammed M', 'Rao NP', 'Shih G', 'Schiller G', 'Sawyers C', 'Glaspy JA']","['UCLA Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1678, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Blood Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'CD40 Ligand/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HLA Antigens/analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/08/20 10:01,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2001/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402602 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Aug;16(8):1484-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402602.,,['Leukemia. 2003 May;17(5):983-4; author reply 985.

The apoptotic rate was significantly higher in the patients with a F blast/F cell (Fb/Fc) ratio >or=5.0 than in those with a Fb/Fc ratio <1.0 (P < 0.01).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the incidence of phenotypic aberrations in a series of 467 consecutive leukemic B cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders through the comparison of the phenotypic characteristics of tumor vs normal peripheral blood (n = 10) and bone marrow (n = 10) B cells, in order to explore the applicability of this strategy for minimal residual disease monitoring. An additional goal of our study was to evaluate the sensitivity of multiparameter flow cytometry for the detection of minimal residual disease in leukemic B cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders through dilutional experiments (n = 19). From the patients analyzed 382 corresponded to B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (353 typical and 29 atypical); five to prolymphocytic leukemia; 13 to hairy cell leukemias; 12 to lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas; 14 to splenic marginal zone lymphomas; 22 were follicular lymphomas; and 19 mantle cell lymphomas. The following triple stainings were systematically applied to both normal and leukemic samples: FMC7/CD5/CD19, CD22/CD23/CD19, CD103/CD25/CD19, CD10/CD11c/CD19 and sIg/sIg(lambda)/CD19. Overall, 98% of the leukemic B cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders cases displayed aberrant phenotypes at diagnosis with no significant differences being found between cases analyzed in peripheral blood vs bone marrow samples. The most common types of aberrant criteria detected included asynchronous antigen expression (92%) and antigen over-expression (54%); abnormally light scatter characteristics were found in 17% of the cases. Most of the cases studied (90%) displayed four or more phenotypic aberrations. Once patients were divided according to the different diagnostic subgroups, the overall incidence of aberrant phenotypes ranged from 79 to 80% among atypical B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and prolymphocytic leukemia to 97% of follicular lymphoma and 100% of typical B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas, splenic marginal zone lymphomas and mantle cell lymphomas. Based on the aberrant phenotypes detected unique four-color stainings could be built for the specific identification of aberrant phenotypes. These include CD22/CD23/CD19/CD5 and sIg(kappa)/sIg(lambda)/CD19/CD5 for lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and prolymphocytic leukemia, CD103/CD25 or CD22/CD19/CD11c for hairy cell leukemia, FMC7/CD22/CD19/CD103 and sIg(kappa)/sIg(lambda)/CD22/CD19 for splenic marginal zone lymphomas, CD22/CD23/CD19/CD10 for follicular lymphomas and CD10/CD22/CD19/CD5 for mantle cell lymphomas. Serial dilutional experiments showed that the sensitivity level of immunophenotyping ranges between 10(-4) and 10(-5). In summary, the present study shows that immunophenotypic analysis allows the identification of aberrant phenotypes in 98% of leukemic B cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders and these phenotypes can be used for minimal residual disease monitoring with a sensitivity limit of 10(-4)-10(-5).","['Sanchez, M L', 'Almeida, J', 'Vidriales, B', 'Lopez-Berges, M C', 'Garcia-Marcos, M A', 'Moro, M J', 'Corrales, A', 'Calmuntia, M J', 'San Miguel, J F', 'Orfao, A']","['Sanchez ML', 'Almeida J', 'Vidriales B', 'Lopez-Berges MC', 'Garcia-Marcos MA', 'Moro MJ', 'Corrales A', 'Calmuntia MJ', 'San Miguel JF', 'Orfao A']","['Cancer Research Center, Department of Medicine and Service of Cytometry, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*pathology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clone Cells/chemistry/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Direct', 'Fluorescent Dyes/analysis', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/pathology', 'Nephelometry and Turbidimetry', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staining and Labeling/*methods']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/08/20 10:01,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2001/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402584 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Aug;16(8):1460-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402584.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe three patients with a well-characterized HCL in whom a CLL/SLL population was detected. Of note, these cases represent a significant proportion (11.5%; 95% CI: 0% to 24%) of the total number of HCL cases diagnosed in our institution during the same period of time. All three patients were treated with deoxycoformycin. They achieved a complete response of the HCL, whereas the CLL/SLL population persisted in all cases. The immunoglobulin gene rearrangement analysis, in two informative cases, suggested that the HCL and CLL/SLL populations arose from different B cell clones. This study indicates that the association of HCL and CLL/SLL might be much more frequent than previously recognized. Therefore, a large panel of monoclonal antibodies, including those necessary to detect CLL/SLL, should be employed when studying patients with HCL.","['Gine, E', 'Bosch, F', 'Villamor, N', 'Rozman, M', 'Colomer, D', 'Lopez-Guillermo, A', 'Campo, E', 'Montserrat, E']","['Gine E', 'Bosch F', 'Villamor N', 'Rozman M', 'Colomer D', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Campo E', 'Montserrat E']","[""Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/08/20 10:01,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2001/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402553 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Aug;16(8):1454-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402553.,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the exact Ig rearrangement patterns reflecting this process, especially those of the Ig light chain genes, are not well established. This requires detailed analysis of the gene configuration of all six IGH, IGK and IGL alleles at the single cell level. As such extensive analyses are difficult to perform in a reliable way within a single normal precursor-B cell, we used 169 precursor-B-ALL (ie six pro-B-ALL, 112 common ALL, and 51 pre-B-ALL) as clonal 'single cell' model system. The Ig gene recombinations show hierarchy starting with IGH gene rearrangements in all cases, followed by IGK rearrangements, IGK deletions and/or IGL rearrangements in 71% of cases. IGK deletions were found in the absence of IGL rearrangements in 34% of cases, which might be explained by the continuous recombinase activity in precursor-B-ALL, resulting in 'end-stage' IGK rearrangements, together with an apparently limited accessibility of the IGL locus. Remarkably, in 5% of cases IGL rearrangements took place in the absence of IGK rearrangements. In addition we found that in-frame IGH rearrangements are not necessarily required for the induction of Ig light chain gene rearrangements and that IGL rearrangements can be induced irrespective of the frame of the accompanying IGK rearrangements. In conclusion, precursor-B-ALL constitute a model system for studying Ig gene rearrangement processes without selection for functionality of the rearrangements or the influence of somatic hypermutations. Nevertheless, the hierarchy of IGH, IGK and IGL rearrrangements is apparent in precursor-B-ALL.","['van der Burg, M', 'Barendregt, B H', 'Szczepanski, T', 'van Wering, E R', 'Langerak, A W', 'van Dongen, J J M']","['van der Burg M', 'Barendregt BH', 'Szczepanski T', 'van Wering ER', 'Langerak AW', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Rotterdam/University Hospital Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/08/20 10:01,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2001/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402548 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Aug;16(8):1448-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402548.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transfection and enforced expression of BCRP in drug-sensitive cells confers resistance to mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, daunorubicin and topotecan. In this study the expression of BCRP gene was measured using TaqMan real-time PCR in 59 children with newly diagnosed AML. Nine patients were also analyzed in relapse. The median of BCRP gene expression was more than 10 times higher in patients who did not achieve remission after the first phase of chemotherapy (n = 24) as compared to patients who did achieve remission at this stage (n = 21; P = 0.012). In first relapse the expression of the BCRP gene was higher than at diagnosis (P = 0.038). Although high levels of BCRP gene expression were more frequent in subtypes of AML with a favorable prognosis, we found that within both risk groups (high and low risk), patients who expressed high levels of BCRP had a worse prognosis (P = 0.023). Our results strongly suggest that the expression of the BCRP gene reduces the response to chemotherapy in AML and that BCRP expression is higher at the time of relapse.","['Steinbach, D', 'Sell, W', 'Voigt, A', 'Hermann, J', 'Zintl, F', 'Sauerbrey, A']","['Steinbach D', 'Sell W', 'Voigt A', 'Hermann J', 'Zintl F', 'Sauerbrey A']","[""University Children's Hospital, Jena, Germany.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Computer Systems', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/08/20 10:01,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2001/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402541 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Aug;16(8):1443-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402541.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluated whether the traumatic BM samplings can be replaced by peripheral blood (PB) samplings. MRD levels were analyzed in follow-up samples of 62 children with precursor-B-ALL (532 paired BM-PB samples) and 22 children with T-ALL (149 paired BM-PB samples) using real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) analysis of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene rearrangements with sensitivities of 10(-3) to 10(-5) (one ALL cell in 10(3) to 10(5) normal cells). In 14 of the 22 T-ALL patients, detectable MRD levels were found in 67 paired BM-PB samples: in 47 pairs MRD was detected both in BM and PB, whereas in the remaining pairs very low MRD levels were detected in BM (n = 11) or PB (n = 9) only. The MRD levels in the paired BM-PB samples were very comparable and strongly correlated (r(s) = 0.849). Comparable results were obtained earlier by immunophenotyping in 26 T-ALL patients (321 paired BM-PB samples), which also showed a strong correlation between MRD levels in paired BM and PB samples (r(s) = 0.822). In 39 of the 62 precursor-B-ALL patients, MRD was detected in 107 BM-PB pairs: in 48 pairs MRD was detected in both BM and PB, in 47 pairs MRD was solely detected in BM (at variable levels), and in 12 pairs only the PB sample was MRD-positive at very low levels (</=10(-4)). Furthermore, in the 48 double-positive pairs, MRD levels in BM and PB varied enormously with MRD levels in BM being up to 1000 times higher than in the corresponding PB samples. Consequently, BM samples cannot easily be replaced by PB sampling for MRD analysis in childhood precursor-B-ALL, in line with their BM origin. In T-ALL, which are of thymic origin, BM sampling might be replaced by PB sampling, because the dissemination of T-ALL cells to BM and PB appears to be comparable.","['van der Velden, V H J', 'Jacobs, D C H', 'Wijkhuijs, A J M', 'Comans-Bitter, W M', 'Willemse, M J', 'Hahlen, K', 'Kamps, W A', 'van Wering, E R', 'van Dongen, J J M']","['van der Velden VH', 'Jacobs DC', 'Wijkhuijs AJ', 'Comans-Bitter WM', 'Willemse MJ', 'Hahlen K', 'Kamps WA', 'van Wering ER', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blood Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Computer Systems', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/genetics/*pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/genetics/*pathology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/08/20 10:01,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402636 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Aug;16(8):1432-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402636.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixteen percent of patients developing aGVHD relapsed as compared to 47% in those without aGVHD (P = 0.03) and also 10% of patients developing cGVHD relapsed as compared to 50% relapses in those without cGHVD (P = 0.03). Four patients (12%) died due to early (n = 1) and late (n = 3) transplant-related mortality. After a median follow-up of 15 months, 24 out of the 34 patients remain alive. Projected overall survival and disease-free survival at 3 years are 68% and 63%, respectively. Early chimerism analysis showed 67% of patients with complete chimerism (CC) in bone marrow (BM), 86% in peripheral blood (PB), 89% in granulocytes and 68% in T lymphocytes. On day +100, these figures were 68%, 79%, 90% and 73%, respectively, and on day +180 there were 83% patients with CC in BM, 100% in PB, 100% in granulocytes and 100% in T lymphocytes. We observed a trend to a higher incidence of relapse in patients with mixed chimerism (MC) as compared to patients with CC. MRD monitoring by flow cytometry and/or RT-PCR analysis was performed in 23 patients. MRD assessment on days +21 to +56 after transplant allowed identification of patients at risk of relapse. In this sense, seven out of 12 patients (58.3%) who had positive MRD on days +21 to +56 relapsed as compared to none out of 11 patients who had negative MRD (P = 0.002). Of the seven patients with criteria to monitor MRD who relapsed after transplant, all but one remained MRD positive until relapse. By contrast, 10 patients remained MRD negative and all of them are in continuous CR. In nine additional patients, persistence of MRD or mixed chimerism was observed after transplant and withdrawal of cyclosporin with or without DLI was performed. Only two out of these nine patients relapsed. MRD clearance was preceded by CC and GVHD. In conclusion, in our study we found that RIC allogeneic transplantation can be used in patients considered poor candidates for conventional transplantation due to advanced age or other concurrent medical conditions with both low toxicity and low transplant-related mortality. Simultaneous studies of both chimerism and MRD are a useful tool in order to predict risk of relapse in patients undergoing RIC transplants and so can be helpful for individualizing treatment strategies after transplant.","['Perez-Simon, J A', 'Caballero, D', 'Diez-Campelo, M', 'Lopez-Perez, R', 'Mateos, G', 'Canizo, C', 'Vazquez, L', 'Vidriales, B', 'Mateos, M V', 'Gonzalez, M', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Perez-Simon JA', 'Caballero D', 'Diez-Campelo M', 'Lopez-Perez R', 'Mateos G', 'Canizo C', 'Vazquez L', 'Vidriales B', 'Mateos MV', 'Gonzalez M', 'San Miguel JF']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/pathology/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Patient Selection', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous/pathology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/08/20 10:01,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402550 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Aug;16(8):1423-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402550.,,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various methods have been developed to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) after transplantation to identify patients at risk for relapse. Chimerism tests differentiate recipient and donor cells and are used to identify MRD when there are no other disease-specific markers. The detection of MRD does not always correlate with relapse risk. Chimerism testing may also identify normal hematopoietic cells or other cells not contributing to relapse. In this study we report our initial experience with a novel system that provides combined morphological and cytogenetical analysis on the same cells. This system allows rapid automatic scanning of a large number of cells, thus increasing the sensitivity of detection of small recipient population. The clinical significance of MRD detection is improved by identifying the morphology of recipient cells. Identification of recipient characteristics within blasts predicts overt relapse in leukemia patients and precedes it by a few weeks to months. Identification within mature hematopoietic cells may not be closely associated with relapse. The system also allows chimerism testing after sex-mismatched transplants, within cellular subsets, with no need for sorting of cells. The system merits further study in larger scale trials.","['Shimoni, A', 'Nagler, A', 'Kaplinsky, C', 'Reichart, M', 'Avigdor, A', 'Hardan, I', 'Yeshurun, M', 'Daniely, M', 'Zilberstein, Y', 'Amariglio, N', 'Brok-Simoni, F', 'Rechavi, G', 'Trakhtenbrot, L']","['Shimoni A', 'Nagler A', 'Kaplinsky C', 'Reichart M', 'Avigdor A', 'Hardan I', 'Yeshurun M', 'Daniely M', 'Zilberstein Y', 'Amariglio N', 'Brok-Simoni F', 'Rechavi G', 'Trakhtenbrot L']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Automation', 'Bone Marrow Examination/instrumentation/*methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/instrumentation/*methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/instrumentation/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous/pathology']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/08/20 10:01,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2001/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402581 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Aug;16(8):1413-8; discussion 1419-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402581.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disease progression and blast crisis CML is associated with characteristic non-random cytogenetic and molecular events. These can be viewed as increased oncogenic activity or loss of tumor suppressor activity. However, what causes transformation and disease progression to blast crisis is only poorly understood. This is in part due to the lack of a good in vivo model of chronic phase CML even though animal models developed over the last few years have started to provide insights into blast crisis development. Thus, additional in vitro and in vivo studies will be needed to provide a complete understanding of the contribution of BCR-ABL and other genes to disease progression and to improve therapeutic approaches for blast crisis CML.","['Shet, A S', 'Jahagirdar, B N', 'Verfaillie, C M']","['Shet AS', 'Jahagirdar BN', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Stem Cell Institute and Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Repair', 'Disease Progression', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/physiology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Animal', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Oncogenes', 'Signal Transduction']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/08/20 10:01,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2001/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2001/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402577 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Aug;16(8):1402-11. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402577.,,,174,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we found that the megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line CMK, established from a patient with Down's syndrome, expressed granulysin mRNA. CMK was positive for CD13 and CD41 and negative for CD56. CMK also expressed CD2 and CD7. However, no rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta-chain gene, an early marker of T-cell lineage, was found in CMK cells. Thus, CMK is assumed to originate from the clonal evolution at the immature cell level. The expression of granulysin in CMK cells suggests that granulysin is occasionally present in immature multilineage cells or may be characteristic of leukemic cells obtained from Down's syndrome patients.

Here we show that, upon FcepsilonRI engagement on RBL-2H3 cells Syk undergoes ubiquitination and Syk kinase activity is required for its own ubiquitination and that of FcepsilonRI beta and gamma chains. This requirement was demonstrated by overexpression of Syk wild-type or its kinase-dead mutant in RBL cells or using an Syk-deficient RBL-derived cell line transfected with wild-type or a kinase inactive form of Syk. We also identify c-Cbl as the E3 ligase responsible for both Syk and receptor ubiquitination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Syk controls tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk-associated Cbl induced after receptor engagement. These data suggest a mutual regulation between Syk and Cbl activities. Finally, we show that a selective inhibitor of proteasome degradation induces persistence of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor complexes, of activated Syk, and of FcepsilonRI-triggered degranulation. Our results provide a molecular mechanism for down-regulation of engaged receptor complexes by targeting ubiquitinated FcepsilonRI and activated Syk to the proteasome for degradation.","['Paolini, Rossella', 'Molfetta, Rosa', 'Beitz, Laurie O', 'Zhang, Juan', 'Scharenberg, Andrew M', 'Piccoli, Mario', 'Frati, Luigi', 'Siraganian, Reuben', 'Santoni, Angela']","['Paolini R', 'Molfetta R', 'Beitz LO', 'Zhang J', 'Scharenberg AM', 'Piccoli M', 'Frati L', 'Siraganian R', 'Santoni A']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Pathology, Institute Pasteur-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, University La Sapienza, Rome 00161, Italy. rosella.paolini@uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)', 'Y0900I3U8U (epoxomicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Enzyme Precursors/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Ligands', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Subunits', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Syk Kinase', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', '*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Vaccinia virus/genetics']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M204948200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)36402-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Oct 4;277(40):36940-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M204948200.

In this work, we identified potential binding partners for DRAL/FHL2 using an inducible yeast two-hybrid system. We present evidence of a functional interaction between the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) and DRAL/FHL2. PLZF is a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor whose function relies on recruitment of corepressors that form part of the histone deacetylase complex involved in chromatin remodeling. DRAL/FHL2 interacts specifically with PLZF in vitro and in vivo and augments transcriptional repression mediated by PLZF. This is the first reported incidence of a bona fide FHL protein-mediated corepression and supports the notion of these proteins having a role as coregulators of tissue-specific gene expression.","['McLoughlin, Patricia', 'Ehler, Elisabeth', 'Carlile, Graeme', 'Licht, Jonathan D', 'Schafer, Beat W']","['McLoughlin P', 'Ehler E', 'Carlile G', 'Licht JD', 'Schafer BW']","['Division of Clinical Chemistry and Biochemistry, Department of Pediatrics, University of Zurich, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FHL2 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (LIM-Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'LIM-Homeodomain Proteins', 'Muscle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Zinc Fingers']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M203336200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)36416-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Oct 4;277(40):37045-53. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M203336200.

However, the intracellular signal that regulates cytokine secretion in bone marrow stromal cells has not been determined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family in serum-induced secretion of LIF and IL-6 by bone marrow stromal cells. 2: Transformed human bone marrow stromal cells (HS-5) were stimulated with foetal calf serum (FCS) to produce LIF and IL-6. FCS also induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 MAPK and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK). 3: Both PD98059 (MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor) and SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) attenuated FCS-induced LIF protein production and gene expression. SB203580 decreased IL-6 production and gene expression, but PD98059 had no effect on IL-6 production and gene expression. 4: Expression of a dominant-negative mutant form of JNK1 that blocked FCS-induced JNK activity had no effect on protein production and gene expression of these cytokines. 5: These findings demonstrate that both ERK and p38 MAPK are involved in FCS-induced LIF secretion, whereas only p38 MAPK is important for IL-6 secretion, and that FCS-induced activation of JNK has no effect on the production of LIF and IL-6. We conclude that, in spite of their similar biological effects, they are differentially regulated at the level of MAPK activity in bone marrow stromal cells.","['Nakao, Takafumi', 'Kim, Shokei', 'Ohta, Kensuke', 'Kawano, Hitomi', 'Hino, Masayuki', 'Miura, Katsuyuki', 'Tatsumi, Noriyuki', 'Iwao, Hiroshi']","['Nakao T', 'Kim S', 'Ohta K', 'Kawano H', 'Hino M', 'Miura K', 'Tatsumi N', 'Iwao H']","['Department of Pharmacology, Osaka City University Medical School, 1-4-3 Asahimachi, Abeno-ku, Osaka 545-8585, Japan. nakao-t@med.osaka-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', '*Blood', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2002/07/30 10:00,2003/04/01 05:00,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/01 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjp.0704797 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2002 Aug;136(7):975-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0704797.,,,,,PMC1573426,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, spontaneous and polyclonal activation induced cytokine production in T cells were assessed by flow cytometry in patients with B-CLL. Patients with progressive disease had a significantly increased number of T cells spontaneously producing IL-2, IL-4 and GM-CSF as compared to healthy donors and patients with non-progressive CLL, which was not the case for TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma producing T cells. However, no difference in the frequency of T cells producing these cytokines was seen comparing patients with non-progressive disease to control donors. Polyclonal activation of B-CLL T cells in vitro induced an increased proportion of T cells producing these five cytokines in patients as well as in control donors, indicating that T cells in CLL patients might have a relatively well preserved functional capacity. However, the increase in GM-CSF, TNF-alpha and IL-4 producing T cells was more marked in CLL patients than in controls. Furthermore, following activation, a higher frequency of cytokine-producing T cells was noted in patients with progressive disease as compared to those with non-progressive disease. The augmented number of cytokine-producing T cells in CLL may indicate an up-regulated capability of T cells to secrete cytokines, especially in patients with progressive CLL. The increased production of the T cell derived cytokines GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, IL-4 and IL-2 is interesting, as these cytokines have previously been shown to support growth of B-CLL leukaemic cells in vitro and as T cells might specifically recognise the autologous leukaemic B cells in vivo. The findings may suggest a role for T cells in the pathogenesis of B-CLL.","['Rossmann, Eva D', 'Lewin, Nongnit', 'Jeddi-Tehrani, Mahmood', 'Osterborg, Anders', 'Mellstedt, Hakan']","['Rossmann ED', 'Lewin N', 'Jeddi-Tehrani M', 'Osterborg A', 'Mellstedt H']","['Immune and Gene Therapy Laboratory, Cancer Center Karolinska, Karolinska Hospital, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytokines/*analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Interleukin-4/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*chemistry/cytology/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['1o612 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.01612.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2002 May;68(5):299-306. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.01612.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Six newly diagnosed CML patients were subjected to leukapheresis, and the products were subfractionated with the use of CCE. nLP and all fractions were studied for the presence of CD34+ cells and a proportion of BCR-ABL fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)+ cells. RESULTS: CCE fractions with a high flow rate contained the highest proportion of CD34+ cells [mean (SEM) 6.89% (3.88)]. However, CD34+ cells present in low-rate CCE fractions showed a higher proportion of HLADR-[49.6% (13.5 in 70 mL min-1) and 21.5% (11.6 in 110 mL min-1)] than those in 170 mL min-1[3.2% (2.5)] and ""rotor off"" [3.4% (1.9)]. This was associated with lower proportions of BCR-ABL FISH+[8.1% (4.8) and 1.9 (1.7)] and smaller BCR-ABL to ABL transcript ratios [0.58 (17) and 0.26 (0.08) in 70 and 110 mL min-1] fractions as compared to 140 and 170 mL min-1 fractions [21.6% (5.2) and 31.6% (15.3) for BCR-ABL FISH+ cells and 0.75 (0.16) and 0.90 (0.24) for BCR-ABL/ABL]. Fractions with the lowest proportions of BCR-ABL-positive cells and the lowest BCR-ABL/ABL transcript ratios (110 mL min-1) contained from 1.3 x 106 to 82.7 x 106 (median: 3.97 x 106) CD34+ cells. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study we have shown that CCE may be used effectively to obtain nLP fractions enriched in normal hematopoietic progenitors.","['Dlubek, Dorota', 'Dybko, Jaroslaw', 'Wysoczanska, Barbara', 'Laba, Anna', 'Klimczak, Aleksandra', 'Kryczek, Ilona', 'Konopka, Lech', 'Lange, Andrzej']","['Dlubek D', 'Dybko J', 'Wysoczanska B', 'Laba A', 'Klimczak A', 'Kryczek I', 'Konopka L', 'Lange A']","['Lower Silesian Center for Cellular Transplantation, Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Science, Rudolf Weigl 12, 53-114 Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Centrifugation/methods', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukapheresis/*methods/standards', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Autologous/methods']",2002/07/30 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/07/30 10:00'],"['2002/07/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['1o682 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.01682.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2002 May;68(5):281-8. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.01682.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sensitivities of FISH to BCR-ABL positive samples determined by first-round (1st) RT-PCR, second-round (2nd) RT-PCR, and RQ-PCR were 64.2%, 25.8%, and 20.7%, respectively. The BCR-ABL/ABL ratio by RQ-PCR had a mean of 0.000 13 in the 1st RT-PCR-negative samples and 1.42 in the 1st RT-PCR-positive samples (P<0.001), and means of 0.000 39 and 0.51 in the 2nd RT-PCR-negative and -positive samples (P< 0.001). The mean ratios of BCR-ABL/ABL by RQ-PCR were significantly different in N/N (1st/2nd RT-PCR) or N/P and P/P (P<0.001), but not in N/N and N/P, which showed that the discriminative power of RQ-PCR is confined to the 1st RT-PCR level. In this respect, monitoring of the 1st RT-PCR might be useful for estimating normalized BCR-ABL levels after transplantation. Nested RT-PCR was of limited use, as RQ-PCR quantified the BCR-ABL transcripts in 60 (91%) of 66 samples determined to be negative by 2nd RT-PCR. FISH was significantly correlated with RQ-PCR in FISH-positive samples (n=24, r=0.79, P=0.001). An increase of FISH preceded that of RQ-PCR in a few cases with molecular relapse.

Age- and sex-matched healthy children with normal dentofacial development constituted the control material. The investigation data were based on measurements made on lateral skull radiographs taken at the start and, on average, 6 months after cessation of GH treatment. The control group comprised similar longitudinal cephalographic records. The results showed that GH therapy in patients who exhibited growth retardation after TBI and BMT had only a minor effect on cranial base dimensions, probably due to the fact that the development of this area is completed at a relatively early age. The effect of GH treatment on mandibular growth was very obvious. The dimensional increase of the mandibular variables in the patients was equivalent to, or in some cases even exceeded, that of the controls. In relation to basion, the mandibular condyles were displaced in a backward/upward direction in the patient group. Displacement in the opposite direction was recorded in the controls. It seems likely that the development seen in the patients is a reflection of a normalization of the condyle-fossa relationship made possible by enhanced condylar growth.

They both exhibit antiplasmodial activities but also show cytotoxic effects against human cancer cell lines. In order to elucidate their mechanism of action, we have investigated the interaction of the alkaloids with DNA and their capacity to inhibit nucleic acids and protein synthesis in the human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line. Cell treatment with both sungucine and isosungucine leads to the appearance of a hypo-diploid DNA content peak. Western blotting analysis reveals that the two alkaloids induce cleavage of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and promote the cleavage of a caspase-3 DEVD peptide substrate. The activation of the caspase cascade is accompanied with a fragmentation of DNA in cells, as revealed by the TUNEL assay. Altogether, the results shed light on the mechanism of action of these two plant alkaloids and identify signaling factors involved in (iso)sungucine-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells.","['Lansiaux, Amelie', 'Bailly, Christian', 'Houssier, Claude', 'Colson, Pierre', 'De Pauw-Gillet, Marie-Claire', 'Frederich, Michel', 'Tits, Monique', 'Angenot, Luc']","['Lansiaux A', 'Bailly C', 'Houssier C', 'Colson P', 'De Pauw-Gillet MC', 'Frederich M', 'Tits M', 'Angenot L']","['INSERM U-524 et Centre Oscar Lambret, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Planta Med,Planta medica,0066751,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Indole Alkaloids)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (isosungucine)', '73020-53-8 (sungucine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'H9Y79VD43J (Strychnine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Chromatin/drug effects', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indole Alkaloids/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Loganiaceae/*chemistry', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Strychnine']",2002/07/27 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/07/27 10:00'],"['2002/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2002-32889 [doi]'],ppublish,Planta Med. 2002 Jul;68(7):591-5. doi: 10.1055/s-2002-32889.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-five patients were studied by polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, sequencing, and immunodiffusion. RESULTS: During the period of observation, 8% (4/48) of B19-seronegative patients seroconverted and infection triggered profound anemia and thrombocytopenia. B19-specific IgG disappeared in 26% (8/31) of B19-seropositive patients, and these patients were significantly younger and the B19 IgG titers were lower on admission compared with patients who continuously displayed B19 IgG. B19 DNA was detected in the seroconverting patients, and this helped in determining the time of infection, which coincided with a B19 epidemic in 75% (3/4) of patients. Patients typically presented with fever and myalgia; a rash, indicative of B19 infection, was observed in only one patient. CONCLUSIONS: B19 infection was able to mimic a leukemic relapse or therapy-induced cytopenia and led to hospital admission, frequent blood sampling, renewed bone marrow aspirates, multiple transfusions of red blood cells or platelets, and cessation of maintenance chemotherapy for up to 3 weeks. The peculiar disappearance of B19-specific IgG, which could not be ascribed to a generalized low level of serum immunoglobulins, has not been previously reported. The results indicate that B19 should be assayed at diagnosis of leukemia to avoid subsequent diagnostic uncertainty, and during treatment in B19-seronegative patients exhibiting unexplained cytopenia.","['Heegaard, Erik D', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Heegaard ED', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Department of Clinical Microbiology, University State Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. e.heegaard@immi.ku.dk']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/*blood', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunodiffusion', 'Immunoglobulin G/*blood', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Parvoviridae Infections/diagnosis/*virology', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*virology', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies']",2002/07/27 10:00,2002/08/17 10:01,['2002/07/27 10:00'],"['2002/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200206000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Jun-Jul;24(5):368-73. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200206000-00009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors analyzed DNA samples from 12 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at diagnosis and after relapse using polymerase chain reaction and automatic sequencing to determine the presence of T-cell receptor gamma (TCRgamma) gene rearrangements. A clone-specific primer was synthesized based on the sequence obtained at diagnosis for each patient and at relapse for those with clonal evolution for the study of minimal residual disease. RESULTS: A change of the original clone was detected in 3 of 12 patients (25%), involving the same rearrangement detected at diagnosis, suggesting the development of subclones. Minimal residual disease was detected at the end of treatment or before the relapse in all patients who had maintained the same rearrangements detected at diagnosis. Minimal residual disease was investigated at the end of treatment in two of the three patients with clonal evolution and was not detected with the use of clone-specific primers. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that clonal evolution for TCRgamma gene rearrangements was not a rare event among children in Brazil and, when present, interfered with the detection of minimal residual disease.","['Scrideli, Carlos A', 'Kashima, Simone', 'Cipolloti, Rosana', 'Defavery, Ricardo', 'Tone, Luiz G']","['Scrideli CA', 'Kashima S', 'Cipolloti R', 'Defavery R', 'Tone LG']","['Department of Pediatrics and Puericulture, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Brazil', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor gamma/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/07/27 10:00,2002/08/17 10:01,['2002/07/27 10:00'],"['2002/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200206000-00008 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Jun-Jul;24(5):364-7. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200206000-00008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six hundred unrelated cord blood samples from 200 Chinese, Malay, and Indian healthy newborns were collected at the National University Hospital, Singapore; an additional 100 children with ALL were analyzed for five of the commonly reported TPMT variant alleles using polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction-based assays. In the cord blood study, the TPMT*3C variant was detected in all three ethnic groups; Chinese, Malays, and Indians had allele frequencies of 3%, 2.3%, and 0.8%, respectively. The TPMT*3A variant was found only among the Indians at a low allele frequency of 0.5%. The TPMT*6 variant was found in one Malay sample. Among the children with ALL, two white and one Chinese were heterozygous for the TPMT*3A variant and showed intermediate sensitivity to 6-mercaptopurine during maintenance therapy. Three Chinese patients and one Malay patient were heterozygous for the TPMT*3C variant. Mercaptopurine sensitivity could be validated in only one out of four TPMT*3C heterozygous patients. The overall allele frequency of the TPMT variants in this multiracial population was 2.5%. The TPMT*3C was the most common variant allele; TPMT*3A and TPMT*6 were rare. These results support the feasibility of performing TPMT genotyping in all children diagnosed with acute leukemia to minimize toxicity from thiopurine chemotherapy.","['Kham, S K Y', 'Tan, P L', 'Tay, A H N', 'Heng, C K', 'Yeoh, A E J', 'Quah, Thuan-Chong']","['Kham SK', 'Tan PL', 'Tay AH', 'Heng CK', 'Yeoh AE', 'Quah TC']","['Department of Pediatrics, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Child', 'China/ethnology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'India/ethnology', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Malaysia/ethnology', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/ethnology/*genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Singapore/epidemiology']",2002/07/27 10:00,2002/08/17 10:01,['2002/07/27 10:00'],"['2002/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200206000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Jun-Jul;24(5):353-9. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200206000-00006.,,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Jun-Jul;24(5):335-6.

The French-American-British (FAB) classification of adult forms of MDS is not always applicable because many pediatric patients do not fit into any of the categories. To circumvent the FAB schema and other flawed formats, the authors developed a practical classification system for childhood MDS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors analyzed 40 children with MDS diagnosed in Toronto between 1988 and 1998 to test the utility of the classification. Children were classified according to three main features: category, cytology, and cytogenetics. RESULTS: Using this system the authors were able to classify all 40 patients; about half could not be unclassified by FAB. Patients could also be longitudinally classified by serial analysis to show progression of disease. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia was excluded because of its known myeloproliferative pathogenesis. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, which almost never occurs in children, was also omitted. Also excluded were other chronic myeloproliferative disorders and any cytopenias without malignant potential. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these data, the CCC system appears to have prognostic potential; children with advanced class and cytogenetic abnormalities had a poorer outcome. The authors urge international adoption of this system for uniformity in clinical practice and reporting purposes.","['Mandel, Karen', 'Dror, Yigal', 'Poon, Annette', 'Freedman, Melvin H']","['Mandel K', 'Dror Y', 'Poon A', 'Freedman MH']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, Department of Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Neuroblastoma/pathology/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/07/27 10:00,2002/08/17 10:01,['2002/07/27 10:00'],"['2002/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200206000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Jun-Jul;24(5):343-52. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200206000-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Oct;24(7):596-605.

METHODS: A computerized retrieval system was used to identify patients with histologically proven leukemic or lymphomatous involvement of the LDS. Medical records were reviewed. RESULTS: Biopsies of the lacrimal sac or nasolacrimal duct obtained during dacryocystorhinostomies (DCR) performed at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota) between January 19, 1989, and August 26, 1997, were positive for leukemia or lymphoma in 11 patients (15 LDS). Ten patients had previously diagnosed leukemia or lymphoma; the interval between the diagnosis of systemic disease and DCR averaged 5.8 years (range, 7 months to 13 years; median, 5 years). The median age at the time of LDS involvement was 72 years (range, 49 to 85 years). Seven patients (64%) were women, and all were white. The median postoperative follow-up after DCR was 38 months (range, 10 to 65 months). Eight patients had leukemic infiltration of the LDS, 2 patients had B-cell lymphoma, and 1 patient had cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Four patients had bilateral LDS involvement, and the remainder had unilateral disease (right eye, 1 patient; left eye, 6 patients). The most common initial presentation, in 9 patients (82%), was epiphora. Lacrimal irrigation of 2 LDS was deferred because of acute dacryocystitis. Of the remaining 13 systems, 8 were completely obstructed. The blockage was low (in the lower sac or in the nasolacrimal duct) in 6 systems and high (in the upper sac or common internal punctum) in 2 systems. Four LDS were anatomically patent to irrigation but were functionally obstructed. Chemotherapy was the primary treatment in 7 patients, whereas 4 patients underwent radiation therapy. Nine patients responded well to treatment, with alleviation of signs and symptoms, and none of these patients had local recurrence during the follow-up interval. CONCLUSIONS: Leukemic or lymphomatous involvement of the LDS is an unusual cause of tearing in elderly patients, but it should be suspected in patients with known systemic disease.

L-Asparagine is an essential amino acid for many lymphoid tumor cells and L-asparaginase catalyzes its conversion to L-aspartic acid and ammonia. The dosage of this highly toxic drug is individualized based on the body surface area of the patient, but monitoring of L-asparaginase activity during the L-asparaginase therapy is not commonly used. We measured L-asparaginase activity in the serum of ten children (aged 3-13 y) with ALL (ALL NOPHO-92 standard or intermediate risk groups) during their L-asparaginase therapy. L-asparaginase was given 30,000 IU/m2 IM during days 37-46 of the induction therapy and no other chemotherapeutic drug except for prednisone was given at the same time. We observed that this dosage schedule resulted in almost 6-fold differences in the serum activity of L-asparaginase between the patients. There was also a relationship between the area under the L-asparaginase activity-time curve (AUC) and even peak L-asparaginase activity in serum during the enzyme therapy and neutropenia after the therapy in the patients: the higher the AUC or peak value was, the more severe was the neutropenia in the patients after treatment.

However, there is a lack of well-characterized and validated calibrators and positive controls for these assays. We therefore evaluated 16 readily available leukemia and lymphoma cell lines for their potential use as controls. METHODS: DNA and RNA were isolated from each cell line and analyzed by Southern blot and PCR or reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Rearrangements in the IgJ(H), IgJ(kappa), TcR-beta or TcR-gamma, bcr/abl, and bcl-2 genes were detected by commercially available probes and primers. Cell lineages were confirmed by immunophenotyping. RESULTS: Immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements were identified in five B- and three T-cell lines, respectively. Two cell lines tested positive for the bcr/abl gene, and one was positive for the bcl-2 gene rearrangement by Southern blot. CONCLUSIONS: The 16 cell lines studied can be used as positive controls in molecular detection assays for gene rearrangements.

Survival rates are improved by therapies guided by such monitoring. We assessed the potential of DzyNA reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for measurement of PML/RARalpha fusion transcripts. METHODS: Parallel single-tube DzyNA RT-PCR protocols were developed to allow real-time fluorescent quantification of PML/RARalpha fusion transcripts and a low abundance control transcript, normal BCR. Calibration curves, generated using cell line RNA, allowed estimation of these transcripts in RNA from patients with APL at various stages of the disease. RESULTS: DzyNA RT-PCR calibration curves were linear for both transcripts over a broad range and demonstrated interassay variations of 12% (mean, 658 ng) and 10% (mean, 263 ng), respectively. The protocols detected low concentrations of transcripts and resolved twofold dilutions. PML/RARalpha mRNA was quantified in 10 patients at diagnosis and in 1 patient over a 7-year period. Monitoring of transcript concentrations effectively reflected the disease course in one patient and demonstrated that an increase in PML/RARalpha transcripts can be detected 4-6 months before hematologic relapse, with no false-positive results. CONCLUSION: DzyNA RT-PCR has potential for use in clinical practice as a tool for diagnosis of APL and forsubsequent monitoring of minimal residual disease and detection of molecular relapse.","['Applegate, Tanya L', 'Iland, Harry J', 'Mokany, Elisa', 'Todd, Alison V']","['Applegate TL', 'Iland HJ', 'Mokany E', 'Todd AV']","['Johnson & Johnson Research Pty Limited, Australian Technology Park, Eveleigh NSW 1430, Australia. tapplega@medau.jnj.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*analysis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/07/27 10:00,2002/08/06 10:01,['2002/07/27 10:00'],"['2002/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Chem. 2002 Aug;48(8):1338-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML was first identified at the chromosomal translocation break-points t(15;17) of acute promyelocytic leukaemia and the gene product may mediate cell-cycle control and apoptosis. PML was found to interact with the co-transactivator CREB binding protein (CBP) and the apoptotic-modulator Bax. To determine if PML, CBP and Bax may be involved in solid tumours, such as the nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a rare neoplasia that is prevalent in Southern China, the expression of these proteins and the proliferation marker Ki-67 was analysed by immunohistochemical staining. Expression of PML in the PML-oncogenic domain (POD) or nuclear bodies in most NPC was inversely correlated with the expression of Ki-67. In addition, based on PML expression patterns in NPC three subtypes could be identified, namely, Subtype-1, with strong PML expression in POD structures and with low Ki-67 staining; Subtype-2, where PML was expressed in a homogeneously diffused pattern, but with a low intensity in the tumour cells; while Ki-67 was expressed in a moderate number of cells and Subtype-3, where the majority of tumour cells were PML-negative, while a considerable number of tumour cells were strongly labelled with Ki-67. Furthermore, CBP was present in most of the NPC cells with moderate-strong nuclear staining, while the expression in non-tumour cells were relatively weak. However, there was no direct correlation between PML and CBP expression in the NPC examined. In addition, there was low or no expression of Bax in the NP and NPC. This is, to our knowledge, the first report describing PML and CBP expression in NPC and our data strongly suggests that PML and CBP, but not Bax, may play a role in the transformed phenotypes of NPC.","['Chan, J Y H', 'Meng, C L', 'To, K F', 'Leung, S F', 'Chan, A T C', 'Lee, K K H', 'Johnson, P J']","['Chan JY', 'Meng CL', 'To KF', 'Leung SF', 'Chan AT', 'Lee KK', 'Johnson PJ']","['Institute of Radiological Sciences, National Yang Ming University, 155 Sec.2, Li-Nung St., Shi-Pai, ROC, Taipei, Taiwan. jchan@rics.bwh.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",IM,"['CREB-Binding Protein', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Ki-67 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2002/07/27 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/07/27 10:00'],"['2002/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0959804902000801 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(02)00080-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2002 Aug;38(12):1600-6. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(02)00080-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proteasome controls the stability of numerous proteins that regulate progression through the cell cycle and apoptosis, such as cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, tumor suppressors, and the nuclear factor-kB. By altering the stability or activity of these proteins, proteasome inhibitors sensitize malignant cells to apoptosis. Bortezomib is a dipeptidyl boronic acid proteasome inhibitor that effectively and specifically inhibits proteasome activity. In preclinical studies, bortezomib and other proteasome inhibitors have shown activity against a variety of B-cell malignancies, including multiple myeloma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. These agents can induce apoptosis and sensitize tumor cells to radiation or chemotherapy. Based on these findings, phase I clinical trials were conducted with bortezomib in various solid and hematologic malignancies. In these studies, bortezomib was generally well tolerated with manageable toxicities. Phase II trials have been initiated for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Preliminary data from the multiple myeloma phase II study indicate that a significant number of patients responded to therapy or exhibited stable disease and that the drug had manageable toxicities.

Among them, the combination of fludarabine/cyclophosphamide (FC) is by far the best regimen studied. Patients receiving FC at relapse show response rates (RRs) of 70%-94% with 11%-34% complete remission (CR) rates. In previously untreated patients with CLL, RRs of 64%-88% with 21%-46% CR rates were observed. The main side effects of FC are myelotoxicity and infections; most complications are reported as fever of unknown origin, infections of the upper respiratory tract, or herpes virus infection. There is probably a correlation between the higher dose of cyclophosphamide (> 750 mg/m2 per treatment course) and an increase in the number of severe infectious complications. Similar results were reported regarding the RRs and side effects of the combination of fludarabine/epirubicin. The triple combination of fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/mitoxantrone and fludarabine combinations with anti-CD20 (rituximab) or anti-CD52 (Campath-1H) antibody, might be even be more promising, since a relevant number of complete molecular remissions are achieved with these drugs.

To determine whether PR3 is involved in DOX-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells, and whether its loss causes resistance to DOX, we inhibited PR3 expression by an anti-sense PR3 oligodeoxynucleotide and showed that inhibition of PR3 expression results in a significant reduction in DOX-induced DNA fragmentation and increased resistance to DOX-induced apoptosis. Our results revealed that PR3-mediated DOX-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells is independent of the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsi(m)) and activation of the caspase-8 and -9 pathways. Moreover, while PR3 is involved in the cleavage of caspase-3, PR3-mediated DOX-induced DNA fragmentation and apoptosis were not prevented by a specific inhibitor of caspase-3. These data suggest that activation of caspase-3 alone is not sufficient to trigger PR3-mediated DOX-induced apoptosis. Treatment with an anti-PR3 oligomer significantly decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in cells treated with low concentrations of DOX, revealing a role for PR3 in enhancing production of DOX-induced ROS. Moreover, DOX-induced apoptosis at 0.001-0.01 microM was only inhibited in HL-60 cells pre-treated with the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine in the absence of anti-PR3, revealing that DOX-induced apoptosis in these cells is PR3- and ROS-dependent. Our results show that PR3 is involved in DOX-induced ROS-dependent apoptosis and that its loss is associated with resistance to DOX in HL-60 cells.","['Wu, Ching-Huang', 'Gordon, John', 'Rastegar, Mojgan', 'Ogretmen, Besim', 'Safa, Ahmad R']","['Wu CH', 'Gordon J', 'Rastegar M', 'Ogretmen B', 'Safa AR']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Indiana University, 1044 West Walnut R4-119, Indianapolis, Indiana, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', '*Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Myeloblastin', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism']",2002/07/26 10:00,2002/08/17 10:01,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2002/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205639 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Aug 1;21(33):5160-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205639.,"['CA 56078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 80734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 90878/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, expression of transgenes in primary lymphocytes is generally low. Reasoning that vector modification may lead to increased transgene expression and subsequent increases in function, we have performed two retroviral vector modifications and report their effect on the functional expression in primary lymphocytes. A chimeric receptor specific for the colon carcinoma-associated antigen, EGP40, was initially incorporated into the retroviral vector LXSN. In this vector, receptor expression is driven by the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR, and neomycin phosphotransferase expression driven by the SV40 promoter. Replacement of SV40 with an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) increased the transgene activity of a mouse T cell line and human PBL as judged by increased cytokine release in response to antigen positive target cells. A further increase in transgene function was generated by the additional incorporation of a splice acceptor motif into the construct. Human PBL transduced with vector incorporating both IRES and intron were consistently more effective at lysing antigen positive colorectal carcinoma cells.","['Royal, R E', 'Kershaw, M H', 'Reeves, M E', 'Wang, G', 'Daly, T', 'Treisman, J', 'Lam, J', 'Hwu, P']","['Royal RE', 'Kershaw MH', 'Reeves ME', 'Wang G', 'Daly T', 'Treisman J', 'Lam J', 'Hwu P']","['Tumor Immunology Section, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule)', '0 (RNA Splice Sites)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*genetics/metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms/immunology/*pathology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'RNA Splice Sites', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/07/26 10:00,2002/09/17 10:01,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2001/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3301734 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 2002 Aug;9(16):1085-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301734.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a 75-year-old man with a recent diagnosis of M0 acute myelogenous leukemia, who presented with multiple pruritic erythematous papules on his chest and back. Microscopically, the epidermis showed acrosyringeal-based acantholysis consistent with transient acantholytic dermatosis (TAD), associated with exocytosis of atypical hematolymphoid cells. In addition, the dermis showed a contiguous atypical hematolymphoid proliferation consistent with conventional leukemia cutis. To our knowledge, this is the first such case combining features of TAD with leukemia cutis. It remains to be determined whether the acantholysis occurred secondary to the leukemia cutis, was initiated by the migration of leukemic cells, or if the association is merely serendipitous.","['Sakalosky, Pamela E', 'Fenske, Neil', 'Morgan, Michael B']","['Sakalosky PE', 'Fenske N', 'Morgan MB']","['Departments of Pathology and Dermatology, University of South Florida College of Medicine and Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Tampa, Florida 33556, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acantholysis/drug therapy/etiology/*pathology', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/complications/*pathology', 'Male', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/07/26 10:00,2002/09/13 10:01,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000372-200206000-00012 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 2002 Jun;24(3):257-9. doi: 10.1097/00000372-200206000-00012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Signaling from the c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase is essential for primordial germ cell (PGC) growth both in vivo and in vitro. Many downstream effectors of the c-Kit signaling pathway have been identified in other cell types but how these molecules control PGC survival and proliferation are unknown. Determination of the c-Kit effectors acting in PGCs has been hampered by the lack of effective methods to easily manipulate gene expression in these cells. We overcame this problem by testing the efficacy of retroviral-mediated gene transfer for manipulating gene expression in mammalian germ cells. We found that PGCs can be successfully infected with a variety of types of retroviruses. We used this method to demonstrate an important role for the AKT kinase in regulating PGC growth. Such technology for manipulating gene expression in PGCs will allow many of the molecular mechanisms regulating germ cell growth, behavior, and differentiation to be comprehensively analyzed.","['De Miguel, Maria P', 'Cheng, Linzhao', 'Holland, Eric C', 'Federspiel, Mark J', 'Donovan, Peter J']","['De Miguel MP', 'Cheng L', 'Holland EC', 'Federspiel MJ', 'Donovan PJ']","['Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Bluemle Life Sciences Building, Room 706, 233 South 10th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Germ Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",2002/07/26 10:00,2002/09/24 06:00,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.122249399 [doi]', '122249399 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Aug 6;99(16):10458-63. doi: 10.1073/pnas.122249399.

Fifty-two male Wistar rats were divided into four groups. The flap size was 8 x 8 cm, with the medial middle branch of the superficial epigastric artery as the only nutrient supply vessel. Group 1 received only a control vehicle, group 2 received leukemia inhibitory factor(LIF), cDNA treated, group 3 received combined treatment of LIF and anti-gp130 antibody, and group 4 was the anti-gp130-treated group. All groups received 0.1 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) via 30-gauge needle injected into the proximal site of the femoral artery after distal sites of the bifurcated femoral artery to epigastric artery and vein were clamped. All clamps were removed after 10 min of incubation of the injected agents. During the first 3 postoperative days, the flap survival was significantly more improved in the anti-gp130-treated and combined-treated groups than in the control (88 +/- 1.5% and 77 +/- 5.3 vs. 45 +/- 7.8, respectively, p <.01). Laser blood flowmetry on day 3 showed a significant increase of blood flow in three different flap sites in anti-gp130-treated and combined-treated groups than in the other groups (p <.001). Microangiography showed remarkable differences between all four groups. The anti-gp130-treated flap showed augmented vessel formation at the base of the pedicle, which elongated the vessel interconnection up to the distal area. Strong gp130 transcripts and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression were observed in all groups, as determined using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The intensity of VEGF expression was the strongest in the anti-gp130-treated group. Attenuation of the gp130 receptor subunit can improve axial-pattern flap survival along with angiogenesis.","['Akita, Sadanori', 'Rashid, Mohammad Abdur', 'Ishihara, Hiroshi', 'Daian, Takehiro', 'Dazai, Seiji', 'Fujii, Tohru']","['Akita S', 'Rashid MA', 'Ishihara H', 'Daian T', 'Dazai S', 'Fujii T']","['Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan. akitas@hf.rim.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Invest Surg,Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,8809255,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (cytokine receptor, GLM-R)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/analysis/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', '*Interleukin-6', 'Laser-Doppler Flowmetry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/analysis/genetics', 'Male', 'Models, Animal', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Subunits', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, Cytokine/chemistry/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stomach/*surgery', '*Surgical Flaps', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2002/07/26 10:00,2003/01/23 04:00,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08941930290085895 [doi]'],ppublish,J Invest Surg. 2002 May-Jun;15(3):137-51. doi: 10.1080/08941930290085895.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that CLA is a specific homing receptor, facilitating the T-cell migration into skin lesions, and also an indicator of the skin-homing T-cell subset. In the present study, we investigated the expression of CLA in natural killer (NK) cells defined phenotypically as surface CD3- and CD56+ cells in peripheral blood. CLA was definitely expressed on CD3-CD56+ cells at a level comparable to CD3+ cells in peripheral blood of normal Japanese volunteers. After in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-12, there was a significant increase in the number and percentage of CLA+ NK cells but not CLA+ T cells (P < 0.01). To analyse the characteristics of CLA expressed by NK cells, we investigated a CLA+ NK-leukaemia cell line, NK-YS, established from a patient with NK leukaemia/lymphoma with skin infiltration. In the in vitro study, the CLA-expressing NK-leukaemic cell line bound to E-selectin-transfected cells and was inhibited by HECA 452 antibody or neuraminidase treatment of leukaemic cells. These findings suggest that CLA expressed by NK cells is a homing receptor for the E-selectin molecule and may explain skin infiltration by NK cells and NK lymphoma cells analogous to T cells. An NK-cell subset expressing CLA must play an important role in host defence against microorganisms and neoplasms in skin lesions.","['Tsuchiyama, Junjiro', 'Yoshino, Tadashi', 'Toba, Ken', 'Harada, Naoki', 'Nishiuchi, Ritsuo', 'Akagi, Tadaatsu', 'Furukawa, Tatsuo', 'Takahashi, Masuiro', 'Fuse, Ichiro', 'Aizawa, Yoshifusa', 'Harada, Mine']","['Tsuchiyama J', 'Yoshino T', 'Toba K', 'Harada N', 'Nishiuchi R', 'Akagi T', 'Furukawa T', 'Takahashi M', 'Fuse I', 'Aizawa Y', 'Harada M']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Niigata University School of Medicine, 1-754 Asahi-machi, Niigata 951, Japan. j-tutti@nifty.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'E-Selectin/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*immunology', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/immunology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/07/26 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['3608 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03608.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Aug;118(2):654-62. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03608.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of PKC-zeta in haematopoietic cell differentiation is less clear. In this study, we have investigated the influence of PKC-zeta overexpression on the phenotype of the human monocytic U937 leukaemic cells. In two PKC-zeta-overexpressing clones (U937 zetaJ and U937 zetaB), PKC-zeta expression levels and activity were three to fourfold higher, and the enzyme accumulated both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus compared with U937 control cells. PKC-zeta-overexpressing U937 cells exhibited an erythroid phenotype characterized by high levels of glycophorin A, cell haemoglobinization, increased GATA-1 transcripts and protein expression, compared with controls. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that GATA-1 protein was constitutively phosphorylated in PKC-zeta-overexpressing cells. Moreover, GATA-1 did not interact with PKC-zeta but interacted with ERK1, which was constitutively activated and accumulated in the nucleus of U937 zetaJ. However, ERK1 phosphorylation inhibition by PD098059 did not influence either GATA-1 phosphorylation or GATA-1/ERK1 interaction. Collectively, these results suggest a model in which PKC-zeta induces MEK-dependent ERK1 activation, ERK1 translocation to the nucleus, GATA-1/ERK1 interaction and ERK1-independent GATA-1 phosphorylation resulting in GATA-1 accumulation. To conclude, this study provides evidence for the role of PKC-zeta in erythroid gene regulation.","['Mansat-De Mas, Veronique', 'de Thonel, Aurelie', 'Gaulin, Vanessa', 'Demur, Cecile', 'Laurent, Guy', 'Quillet-Mary, Anne']","['Mansat-De Mas V', 'de Thonel A', 'Gaulin V', 'Demur C', 'Laurent G', 'Quillet-Mary A']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) E9910, Institut Claudius Regaud, 20 Rue du pont Saint-Pierre, 31052 Toulouse Cedex, France. demas.v@chu-toulouse.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2002/07/26 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['3625 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03625.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Aug;118(2):646-53. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03625.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using model human leukaemia THP-1 monocytes, we studied monocytic TF (mTF) hypercoagulation and its regulation. After an 8 h exposure to bacterial endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS); 100 ng/ml], mTF activity was significantly upregulated as the result of the enhanced mTF synthesis. Thereafter, LPS induction declined, exhibiting a ""quiescent-desensitizing' phenomenon. Such diminished LPS induction was,however,associated with sustained LPS-enhanced mTF synthesis, revealing the possible occurrence of a post-translational downregulation. It was noted that LPS desensitization was accompanied by the increased expression of myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (Marcks). In contrast, A23187 (20 micromol/l) or Quin-2AM (20 micromol/l) drastically activated mTF activity without detectable effect on mTF synthesis; both of which showed that sustained functional upregulation during 24 h culture did not enhance Marcks expression. These inverse correlations between mTF activity upregulation and Marcks expression suggested that Marcks could be inhibitory. Marcks phosphorylation site domain (151-175) (Marcks PSD) readily inhibited mTF-dependent FVII activation and diminished FVIIa formation in LPS-challenged cells. As a result, Marcks PSD offset LPS-induced mTF hypercoagulation upon inclusion in the single-stage clotting assays. The anticoagulant activity was confirmed by showing that Marcks PSD significantly blocked rabbit brain thromboplastin (rbTF) procoagulation and inhibited rbTF-dependent FVII activation as well as FVIIa formation. Our study suggests that Marcks expression plays a role in a novel cellular modulation to downregulate mTF hypercoagulation.","['Chu, Arthur J', 'Lin, Shi-Hua', 'Piasentin, Evano']","['Chu AJ', 'Lin SH', 'Piasentin E']","['Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, 416 Lande Medical Research Building, 550 E.

The CD38 antigen contributes to the control of blast cell proliferation, and the upregulation of CD38 might constitute an element in the pathogenesis of retinoic acid syndrome. The aim of this study was to determine whether phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) is involved in the modification of CD38 antigen expression on myeloid cells, as PI3-K plays a major role in the ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. We evaluated the effects of PI3-K inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) on the levels of CD38 antigen and mRNA in HL-60 and normal marrow CD34+ cells exposed to ATRA (1 micromol/l). The inhibitors prevented increase in CD38 mRNA expression and the overexpression of membrane CD38 antigen, without modification of the cytoplasmic level of this antigen. Interestingly, PI3-K activity was also necessary for CD38 expression on normal marrow CD34+ cells and for the ATRA-induced upregulation of CD157, a CD38-related antigen. In conclusion, PI3-K activity plays an essential role in the regulation of CD38 expression on human haematopoietic cells, and might constitute an interesting therapeutic target in haematological disorders involving CD38 overexpression.","['Lewandowski, Daniel', 'Linassier, Claude', 'Iochmann, Sophie', 'Degenne, Michel', 'Domenech, Jorge', 'Colombat, Philippe', 'Binet, Christian', 'Herault, Olivier']","['Lewandowski D', 'Linassier C', 'Iochmann S', 'Degenne M', 'Domenech J', 'Colombat P', 'Binet C', 'Herault O']","[""UPRES-EA 3249 'Haematopoietic cells, Haemostasis and Transplantation', Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital Bretonneau, boulevard Tonnelle, 37044 Tours Cedex, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Androstadienes/pharmacology', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Wortmannin']",2002/07/26 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['3601 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03601.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Aug;118(2):535-44. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03601.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) have been implicated in cell cycle regulation, we investigated the expression of these genes in non-proliferating (Q) and proliferating (P) AML and normal CD34+ progenitor cells. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2 were overexpressed in Q versus P AML cells, whereas no difference in Bcl-XS and Bax expression was found. Furthermore, the Bcl-X(L)/X(S) but not the Bcl-2/Bax ratio was higher in Q AML compared with normal CD34+ Q cells (P = 0.001). An inverse correlation between Bcl-2 expression of leukaemic Q cells and their ability to enter the cell cycle was found. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) reduced Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) expression in the leukaemic Q cells, and enhanced their chemosensitivity to cytosine arabinoside (ara-C). These findings demonstrate overexpression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2 in quiescent CD34+ AML cells and suggest their involvement in the chemoresistance. The observed inverse correlation between Bcl-2 and proliferation suggests a role for Bcl-2 in the cell cycle regulation of AML. These findings could be used in the development of therapies that selectively induce apoptosis in quiescent leukaemic progenitor cells.","['Konopleva, Marina', 'Zhao, Shourong', 'Hu, Wei', 'Jiang, Shuwei', 'Snell, Virginia', 'Weidner, Douglas', 'Jackson, C Ellen', 'Zhang, Xin', 'Champlin, Richard', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Reed, John C', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Konopleva M', 'Zhao S', 'Hu W', 'Jiang S', 'Snell V', 'Weidner D', 'Jackson CE', 'Zhang X', 'Champlin R', 'Estey E', 'Reed JC', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas M.

All children were eligible for randomization irrespective of risk group. The impact of the various types of intensification therapy was examined in a stratified analysis. At a median follow up of 102 months, both trials had an identical event-free survival of 61% (95% CI 58-63%) at 8 years. Survival at 8 years in UKALL XI was significantly better in than in UKALL X, 81% (79-83%) compared with 74% (72-76%) (P = < 0.001), owing to improved management of relapse.

Introduction of a third late intensification block compensated for omission of anthracyclines during induction but produced little additional benefit.

Not much is known about the underlying genetic differences leading to these clearly different phenotypes. We analysed 58 patients with de novo AML M5a and 66 patients with de novo AML M5b in comparison with a whole group of 1603 de novo AML. An aberrant karyotype was found in 75.9% of AML M5a but in only 28.8% of M5b (P < 0.0001) and in 54.7% of all other AML subtypes (P = 0.0015). 11q23/MLL aberrations were detected in 31% of M5a, 12.1% of M5b (P = 0.01) but only 1.3% of all other AML subtypes (P < 0.0001). Trisomy 8 as the sole cytogenetic aberration was found in 22.4% of M5a, but in only 3% of M5b and in 2.5% of all other AML subcategories (P < 0.0001). Although the frequency of the MLL-partial tandem duplication (MLL-PTD) did not differ between the three cohorts (1.7%, 4.5% and 6.1% respectively, NS), the detection of FLT3 length mutations (FLT3-LM) differed significantly. AML M5a showed a low frequency of only 6.9%, but 28.8% of M5b (P = 0.0014) and 23.5% of all other AML revealed a FLT3-LM. In conclusion, we demonstrated genetic, i.e. biological, differences between AML M5a and AML M5b and all other AML.

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is produced by neutrophils and its expression appears to be linked with myeloid cell differentiation. We investigated effects of ATRA on MMP expression in two human myeloid leukaemia cell lines, PL-21 and NB4. Both cells could differentiate into neutrophils after exposure to ATRA. Both the activity and antigen levels of MMP-9 were much higher in NB4 cells than in PL-21 cells. Stimulation with ATRA significantly increased MMP-9 levels approximately three- to fivefold in both PL-21 and NB4-conditioned media. MMP-9 mRNA levels increased in ATRA-treated cells and was almost in parallel with the increase in MMP-9 activity, suggesting that ATRA induced MMP-9 by activating its gene expression. ATRA can induce interleukin 8 (IL-8) in APL cells. IL-8, chemokine for neutrophils and a potent inducer of MMP-9, was also induced by ATRA in PL-21 cells. However, recombinant IL-8 did not induce MMP-9 expression. In addition, a neutralizing antibody against IL-8 did not inhibit ATRA-induced MMP-9 expression in either cell type. These observations suggest that ATRA can induce both MMP-9 and IL-8, but IL-8 is not involved in ATRA-induced MMP-9 expression. As MMP-9 can truncate and activate IL-8, simultaneous induction of MMP-9 and IL-8 by ATRA could activate leucocytes excessively, causing the hyper-inflammatory events in retinoic acid syndrome.","['Shibakura, Misako', 'Niiya, Kenji', 'Kiguchi, Toru', 'Shinagawa, Katsuji', 'Ishimaru, Fumihiko', 'Ikeda, Kazuma', 'Namba, Masayoshi', 'Nakata, Yasunari', 'Harada, Mine', 'Tanimoto, Mitsune']","['Shibakura M', 'Niiya K', 'Kiguchi T', 'Shinagawa K', 'Ishimaru F', 'Ikeda K', 'Namba M', 'Nakata Y', 'Harada M', 'Tanimoto M']","['Department of Health Sciences, Okayama University Medical School, 2-5-1 Shikata-cho, Okayama 700-8558, Japan. m_shiba@md.okayama-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2002/07/26 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['3723 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03723.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Aug;118(2):419-25. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03723.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six patients were followed for a median of 17.5 months after diagnosis during which 120 evaluable samples were analysed. The CBFB-MYH11 expression at diagnosis varied only fourfold between the six patients and was virtually identical to that observed in the CBFB-MYH11-positive cell line ME-1. For two cases, a patient-specific real-time PCR for CBFB-MYH11 quantification at genomic DNA level was designed. Similar disease levels were found at the RNA and genomic DNA level during and after treatment, indicating that CBFB-MYH11 gene expression was unaltered during treatment and that the percentage of malignant cells can be accurately quantified at the RNA level. Following successive courses of chemotherapy, the reduction of malignant cells was found to be significantly more pronounced (80-250-fold greater) in peripheral blood compared with bone marrow in five out of six cases tested. Treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin as sole agent at relapse did not result in a selective decrease of tumour cells in three cases analysed. We conclude that real-time PCR is a powerful method of monitoring MRD levels and quantifying the antileukaemic effect of separate (experimental) courses of chemotherapy.","['van der Reijden, Bert A', 'Simons, Annet', 'Luiten, Erna', 'van der Poel, Sonja C', 'Hogenbirk, Pauline E', 'Tonnissen, Evelyn', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'De Greef, Georgine E', 'Breuning, Martijn H', 'Jansen, Joop H']","['van der Reijden BA', 'Simons A', 'Luiten E', 'van der Poel SC', 'Hogenbirk PE', 'Tonnissen E', 'Valk PJ', 'Lowenberg B', 'De Greef GE', 'Breuning MH', 'Jansen JH']","['Institute of Haematology, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. bvanderreijden@chl.azn.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Artificial Gene Fusion', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/07/26 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['3738 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03738.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Aug;118(2):411-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03738.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was performed with the subclones of the retinoid-sensitive OCI/AML-2 cell line. The most prominent inhibitory effect on clonogenic cell growth and morphological apoptosis was shown by 9-cis RA. In addition, Western blotting revealed the most obvious translocation of p53 from cytosol to nucleus in the case of 9-cis RA, which was the only retinoid able to change the conformation of p53 from mutational to wild type, as demonstrated by flow cytometry. There was no difference between the retinoids in the downregulation of bcl-2 as analysed by Western blotting and flow cytometry. The RA receptor (RAR)-alpha antagonist had no effect on apoptosis in any of the three retinoids studied using the annexin V method. In conclusion, this study shows that 9-cis RA was a more potent agent than ATRA or 13-cis RA in inducing growth arrest and apoptosis in the OCI/AML-2 subclones. The effect was associated with the downregulation of bcl-2 and was hardly mediated through the RAR-alpha receptor, but might be related to the activation of p53.","['Koistinen, Pirjo', 'Zheng, Aiping', 'Saily, Marjaana', 'Siitonen, Timo', 'Mantymaa, Pentti', 'Savolainen, Eeva-Riitta']","['Koistinen P', 'Zheng A', 'Saily M', 'Siitonen T', 'Mantymaa P', 'Savolainen ER']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Oulu, PO Box 20, 90029 Oulu, Finland. pirjo.koistinen@ppshp.fi']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)']",IM,"['Alitretinoin', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Isotretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2002/07/26 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['3743 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03743.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Aug;118(2):401-10. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03743.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic transplantation given after intensive chemotherapy was able to reduce relapse in all risk and age groups.

Antifolate-resistant sublines established by stepwise and single-step selections displayed up to 2135-fold resistance to the selection drug, and up to 2323-fold cross-resistance to various hydrophilic antifolates. In contrast, these sublines were up to 17- and 20-fold hypersensitive to the lipophilic antifolates AG377 and trimetrexate, respectively. The total reduced folate pool of these antifolate-resistant sublines shrunk by 87-96%, resulting in up to 42-fold increased folic acid growth requirement. These sublines lost 92-97% of parental [(3)H]methotrexate influx rates. Genomic PCR single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and sequencing revealed that most of these drug-resistant sublines harboured RFC mutations that surprisingly clustered in two confined regions in exons 2 and 3. The majority of these mutations resulted in frame-shift and/or premature translation termination and lack of RFC protein expression. The remaining mutations involved single amino acid substitutions predominantly residing in the first transmembrane domain (TMD1). Some RFC-inactivating mutations emerged during the early stages of antifolate selection and were stably retained during further drug selection. Furthermore, some sublines displayed a markedly decreased or abolished RFC mRNA and/or protein expression. This constitutes the first demonstration of clustering of multiple human RFC mutations in TMD1, thereby suggesting that it plays a functional role in folate/antifolate binding and/or translocation. This is the first molecular characterization of human RFC-associated modalities of resistance to various novel antifolates in multiple leukaemia sublines.","['Rothem, Lilah', 'Ifergan, Ilan', 'Kaufman, Yotam', 'Priest, David G', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G']","['Rothem L', 'Ifergan I', 'Kaufman Y', 'Priest DG', 'Jansen G', 'Assaraf YG']","['Department of Biology, The Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', '*Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/07/26 10:00,2002/12/05 04:00,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2002/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BJ20020801 [doi]', 'BJ20020801 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2002 Nov 1;367(Pt 3):741-50. doi: 10.1042/BJ20020801.,,,,,PMC1222927,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability to quantitate full-length MDR1 mRNA levels may be predictive of P-gp expression and function. Therefore, a semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay was developed to assess full-length MDR1 mRNA levels. Levels offull-length 3.8-kb MDR1 mRNA were estimated by comparing PCR amplification of the RNA extract with that of an internal standard, deltaMDR1. The 2.9-kb deltaMDR1 competitor RNA standard was constructed by deleting 965 bpfrom the interior of MDR1 mRNA. The full-length MDR1 and deltaMDR1 share identical 5' and 3'primer binding sequences, allowing for their simultaneous amplification in the same RT-PCR. With this approach, MDR1 mRNA levels can be sensitively and reliably estimated with a detection limit of 2000 copies. Full-length MDR1 mRNA levels in various human cell lines and lymphocytes from leukemia patients varied over 100-fold, ranging from 0.3 to 36.5 x 10(5) copies/microg total RNA.

Our approach utilizesfluorescent PCRfor the co-ampification of the specific fusion transcript with an internal control (HPRT). We have also combined the advantages of real-time quantitative PCR, namely continuous fluorescent detection of PCR products with the low cost of an endpoint assay by examining in a novel manner the amount offluorescent PCR product generated during the exponential phase of amplification. This has been achieved by using the automated loading and quantification capacity of a laser-induced fluorescence capillary electrophoresis system, the ABI PRIsMS 310A, so that we can effectively monitor amplification during the exponential phase cheaply, reproducibly, and in a sensitive manner. We have carefully verified our new technique using five leukemia cell lines, each expressing a differentfusion transcript. Specificity and reproducibility (cy within 10%) have been examined and demonstrate the excellent precision of our technology. The high sensitivity levels of at least 10(-4) to 10(-6) obtainedfor the serial dilutions of the five cell lines validate the choice of our fluorescent PCR as a comparable method to other more complicated and expensive methods.

In this study, we evaluated a homogenous group of 19 girls between the ages of 7 and 11 years, 30 months after the completion of treatment. Nine received cranial radiation and chemotherapy and 10 were treated with chemotherapy alone. The patients were compared to 10 normal healthy controls. Neuropsychological tests included the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition (WISC-III), the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C), and the Calculation and Passage Comprehension subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised. Results confirmed the presence ofa verbal learning deficit in ALL girls treated with the combination of ITC and CRT. The ITC and CRT group scored significantly lower than the healthy controls on the Passage Comprehension subtest and on 5 of the 6 verbal subtests of the WISC-III. Furthermore, compared to nonirradiated patients and healthy normal controls, the ITC and CRT group was impaired on the Freedom from Distractibility index of the WISC-III, indicating an auditory-verbal attention deficit. On the CVLT-C, the ITC and CRT group was particularly impaired on the second half of the learning trials compared to the other two groups, showing a plateau in their performance. The ITC group was not different from the healthy control group, suggesting a less detrimental effect of the ITC alone on verbal abilities. Globally, these results indicate a deficit affecting auditory attention and verbal learning in girls who receive ITC and CRT, which may suggest the necessity for special educational assistance for these children.","['Precourt, Simon', 'Robaey, Philippe', 'Lamothe, Isabelle', 'Lassonde, Maryse', 'Sauerwein, Hannelore C', 'Moghrabi, Albert']","['Precourt S', 'Robaey P', 'Lamothe I', 'Lassonde M', 'Sauerwein HC', 'Moghrabi A']","['Department of Psychiatry, Research Center of Ste.

Based on distinct dielectric property differences between individual cell types, efficient cell separations were achieved by dielectrophoresis on this 5 x 5 array, which included separation of monocytic cells (U937) or human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) tax-transformed cells (Ind-2) from PBMC, as well as separation of neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) from glioma cells (HTB). The purity of dielectrophoretically separated cells can be greater than 95%. Expression profiles of IL-1, TNF-alpha, and TGF-beta genes for U937 cells mixed with PBMC before and after the separation were determined by a means of electric field-facilitated hybridization on a 10 x 10 microelectronic chip array. By using the expression levels of pure U937 cells as a control, it was shown that the gene expression profiles of the postseparation cells were significantly different from those of the preseparation cell mixtures. The increase in gene expression levels for U937 cells upon lipopolysaccharide induction could be accurately determined only in the postseparation cells, while the preseparation samples masked these changes. Furthermore, by cultivating the separated HTB and SH-SY5Y cells and measuring expression of the stress-related gene c-fos, dielectrophoretic forces were shown to have little effect on cell survival and stress. The presented approach of using microelectronic chip arrays for both cell separation and gene expression profiling provides a great potential for accurate genetic analysis of specific cell subpopulations in heterogeneous samples.","['Huang, Ying', 'Joo, Sunghae', 'Duhon, Melanie', 'Heller, Michael', 'Wallace, Bruce', 'Xu, Xiao']","['Huang Y', 'Joo S', 'Duhon M', 'Heller M', 'Wallace B', 'Xu X']","['Department of Advanced Technology, Nanogen Inc, San Diego, California 92121, USA. yhuang@nanogen.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Electrons', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics', 'U937 Cells']",2002/07/26 10:00,2002/08/28 10:01,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/ac011273v [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2002 Jul 15;74(14):3362-71. doi: 10.1021/ac011273v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reinduction rates in BM and CNS relapse cases were 72.3% and 83.3%, respectively. High reinduction rates were observed in B-precursor (B-pre) phenotype ALL in both relapse groups and in late (more than 24 months from onset) BM-relapse patients. After BM relapse, the overall 5-year survival rate was superior in the allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) group compared to the non-SCT group (41.9%+/-8.2% versus 13.6%+/-6.5%, P < .0001).

However, primary ATL cells, in contrast to ATL cell lines, are not necessarily susceptible to anti-Fas-induced apoptosis. To clarify the mechanism tuning the apoptotic signal transduction initiated by the activation caspase-8 in ATL cells and ATL cell lines, we examined the expression profile of caspase-8, of which there are at least 8 isoforms at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level with the potential to finely tune the signal transduction. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction disclosed the 2 major mRNA bands of 815 bp (casp-8S) and 951 bp (casp-8L) with different expression profiles among normal CD4 T-cells, primary ATL cells, and ATL cell lines. Casp-8L was the predominant form in primary ATL cells, whereas casp-8S was predominant in ATL cell lines. Casp-8S was structurally intact as shown by nucleotide analysis, whereas casp-8L was shown to be generated by a 136-bp insertion between exons 8 and 9 and to carry a frame shift in the transcript, introducing a premature stop codon and probably resulting in a truncated protein of approximately 30 kd deduced for the casp-8L transcript.

Cytogenetic (CG), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are mainly the techniques used for detecting this abnormality. The objective of this study was to compare and assess the role of CG, FISH and RT-PCR in the diagnosis of APL. METHODS: CG, FISH and RT-PCR analysis were performed in 29 patients with APL (28 M3, 1 M3v; 27 studied at diagnosis and 2 at relapse). RESULTS: Karotypes obtained in 25 patients revealed t(15;17) in 21 normal karyotype in 3 and trisomy 8 in 1 patient. In 26 patients FISH was positive for PML-RAR alpha fusion in both interphase (IP) and metaphase, two were negative and one patient had no cells for FISH analysis. IP FISH confirmed the fusion of PML-RAR alpha in all patients with t(15;17) detected by CG. RT-PCR was positive in the 22 patients analyzed (7 patients did not have RT-PCR).

Fludarabine inhibits DNA synthesis, acts on non-dividing (G0 phase) cells influencing apoptosis. PATIENTS, RESULTS, CONCLUSIONS: In our institute 47 patients were treated with fludarabine or fludarabine based combination chemotherapy. Fludarabine was given in 19 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), complete remission (CR) was achieved in one case, partial remission (PR) was obtained in 10 patients. Fludarabine was more effective in patients who received less intensive chemotherapy prior to fludarabine therapy and in those patients who had less advanced diseases. Elderly patients (over sixty years of age) also responded to fludarabine therapy. Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide combination (FCy) were used in three lymphocytic lymphoma patients, two of them obtained PR, in the third case the disease progressed. Fludarabine + mitoxantrone (Novantrone) + dexamethasone (FND) regimen was administered in nine patients who were previously heavily treated (one patient with B-CLL, one with T-CLL, one with peripheral T-cell lymphoma and six with indolent B-cell lymphoma). More patients and longer follow up is needed to determine the efficacy of FCy and FND protocol. FLAG-IDA (fludarabine, high dose Ara-C, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, idarubicin) was applied in 16 acute leukaemia patients with poor prognosis including therapy refractory and relapsing cases. Three CR and two PR, one CR and three PR was achieved in nine patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and in seven patients with acute lymphoid leukaemia, respectively. For this reason, despite the short period of remission, this regimen can be recommended to patients who are candidate for stem cell transplantation.","['Telek, Bela', 'Rejto, Laszlo', 'Kiss, Attila', 'Batar, Peter', 'Remenyi, Gyula', 'Rak, Kalman', 'Udvardy, Miklos']","['Telek B', 'Rejto L', 'Kiss A', 'Batar P', 'Remenyi G', 'Rak K', 'Udvardy M']","['Debreceni Orvos- es Egeszsegtudomanyi Centrum, II.

Smooth muscle cells (SMC), by expressing tissue factor (TF) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) can contribute to the thrombogenicity of atherosclerotic plaque. Consequently, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of OSM on the procoagulant activity of SMC. We observed that OSM induced in a concentration-dependent manner a potent procoagulant activity (PCA) that was related in part to an increased synthesis of TF, both at the cell membrane and in SMC lysates. The increased expression of TF on SMC membrane induced by OSM was sustained and was still observed 24 h after stimulation by OSM. IL-6 and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), two OSM-related cytokines, did not significantly modify TF expression at the surface of SMC. In addition to its effects on TF, OSM decreased the secretion of TFPI in the supernatants of SMC, as well as in the lysates, but was devoid of effect on TFPI bound at the membrane of SMC. IL-6 and LIF reduced also TFPI secretion, which could explain why the PCA of SMC lysates treated by IL-6 or LIF was increased, despite an absence of effect on TF expression. In conclusion, these data support the hypothesis that by increasing the PCA of SMC, OSM might be involved in the thrombotic complications associated with plaque rupture.","['Mirshahi, F', 'Vasse, M', 'Tedgui, A', 'Li, H', 'Merval, R', 'Legrand, E', 'Vannier, J P', 'Soria, J', 'Soria, C']","['Mirshahi F', 'Vasse M', 'Tedgui A', 'Li H', 'Merval R', 'Legrand E', 'Vannier JP', 'Soria J', 'Soria C']","['Laboratoire DIFEMA, UFR de Medecine et Pharmacie de Rouen, Rouen, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,9102551,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",IM,"['Aorta', 'Arteriosclerosis/complications', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lipoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Rupture, Spontaneous', 'Thromboplastin/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2002/07/26 10:00,2003/02/01 04:00,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001721-200207000-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis. 2002 Jul;13(5):449-55. doi: 10.1097/00001721-200207000-00010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infectious complications are a major concern in patients treated for acute leukemia. Although CVC-related infections are considered to be a major source of infections during neutropenia (<500/microl), data regarding the incidence of CVC-related infections are rare in acute leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed nontunneled CVCs in 58 patients with acute leukemia (22 men/36 women) in 119 chemotherapy cycles from April 1996 to January 1998 in a prospective trial. Proven CVC-related infection was defined as the isolation of the same organism from peripheral blood and CVC tip. CVC infection was suspected or possible when exit site inflammation and positive blood culture or organisms typical for CVC infection were observed. RESULTS: Mean neutropenia/cycle was 16.3 days (SD 8.0). 178 CVCs with 2,576 CVC days (mean 14.5 days, SD 7.2 days) were used in 119 cycles. Fever occurred in 87 cycles (73%). Blood stream infection was proven in 31 out of 87 febrile episodes (26.1%) with 40 isolates (8 gram-negative, 31 gram-positive, 1 Candida spp.). Colonization of the CVC tip was observed in 24 CVC lines with 28 isolates (27 gram-positive, 1 gram-negative); however, proven CVC-related infections were observed in 5 episodes only, all with coagulase-negative staphylococci. In another 6 episodes, CVC-related infection was assumed (local inflammation and gram-positive blood culture). Six further episodes had typical blood isolates (4 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 1 Candida spp.) and were considered possible CVC-related infections. In none of the remaining afebrile 32 cycles was a CVC infection observed or suspected. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive organisms contributed to the majority of CVC-related infections (16 out 17 CVC infections); however, the overall incidence of CVC infections in acute leukemia patients was 6.5/1,000 CVC days only (1.9 proven/2.3 suspected/2.3 possible/1,000 CVC days).","['Karthaus, M', 'Doellmann, T', 'Klimasch, T', 'Krauter, J', 'Heil, G', 'Ganser, A']","['Karthaus M', 'Doellmann T', 'Klimasch T', 'Krauter J', 'Heil G', 'Ganser A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",2002/07/26 10:00,2003/01/01 04:00,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/01 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['64922 [pii]', '10.1159/000064922 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2002 Jul;48(3):154-7. doi: 10.1159/000064922.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 S.

Inasmuch as most effects of chemotherapeutic agents are mediated via the activation of apoptosis, the cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil (FU) in correlation with apoptosis-regulating genes in pancreatic cancer cell lines were analyzed. METHODS: The cytotoxic effects of 5-FU and gemcitabine in AsPC-1, Capan-1, Mia-PaCa-2 and T3M4 pancreatic cancer cell lines were assessed by growth assays, and mRNA expression levels of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes of the Bcl-2 family were analyzed by RNAse protection assays. RESULTS: Pancreatic cancer cells displayed a wide range of responses towards 5-FU (IC(50) 0.22-4.63 microM) and gemcitabine (11.51-42.2 nM). After repeated treatment with 5-FU, the IC(50) values in Capan-1 and T3M4 cells increased 2.1- and 1.8-fold, respectively, compared to their parental cells. Following recurrent treatment with gemcitabine, the IC(50) values in Capan-1 cells increased significantly (1.5-fold, p < 0.01). RNase protection assay showed a negative correlation between bcl-x(L) and mcl-1 mRNA expression levels and the sensitivity to 5-FU and gemcitabine after 5-FU and gemcitabine treatment. The bax/bcl-2 ratio maintained relatively stable following 5-FU/gemcitabine treatment and reflected the chemotherapeutic sensitivity of these cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that pancreatic cancer cell lines are generally resistant to 5-FU and are more sensitive towards gemcitabine. The bax/bcl-2 ratio is predictive of chemotherapy sensitivity, whereas bcl-x(L) and mcl-1 mRNA levels following repeated exposure to 5-FU or gemcitabine are associated with resistance to these drugs. These findings suggest that the activation of anti-apoptotic genes after repeated drug exposure contributes to chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells and that blockage of anti-apoptotic genes might enhance chemosensitivity in pancreatic cancer.","['Shi, Xin', 'Liu, Shengli', 'Kleeff, Jorg', 'Friess, Helmut', 'Buchler, Markus W']","['Shi X', 'Liu S', 'Kleeff J', 'Friess H', 'Buchler MW']","['Department of Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, Inselspital, University of Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '2609-88-3 (lissamine rhodamine B)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 3.1.27.5 (Ribonuclease, Pancreatic)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Rhodamines/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease, Pancreatic/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/07/26 10:00,2002/08/23 10:01,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['65068 [pii]', '10.1159/000065068 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2002;62(4):354-62. doi: 10.1159/000065068.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 S.

The TRPV6-mediated currents are highly Ca(2+)-selective, show a strong inward rectification, and reverse at positive potentials, which is similar to store-operated Ca(2+) entry in electrically nonexcitable cells. The gating of TRPV6 channels is strongly dependent on the cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration; lowering the intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration results in Ca(2+) influx, and current amplitude correlates with the intracellular EGTA or BAPTA concentration. This is also the case for TRPV6-mediated currents in the absence of extracellular divalent cations; compared with endogenous currents in nontransfected rat basophilic leukemia cells, these TRPV6-mediated monovalent currents reveal differences in reversal potential, inward rectification, and slope at very negative potentials. Release of stored Ca(2+) by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and/or the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin appears not to be involved in TRPV6 channel gating in both cell lines but, in rat basophilic leukemia cells, readily activates the endogenous Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) current. In conclusion, TRPV6, expressed in human embryonic kidney cells and in rat basophilic leukemia cells, functions as a Ca(2+)-sensing Ca(2+) channel independently of procedures known to deplete Ca(2+) stores.","['Bodding, Matthias', 'Wissenbach, Ulrich', 'Flockerzi, Veit']","['Bodding M', 'Wissenbach U', 'Flockerzi V']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Universitat des Saarlandes, D-66421 Homburg, Germany. matthias.boedding@uniklinik-saarland.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Cations)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TRPV Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPV6 channel)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.3.8 (Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', ""K22DDW77C0 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid)"", 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/metabolism', 'Cations', 'Cell Line', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Egtazic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Electrophysiology', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases', 'TRPV Cation Channels', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/07/26 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M202822200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)36644-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Sep 27;277(39):36656-64. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M202822200.

Stab lesions made with nitrocellulose implants induced within 4 days the formation of peripherin accumulations, devoid of neurofilament proteins, in thalamic neurites at the site of the lesion. The local administration of interleukin-6 or leukemia inhibitory factor at the site of the stab lesion extended the expression pattern of peripherin to other neuronal subsets in areas of the cortex and/or of the hippocampus adjacent to injury. We also show that transient focal ischemia in mice, a model of stroke, can trigger within 72 h the formation of neuronal peripherin accumulations in neurons of the cortex, thalamus and hippocampus. This new type of potentially noxious intermediate filament protein accumulations, composed of peripherin, may be of relevance to many brain degenerative disorders with occurrence of proinflammatory cytokines.","['Beaulieu, Jean-Martin', 'Kriz, Jasna', 'Julien, Jean-Pierre']","['Beaulieu JM', 'Kriz J', 'Julien JP']","['Centre for Research in Neurosciences, McGill University, The Montreal General Hospital Research Institute, 1650 Cedar Avenue, Quebec H3G 1A4, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neurofilament Proteins)', '0 (Peripherins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brain/cytology', 'Brain Chemistry/*physiology', 'Brain Injuries/*metabolism/pathology', 'Brain Ischemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Neurofilament Proteins/metabolism', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'Peripherins', 'Thalamus/cytology/metabolism']",2002/07/26 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006899302028305 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-8993(02)02830-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 2002 Aug 16;946(2):153-61. doi: 10.1016/s0006-8993(02)02830-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Human fetal ovaries were obtained from aborted fetuses aged 19-33 GW. SETTING: Rabin Medical Center, a major tertiary care and referral center. PATIENT(S): Twenty-seven women undergoing pregnancy termination. The abortions were mostly because of fetal anatomical or chromosomal abnormalities. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Microscopy studies, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) assay (TUNEL), and immunocytochemistry for B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (bcl-2). RESULT(S): TUNEL assay revealed a slight increase in apoptotic oocytes in fetuses from 23 GW, with a peak at 27 GW. Overexpression of bcl-2 was detected in all ovarian components, regardless of fetal age. CONCLUSION(S): There seems to be a slight increase in apoptosis in oocytes from 23 GW with a peak at 27 GW. However, it is very unlikely that these low apoptotic rates could be the cause of the extensive germ cell loss throughout human pregnancy. The overexpression of bcl-2 possibly suggests either that this gene is necessary to overcome extensive apoptotic activity or that it is responsible for the low apoptosis rates. However, these results should be considered with caution, since the ovaries were mostly from abnormal fetuses after feticide.","['Abir, Ronit', 'Orvieto, Raoul', 'Dicker, Dov', 'Zukerman, Zvi', 'Barnett, Miriam', 'Fisch, Benjamin']","['Abir R', 'Orvieto R', 'Dicker D', 'Zukerman Z', 'Barnett M', 'Fisch B']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Campus, Petah Tikva, Israel. ronita@clalit.org.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)'],IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Ovary/*embryology/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Second/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism']",2002/07/26 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0015028202032181 [pii]', '10.1016/s0015-0282(02)03218-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2002 Aug;78(2):259-64. doi: 10.1016/s0015-0282(02)03218-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULT(S): Cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor, colony-stimulating factor-1, and interleukin-1 have all been shown to play important roles in the cascade of events that leads to implantation. They participate in a synchronized cooperation between the endometrium and the preimplanting embryo under the influence of steroid hormones. The same applies to the integrin alpha(v)beta(3), glycodelin, and the polymorphic mucin 1. The usefulness of these factors to assess endometrial receptivity and to estimate the prognosis for pregnancy in natural and artificial cycles remains to be proven. CONCLUSION(S): The studies performed to date have mostly included only small groups of patients with a lack of fertile controls, and only a few prospective, controlled trials have been carried out.

A comparison of IDA and DNR transport phenomena in relation to drug cytotoxicity and expression of P-glycoprotein (PGP) was made. Intracellular content of IDA/DNR was determined by flow cytometry using the fluorescent properties of the drugs. In vitro drug cytotoxicity was measured by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. PGP expression was analysed by flow cytometry. The uptake and efflux rates were non-significantly higher for IDA than DNR. There were no differences between three types of leukemia with respect to drug content during accumulation and retention. After correction for the cell volume, intracellular concentration of both drugs in each moment of uptake and efflux was significantly lower in relapsed ALL and AML samples in comparison with initial ALL cells. Efflux, but not uptake, of both drugs was inversely correlated with PGP expression and IDA, but not DNR, cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity was correlated with drug accumulation for both drugs and with drug retention for IDA. In conclusion, it seems that (1) intracellular content was related to the lipophilic properties of the drugs rather than to the type of leukemia, (2) decreased intracellular concentration of both drugs might have an impact on compromised therapy results in AML and relapsed ALL children, (3) IDA presents higher cytotoxicity, which possibly might be decreased by the presence of PGP.

The TEL/JAK2 fusion protein contains the JAK2 catalytic domain and the TEL-specific oligomerization domain. TEL-mediated oligomerization of the TEL/JAK2 proteins results in the constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase activity. Leukemia cells expressing TEL/JAK2 tyrosine kinase become resistant to anti-neoplastic drugs. Amifostine is a pro-drug which can selectively protect normal tissues against the toxicity of anticancer drugs and radiation. We investigated the effects of amifostine on idarubicin-induced DNA damage and repair in murine pro-B lymphoid BaF3 cells and BaF3-TEL/JAK2-transformed cells using alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). Idarubicin induced DNA damage in both cell types but amifostine reduced its extent in control non-transformed BaF3 cells and enhanced it in TEL/JAK2-transformed cells. The transformed cells did not show measurable DNA repair after exposure to amifostine and idarubicin, but cells treated only with idarubicin were able to recover within a 60-min incubation. Because TEL/JAK2-transformed cells can be considered as model cells for certain human leukemias and lymphomas we anticipate an enhancement of idarubicin cytotoxicity by amifostine in these diseases. Moreover, TEL/JAK2 tyrosine kinase might be involved in cellular response to DNA damage. Amifostine could promote apoptosis or lower the threshold for apoptosis induction dependent on TEL/JAK2 activation.","['Gloc, Ewa', 'Warszawski, Mariusz', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech', 'Stolarska, Malgorzata', 'Hoser, Grazyna', 'Skorski, Tomasz', 'Blasiak, Janusz']","['Gloc E', 'Warszawski M', 'Mlynarski W', 'Stolarska M', 'Hoser G', 'Skorski T', 'Blasiak J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, mouse)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)']",IM,"['Amifostine/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/07/26 10:00,2003/01/23 04:00,['2002/07/26 10:00'],"['2002/07/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/26 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 2002;49(1):121-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They differed in resistance to thermal inactivation at elevated temperatures in the presence of an RNA/DNA template-primer. RNase H-minus RTs retained the ability to efficiently synthesize cDNA at much higher temperatures. We show that the structure of the template-primer has a critical bearing on protection of RT from thermal inactivation. RT RNase H activity rapidly alters the structure of the template-primer to forms less tightly bound by RT and thus less able to protect the enzyme at elevated temperatures. We also found that when comparing wild-type or mutant AMV RT with the respective M-MLV RT, the avian enzymes retained more DNA synthetic activity at elevated temperatures than murine RTs. Enzyme, template-primer interaction again played the most significant role in producing these differences. AMV RT binds much tighter to template- primer and has a much greater tendency to remain bound during cDNA synthesis than M-MLV RT and therefore is better protected from heat inactivation.","['Gerard, Gary F', 'Potter, R Jason', 'Smith, Michael D', 'Rosenthal, Kim', 'Dhariwal, Gulshan', 'Lee, Jun', 'Chatterjee, Deb K']","['Gerard GF', 'Potter RJ', 'Smith MD', 'Rosenthal K', 'Dhariwal G', 'Lee J', 'Chatterjee DK']","['Invitrogen Corporation, 7335 Executive Way, Frederick, MD 21704, USA. gary.gerard@invitrogen.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/enzymology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Half-Life', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'Mutation', 'Protein Denaturation', 'RNA/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2002/07/24 10:00,2002/08/09 10:01,['2002/07/24 10:00'],"['2002/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/gkf417 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Jul 15;30(14):3118-29. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkf417.,,,,,PMC135738,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Knockout experiments have demonstrated that endometrial LIF is essential for in vivo murine implantation. We assessed the impact of LIF and an anti-LIF polyclonal antibody (pab) on in vivo development and developed a novel and successful nonsurgical method of embryo transfer for this species, a transcervical blastocyst transfer technique. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of LIF and the anti-LIF pab on 1) implantation, resorption, pregnancy, and viability rates and 2) the overall structural and skeletal development. Two-cell embryos were recovered from superovulated mated donors, cultured to the expanded blastocyst stage, and transferred transcervically into pseudopregnant recipients. Exposure to 5000 U/ml LIF resulted in significant increases in implantation, pregnancy, and viability rates compared with controls. A similar dose of pab produced overall inhibitory effects with a significant decrease in implantation rate. Paradoxically, lower pab doses resulted in significantly increased viability rates. Exposure to LIF had no effect on fetoplacental development. However, pab treatments had variable but significant negative effects on placental length, ossification of the exoccipital bone, and vertebral space width compared with controls. Exposure of murine blastocysts to LIF at the time of transcervical transfer resulted in pronounced positive effects on implantation and pregnancy rates without affecting fetal development. A similar pab dose dramatically reduced implantation and pregnancy rates; at high and low doses, pab produced deleterious effects on placental and skeletal development.","['Mitchell, Michael H', 'Swanson, R James', 'Oehninger, Sergio']","['Mitchell MH', 'Swanson RJ', 'Oehninger S']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA 23529, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Blocking/*pharmacology', 'Blastocyst/drug effects/*physiology', 'Bone Development/drug effects', 'Embryo Implantation/drug effects', 'Embryo Loss/pathology', '*Embryo Transfer', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Fetal Viability/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Pregnancy', 'Superovulation']",2002/07/24 10:00,2003/01/25 04:00,['2002/07/24 10:00'],"['2002/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1095/biolreprod67.2.460 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2002 Aug;67(2):460-4. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod67.2.460.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the transduction efficiency by a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV)-based vector is low, probably due to the characteristically slow cell cycle of stem cells. Since lentiviral vectors can transduce non-dividing cells, they have the potential to efficiently transduce GSCs. Here we report that male GSCs of mice can be transduced in vitro by a lentiviral vector and generate complete spermatogenesis when transplanted into infertile host testes. Transduction efficiencies were comparable to those for MMLV transduction using similar experimental conditions. The results suggest that both lentiviral and MMLV vectors could be effective in transducing GSCs of other species. In addition, these and previous studies suggest that transduction of immature donor stem cells transplanted into immature recipient testes will provide the most efficient system for male germ line modification.","['Nagano, Makoto', 'Watson, Deborah J', 'Ryu, Buom-Yong', 'Wolfe, John H', 'Brinster, Ralph L']","['Nagano M', 'Watson DJ', 'Ryu BY', 'Wolfe JH', 'Brinster RL']","['Department of Animal Biology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6009, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,,IM,"['Animals', '*Germ Cells', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2002/07/24 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/07/24 10:00'],"['2002/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0014579302030107 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03010-7 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2002 Jul 31;524(1-3):111-5. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03010-7.,"['36504/PHS HHS/United States', 'DK-47747-07/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK42707/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK46637/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'NS07810/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS11024/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We used a ""positive"" (CD34) and ""negative"" (CD19) double selection method to improve the efficacy of ""single purging"" of hematopoietic harvests in poor-prognosis lymphoproliferative disorders. All patients included in the study had a positive molecular marker of their disease. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was studied by flow cytometry and PCR techniques during the purging procedure and after transplantation. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients fulfilled entry criteria. Median age of patients was 50 years (range: 33-66); 17 were male and 9 female. Thirteen (50%) of the patients mobilized an adequate number of CD34+ cells (>or=3 x 10(6)/kg) to proceed with the double-selection protocol. Twelve of the 13 harvests became PCR negative after purging. Ten patients were grafted with the selected products and all but one engrafted without delay. After a median follow-up of 30 months, 2 of 10 patients suffered a molecular relapse at 7 and 19 months respectively. The earlier relapse was observed in the patient who received a MRD+ product. Only one patient experienced a clinical relapse. Three patients died due to obliterans bronchiolitis, pneumococcal sepsis, and septic shock of unknown origin, respectively, and three others presented life-threatening infections. CONCLUSION: Therefore, CD34+/CD19+ positive/negative selection is an effective purging approach in patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. This favorable effect is, however, counterbalanced by the high frequency of life-threatening infections.","['Altes, Albert', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Martin-Henao, Gregorio', 'Marin, Pedro', 'Sureda, Anna', 'Briones, Javier', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Carreras, Enric', 'Garcia, J', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Montserrat, Emili']","['Altes A', 'Sierra J', 'Esteve J', 'Martin-Henao G', 'Marin P', 'Sureda A', 'Briones J', 'Martino R', 'Villamor N', 'Colomer D', 'Carreras E', 'Garcia J', 'Brunet S', 'Montserrat E']","['Clinical Hematology Division, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. aaltesh@hsp.santpau.es']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Bacterial Infections/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Blood Cells/chemistry/*transplantation', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Bronchiolitis Obliterans/etiology', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*classification', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', '*Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/complications/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/complications/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Sepsis/etiology', 'Shock, Septic/etiology', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/07/24 10:00,2002/08/30 10:01,['2002/07/24 10:00'],"['2002/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02008287 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00828-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Jul;30(7):824-30. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00828-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)-1/2 and its ligand VEGF in AML cell lines and characterized the inhibitory activity of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor SU5614 on human endothelial and leukemic cells. RESULTS: Intracellular VEGF expression was detected in 9 of 10 leukemic cell lines. In contrast, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 expression was restricted to 6 and 2 out of 10 cell lines, respectively. Although SU5614 was a potent inhibitor of the VEGF-induced endothelial cell sprouting in vitro, the sensitivity of leukemic cells toward the growth inhibitory activity of the compound was determined by the c-kit, but not by the VEGFR-1/2 expression. SU5614 induced growth arrest and apoptosis in c-kit-expressing Kasumi-1, UT-7, and M-07e cells and inhibited the stem cell factor (SCF)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-kit. The sensitivity of Kasumi-1 cells towards the growth inhibitory activity of SU5614 was caused by an autocrine production of SCF, but not by transforming mutations of c-kit. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide strong evidence that SU5614 has a dual mode of action, and by direct inhibition of c-kit in AML cells and by inhibition of VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells, it might represent a novel treatment option for patients with c-kit+ AML.","['Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Faber, Florian', 'Voswinckel, Robert', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang']","['Spiekermann K', 'Faber F', 'Voswinckel R', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Clinical Cooperative Group Leukemia, GSF National Research Center for Environment and Health, Munich, Germany. spiekermann@gsf.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SU 5614)', '0 (TEL-ABL fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autocrine Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Drug Resistance', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*physiopathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*drug effects/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2002/07/24 10:00,2002/08/30 10:01,['2002/07/24 10:00'],"['2002/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02008378 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00837-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Jul;30(7):767-73. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00837-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We attempted to identify signal transduction pathways activated by these factors in normal human megakaryocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To better understand the role of these factors in normal human megakaryopoiesis we studied their effect on 1) purified human bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells, 2) human alpha(IIb)beta3+ cells (shown by immunophenotypical and morphological criteria to be megakaryoblasts), which had been expanded ex vivo from CD34+ cells in chemically defined artificial serum, and 3) gel-filtered human peripheral blood platelets. Further, in an attempt to correlate the influence of these factors on cell proliferation and survival with activation of signal transduction pathways, we evaluated their effect on the phosphorylation of MAPK p42/44 and activation of PI-3K-AKT and JAK-STAT proteins in these various cell types. RESULTS: Using serum-free liquid cultures, we found that only TPO and IL-6 protected CD34+ cells and megakaryocytes from undergoing apoptosis (decrease in annexin-V binding, PARP cleavage, and activation of caspase-3). Moreover, only TPO when used alone and IL-6 only when used in combination with TPO, stimulated the growth of human colony-forming unit-megakaryocytes (CFU-Meg) in semisolid serum-free medium. We also observed that while TPO efficiently activated various signaling pathways in CD34+ cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets (MAPK p42/44, PI-3K-AKT, STAT proteins), IL-6 stimulated phosphorylation of STAT-1, -3, and -5 proteins only in CD34+ cells and megakaryoblasts. To our surprise, none of the other gp130 protein-related cytokines tested (IL-11, LIF, CNTF, and OSM) activated these signaling pathways in CD34+ cells, megakaryoblasts, or platelets. CONCLUSIONS: Our signal transduction studies explain why TPO, by simultaneously activating several signaling pathways, is the most potent megakaryopoietic regulator and why of all five gp130 protein-related cytokines tested, only IL-6, through activation of STAT proteins, plays a role in normal human megakaryopoiesis.","['Majka, Marcin', 'Ratajczak, Janina', 'Villaire, Gaston', 'Kubiczek, Krystyna', 'Marquez, Leah A', 'Janowska-Wieczorek, Anna', 'Ratajczak, Mariusz Z']","['Majka M', 'Ratajczak J', 'Villaire G', 'Kubiczek K', 'Marquez LA', 'Janowska-Wieczorek A', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Stem Cell Biology Program at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blood Platelets/*drug effects/physiology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects/physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2002/07/24 10:00,2002/08/30 10:01,['2002/07/24 10:00'],"['2002/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X0200810X [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00810-x [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Jul;30(7):751-60. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00810-x.,['R01 HL61796-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tetrazolium-based cell line proliferation assays (MTT assays) were performed to determine the cytotoxicity of As2O3 alone and in combination with imatinib. Cell lines tested in this study were Bcr-Abl-expressing cells (K562, MO7p210, 32Dp210) and parental cells (MO7e, 32D). Isobologram analysis was performed manually and using the median effect method. In vitro cytotoxicity also was determined in colony-forming assays using CML patient cells. Western blot analysis was performed to detect Bcr-Abl protein levels in K562 cells exposed to As2O3 at graded concentrations. Bcr-Abl protein level kinetics were correlated with cell viability (trypan blue count) and activated caspase-3 detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: We show additive to synergistic cytotoxicity in Bcr-Abl+ cell lines depending on inhibitory concentrations and cell type. Results obtained by colony-forming assays confirmed the findings in cell line proliferation assays. Flow cytometric detection of activated caspase-3 revealed synergistic activity in K562 cells. Treatment of K562 cells with As2O3 alone led to down-regulation of Bcr-Abl protein within 24 hours, even at low doses. The decline of Bcr-Abl preceded activation of caspase-3 and the loss of viable cells. CONCLUSIONS: Favorable cytotoxicity and proapoptotic activity of imatinib in conjunction with As2O3 and specific down-regulation of Bcr-Abl protein levels by As2O3 in K562 cells indicate that As2O3 in combination with imatinib might be useful for circumventing resistance to imatinib monotherapy.","['La Rosee, Paul', 'Johnson, Kara', ""O'Dwyer, Michael E"", 'Druker, Brian J']","['La Rosee P', 'Johnson K', ""O'Dwyer ME"", 'Druker BJ']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR 97201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2002/07/24 10:00,2002/08/30 10:01,['2002/07/24 10:00'],"['2002/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02008366 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00836-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Jul;30(7):729-37. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00836-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Five female patients with cytogenetically abnormal, newly-diagnosed AML who were heterozygous for informative alleles of the androgen receptor (AR) gene were studied using the human androgen receptor allele (HUMARA) assay. RESULTS: PB mononuclear cells and bone marrow (BM) fibroblasts from these patients were monoclonal and polyclonal, respectively. Both cytogenetically normal and abnormal colony-forming cells (CFC) were detected from 3 AML samples and the HUMARA assay determined that most of these CFC were part of the leukemic clone. The fourth sample generated colonies that were 100% normal by cytogenetics and polyclonal by HUMARA. In contrast, 5-week-old long-term culture (LTC)-derived colonies were 100% cytogenetically normal by FISH and polyclonal by HUMARA in 4 of the 5 samples. The fifth sample, which showed a small number of karyotypically abnormal LTC-derived colonies, nevertheless showed amplification of the ""leukemia-associated"" AR allele in 46/50 LTC-derived colonies as well as all 40 directly clonogenic cells tested. CONCLUSIONS: Thus in 4 of 5 AML samples tested, both cytogenetics and the HUMARA assay indicate that a substantial number of normal, polyclonal hematopoietic progenitors often persist in AML PB at diagnosis in spite of the predominance of malignant blasts and the severe cytopenias of normal mature blood cells that are typically seen clinically.","['Guan, Yinghui', 'Ralph, Steven', 'Hogge, Donna E']","['Guan Y', 'Ralph S', 'Hogge DE']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured/chemistry/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells/chemistry/pathology', 'Dosage Compensation, Genetic', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/chemistry/pathology', 'Gene Amplification', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/pathology', 'Receptors, Androgen/analysis']",2002/07/24 10:00,2002/08/30 10:01,['2002/07/24 10:00'],"['2002/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X0200824X [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00824-x [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Jul;30(7):721-8. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00824-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retrospective studies suggested a high propensity for malignant myeloid transformation into myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The study's aims were to determine the cellular and molecular characteristics as well as the clinical course of malignant myeloid transformation and clonal marrow disease in patients with SDS. METHODS: This is a longitudinal prospective study of 14 patients recruited for annual hematological evaluations. Results of baseline and serial hematological assessments for up to 5 years are reported. RESULTS: Clonal marrow cytogenetic abnormalities (CMCA) were detected in 4 patients (29%) on first testing or at follow-up. The abnormalities were del(20q) in two patients, i(7q) in one, and combined del(20q) and i(7q) in one. The following tests did not distinguish patients with CMCA from other SDS patients: severity of peripheral cytopenia, fetal hemoglobin levels, percentage of marrow CD34+ cells, colony growth from marrow CD34+ cells, cluster-to-colony ratio, marrow stromal function, percentage of marrow apoptosis cells, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor expression. RAS and p53 mutation analysis and AML blast colony assays were uniformly negative. No patients showed progression into more advanced stages of MDS or into AML. In one patient, the abnormal clone became undetectable after 2 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that although CMCA in SDS is high, progression into advanced stages of MDS or to overt AML may be slow and difficult to predict. Treatment should be cautious since some abnormal clones can regress.","['Dror, Yigal', 'Durie, Peter', 'Ginzberg, Hedy', 'Herman, Rebecca', 'Banerjee, Anu', 'Champagne, Martin', 'Shannon, Kevin', 'Malkin, David', 'Freedman, Melvin H']","['Dror Y', 'Durie P', 'Ginzberg H', 'Herman R', 'Banerjee A', 'Champagne M', 'Shannon K', 'Malkin D', 'Freedman MH']","['Department of Paediatrics, Divisions of Hematology and Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. yigal.dror@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Apoptosis', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/blood/genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Disease Progression', 'Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/analysis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes, p53', 'Genes, ras', 'Growth Disorders/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Syndrome', 'fas Receptor/analysis']",2002/07/24 10:00,2002/08/30 10:01,['2002/07/24 10:00'],"['2002/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02008159 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00815-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Jul;30(7):659-69. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00815-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting protein was soluble and single-step purified to homogeneity by metal chelating affinity chromatography. After cleavage of the purified His(6)-tagged TFAR19 sample with hydroxylamine, highly purified untagged TFAR19 protein was then obtained through an FPLC Resource Q column. The structural characteristics and function of the His(6)-tagged and untagged TFAR19 proteins were studied using circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence, and ANS-binding fluorescence spectra and apoptosis activity assay. The results show that alpha-helix is the main secondary structure of the proteins and the two forms of TFAR19 protein fold properly, which correspond well to their apoptosis activity expression. The results also indicate that the extra sequence including the His(6)-tag fused to the N-terminus of TFAR19 protein has a minimal effect on its structure and function, suggesting that the His(6)-tagged TFAR19 protein could be further used as an immobilized target for finding potential proteins which interact with TFAR19 from a cDNA library using in vitro ribosome display technique.","['Feng, Yan-ming', 'Zhang, Ying-mei', 'Jing, Guo-zhong']","['Feng YM', 'Zhang YM', 'Jing GZ']","[""National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Academia Sinica, Beijing 100101, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Protein Expr Purif,Protein expression and purification,9101496,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PDCD5 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', '*Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Histidine', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Solubility', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",2002/07/24 10:00,2003/04/18 05:00,['2002/07/24 10:00'],"['2002/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/18 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1046592802000165 [pii]', '10.1016/s1046-5928(02)00016-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Protein Expr Purif. 2002 Jul;25(2):323-9. doi: 10.1016/s1046-5928(02)00016-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such investigations would be facilitated by the availability of significant amounts of purified HOX11 protein. However, expression of full-length HOX11 in bacteria has been reported to be problematic owing to fusion protein instability. Here, we report the purification of human HOX11 expressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble and functional glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. In addition, a mutant version of HOX11 was produced (HOX11 Delta H3) which lacked the DNA-recognition helix (helix 3) of the homeodomain. Through a single purification procedure using glutathione-Sepharose, 2mg of the recombinant proteins were obtained per liter of bacterial culture. Notably, recombinant GST-HOX11 fusion proteins had a markedly higher stability when purified at low temperature (4 degrees C). Purification to near-homogeneity was achieved as judged by SDS-PAGE and the purified proteins were recognized by anti-HOX11 antibodies.

The multi-domain structure of the bivalent immunotoxin hinders efficient production in Escherichia coli and most eukaryotes are sensitive to the toxin. However, Pichia pastoris has a tolerance to levels of DT (diphtheria toxin) that were previously observed to intoxicate wild type eukaryotic cells, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This tolerance has permitted the optimization of the secreted expression of A-dmDT390-bisFv(G(4)S) in P. pastoris under the control of AOX1 (alcohol oxidase 1) promoter. The original DNA sequence of A-dmDT390-bisFv(G(4)S) was not expressed in P. pastoris because of several AT-rich regions, which induce an early termination of transcription. After DNA rebuilding for abolishing AT-rich regions and codon optimization, the immunotoxin could be expressed up to 10mg/L in the shake flask culture. No differences in the expression levels of immunotoxin were observed by using different secretional signal sequences, Mut(s) (methanol utilization slow phenotype) or Mut(+) (methanol utilization plus phenotype) phenotypes. Buffered complex medium (pH 7.0) having 1% casamino acids provided the highest expression in shake flask culture and PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in the range of 1 to 3mM further improved the expression level presumably by inhibiting protein degradation. The immunotoxin was purified by DEAE (diethylaminoethyl) Sepharose ion exchange chromatography and Protein L affinity chromatography.

Bone marrow was hypocellular with 48% blasts, which were positive for myeloperoxidase, CD13 and CD33. Chromosome analysis showed 46,XY, t(9;11) (p21;q23) in all 20 metaphase spreads. He was diagnosed as having therapy-related acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Because of hypoplastic bone marrow, induction therapy with the CAG regimen including cytarabine, aclarubicin and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was started, but no apparent effect was observed. The patient was then treated with the AVG regimen comprising 250 micrograms of G-CSF and continuous infusion with 20 mg of cytarabine and 50 mg of etoposide for 14 days. Complete hematological and cytogenetic remission was achieved after two courses of the AVG regimen. Although it has been shown that the CAG regimen is effective for refractory and/or secondary AML, our results indicate that the AVG regimen should be tried for cases of AML resistant to the CAG regimen.","['Yamamoto, Katsuya', 'Nagata, Kaoru', 'Morita, Yuriko', 'Hamaguchi, Hiroyuki']","['Yamamoto K', 'Nagata K', 'Morita Y', 'Hamaguchi H']","['Department of Hematology, Musashino Red Cross Hospital.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Remission Induction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2002/07/24 10:00,2002/08/07 10:01,['2002/07/24 10:00'],"['2002/07/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/24 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2002 Jun;43(6):488-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have exploited this in the development of a model system for studying the virus particle assembly pathway for bovine leukemia virus (BLV). BLV is closely related to the human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLVs), and all are members of the Deltaretrovirus genus of the Retroviridae family. Overexpression of a BLV Gag polyprotein containing a carboxy-terminal influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag in mammalian cells led to the robust production of virus-like particles (VLPs). Site-directed mutations were introduced into HA-tagged Gag to test the usefulness of this model system for studying certain aspects of the virus assembly pathway. First, mutations that disrupted the amino-terminal glycine residue that is important for Gag myristylation led to a drastic reduction in VLP production. Predictably, the nature of the VLP production defect was correlated to Gag membrane localization. Second, mutation of the PPPY motif (located in the MA domain) greatly reduced VLP production in the absence of the viral protease. This reduction in VLP production was more severe in the presence of an active viral protease. Examination of particles by electron microscopy revealed an abundance of particles that began to pinch off from the plasma membrane but were not completely released from the cell surface, indicating that the PPPY motif functions as a late domain (L domain).","['Wang, Huating', 'Norris, Kendra M', 'Mansky, Louis M']","['Wang H', 'Norris KM', 'Mansky LM']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Genes, gag', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Virus Assembly']",2002/07/23 10:00,2002/08/24 10:01,['2002/07/23 10:00'],"['2002/07/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.16.8485-8493.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Aug;76(16):8485-93. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.16.8485-8493.2002.,,,,,PMC155129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incorporation of the codon-modified SV40 NLS into IN, however, altered the packaging of the Gag-Pol precursor in the virus; viral particles contained decreased levels of reverse transcriptase (RT) and IN. In addition, the virus showed delayed kinetics of viral DNA synthesis upon infection. A panel of infectious MuLVs containing alternative IN-NLS fusions was generated and assayed for cell cycle-independent infection.

Although a mutant Mo-MLV RT lacking the C helix (DeltaC RT) retains DNA polymerase activity on homopolymeric substrates and partial RNase H activity, reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome in vivo is defective. To identify the essential features of the C helix, a panel of Mo-MLV RT mutants was generated. Analyses of these mutant viruses revealed the importance of residues H594, I597, R601, and G602. The mutants were tested for their ability to synthesize viral DNA after acute infections and to form proper 5' and 3' viral DNA ends. The mutant RTs were tested in vitro for exogenous RT activity, minus-strand strong-stop DNA synthesis in endogenous RT reactions, nonspecific RNase H activity, and finally, proper cleavage at the polypurine tract-U3 junction. The R601A mutant was the most defective mutant both in vivo and in vitro and possessed very little RNase H activity. The H594A, I597A, and G602A mutants had significant reductions in RNase H activity and in their rates of viral replication. Many of the mutants formed improper viral DNA ends and were less efficient in PPT-U3 recognition and cleavage in vitro. The data show that the C helix plays a crucial role for overall RNase H cleavage activity.

Previous studies suggested that Rmcf resistance is mediated by expression of an interfering MCF MLV envelope (Env) gene. To characterize this env gene, we examined resistance in crosses between Rmcf(r) DBA/2 mice and Mus castaneus, a species that lacks endogenous MCF env sequences. In backcross progeny, inheritance of Rmcf resistance correlated with inheritance of a specific endogenous MCF virus env-containing 4.6-kb EcoRI fragment. This fragment was present in the DBA/2N substrain with Rmcf-mediated resistance but not in virus-susceptible DBA/2J substrain mice. This fragment contains a provirus with a 5' long terminal repeat and the 5' half of env; the gag and pol genes have been partially deleted. The Env sequence is identical to that of a highly immunogenic viral glycoprotein expressed in the DBA/2 cell line L5178Y and closely resembles the env genes of modified polytropic proviruses.

We recently identified two host cell proteins, FeLIX and Pit1, that are necessary for infection by cytopathic, T-cell-tropic feline leukemia viruses (FeLV-T). Pit1 is a classic multiple transmembrane protein used as a receptor by several other simple retroviruses, including subgroup B FeLV (FeLV-B), and FeLIX is a secreted cellular protein expressed from endogenous FeLV-related sequences (enFeLV). FeLIX is nearly identical to FeLV-B envelope sequences that encode the N-terminal half of the viral surface unit (SU), because these FeLV-B sequences are acquired by recombination with enFeLV. FeLV-B SUs can functionally substitute for FeLIX in mediating FeLV-T infection. Both of these enFeLV-derived cofactors can efficiently facilitate FeLV-T infection only of cells expressing Pit1, not of cells expressing the related transport protein Pit2. We therefore have used chimeric Pit1/Pit2 receptors to map the determinants for cofactor binding and FeLV-T infection. Three distinct determinants appear to be required for cofactor-dependent infection by FeLV-T. We also found that Pit1 sequences within these same domains were required for binding by FeLIX to the Pit receptor. In contrast, these determinants were not all required for receptor binding by the FeLV-B SU cofactors used in this study. These data indicate that cofactor binding is not sufficient for FeLV-T infection and suggest that there may be a direct interaction between FeLV-T and the Pit1 receptor.","['Lauring, Adam S', 'Cheng, Heather H', 'Eiden, Maribeth V', 'Overbaugh, Julie']","['Lauring AS', 'Cheng HH', 'Eiden MV', 'Overbaugh J']","['Program in Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Washington, Seattle, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (FeLIX protein, feline leukemia virus)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Receptors, Virus/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology/virology']",2002/07/23 10:00,2002/08/24 10:01,['2002/07/23 10:00'],"['2002/07/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.16.8069-8078.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Aug;76(16):8069-78. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.16.8069-8078.2002.,"['R01 CA051080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2 T32 CA09229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 51080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC155116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their entry into the host cell is supposed to be mediated by interactions of the extracellular (SU) envelope glycoproteins with cellular receptors. To gain insight into the mechanisms governing this process, we investigated the ability of SU proteins to interact with specific ligands. In particular, by affinity chromatography, we have shown that BLV SU protein specifically interacted with zinc ions. To identify the protein domains involved in binding, 16 peptides distributed along the sequence were tested. Two of them appeared to be able to interact with zinc. To unravel the role of these SU regions in the biology of the virus, mutations were introduced into the env gene of a BLV molecular clone in order to modify residues potentially interacting with zinc. The fusogenic capacity of envelope mutated within the first zinc-binding region (104 to 123) was completely abolished. Furthermore, the integrity of this domain was also required for in vivo infectivity. In contrast, mutations within the second zinc-binding region (218 to 237) did not hamper the fusogenic capacity; indeed, the syncytia were even larger. In sheep, mutations in region 218 to 237 did not alter infectivity or viral spread. Finally, we demonstrated that the envelope of the related HTLV-1 was also able to bind zinc. Interestingly, zinc ions were found to be associated with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Friend murine leukemia virus (Fr-MLV) SU glycoprotein, further supporting their relevance in SU structure. Based on the sequence similarities shared with the Fr-MLV RBD, whose three-dimensional structure has been experimentally determined, we located the BLV zinc-binding peptide 104-123 on the opposite side of the potential receptor-binding surface. This observation supports the hypothesis that zinc ions could mediate interactions of the SU RBD either with the C-terminal part of SU, thereby contributing to the SU structural integrity, or with a partner(s) different from the receptor.","['Gatot, Jean-Stephane', 'Callebaut, Isabelle', 'Van Lint, Carine', 'Demonte, Dominique', 'Kerkhofs, Pierre', 'Portetelle, Daniel', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Willems, Luc', 'Kettmann, Richard']","['Gatot JS', 'Callebaut I', 'Van Lint C', 'Demonte D', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Portetelle D', 'Burny A', 'Willems L', 'Kettmann R']","['Unite de Biologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Faculte Universitaire des Sciences Agronomiques, Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (SU protein, Bovine immunodeficiency-like virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Cysteine/chemistry', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/etiology', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', 'Virulence', 'Zinc/*metabolism']",2002/07/23 10:00,2002/08/24 10:01,['2002/07/23 10:00'],"['2002/07/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.16.7956-7967.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Aug;76(16):7956-67. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.16.7956-7967.2002.,,,,,PMC155115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in the present study with Friend murine retrovirus (FV), the reverse was also found to be true. In the absence of a responder H-2(b) allele at major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II loci, a single H-2D(b) MHC class I allele was sufficient for the development of a CD4(+) Th1 response to FV. This effect of H-2D(b) on CD4(+) T-cell responses was dependent on CD8(+) T cells, as demonstrated by depletion studies. A direct effect of CD8(+) T-cell help in the development of CD4(+) Th1 responses to FV was also shown in vaccine studies. Vaccination of nonresponder H-2(a/a) mice induced FV-specific responses of H-2D(d)-restricted CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Adoptive transfer of vaccine-primed CD8(+) T cells to naive H-2(a/a) mice prior to infection resulted in the generation of FV-specific CD4(+) Th1 responses. This novel helper effect of CD8(+) T cells could be an important mechanism in the development of CD4(+) Th1 responses following vaccinations that induce CD8(+) CTL responses. The ability of MHC class I genes to facilitate CD4(+) Th1 development could also be considerable evolutionary advantage by allowing a wider variety of MHC genotypes to generate protective immune responses against intracellular pathogens.","['Peterson, Karin E', 'Stromnes, Ingunn', 'Messer, Ron', 'Hasenkrug, Kim', 'Chesebro, Bruce']","['Peterson KE', 'Stromnes I', 'Messer R', 'Hasenkrug K', 'Chesebro B']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana 59840, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', '*Genes, MHC Class I', 'Genes, MHC Class II', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Congenic', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae Infections/etiology/genetics/*immunology', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/etiology/genetics/*immunology']",2002/07/23 10:00,2002/08/24 10:01,['2002/07/23 10:00'],"['2002/07/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.16.7942-7948.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Aug;76(16):7942-8. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.16.7942-7948.2002.,,,,,PMC155146,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disruption of this gene results in a leukemia-like disease in mice. To investigate the role of ICSBP in myeloid cell development, lineage marker-negative (Lin(-)) bone marrow progenitor cells were purified from ICSBP(+/+) and ICSBP(-/-) mice and tested for gene expression and colony-forming ability. ICSBP was expressed in Lin(-) progenitor cells, and its levels were markedly increased by IFN-gamma. The colony-forming potential of ICSBP(-/-) progenitor cells was grossly abnormal, as they gave rise to a disproportionately high number of granulocyte colonies and many fewer macrophage colonies. IFN-gamma inhibited colony formation, while promoting macrophage maturation in ICSBP(+/+) cells. In contrast, the effects of IFN-gamma were completely absent in ICSBP(-/-) progenitors. By retrovirus transduction we tested whether reintroduction of ICSBP restores a normal colony-forming potential in -/- progenitor cells. The wild-type ICSBP, but not transcriptionally defective mutants, corrected abnormal colony formation by increasing macrophage colonies and decreasing granulocyte colonies. Taken together, ICSBP plays a critical role in myeloid cell development by controlling lineage selection and is indispensable for IFN-gamma-dependent modulation of progenitor cell maturation.","['Tsujimura, Hideki', 'Nagamura-Inoue, Tokiko', 'Tamura, Tomohiko', 'Ozato, Keiko']","['Tsujimura H', 'Nagamura-Inoue T', 'Tamura T', 'Ozato K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Growth Regulation, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*physiology', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",2002/07/23 10:00,2002/08/14 10:01,['2002/07/23 10:00'],"['2002/07/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.3.1261 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Aug 1;169(3):1261-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.3.1261.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After treatment of HMBA, the percentages of cyclin A positive K562 leukemia cells in control group and groups with 1, 2, and 4 mmol/L HMBA were 34.4% +/- 5.2%, 16.1% +/- 2.5%, 9.9% +/- 1.7%, and 7.6% +/- 2.0% respectively (P < 0.01). No drug-related apoptosis was found in both cell lines. CONCLUSION: HMBA inhibits cell proliferation and reduces S-phase-fraction in both cell lines dose-dependently through down-regulating the expression of cyclin A. Apoptosis is not a consequence of the proceeding mitosis arrest and is induced p53-dependently by HMBA. In both leukemia cell lines (U937 and K562) lacking wt-p53, a nonapoptotic death pathway may exist during HMBA induction.","['Yu, Hui', 'Lu, Huazhong', 'Zheng, Bin', 'Fan, Huahua', 'Xie, Yi']","['Yu H', 'Lu H', 'Zheng B', 'Fan H', 'Xie Y']","['Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Medical Center of Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin A/biosynthesis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel/methods', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia', 'S Phase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2002/07/23 10:00,2002/09/26 06:00,['2002/07/23 10:00'],"['2002/07/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2002/07/23 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2002 Apr 25;82(8):549-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with acute leukemia (n = 21) and chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 17) and severe aplastic anemia (n = 1) were treated with allo-PBSCT from HLA matched siblings (n = 36) or unrelated donors (n = 3). Twenty-six patients were in CsA + MTX group. CsA was given at a dosage of 2 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) by continuous intravenous injection for 24 h, since on day(-1) and injection of CsA was changed to oral administration of CsA around day 18. CsA was tapered by 10% per week after day + 90. MTX was given at the dosage of 15 mg at day + 1, and 10 mg at day + 3, + 6 and + 11, respectively. Thirteen patients were included in MMF + CsA + MTX group with the same dosage of CsA and MTX as above but omitted at day + 11. MMF of 2 g/day was added orally from day + 1 to day + 28 post transplantation. RESULTS: All patients in both groups were successfully engrafted. The days of recovery of neutrophils and platelets were not significantly different between two groups (P > 0.05). The incidence of acute GVHD in MMF + CsA + MTX group (7.6%) was significantly lower than that in CsA/MTX group (46.2%, P < 0.05). Incidence of grade II approximately IV GVHD in MMF group was 0 while that in control group was 23.0%. The incidence of severe mucositis was lower in MMF group (15.4%) than in the control group (30.8%) (P < 0.05).

METHOD: Twelve patients with leukemia, including 4 in complete remission, whose HLAs were full matched with donors, and 8 with refractory leukemia, whose HLAs were mismatched, were transplanted with G-CSF mobilized allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells after conditioned with a regimen consisting of fludarabine (30 mg/m(2) x 6 days), busulfan (4 mg/kg x 2 days) and cyclophosphamide (30 approximately 60 mg/kg x 2 days) (FBC). Donor lymphocytes were infused at day + 30, + 60 and + 90 after transplantation, respectively. Hematopoietic reconstitution was observed.

METHODS: Different clone strains of HL60-n cells were established by limited dilution and their biological features were compared with parental HL-60 cells. RESULTS: The colony yields in soft agar, especially the large colony yields of the high tumorigenic clone strains HL60-n/A, HL60-n/B were significantly higher than that of the HL-60 cells (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference between the low tumorigenic clone strains HL60-n/E, HL60-n/F and the HL-60 cells. Ultrastructurally, the nucleus was highly abnormal, the euchromatic element of nuclear chromatin increased, the heterochromatin sparse, and the microfilaments in cytoplasm increased and disarranged in the high tumorigenic cells as compared with HL-60 cells. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometer showed higher S phase fractions in the high tumorigenic cells. The killing activities of NK cells to the high tumorigenic clone strains were significant lower than to the contrast (P < 0.01). The histopathological features produced by the low tumorigenic leukemia cells showed that there were many inflammatory cells infiltrated, the majority of them were lymphocytes, and many tumor cells were killed especially in vessel abundant areas. By contrast, there were few inflammatory cells infiltrated in the tumors produced by the high tumorigenic cell strains.

Loss of p73 expression was significantly associated with the reduced disease free survival and overall survival of the patients. 39.3% (24/61) of the ALL cell lines showed hypermethylation of p73 exon 1, while normal lymphocytes and most cell lines expressed p73 mRNA were not hypermethylated. CONCLUSION: There was a higher negative expression rate of p73 mRNA in childhood ALL. The main mechanism of the loss expression would be the hypermethylation of p73 gene. p73 gene inactivation might play an important role in the pathogenesis of ALL. Examination of p73 mRNA might have clinical significance in predicting prognosis of childhood ALL.","['Liu, Mingli', 'Li, Rongsheng', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide', 'Zhu, Gujian', 'Guo, Shanchun']","['Liu M', 'Li R', 'Hayashi Y', 'Zhu G', 'Guo S']","['Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Line/classification/cytology/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/07/23 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/07/23 10:00'],"['2002/07/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/23 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2002 May;23(5):239-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 19 patients received URD-BMT in our institute from August 1998 to February 20, 2001. The diagnoses included chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (n = 9), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 6), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (n = 2), MDS-RAEB (n = 1) and beta-thalassemia major (n = 1). 19 pairs were HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DR matched with low resolution technique; 8 of them were HLA-A, B or DRB1 mismatched with high resolution technique. 2 patients received a TBI conditioning regimen, the other 17 received BUCY or modified BUCY regimen. Bone marrow was infused to 18 recipients via aorta and one through intravenous route. As graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, all patients received CSA and MTX, 9 patients received ATG, 1 patient received CD(3)/CD(25) and 7 patients received mycophenolate mofetil. T-cell depletion technique was applied in one patient. Statistics Kaplan-Meier plots for time-dependent analysis (survival, acute GVHD and engraft). Fisher' exact test was used for univariate analysis of risk factors. RESULTS: Apart from 2 patients who were under observation and one patient with CML suffered from late rejection. 16 out of the 19 patients had all been persistently engrafted. Relapse happened on day 60 in one patient who had advanced refractory ALL. Early infection within 5 weeks after BMT with discernable pathogens was documented in 5 patients. CMV infection occurred in 10 patients. 13 out of the 19 patients have survived. The disease free survival rate was 58.3%. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grades II approximately IV was 53.0%. CONCLUSION: Even if the results of using HLA identical unrelated donor marrow are encouraging, the high transplantation related mortality due to infection and GVHD is a major challenge. It is not likely that this technique will be extensively used. However, in cases of high risk acute leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia without appropriate related donor, URD-BMT might be a therapeutic measure.","['Xu, Lanping', 'Huang, Xiaojun', 'Ren, Hanyun', 'Zhang, Yaoshen', 'Guo, Nailian', 'Lu, Daopei']","['Xu L', 'Huang X', 'Ren H', 'Zhang Y', 'Guo N', 'Lu D']","[""Peking University Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/immunology', 'Child', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology/*mortality/pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology/*mortality/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/07/23 10:00,2002/09/20 10:01,['2002/07/23 10:00'],"['2002/07/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/23 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2002 Apr;41(4):256-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The protein expression of cyclin E, p27, p170 and cell cycle distribution was measured in the bone marrow samples of 60 adult patients with AL and 17 controls with flow cytometric analysis. The mRNA levels of cyclin E, p27, MRP in 46 cases of AL and 17 controls were examined with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: The expression of cyclin E in AL patients was higher than that in controls (P < 0.01), so was the expression of p27 (P < 0.05). However in G(2)/M phase the expression rate of cyclin E in AL patients was not so apparently different with that in control (P < 0.05) so was that of p27 (P > 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the protein expression of cyclin E and p27. The remission rate (44.8%) in patients with over expression of cyclin E was lower than that (77.4%) in patients with normal expression of cyclin E (P < 0.01). The relapse rate (92.3%) in over expression group was higher than that (41.7%) in normal expression group (P = 0.003). No significant difference in remission rate or relapse rate was found between p27 over expression group and normal expression group (P > 0.50, P = 0.89). CONCLUSION: Over expression of cyclin E may implicate occurrence and progression of AL. Over expression of cyclin E is an important influential factor for remission rate and relapse rate in AL patients.","['Wang, Ying', 'Xu, Shirong', 'Guo, Xiaonan', 'Lin, Fengru', 'Liu, Linna', 'Du, Xingyan']","['Wang Y', 'Xu S', 'Guo X', 'Lin F', 'Liu L', 'Du X']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital, Heibei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cyclin E/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'S Phase', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",2002/07/23 10:00,2002/10/04 04:00,['2002/07/23 10:00'],"['2002/07/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/23 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2002 May;41(5):333-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of sepsis-induced activation of the coagulation system in the pathophysiology of severe sepsis. Activated protein C is an important modulator of coagulation and inflammatory derangements during severe sepsis. Low levels of protein C occur in severe sepsis and are predictive of poor outcome. Recombinant human activated protein C (drotrecogin alfa (activated)) was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for severe sepsis. The phase III trial that resulted in the approval of this agent, however, enrolled a general sepsis population and excluded patients undergoing HSCT. We report a case of fulminant septic shock and multiple organ failure after HSCT that was treated with drotrecogin alfa (activated) in addition to standard therapy, and recovered. The high mortality rates of patients who develop severe sepsis after HSCT demand that new avenues of treatment be considered for this very high-risk patient population. This case illustrates the potential application of a novel therapeutic approach. Clinical trials are warranted to further investigate the safety and efficacy of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in patients with severe sepsis after HSCT.","['Pastores, S M', 'Papadopoulos, E', 'van den Brink, M', 'Alicea, M', 'Halpern, N A']","['Pastores SM', 'Papadopoulos E', 'van den Brink M', 'Alicea M', 'Halpern NA']","['Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue M-210, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Protein C)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'JGH8MYC891 (drotrecogin alfa activated)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/therapy', 'Multiple Organ Failure/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Protein C/*administration & dosage', 'Recombinant Proteins/*administration & dosage', 'Shock, Septic/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/07/20 10:00,2003/07/16 05:00,['2002/07/20 10:00'],"['2002/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703618 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2002 Jul;30(2):131-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703618.,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy of this procedure is due to both myeloablative conditioning and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL). However, the disadvantages of allogeneic transplantation include graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse from the original tumor, and patient susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Lately, allogeneic transplantation has been developed to treat solid tumors, with the expectation that graft-versus-tumor (GVT), like GVL, will have a significant anti-tumor effect. This effect has been demonstrated in renal carcinomas, and with less evidence in breast cancers. Five patients with malignant ovarian tumors resistant to chemotherapy underwent allogeneic transplantation, four from bone marrow, and one from peripheral blood stem cells. All donors were HLA-identical siblings. One patient received a myeloablative conditioning regimen, while the other four received a non-myeloablative regimen. Two patients received donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). Four of the patients presented with acute or chronic GVHD associated with tumor regression of at least 50%. These tumor regressions were measured by CA-125 levels and CT scans. The fifth patient died of rapid progression just after transplantation. Of the four transplantation survivors, three received a non-myeloablative regimen which did not seem to reduce treatment effectiveness. While it did reduce toxicity, one of these patients died of GVHD after 127 days. DLI was administered to two patients. These infusions seemed to promote GVHD which was able to control disease progression for one patient and had no apparent effect on the other. Allograft of hematopoietic stem cells might be of interest in ovarian cancer. The results in one patient also suggest that DLI may be an effective immunotherapy, although doses and timing need to be determined. The number of cases presented is small, however, and clinical experience on a larger scale will be required to determine the real clinical efficacy of graft versus cancerous ovarian cells.","['Bay, J-O', 'Fleury, J', 'Choufi, B', 'Tournilhac, O', 'Vincent, C', 'Bailly, C', 'Dauplat, J', 'Viens, P', 'Faucher, C', 'Blaise, D']","['Bay JO', 'Fleury J', 'Choufi B', 'Tournilhac O', 'Vincent C', 'Bailly C', 'Dauplat J', 'Viens P', 'Faucher C', 'Blaise D']","['Unite de Transplantation Medullaire, Centre Jean Perrin, Centre de Lutte Contre le Cancer, 58 rue Montalembert, BP 392, 63011 Clermont-Ferrand cedex 1, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Middle Aged', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/mortality', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",2002/07/20 10:00,2003/07/16 05:00,['2002/07/20 10:00'],"['2001/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703609 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2002 Jul;30(2):95-102. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703609.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the effects of dexamethasone on mast cell activation induced by A(3) receptor stimulation in vivo. Administration of the A(3) receptor agonist APNEA [N(6)-2-(4 aminophenyl)ethyladenosine; 10-30 microg kg(-1) i.v.] to anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats induced falls in blood pressure. Pretreatment with dexamethasone (1 mg kg(-1), i.p., -24 h) blocked the hypotensive response to APNEA but not those induced by the A(1) receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine, the A(2A) receptor agonist 2-[p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine, or the mast cell degranulating agent compound 48/80 (100-300 microg kg(-1), i.v.). APNEA (10 and 30 microg kg(-1), i.v.) and compound 48/80 (100 and 300 microg kg(-1), i.v.) increased plasma histamine concentrations dose dependently. Pretreatment with dexamethasone significantly inhibited the increases induced by the lower doses of each compound. APNEA induced degranulation of mast cells in thymus but not in skin or skeletal muscle, whereas compound 48/80 induced degranulation in each tissue. Pretreatment with dexamethasone inhibited APNEA-induced degranulation of mast cells in the thymus and slightly, yet significantly, reduced degranulation induced by compound 48/80. Thus, in contrast to the findings in RBL-2H3 cells in vitro, in the whole animal, dexamethasone down-regulates the response of the mast cell to A(3) receptor activation. The qualitatively similar effects on compound 48/80 suggest that dexamethasone suppresses mast cell responsiveness by modulating site(s) downstream from the adenosine A(3) receptor, possibly at the level of the G(i) family of trimeric GTP-binding proteins.","['Hannon, Jason P', 'Tigani, Bruno', 'Schuurman, Henk-Jan', 'Fozard, John R']","['Hannon JP', 'Tigani B', 'Schuurman HJ', 'Fozard JR']","['Research Department, Novartis Pharma AG, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Phenethylamines)', '0 (Purinergic P1 Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Receptor, Adenosine A3)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P1)', ""120225-54-9 (2-(4-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino)-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine)"", '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apnea/etiology/physiopathology', 'Blood Pressure/drug effects', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Heart Rate/drug effects/physiology', 'Histamine/blood', 'Hypotension/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Phenethylamines/pharmacology', 'Purinergic P1 Receptor Antagonists', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor, Adenosine A3', 'Receptors, Purinergic P1/drug effects/*physiology']",2002/07/20 10:00,2002/08/30 10:01,['2002/07/20 10:00'],"['2002/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/jpet.102.035790 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2002 Aug;302(2):725-30. doi: 10.1124/jpet.102.035790.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism by which the inhibition of this enzyme results in increased drug retention and cytotoxicity remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the respective role of ceramide (Cer) accumulation and Glu-Cer derivatives depletion in MDR reversal effect of 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanolol (PDMP), a Glu-Cer synthase inhibitor. We show here that treatment with PDMP resulted in increased rhodamine 123 (Rh123) retention and potent chemosensitization of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-expressing cells, including KG1a cells, KG1a/200 cells, K562/138 cells, and K562/mdr-1 cells. Metabolic studies revealed that PDMP induced not only time-dependent Cer accumulation but also reduction of all glycosylated forms of Cer, including Glu-Cer, lactosylceramide (Lac-Cer), monosialo ganglioside (GM3) and disialo ganglioside (GD3). The influence of these metabolites on P-gp function was investigated by measuring Rh123 retention in PDMP-treated cells. P-gp function was found to be stimulated only by the addition of gangliosides in all resistant cell lines, whereas Glu-Cer, Lac-Cer, and Cer had no effect. Moreover, in KG1a/200 cells, GD3 and, to a lesser extent, GM3 were found to phosphorylate P-gp on serine residues. Altogether, these results suggest that, at least in leukemic cells, gangliosides depletion accounts for PDMP-mediated MDR reversal effect, and that gangliosides are important P-gp regulators perhaps through their capacity to modulate P-gp phosphorylation.","['Plo, Isabelle', 'Lehne, Gustav', 'Beckstrom, Karen Johanne', 'Maestre, Nicolas', 'Bettaieb, Ali', 'Laurent, Guy', 'Lautier, Dominique']","['Plo I', 'Lehne G', 'Beckstrom KJ', 'Maestre N', 'Bettaieb A', 'Laurent G', 'Lautier D']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) E9910, Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Glucosylceramides)', '0 (Lactosylceramides)', '0 (Morpholines)', '038753E78J (N-caproylsphingosine)', '4682-48-8 (CDw17 antigen)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '73257-80-4 (RV 538)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/drug effects/*physiology', 'Acute Disease', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Ceramides/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Gangliosides/pharmacology', 'Glucosylceramides/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lactosylceramides/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Sphingosine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2002/07/20 10:00,2002/08/06 10:01,['2002/07/20 10:00'],"['2002/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.62.2.304 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2002 Aug;62(2):304-12. doi: 10.1124/mol.62.2.304.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently cloned a novel member of the PDGFbetaR fusion oncogene family, rabaptin-5-PDGFbetaR. A patient with CMML carrying the rabaptin-5-PDGFbetaR fusion gene underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and was monitored closely with a sensitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain assay to detect the novel fusion gene transcript. After achieving a molecular remission at 5 months after transplantation, 15 months after SCT the patient showed persistent and progressive evidence of molecular relapse. After demonstrating in vitro that cells transformed with this specific fusion oncogene are efficiently killed by STI571, the patient was started on STI571.

Of current major concern is the mechanism by which a PNH clone expands. Many reports have suggested that an immune mechanism operates to cause bone marrow failure in some patients with PNH, aplastic anemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes. Because blood cells of PNH phenotype are often found in patients with these marrow diseases, one hypothesis is that the PNH clone escapes immune attack, producing a survival advantage by immunoselection. To test this hypothesis, we examined the sensitivity of blood cells, with or without PIG-A mutations, to killing by natural killer (NK) cells, using 51Cr-release assay in vitro. To both peripheral blood and cultured NK cells, PIG-A mutant cells prepared from myeloid and lymphoid leukemic cell lines were less susceptible than their control counterparts (reverted from the mutant cells by transfection with a PIG-A cDNA). NK activity was completely abolished with concanamycin A and by calcium chelation, indicating that killing was perforin-dependent. There were no differences in major histocompatibility (MHC) class I expression or sensitivity to either purified perforin or to interleukin-2-activated NK cells between PIG-A mutant and control cells. From these results, we infer that PIG-A mutant cells lack molecules needed for NK activation or to trigger perforin-mediated killing. Our experiments suggest that PIG-A mutations confer a relative survival advantage to a PNH clone, contributing to selective expansion of these cells in the setting of marrow injury by cytotoxic lymphocytes.","['Nagakura, Shoichi', 'Ishihara, Sonoko', 'Dunn, Daniel E', 'Nishimura, Jun-ichi', 'Kawaguchi, Tatsuya', 'Horikawa, Kentaro', 'Hidaka, Michihiro', 'Kagimoto, Tadashi', 'Eto, Nozomu', 'Mitsuya, Hiroaki', 'Kinoshita, Taroh', 'Young, Neal S', 'Nakakuma, Hideki']","['Nagakura S', 'Ishihara S', 'Dunn DE', 'Nishimura J', 'Kawaguchi T', 'Horikawa K', 'Hidaka M', 'Kagimoto T', 'Eto N', 'Mitsuya H', 'Kinoshita T', 'Young NS', 'Nakakuma H']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (phosphatidylinositol glycan-class A protein)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/genetics', 'Clone Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Mutation/*immunology', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Transfection']",2002/07/20 10:00,2002/09/07 10:01,['2002/07/20 10:00'],"['2002/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v100.3.1031 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59407-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Aug 1;100(3):1031-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v100.3.1031.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite strong efficacy of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571, resistance has been observed in a significant proportion of patients in advanced CML stage or in Ph-positive acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). We investigated in this study the mechanism of resistance to STI571 through point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain and/or BCR-ABL gene amplification in 24 patients (16 in chronic phase and 8 in accelerated phase of the disease) who obtained no cytogenetic response to STI571 treatment. Screening for the already-described Thr315Ile point mutation in the ABL domain using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (RT-PCR-RFLP) technique, 3 patients showed a proportion of mutated transcript at the time of resistance. The same technique failed to detect mutation at diagnosis, but a specific allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO)-PCR on DNA for the Thr315Ile mutation and, after sequencing, for 2 newly described Phe311Leu and Met351Thr substitutions, showed the presence of rare mutated cells prior to STI571 therapy. Furthermore, the increased proportion of mutated cells during treatment detected by ASO-PCR strongly suggested clonal selection by the functional inhibiting effect of these mutations. Finally, no BCR-ABL gene amplification was detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in the 24 STI571-resistant patients. Our data support that in CML patients treated with STI571, ABL mutations are not restricted to the accelerated phase of the disease and that, at least in some cases, mutations seem to occur prior to STI571 therapy, probably as second mutational events during the course of CML.","['Roche-Lestienne, Catherine', 'Soenen-Cornu, Valerie', 'Grardel-Duflos, Nathalie', 'Lai, Jean-Luc', 'Philippe, Nathalie', 'Facon, Thierry', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Preudhomme, Claude']","['Roche-Lestienne C', 'Soenen-Cornu V', 'Grardel-Duflos N', 'Lai JL', 'Philippe N', 'Facon T', 'Fenaux P', 'Preudhomme C']","['Unite Inserm U524, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, abl/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies']",2002/07/20 10:00,2002/09/07 10:01,['2002/07/20 10:00'],"['2002/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v100.3.1014 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59404-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Aug 1;100(3):1014-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.v100.3.1014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tRA-induced expression of RIG-G, Bfl-1/A1, and p21(waf1) and, to a lesser extent, of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-epsilon (C/EBPepsilon) are also enhanced by such combined treatments. Both responses are associated with a facilitated diminution of the leukemogenic PML-RARalpha protein and retained DeltaPML-RARalpha, a cleavage product. Treatment with tRA in tRA differentiation-resistant NB4 subclones R4 and MR-2 does not result in PML-RARalpha diminution and the tested gene expressions. Moreover, the addition of HMBA or NaB with tRA results in only minimal increase of differentiation in the tRA differentiation-resistant subclones. The increases in acetylated histone H3 (AcH3) and AcH4 in NaB-treated NB4, R4, and MR-2 cells are similar and do not correlate with the extent of differentiation induction when NaB and HMBA are given in combination with tRA. Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) treatment results in the total degradation of PML-RARalpha without increasing AcH3 or AcH4 or inducing differentiation in R4 cells. As2O3 in combination with tRA induces gene (Bfl-1/A1 and C/EBPepsilon) expression and partial differentiation. Both NaB and HMBA addition to As2O3-plus-tRA-treated R4 cells further enhances differentiation. These results suggest that elimination of the dominant negative PML-RARalpha protein is required prior to inhibition of histone deacetylase to fully overcome tRA-differentiation resistance in APL cells.","['Jing, Yongkui', 'Xia, Lijuan', 'Waxman, Samuel']","['Jing Y', 'Xia L', 'Waxman S']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029-6547, USA. yongkui.jing@mssm.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2002/07/20 10:00,2002/09/07 10:01,['2002/07/20 10:00'],"['2002/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v100.3.1008 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59403-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Aug 1;100(3):1008-13. doi: 10.1182/blood.v100.3.1008.,['5R01-CA85478/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PU.1 regulates the expression of a number of crucial myeloid genes, such as the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor, and the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor. Myeloid cells derived from PU.1(-/-) mice are blocked at the earliest stage of myeloid differentiation, similar to the blast cells that are the hallmark of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These facts led us to hypothesize that molecular abnormalities involving the PU.1 gene could contribute to the development of AML. We identified 10 mutant alleles of the PU.1 gene in 9 of 126 AML patients. The PU.1 mutations comprised 5 deletions affecting the DNA-binding domain, and 5 point mutations in 1) the DNA-binding domain (2 patients), 2) the PEST domain (2 patients), and 3) the transactivation domain (one patient). DNA binding to and transactivation of the M-CSF receptor promoter, a direct PU.1 target gene, were deficient in the 7 PU.1 mutants that affected the DNA-binding domain. In addition, these mutations decreased the ability of PU.1 to synergize with PU.1-interacting proteins such as AML1 or c-Jun in the activation of PU.1 target genes. This is the first report of mutations in the PU.1 gene in human neoplasia and suggests that disruption of PU.1 function contributes to the block in differentiation found in AML patients.","['Mueller, Beatrice U', 'Pabst, Thomas', 'Osato, Motomi', 'Asou, Norio', 'Johansen, Lisa M', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Behre, Gerhard', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Ito, Yoshiaki', 'Tenen, Daniel G']","['Mueller BU', 'Pabst T', 'Osato M', 'Asou N', 'Johansen LM', 'Minden MD', 'Behre G', 'Hiddemann W', 'Ito Y', 'Tenen DG']","['Harvard Institutes of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/pharmacology/physiology', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/pharmacology/physiology']",2002/07/20 10:00,2002/09/07 10:01,['2002/07/20 10:00'],"['2002/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v100.3.998 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59402-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Aug 1;100(3):998-1007. doi: 10.1182/blood.v100.3.998.,"['CA41456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Blood. 2002 Dec 15;100(13):4680-1.

Deregulation of beta-catenin has been implicated in the malignant transformation of cells of epithelial origin. However, a function for beta-catenin in hematologic malignancies has not been reported. beta-Catenin is not detectable in normal peripheral blood T cells but is expressed in T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and other tumor lines of hematopoietic origin and in primary lymphoid and myeloid leukemia cells. beta-Catenin function was examined in Jurkat T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Overexpression of dominant-negative beta-catenin or dominant-negative TCF reduced beta-catenin nuclear signaling and inhibited Jurkat proliferation and clonogenicity. Similarly, these constructs inhibited proliferation of K562 and HUT-102 cells. Reduction of beta-catenin expression with beta-catenin antisense down-regulated adhesion of Jurkat cells in response to phytohemagglutinin. Incubation of Jurkat cells with anti-Fas induced caspase-dependent limited proteolysis of beta-catenin N- and C-terminal regions and rapid redistribution of beta-catenin to the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton, concomitant with a marked decline in nuclear beta-catenin signaling.

A mutant of p160 v-Abl lacking the Jak1-binding region (v-Abl Delta858-1080) has a significant defect in Jak/STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) activation, cytokine-independent cell growth/survival, and tumorigenesis. To identify the pathways downstream of Jak kinases in v-Abl-mediated signaling, we examined the activation of several signaling molecules by p160 v-Abl or the v-Abl Delta858-1080 mutant. We demonstrate that, in addition to the decreased Ras activation, signaling through phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and Akt are impaired in cells expressing mutant v-Abl. The proliferative defect of v-Abl Delta858-1080 was rescued by activated v-Akt and was also moderately rescued by activated v-H-Ras. However, constitutive active phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (p110CAAX) did not complement this effect. Cells expressing v-Abl Delta858-1080 demonstrated reduced tumor formation in nude mice. In contrast, cells coexpressing v-Akt with v-Abl Delta858-1080 demonstrated reduced latency and increased frequency of tumor formation in nude nice compared with cells expressing v-Abl Delta858-1080 alone, whereas v-H-Ras or p110CAAX had minimum effects on tumor formation. These results suggest that Jak1-dependent Akt activation is important in v-Abl-mediated transformation.","['Oki, Shinji', 'Limnander, Andre', 'Danial, Nika N', 'Rothman, Paul B']","['Oki S', 'Limnander A', 'Danial NN', 'Rothman PB']","['Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032-3702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/administration & dosage/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Receptor Cross-Talk', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Signal Transduction', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2002/07/20 10:00,2002/09/07 10:01,['2002/07/20 10:00'],"['2002/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v100.3.966 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59398-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Aug 1;100(3):966-73. doi: 10.1182/blood.v100.3.966.,['R01 CA77862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the capacity of a panel of GPs of both retroviral (amphotropic murine leukemia virus [MLV-A]; gibbon ape leukemia virus [GALV]; RD114, feline endogenous virus) and nonretroviral (fowl plague virus [FPV]; Ebola virus [EboV]; vesicular stomatitis virus [VSV]; lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [LCMV]) origins to pseudotype lentiviral vectors derived from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac251). SIV vectors were efficiently pseudotyped with the FPV hemagglutinin, VSV-G, LCMV, and MLV-A GPs. In contrast, the GALV and RD114 GPs conferred much lower infectivity to the vectors. Capitalizing on the conservation of some structural features in the transmembrane domains and cytoplasmic tails of the incorporation-competent MLV-A GP and in RD114 and GALV GPs, we generated chimeric GPs encoding the extracellular and transmembrane domains of GALV or RD114 GPs fused to the cytoplasmic tail (designated TR) of MLV-A GP. Importantly, SIV-derived vectors pseudotyped with these GALV/TR and RD114/TR GP chimeras had significantly higher titers than vectors coated with the parental GPs. Additionally, RD114/TR-pseudotyped vectors were efficiently concentrated and were resistant to inactivation induced by the complement of both human and macaque sera, indicating that modified RD114 GP-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors may be of particular interest for in vivo gene transfer applications. Furthermore, as compared to vectors pseudotyped with other retroviral GPs or with VSV-G, RD114/TR-pseudotyped vectors showed augmented transduction of human and macaque primary blood lymphocytes and CD34+ cells.","['Sandrin, Virginie', 'Boson, Bertrand', 'Salmon, Patrick', 'Gay, Wilfried', 'Negre, Didier', 'Le Grand, Roger', 'Trono, Didier', 'Cosset, Francois-Loic']","['Sandrin V', 'Boson B', 'Salmon P', 'Gay W', 'Negre D', 'Le Grand R', 'Trono D', 'Cosset FL']","['Vectorologie Retrovirale & Therapie Genique, U412 INSERM, IFR 74, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'Blood Cells/*metabolism', 'Drug Stability', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics/standards', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Macaca', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",2002/07/20 10:00,2002/09/07 10:01,['2002/07/20 10:00'],"['2002/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2001-11-0042 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59380-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Aug 1;100(3):823-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2001-11-0042.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete clinical and cytogenetic data were available on all patients, and a subgroup of patients was studied for apoptosis, angiogenesis, proliferation, and growth factors. Our results demonstrate that MDS is a discrete entity that is different from AML and is characterized primarily by increased apoptosis in early and mature hematopoietic cells. Using cell sorting and loss of heterozygosity, we demonstrate that the leukemic cells from MDS patients are capable of differentiation into mature myeloid cells and monocytes. We also demonstrate that there is a significant overlap between AML and MDS when MDS is defined on the basis of an arbitrary percentage of blasts of 20% or 30%. These data suggest that despite similarities between AML and MDS in their responses to treatment and outcomes, MDS is biologically and clinically different from AML and should not be considered an early phase of AML.

Recombination experiments revealed that the cytosolic fraction of MM6 cells contains a factor that suppresses the activity of partially purified 5-LO from PMNL, RBL-1, and MM6 cells in the absence but not in the presence of Ca2+.

InsP(6) and lower inositol phosphates, in particular InsP(3), participate in important intracellular processes. In addition, InsP(6) possess significant health benefits, such as anti-cancer effect, kidney stones prevention, lowering serum cholesterol. Because of the insensitivity of existing methods for determination of non-radiolabeled inositol phosphates, little is known about the natural occurrence, much less on the concentrations of InsP(6) and InsP(3) in biological samples. Using gas chromatography-mass detection analysis of HPLC chromatographic fractions, we report a measurement of unlabeled total InsP(3) and InsP(6) (a) as they occur within cells culture, tissues, and plasma, and (b) their changes depending on the presence of exogenous InsP(6). When rats were fed on a purified diet in which InsP(6) was undetectable (AIN-76A) the levels of InsP(6) in brain were 3.35 +/- 0.57 (SE) micromol.kg(-1) and in plasma 0.023 +/- 0.008 (SE) micromol.l(-1). The presence of InsP(6) in diet dramatically influenced its levels in brain and in plasma. When rats were given an InsP(6)-sufficient diet (AIN-76A + 1% InsP(6)), the levels of InsP(6) were about 100-fold higher in brain tissues (36.8 +/- 1.8 (SE)) than in plasma (0.29 +/- 0.02 (SE)); InsP(6) concentrations were 8.5-fold higher than total InsP(3) concentrations in either plasma (0.033 +/- 0.012 (SE)) and brain (4.21 +/- 0.55 (SE)). When animals were given an InsP(6)-poor diet (AIN-76A only), there was a 90% decrease in InsP(6) content in both brain tissue and plasma (p < 0.001); however, there was no change in the level of total InsP(3). In non-stimulated malignant cells (MDA-MB 231 and K562) the InsP(6) contents were 16.2 +/- 9.1 (SE) micromol.kg(-1) for MDA-MB 231 cells and 15.6 +/- 2.7 (SE) for K 562 cells. These values were around 3-fold higher than those of InsP(3) (4.8 +/- 0.5 micromol.kg(-1) and 6.9 +/- 0.1 (SE) for MDA-MB 231 and K562 cells respectively). Treatment of malignant cells with InsP(6) resulted in a 2-fold increase in the intracellular concentrations of total InsP(3) (9.5 +/- 1.3 (SE) and 10.8 +/- 1.0 (SE) micromol.kg(-1) for MDA-MB 231 and K562 cells respectively, p < 0.05), without changes in InsP(6) levels. These results indicate that exogenous InsP(6) directly affects its physiological levels in plasma and brain of normal rats without changes on the total InsP(3) levels. Although a similar fluctuation of InsP(6) concentration was not seen in human malignant cell lines following InsP(6) treatment, an increased intracellular levels of total InsP(3) was clearly observed.","['Grases, Felix', 'Simonet, Bartolome M', 'Vucenik, Ivana', 'Perello, Joan', 'Prieto, Rafael M', 'Shamsuddin, AbulKalam M']","['Grases F', 'Simonet BM', 'Vucenik I', 'Perello J', 'Prieto RM', 'Shamsuddin AM']","['Laboratory of Renal Lithiasis Research, Faculty of Science, University of Balearic Islands, Ctra.

They can lead to aberrant expression of oncogenes or the generation of chimeric proteins. Classically, one of the products is thought to be oncogenic. For example, in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), reciprocal chromosomal translocations involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) gene lead to the formation of two fusion genes: X-RARalpha and RARalpha-X (where X is the alternative RARalpha fusion partner: PML, PLZF, NPM, NuMA and STAT 5b). The X-RARalpha fusion protein is indeed oncogenic. However, recent data indicate that the RARalpha-X product is also critical in determining the biological features of this leukemia.

However, the role of beta-catenin and its regulation in non-adherent cells has not been examined. Therefore, we examined the role and fate of beta-catenin during hematopoietic cell apoptosis using Jurkat T-acute lymphoblastic and U937 acute myeloblastic leukemia cells. The results presented here demonstrate that the treatment of Jurkat cells with the apoptosis inducers anti-Fas, TRAIL, staurosporine, and etoposide induces proteolytic fragments of beta-catenin, as did TRAIL and staurosporine in U937 cells. In Jurkat cells, beta-catenin was cleaved at both the N- and C-terminal after anti-Fas addition. Cleavage of intact beta-catenin was completely inhibited by caspase selective protease inhibitors. There was a clear accumulation of the large proteolytic fragment in Jurkat cells treated with lactacystin or N-acetyl-leucyl leucyl-methioninal (ALLM). These results suggest that both the proteasome and calpain may recognize the large beta-catenin fragment as a substrate for further degradation. Densitometric analysis demonstrated that the loss of intact beta-catenin was more rapid in the cell nucleus (beta-catenin T1/2 of approximately 1.5h in cytoplasm and 0.5h in nucleus). Down-regulation of beta-catenin-associated transcription was an early event in response to anti-Fas. These results suggest that beta-catenin plays a role in promoting Jurkat survival.","['Hwang, Sang Gu', 'Lee, Hyung Chul', 'Trepel, Jane B', 'Jeon, Byung Hun']","['Hwang SG', 'Lee HC', 'Trepel JB', 'Jeon BH']","['Department of Pathology, College of Oriental Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Chonbuk, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calpain/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*physiology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'beta Catenin', 'fas Receptor/immunology/physiology']",2002/07/20 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/07/20 10:00'],"['2002/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212602000188 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00018-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2002 Sep;26(9):863-71. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00018-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the putative protein predicted that the NAIP variant lacks part of the third BIR domain as well as the COOH-terminal tail of regular NAIP. This might suggest that it is endowed with a reduced antiapoptotic activity. This view is supported by the fact that NAIP-deltaEx10-11 mRNA and protein were much less expressed in the multidrug- and apoptosis-resistant HL60R leukemia than in its parental counterpart HL60.

Investigation of several stimulators to promote CD23a expression on CLL versus normal B-cells confirmed a different CD23 regulation in B-CLL. We did not find any evidence for a differential regulation of the two CD23 isoforms in B-CLL. However, CD23a is always predominantly expressed with a constant ratio of CD23a:CD23b. We show that antigen targeted to CD23 on CLL B-cells is very efficiently presented. Therefore, CD23 is likely to provide a suitable target for receptor-mediated antigen presentation in B-CLL which can be used to activate a T-cell response.","['Goller, Martin E', 'Kneitz, Christian', 'Mehringer, Claudia', 'Muller, Karin', 'Jelley-Gibbs, Dawn M', 'Gosselin, Edmund J', 'Wilhelm, Martin', 'Tony, Hans Peter']","['Goller ME', 'Kneitz C', 'Mehringer C', 'Muller K', 'Jelley-Gibbs DM', 'Gosselin EJ', 'Wilhelm M', 'Tony HP']","['Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Medizinische Poliklinik, University of Wurzburg, Klinikstrasse 6-8, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Endocytosis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, IgE/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",2002/07/20 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/07/20 10:00'],"['2002/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212602000073 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00007-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2002 Sep;26(9):795-802. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00007-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cell lines, from the same patient, were established from two distinct stages of PBC-ALL disease progression, namely, first and second relapse. Analysis of both cell lines with spectral karyotying (SKY) revealed an insertion of chromosome 8 into chromosome 5 and a previously undetected translocation in AT-2 involving chromosomes 1 and 17. Hybridization of cDNA microarrays identified the TCL1 transcript as being overexpressed in the AT-2 cell line relative to AT-1. Northern blot analysis showed an eightfold increase of the TCL1 transcript in AT-2 over AT-1 cells. Western blot analysis showed that the TCL1 protein was expressed more than 50-fold higher in AT-2 than AT-1 cells. TCL1 expression was correlated with TEL expression by reintroducing TEL into AT-2 cells and demonstrating that those cells expressing TEL at high levels showed a decreased expression of endogenous TCL1.","['Fears, S', 'Chakrabarti, S R', 'Nucifora, G', 'Rowley, J D']","['Fears S', 'Chakrabarti SR', 'Nucifora G', 'Rowley JD']","['Section of Hematology, Oncology Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Painting', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/deficiency/*genetics/physiology', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",2002/07/20 10:00,2002/08/09 10:01,['2002/07/20 10:00'],"['2002/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460801006550 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(01)00655-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2002 Jun;135(2):110-9. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(01)00655-0.,"['CA 42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 67189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 72675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-07009/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The up-regulation of SPI-3 mRNA expression is also confirmed by northern blotting. Most SPI-3 mRNA-positive cells simultaneously express synaptophysin, a marker for pinealocytes, but not glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker for astrocytes. This indicates that SPI-3 mRNA-positive cells are pinealocytes. Almost all SPI-3 mRNA-positive cells also showed translocation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) into nuclei after lipopolysaccharide injection. These data support previous in vitro results that SPI-3 expression is induced in a STAT3-mediated manner. In addition, the expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) mRNAs, but not of interleukin 6 receptor mRNA, was up-regulated after systemic lipopolysaccharide treatment. Because these receptors are upstream of STAT3, the present results suggest that cytokines such as LIF and/or CNTF induce SPI-3 expression via STAT3 in the pineal gland in response to inflammatory stimulus. We conclude that although the functional consequences of SPI-3 in the pineal gland during systemic inflammation are unknown, SPI-3 may have a crucial role in preventing some degenerative proteolysis induced by inflammatory stimuli.","['Takamiya, A', 'Takeda, M', 'Yoshida, A', 'Kiyama, H']","['Takamiya A', 'Takeda M', 'Yoshida A', 'Kiyama H']","['Department of Anatomy, Asahikawa Medical College, 2-1 Midorigaoka Higashi Asahikawa, Hokkaido 078-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Serpina3n protein, rat)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Pineal Gland/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Serpins', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",2002/07/20 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/07/20 10:00'],"['2002/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0306452202001987 [pii]', '10.1016/s0306-4522(02)00198-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 2002;113(2):387-94. doi: 10.1016/s0306-4522(02)00198-7.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2002 IBRO'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fourteen of 18 (80%) of the vaccinated cats challenged in this way remained non-viraemic while 9/15 (60%) of age-matched controls became persistently infected, a preventable fraction of 63%.

Tests for virus neutralising and anti-feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) antibodies suggested that the former were more important than the latter in protection. Thus, Leukocell 2 protected a significant proportion of cats from FeLV challenge 1 year after primary vaccination as kittens.","['Harbour, D A', 'Gunn-Moore, D A', 'Gruffydd-Jones, T J', 'Caney, S M A', 'Bradshaw, J', 'Jarrett, O', 'Wiseman, A']","['Harbour DA', 'Gunn-Moore DA', 'Gruffydd-Jones TJ', 'Caney SM', 'Bradshaw J', 'Jarrett O', 'Wiseman A']","['Department of Clinical Veterinary Science, Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Bristol, Langford House, Langford, Bristol BS40 5DU, UK. dave.harbour@bristol.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Vaccine,Vaccine,8406899,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '0 (feline leukemia virus protein p27)', '0 (feline leukemia virus vaccine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Antigens, Viral/blood', 'Cat Diseases/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Gene Products, gag/blood/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Male', 'Mouth', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Nose', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/prevention & control/*veterinary', 'Retroviridae Proteins/blood/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*administration & dosage', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/prevention & control/*veterinary', 'Viral Vaccines/*administration & dosage', 'Viremia/immunology/prevention & control/veterinary', 'Virulence']",2002/07/20 10:00,2003/02/20 04:00,['2002/07/20 10:00'],"['2002/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0264410X02002372 [pii]', '10.1016/s0264-410x(02)00237-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Vaccine. 2002 Jul 26;20(23-24):2866-72. doi: 10.1016/s0264-410x(02)00237-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have modified the highly successful extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) treatment that has been used in the therapy of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). autoimmune disease, transplantation rejection episodes and graft-versus-host disease to enhance its efficacy by the addition of an overnight incubation period. This adaption of ECP is termed ""transimmunization (TI)"" since the new therapy permits transfer of tumor antigens that have been previously poorly recognized to potent antigen presenting cells where the tumor epitopes can be displayed in the full context of major histocompatibility, co-stimulatory and adhesion molecules. The TI modification of ECP is a practical and safe means of rapidly inducing DC differentiation from peripheral blood monocytes in the presence of apoptotic tumor cells. Uptake of the apoptotic CTCL cells by the immature DC, in the presence of inflammatory cytokines, further drives their maturation into potent antigen presenting cells. Reinfusion of these tumor-loaded DC, that have access to the full spectrum of tumor antigens, has the potential to invoke an anti-tumor immune response in the recipient. Standard ECP has been a very useful form of immunotherapy and a modification of this approach that can enhance its ellicacy and utility should broaden its application to a larger variety of disorders including potentially the treatment of solid tumors and the modulation of the immune response in graft-versus-leukemia and graft-versus-host transplantation regimens. An understanding of the mechanism of ECP and TI will provide the physician with the ability to more finely tune the desired immune response and thereby, provide an enhanced immunotherapy for malignancy and other disorders of immunocompetence.","['Berger, Carole L', 'Hanlon, Douglas', 'Kanada, Daniel', 'Girardi, Michael', 'Edelson, Richard L']","['Berger CL', 'Hanlon D', 'Kanada D', 'Girardi M', 'Edelson RL']","['Department of Dermatology, Yale University, School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510-8059, USA. carole.berger@yale.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Transfus Apher Sci,Transfusion and apheresis science : official journal of the World Apheresis Association : official journal of the European Society for Haemapheresis,101095653,,,"['Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukapheresis/methods', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/therapy', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Photopheresis/*methods']",2002/07/20 10:00,2003/07/15 05:00,['2002/07/20 10:00'],"['2002/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/15 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1473-0502(02)00014-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s1473-0502(02)00014-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Transfus Apher Sci. 2002 Jun;26(3):205-16. doi: 10.1016/s1473-0502(02)00014-9.,,,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among them, interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) and its family proteases, which are called caspases, play critical roles in the execution stage of apoptosis. We previously reported that a proteasome-inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl Leu-Leu-leucinal (ZLLLal), induced apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells. In the present study, in order to analyze the detailed mechanism of ZLLLal-induced apoptosis, we examined the effect of a caspase-inhibitor, acetyl(Ac)-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethyl ketone (AcYVADcmk), on ZLLLal-induced apoptosis in the cells. Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that low concentrations of AcYVADcmk efficiently suppressed apoptotic DNA fragmentation. However, the cells presented morphology different from normal, apoptotic or necrotic cells, although DNA fragmentation was suppressed. The same examination was performed on the cells with anti-Fas antibody-induced apoptosis, and the same results were obtained. Some cells with a similar morphology were found even without the caspase-inhibitor in the early stage of anti-Fas antibody-induced physiological apoptosis. In addition, apoptotic cascade was reactivated by washing out the caspase inhibitor from the DNA degradation-suppressed cells. Therefore, this newly found morphological feature shows the presence of a step prior to caspase activation in the cells, and this is the first report presenting the pre-caspase-activated step in the apoptotic cascade.","['Tomioka, Masanori', 'Sameshima, Masasumi', 'Nakano, Hisako', 'Kubo, Toshikazu', 'Shinohora, Kunio', 'Seyama, Yousuke', 'Kawashima, Seiichi', 'Tone, Shigenobu']","['Tomioka M', 'Sameshima M', 'Nakano H', 'Kubo T', 'Shinohora K', 'Seyama Y', 'Kawashima S', 'Tone S']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Leupeptins/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Thymoma/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",2002/07/20 10:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2002/07/20 10:00'],"['2002/07/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-0774.2002.tb00098.x [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Cell. 2002 Mar;15(1):43-51. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-0774.2002.tb00098.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk of leukemia in a large cohort of gas and electricity utility workers with exposures to several suspected or confirmed carcinogens was investigated. METHODS: A case-control study nested within the cohort was conducted, with 72 leukemia cases identified among male workers, and 285 controls matched to the cases by year of birth. Only cases, and their matched controls, active in the company at the date of diagnosis were included. Exposure assessment was based on a job-exposure matrix (JEM) developed from expert judgment using a standardized procedure. RESULTS: The risk of leukemia was increased in workers with an estimated cumulative exposure to benzene > or = 16.8 ppm-years (OR = 3.6; 95% CI 1.1-11.7), and there was an indication of a dose-response relation (OR = 1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.5 per 10 ppm-years increase in exposure). The link with benzene was more pronounced for acute leukemia than for chronic leukemia, but no association with a particular leukemia cell type was apparent. The risk of leukemia remained elevated for latency periods of 2, 5, or 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: From our evaluation, it could be estimated that the median TWA exposure to benzene among exposed workers was 0.16 ppm, i.e., within concentration ranges where an increased leukemia risk was usually not apparent in previous epidemiological studies. Although an increased leukemia risk may be real, it may also be related to other occupational factors not totally controlled for in the analysis, or to benzene exposures actually higher than expected.","['Guenel, Pascal', 'Imbernon, Ellen', 'Chevalier, Anne', 'Crinquand-Calastreng, Anne', 'Goldberg, Marcel']","['Guenel P', 'Imbernon E', 'Chevalier A', 'Crinquand-Calastreng A', 'Goldberg M']","['Inserm Unite 88, Hopital National de Saint-Maurice, France. guenel@vjf.inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,"['0 (Gasoline)', '0 (Solvents)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', '*Electricity', '*Gasoline', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Solvents', 'Time Factors']",2002/07/19 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/07/19 10:00'],"['2002/07/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.10090 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2002 Aug;42(2):87-97. doi: 10.1002/ajim.10090.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors therefore investigated the effect of p210(BCR-ABL) on actin polymerization as well as on the expression and phosphorylation state of the adhesion proteins paxillin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). METHODS: Transfection with BCR-ABL constructs abrogated the ability of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts to adhere and the cells underwent striking morphologic changes. RESULTS: Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the cells lost their elongated appearance and became rounded. This alteration was associated with significantly reduced actin polymerization. In addition, steady-state levels of paxillin and FAK protein were increased. However, while the overall level of phosphotyrosines was also increased, the amount of tyrosine phosphorylated paxillin and FAK was reduced in the BCR-ABL-transfected cells as compared to the parental cells. Culture on extracellular fibronectin matrix partially reversed the morphologic changes and resulted in a return, albeit incomplete, of filamentous actin in BCR-ABL-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts. In addition, phosphorylation of paxillin and FAK in the BCR-ABL-transfected NIH 3T3 cells was restored. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that, in the current system, transfection of BCR-ABL attenuates FAK and paxillin phosphorylation and reduces actin polymerization, events accompanied by significant alterations in cellular morphology. The observation that exposure of the cells to fibronectin partially reverses all these changes suggests that the focal adhesion proteins and actin structures nevertheless remain responsive to signaling from the outside.","['Cheng, Keding', 'Kurzrock, Razelle', 'Qiu, Xiangguo', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Ku, Stella', 'Dulski, Kim M', 'Wang, Jean Y J', 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Cheng K', 'Kurzrock R', 'Qiu X', 'Estrov Z', 'Ku S', 'Dulski KM', 'Wang JY', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, The University of Texas M.

Studies in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection and malignancies have demonstrated both biologic and clinical activity of PEG Intron and have provided empiric data to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of PEG Intron and IFN-alpha-2b. METHODS: The authors conducted a review of the available data comparing the PK and pharmacodynamic effects of PEG Intron and IFN-alpha-2b. Safety and efficacy data from Phase I/II studies of PEG Intron in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and solid tumors were also reviewed. RESULTS: Data from patients with chronic hepatitis C infection suggest that exposure to IFN at a PEG Intron dose of 0.25 microg/kg per week is similar to that observed after administration of IFN-alpha-2b at a dose of 3 million International Units, three times per week. PEG Intron at doses up to 6 microg/kg per week was well tolerated and demonstrated clinical activity in patients with CML and solid tumors, including metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Dose intensification can be achieved safely in patients with CML and solid tumors using PEG Intron, which could improve efficacy. These results provide useful dosing guidelines to clinicians investigating the antitumor activity of PEG Intron in patients with malignancies. More data are needed to determine the optimal dose in various oncologic indications. However, these results provide a sound rationale for further investigation of PEG Intron.","['Bukowski, Ronald M', 'Tendler, Craig', 'Cutler, David', 'Rose, Esther', 'Laughlin, Mark M', 'Statkevich, Paul']","['Bukowski RM', 'Tendler C', 'Cutler D', 'Rose E', 'Laughlin MM', 'Statkevich P']","['Experimental Therapeutics Program, Cleveland Clinic Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio 44195-5237, USA. bukowr@cc.ccf.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'G8RGG88B68 (peginterferon alfa-2b)', 'Q46947FE7K (peginterferon alfa-2a)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', '*Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', '*Polyethylene Glycols', 'Recombinant Proteins']",2002/07/19 10:00,2002/08/09 10:01,['2002/07/19 10:00'],"['2002/07/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.10663 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2002 Jul 15;95(2):389-96. doi: 10.1002/cncr.10663.,,,26,,,,,,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.DOI 10.1002/cncr.10663'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-four whole-body bone marrow scans were performed in 23 patients (11 women, 12 men; median age 46 years, range 17-74 years) 5 h after i.v. injection of 370 MBq of AGAb. The UR was calculated from the posterior view drawing an irregular region of interest around the sacroiliac and a background areas. The mean UR in pancytopenic patients was 2.3+/-1.5 (range 0.3-5.8), thus being significantly lower (P=0.45 x 10(-6)) than the mean UR in a control group of 50 patients (mean UR 7.3+/-2.3; range 4.4-12.6) obtained previously. Considering patient age, there was no overlap between UR of pancytopenic patients and the respective normal ranges. The bone marrow appearance on scans seemed to be characteristic for the different haematological diseases investigated. In six patients with myelofibrosis, bone marrow scans demonstrated diffusely decreased bone marrow activity and prominent splenic uptake, possibly related to extramedullary haematopoiesis. In aplastic anaemia, highly reduced and patchy marrow uptake was observed in four patients (five scans), in one of them persisting even after blood cell counts had recovered to the near-normal range. In another two patients with aplastic anaemia, diffusely decreased bone marrow uptake was obtained. In patients with myeloid leukaemia, bone marrow patterns were almost normal probably because the target antigen is often expressed on neoplastic myeloid cells, too. Bone marrow extension was a common finding in these patients. There is an obvious differentiation between haematological patients with pancytopenia and normal subjects by means of AGAb bone marrow uptake ratio. The distinct patterns of AGAb distribution may be indicative for particular haematological diseases.","['Huic, Drazen', 'Ivancevic, V', 'Aurer, I', 'Dodig, D', 'Nemet, D', 'Labar, B', 'Poropat, M', 'Munz, D L']","['Huic D', 'Ivancevic V', 'Aurer I', 'Dodig D', 'Nemet D', 'Labar B', 'Poropat M', 'Munz DL']","['Clinical Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiation Protection, University Hospital Rebro, Kispaticeva 12, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia. dhuic@rebro.mef.hr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucl Med Commun,Nuclear medicine communications,8201017,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (BW 250 183)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacokinetics', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/complications/*diagnostic imaging/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancytopenia/*diagnostic imaging/etiology/metabolism', 'Radioimmunodetection/methods', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2002/07/19 10:00,2003/01/23 04:00,['2002/07/19 10:00'],"['2002/07/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00006231-200208000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucl Med Commun. 2002 Aug;23(8):757-63. doi: 10.1097/00006231-200208000-00009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We showed that the MLL gene on 11q23 was fused to the LCX (leukemia-associated protein with a CXXC domain) gene on 10q22 in a de novoadult AML-M2 with trilineage dysplasia having t(10;11)(q22;q23). LCX consisted of at least 12 exons and was predicted to encode a 2136-amino-acid protein with an estimated molecular mass of 235.3 kDa. The LCX protein had a zinc-binding CXXC domain that MLL also contains within a methyltransferase domain, three nuclear localization signals, an alpha-helical coiled-coil region, and two homologous regions to CG2083 proteins of Drosophila melanogaster. We found approximately 12-, 9.5-, and 7.5-kb transcripts of LCX. Expression of the 7.5-kb transcript was detected in fetal heart, lung, and brain, and in adult skeletal muscle, thymus, and ovary. Expression of the 9.5-kb transcript was detected in fetal lung and brain and in adult ovary. Expression of the 12-kb transcript was detected in fetal heart and brain and in adult thymus and ovary. LCX was expressed in 8 of 22 leukemic cell lines, but not in EBV-induced normal B-cell lines. The MLL-LCX fusion protein lacked a CXXC domain of LCX, but retained an alpha-helical coiled-coil region at the COOH terminus, similar to MLL-SEPTING, MLL-CDCREL1, MLL-AF1p/Eps15, and MLL-AF6, which suggests that these fusion proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of 11q23-associated leukemia through similar mechanisms.","['Ono, Ryoichi', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Taketani, Takeshi', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi', 'Kobayashi, Hajime', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide']","['Ono R', 'Taki T', 'Taketani T', 'Taniwaki M', 'Kobayashi H', 'Hayashi Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.- (TET1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Breakage', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Drosophila melanogaster/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2002/07/19 10:00,2002/08/14 10:01,['2002/07/19 10:00'],"['2002/07/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/19 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Jul 15;62(14):4075-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we demonstrate that HE also inhibits the growth of a variety of human and murine tumor cell lines in vitro at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 10 microM and was inactive as a mutagen in the Ames test. HE exhibited highly potent (0.3-10 mg/kg dose ranges) activities against B16 melanoma growth in C57BL/6 mice and P388D1 leukemia in C57BL/6 x DBA/2 F(1) mice, respectively. At a low maximal effective dose of 5 mg/kg, HE induced significant in vivo antitumor activities that were better than or comparable with most of the standard chemotherapeutic antiangiogenic agents tested: cortisone acetate, vincristine, bleomycin, Adriamycin, 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide. All of the agents, except vincristine, had much higher maximal effective doses than HE. HE arrested the growth of human Burkitt lymphoma CA46 cells and HeLa (cervical epitheloid carcinoma) cells in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle, which was caused by interference, either direct or indirect, with actin assembly. Thus, the cell cycle arrest occurred at cytokinesis, as demonstrated by an increase in the number of binucleate cells. Moreover, HE inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor-induced cell proliferation in vitro, with an IC(50) of 28.6 microM, and it significantly inhibited basic fibroblast growth factor-induced angiogenesis on the chick chorioallantoic membrane, with an IC50 of 10 microM. Furthermore, HE inhibited endothelial cell migration on vitronectin, collagen, and fibronectin.

As a single agent, it induces complete remissions, causing few adverse effects and only minimal myelosuppression. These successes have prompted investigations to elucidate the mechanisms of action underlying these clinical responses. Substantial data show that arsenic trioxide produces remissions in patients with APL at least in part through a mechanism that results in the degradation of the aberrant PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion protein. Studies have also investigated concerns about the toxicity and potential carcinogenicity of long-term exposure to environmental arsenic. Arsenic apparently affects numerous intracellular signal transduction pathways and causes many alterations in cellular function. These actions of arsenic may result in the induction of apoptosis, the inhibition of growth and angiogenesis, and the promotion of differentiation. Such effects have been observed in cultured cell lines and animal models, as well as clinical studies. Because arsenic affects so many cellular and physiological pathways, a wide variety of malignancies, including both hematologic cancer and solid tumors derived from several tissue types, may be susceptible to therapy with arsenic trioxide. These multiple actions of arsenic trioxide also highlight the need for additional mechanistic studies to determine which actions mediate the diverse biological effects of this agent. This information will be critical to realizing the potential for synergy between arsenic trioxide and other chemotherapeutic agents, thus providing enhanced benefit in cancer therapy.","['Miller, Wilson H Jr', 'Schipper, Hyman M', 'Lee, Janet S', 'Singer, Jack', 'Waxman, Samuel']","['Miller WH Jr', 'Schipper HM', 'Lee JS', 'Singer J', 'Waxman S']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research and Sir Mortimer B.

The autophosphorylation site tyrosine 177 binds the adaptor Grb2 and helps determine the lineage and severity of BCR/ABL disease: Tyr177 mutation (BCR/ABL-Y177F) dramatically impairs myeloid leukemogenesis, while diminishing lymphoid leukemogenesis. The critical signal(s) from Tyr177 has remained unclear. We report that Tyr177 recruits the scaffolding adaptor Gab2 via a Grb2/Gab2 complex. Compared to BCR/ABL-expressing Ba/F3 cells, BCR/ABL-Y177F cells exhibit markedly reduced Gab2 tyrosine phosphorylation and association of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and Shp2 with Gab2 and BCR/ABL, and decreased PI3K/Akt and Ras/Erk activation, cell proliferation, and spontaneous migration. Remarkably, bone marrow myeloid progenitors from Gab2 (-/-) mice are resistant to transformation by BCR/ABL, whereas lymphoid transformation is diminished as a consequence of markedly increased apoptosis. BCR/ABL-evoked PI3K/Akt and Ras/Erk activation also are impaired in Gab2 (-/-) primary myeloid and lymphoid cells. Our results identify Gab2 and its associated proteins as key determinants of the lineage and severity of BCR/ABL transformation.","['Sattler, Martin', 'Mohi, M Golam', 'Pride, Yuri B', 'Quinnan, Laura R', 'Malouf, Nicole A', 'Podar, Klaus', 'Gesbert, Franck', 'Iwasaki, Hiromi', 'Li, Shaoguang', 'Van Etten, Richard A', 'Gu, Haihua', 'Griffin, James D', 'Neel, Benjamin G']","['Sattler M', 'Mohi MG', 'Pride YB', 'Quinnan LR', 'Malouf NA', 'Podar K', 'Gesbert F', 'Iwasaki H', 'Li S', 'Van Etten RA', 'Gu H', 'Griffin JD', 'Neel BG']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Adult Oncology, Harvard Medical School, 44 Binney Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Helminth Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '167473-79-2 (microfilarial sheath protein, Helminth)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Helminth Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2002/07/19 10:00,2002/09/28 04:00,['2002/07/19 10:00'],"['2002/07/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1535610802000740 [pii]', '10.1016/s1535-6108(02)00074-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2002 Jun;1(5):479-92. doi: 10.1016/s1535-6108(02)00074-0.,"['P01 DK50654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA90576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report describes a competitive PCR assay that was used to quantitate DNA damage induced by anticancer drugs within a 683-bp region of the c-myc gene in human CEM leukemia cells. Absolute quantitation of gene-specific DNA damage (attomoles or molecules of damaged DNA sequences) was achieved by coamplification of a homologous internal standard that has the same primer binding sites and PCR amplification efficiency as c-myc. The variability (standard error) associated with four separate determinations of the amount of c-myc sequence in 300 ng of DNA from untreated cells (6.80 +/- 0.05 SE amol) was less than 1% of the mean. The assay was capable of quantitating direct DNA damage that was induced by therapeutic concentrations of VM-26 and cisplatin prior to the onset of cellular apoptosis or necrosis. Both VM-26 (1-10 microM) and cisplatin (25-100 microM) induced a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of intact c-myc sequence.

The ubiquitous microtubule associated protein 4 (MAP4) shows rescue-promoting activity during in vitro assembly of microtubules (i.e., promotes transitions from shortening to elongation), but its regulatory role in intact cells is poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that ectopic MAP4 promotes outgrowth of extended MTs during beta1-integrin-induced cell spreading. An inducible cotransfection protocol was employed to further analyze the regulatory role of MAP4 in human leukemia cells with microtubules partially destabilized by either ectopic tubulin-sequestering proteins or proteins that promote catastrophes (i.e., transitions from elongation to shortening). Coexpression of proteins that sequester free tubulin heterodimers with different efficiencies was found to abolish microtubule stabilization by MAP4. In contrast, however, the microtubule-stabilizing activity of MAP4 was found to suppress the activities of two distinct and specific catastrophe promoters, namely, XKCM1 and a nonsequestering truncation derivative of Op18/stathmin. These observations reveal specificity in the microtubule-stabilizing activity of MAP4 that differentiates between two mechanistically distinct types of MT destabilization.","['Holmfeldt, Per', 'Brattsand, Goran', 'Gullberg, Martin']","['Holmfeldt P', 'Brattsand G', 'Gullberg M']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Umea University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Curr Biol,Current biology : CB,9107782,"['0 (MAP4)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tubulin)']",IM,"['Cell Movement', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*physiology', 'Microtubules/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Transfection', 'Tubulin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/07/19 10:00,2002/09/21 10:01,['2002/07/19 10:00'],"['2002/07/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-9822(02)00897-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0960-9822(02)00897-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Biol. 2002 Jun 25;12(12):1034-9. doi: 10.1016/s0960-9822(02)00897-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the follow-up, 918 cases of leukaemia in children under 15 years (510 boys, 408 girls) were reported to the RNT (41% of all childhood malignancies), with an overall age-standardised incidence rate of 56 per million person-years. Acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) represented 79% and acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) 16% of the cases, with rates of 43 and 9 per million person-years respectively. There were downward trends in incidence of total leukaemias, ALL and ANLL and 'not otherwise specified' (NOS) combined. Incidence of ALL was highest at 1-4 years of age in boys and girls, whereas ANLL peaked in girls during the first year of life. During 1991-96, the decrease in ALL was significant (P = 0.042). A multivariable Poisson regression model identified significant excesses of ALL for boys, for age groups 1-4 and 5-9 years and for three out of seven regions.

However, data on current treatment practices and costs for this form of cancer are sparse. METHODS: We used a retrospective inception cohort design and data from a linkage between 11 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries and Medicare administrative claims. We evaluated survival, use of health care resources, use of chemotherapy, and Medicare payments among adults 65 years and older with an initial diagnosis of AML between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1996. RESULTS: A total of 2657 elderly patients with AML and complete Medicare claims data were identified. The prognosis for these patients was poor, with median survival estimated to be 2 months and a 2-year survival rate of 6%. Mean +/- SE total Medicare payments were $41,594 +/- $870 (in 1998 US dollars), 84% of which was attributed to inpatient payments. In the 2 years after the AML diagnosis, 790 patients (30%) underwent chemotherapy treatment. These patients had costs almost 3 times higher than those of other patients, and their median survival was 6 months longer. The use of hospice care was rare (17% of patients). CONCLUSIONS: Among the elderly, AML is associated with a poor prognosis and substantial costs during the relatively few remaining months of life. Moreover, most patients do not receive active treatment with chemotherapy or hospice services. Further work is needed to characterize this disease and the patient-related factors that influence treatment decisions and associated health outcomes.","['Menzin, Joseph', 'Lang, Kathleen', 'Earle, Craig C', 'Kerney, Donna', 'Mallick, Rajiv']","['Menzin J', 'Lang K', 'Earle CC', 'Kerney D', 'Mallick R']","['Boston Health Economics, Inc, 20 Fox Rd, Waltham, MA 02451, USA. jmenzin@bhei.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Intern Med,Archives of internal medicine,0372440,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Delivery of Health Care/economics', 'Drug Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*economics/mortality', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",2002/07/19 10:00,2002/08/15 10:01,['2002/07/19 10:00'],"['2002/07/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['ioi10588 [pii]', '10.1001/archinte.162.14.1597 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Intern Med. 2002 Jul 22;162(14):1597-603. doi: 10.1001/archinte.162.14.1597.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, systematic information on cancer prevalence is largely unavailable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight population-based cancer registries from 17 European countries, participating in EUROPREVAL, provided data on almost 3 million cancer patients diagnosed from 1970 to 1992. Standardised data collection and validation procedures were used and the whole data set was analysed using proven methodology. The prevalence of stomach, colon, rectum, lung, breast, cervix uteri, corpus uteri and prostate cancer, as well as of melanoma of skin, Hodgkin's disease, leukaemia and all malignant neoplasms combined, were estimated for the end of 1992. RESULTS: There were large differences between countries in the prevalence of all cancers combined; estimates ranged from 1170 per 100000 in the Polish cancer registration areas to 3050 per 100000 in southern Sweden. For most cancers, the Swedish, Swiss, German and Italian areas had high prevalence, and the Polish, Estonian, Slovakian and Slovenian areas had low prevalence. Of the total prevalent cases, 61% were women and 57% were 65 years of age or older. Cases diagnosed within 2 years of the reference date formed 22% of all prevalent cases. Breast cancer accounted for 34% of all prevalent cancers in females and colorectal cancer for 15% in males. Prevalence tended to be high where cancer incidence was high, but the prevalence was highest in countries where survival was also high. Prevalence was low where general mortality was high (correlation between general mortality and the prevalence of all cancers = -0.64) and high where gross domestic product was high (correlation = +0.79). Thus, the richer areas of Europe had higher prevalence, suggesting that prevalence will increase with economic development. CONCLUSIONS: EUROPREVAL is the largest project on prevalence conducted to date. It has provided complete and accurate estimates of cancer prevalence in Europe, constituting essential information for cancer management. The expected increases in prevalence with economic development will require more resources; allocation to primary prevention should therefore be prioritised.","['Micheli, A', 'Mugno, E', 'Krogh, V', 'Quinn, M J', 'Coleman, M', 'Hakulinen, T', 'Gatta, G', 'Berrino, F', 'Capocaccia, R']","['Micheli A', 'Mugno E', 'Krogh V', 'Quinn MJ', 'Coleman M', 'Hakulinen T', 'Gatta G', 'Berrino F', 'Capocaccia R']","['Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Milano, Italy. micheli@istitutotumori.mi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence', '*Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Analysis']",2002/07/19 10:00,2003/01/10 04:00,['2002/07/19 10:00'],"['2002/07/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/mdf127 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)63473-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2002 Jun;13(6):840-65. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdf127.,,['Ann Oncol. 2002 Jun;13(6):815-6.

The importance of PML bodies in cell differentiation and growth is implicated in acute promyelocitic leukemia cells, which do not contain PML bodies. Treatment of patients with drugs that reverse the disease phenotype also causes PML bodies to reform. In this review, we discuss the structure, composition, and dynamics that may provide insights into the function of PML bodies. We also discuss the repsonse of PML bodies to cellular stresses, such as virus infection and heat shock. We interpret the changes that occur as evidence for a role of these structures in gene transcription. We also examine the role of the posttranslational modification.

Calpain inhibition delayed tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis of normal neutrophils, consistent with a role for calpains in regulating the onset of apoptosis. Interestingly, neutrophils from three patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia, a rare syndrome characterized by accumulation of mature neutrophils, exhibited decreased mu-calpain expression, diminished calpain activity, and impaired XIAP degradation. Neutrophils from these patients displayed a delay in spontaneous, Fas-stimulated, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis.

The NADPH oxidase enzyme system initiates the production of oxygen metabolites by reducing oxygen to form superoxide anion (O(2)()). With stimulation of the respiratory burst, cytosolic oxidase components, p47(phox), p67(phox), and Rac, translocate to the phagolysomal and plasma membranes where they form a complex with cytochrome b(558) and express enzyme activity. A 29-kDa neutrophil protein (p29) was identified by co-immunoprecipitation with p67(phox). N-terminal sequence analysis of p29 revealed homology to an open reading frame gene described in a myeloid leukemia cell line. A cDNA for p29 identical to the open reading frame protein was amplified from RNA of neutrophils. Significant interaction between p29 and p67(phox) was demonstrated using a yeast two-hybrid system. A recombinant (rh) p29 was expressed in Sf9 cells resulting in a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 34,000. The rh-p29 showed immunoreactivity with the original rabbit antiserum that detected p47(phox) and p67(phox). In addition, rh-p29 exhibited PLA(2) activity, which was Ca(2+) independent, optimal at low pH, and preferential for phosphatidylcholine substrates. The recombinant protein protected glutathione synthetase and directly inactivated H(2)O(2). By activity and sequence homology, rh-p29 can be classified as a peroxiredoxin. Finally, O(2)() production by plasma membrane and recombinant cytosolic oxidase components in the SDS-activated, cell-free NADPH oxidase system were enhanced by rh-p29. This effect was not inhibited by PLA(2) inhibitors. Thus, p29 is a novel protein that associates with p67 and has peroxiredoxin activity. This protein has a potential role in protecting the NADPH oxidase by inactivating H(2)O(2) or altering signaling pathways affected by H(2)O(2).","['Leavey, Patrick J', 'Gonzalez-Aller, Carolina', 'Thurman, Gail', 'Kleinberg, Michael', 'Rinckel, Lori', 'Ambruso, Daniel W', 'Freeman, Stefanie', 'Kuypers, Frans A', 'Ambruso, Daniel R']","['Leavey PJ', 'Gonzalez-Aller C', 'Thurman G', 'Kleinberg M', 'Rinckel L', 'Ambruso DW', 'Freeman S', 'Kuypers FA', 'Ambruso DR']","['Bonfils Blood Center, Denver, Colorado 80230, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (neutrophil cytosol factor 67K)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 6.3.1.2 (Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell-Free System', 'Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'NADPH Oxidases/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/cytology/metabolism', 'Oxidants/metabolism', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Peroxidases/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Peroxiredoxins', 'Phospholipases A/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2002/07/18 10:00,2003/01/08 04:00,['2002/07/18 10:00'],"['2002/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/08 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M202869200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)71620-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Nov 22;277(47):45181-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M202869200.

The in vitro activity of the compounds against P388 leukemia and A-549 was determined. The results show that the anti-tumor activities of organotin(IV)porphinate is related to the water solubility of the compounds and the central ion in the porphyrin ring. The interaction between the water-soluble dibutyltin(IV) porphinate (7 and 10) complexes and DNA has been investigated. The result shows that compounds 7 and 10 cause DNA hypochromism measured by A(260), a slight increase in the viscosity of the DNA, and an increase in the melting point of DNA by 2.9 and 1.6 degrees C, respectively at DNA(base)/Drug(Por) ratios of 60.

Poly (A) tail formation is a significant component of 3' processing, a link in the chain of events, including transcription, splicing, and cleavage/polyadenylation of pre-mRNA. Transcription, capping, splicing, polyadenylation, and transport take place as coupled processes that can regulate one another. The poly(A) tail is found in almost all eukaryotic mRNA and is important in enhancing translation initiation and determining mRNA stability. Control of poly(A) tail synthesis could possibly be a key regulatory step in gene expression. PAP-specific activity values are measured by a highly sensitive assays and immunocytochemical methods. High levels of PAP activity are associated with rapidly proliferating cells, it also prevents apoptosis. Changes of PAP activity may cause a decrease in the rate of polyadenylation in the brain during epileptic seizures. Testis-specific PAP may play an important role in spermiogenesis. PAP was found to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in leukemia and breast cancer. Furthermore, measurements of PAP activity may contribute to the definition of the biological profile of tumor cells. It is crucial to know the specific target causing the elevation of serum PAP, for it to be used as a marker for disease. This review summarizes the recently accumulated knowledge on PAP including its function, assays, and association with various human diseases, and proposes future avenues for research.","['Scorilas, Andreas']",['Scorilas A'],"['National Center for Scientific Research Demokritos, IPC, Athens, Greece. scorilas@netscape.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci,Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,8914816,"['0 (RNA Precursors)', 'EC 2.7.7.19 (Polynucleotide Adenylyltransferase)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Epilepsy/enzymology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Polynucleotide Adenylyltransferase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Precursors/*metabolism', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/*physiology']",2002/07/18 10:00,2003/01/14 04:00,['2002/07/18 10:00'],"['2002/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10408360290795510 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci. 2002 Jun;39(3):193-224. doi: 10.1080/10408360290795510.,,,189,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of gene transfer to salivary glands using different viral vectors: adenovirus, vaccinia, herpes simplex type 1 (HSV), and two retroviral vectors (murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and lentivirus). We show, by in situ staining and beta-galactosidase reporter activity assay, that the adenoviral and vaccinia vectors were able to deliver the reporter gene efficiently to acinar and duct cells. The HSV vector was less efficient and infected only the acinar cells. The lentiviral vector infected acinar and duct cells, but at a relatively low efficiency. The MuLV vector did not infect the salivary gland unless cell proliferation was induced. Host immune responses to viral infection, inflammation, apoptosis and lymphocyte infiltration, in the transduced glands, were assessed. The DNA viral vectors induced local lymphocyte infiltration and apoptosis. In contrast, the retroviral vectors did not induce an immune response. Our results describe the outcome of salivary gland infection with each of the five different viral vectors and indicate their advantages and limitations for transferring genes to the salivary glands.","['Shai, Ela', 'Falk, Haya', 'Honigman, Alik', 'Panet, Amos', 'Palmon, Aaron']","['Shai E', 'Falk H', 'Honigman A', 'Panet A', 'Palmon A']","['Department of Oral Biology, Faculty of Dental Medicine, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Oral Sci,European journal of oral sciences,9504563,"['0 (Chromogenic Compounds)', '0 (Galactosides)', '0 (Indoles)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'V595OG374W (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-galactoside)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Catheterization', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Separation', 'Chromogenic Compounds', 'Colorimetry', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Galactosides', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/*administration & dosage/classification/genetics', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/genetics', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Indoles', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Saliva/metabolism', 'Salivary Ducts/cytology/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Sialadenitis/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Submandibular Gland/cytology/immunology/*metabolism/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes/genetics', 'Vaccinia/genetics', 'beta-Galactosidase/analysis/genetics']",2002/07/18 10:00,2002/09/07 10:01,['2002/07/18 10:00'],"['2002/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-0722.2002.21200.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Oral Sci. 2002 Jun;110(3):254-60. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0722.2002.21200.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main characteristics of the syndrome are exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, haematologic abnormality and growth retardation. At diagnosis, especially when made in infancy, symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency are always present. This condition could be considered as a transient pancreatic insufficiency. In fact, several studies have shown that, with advancing age, about 40-60% of patients become pancreatic sufficient. Observations on the evolution of pancreatic activity lead us to believe that the diagnosis of SDS must be considered even in the absence of signs and symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency. Intermittent neutropenia is the most common haematological finding in SDS, but more of the bone marrow cellular elements can be involved. In recent years, recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been used in some SDS subjects with severe neutropenia and frequent infection. The major haematological problem in the disease is the appearance of acute myeloid leukaemia; however, its prevalence is difficult to establish. Growth retardation is a typical manifestation. Weight and length are deficient at birth and remain below normal over time. Some studies show that SDS patients present short stature rather than malnutrition and this would suggest an inherent growth problem. A broad spectrum of skeletal abnormalities has been found to be associated with this syndrome. Short ribs with broadened anterior ends and metaphyseal dyschondroplasia of the long bone are the most common findings. Elevated liver enzymes and hepatomegaly are present in the first years of life with subsequent improvement without complications.

It is induced by a mixture of two replication-competent murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) and a disease-causing, replication-incompetent defective MuLV. Infection leads to specific phenotypic and functional alterations of lymphocytes in lymphoid organs. METHODS: We analyzed phenotypic, virological and functional parameters in the blood of mice infected with MAIDS virus. RESULTS: Disease progression correlated with increasing viremia, a loss of mitogen responsiveness of T lymphocytes, and the appearance of CD4+ Thy1- T lymphocytes. At >9 weeks after infection, the distribution of leukocyte cell populations became very heterogeneous, and late-stage leukemic events were observed in 5 of 23 mice. CONCLUSIONS: Virus titers, mitogen responsiveness and the presence of CD4+ Thy1- T lymphocytes can efficiently be monitored in the blood and serve as diagnostic parameters to monitor disease progression. Acute leukemic events occurring at the terminal stage could be responsible for the death of at least some of the mice with MAIDS.","['Hugin, Ambros W', 'Wirth, Susanne']","['Hugin AW', 'Wirth S']","['Department of Dermatology, University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland. ambros.hugin@hcuge.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*blood/immunology/pathology/*virology', '*T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Viremia/*virology']",2002/07/18 10:00,2002/08/28 10:01,['2002/07/18 10:00'],"['2002/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['iaa28244 [pii]', '10.1159/000064259 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2002 Jul;128(3):244-52. doi: 10.1159/000064259.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 S.

DNA-sequencing analysis indicated that the Y586F mutation increased the frequency of substitution mutations 17-fold within 18 nt of adenine-thymine tracts (AAAA, TTTT, or AATT), which are known to induce DNA bending. Sequence alignments indicate that MLV Y586 is equivalent to HIV-1 Y501, a component of the recently described RNase H primer grip domain, which contacts and positions the DNA primer strand near the RNase H active site. The results suggest that wild-type reverse transcriptase (RT) facilitates a specific conformation of the template-primer duplex at the polymerase active site that is important for accuracy of DNA synthesis; when an adenine-thymine tract is within 18 nt of the polymerase active site, the Y586F mutant RT cannot facilitate this specific template-primer conformation, leading to an increase in the frequency of substitution mutations. These findings indicate that the RNase H primer grip can affect the template-primer conformation at the polymerase active site and that the MLV Y586 residue and template-primer conformation are important determinants of RT fidelity.","['Zhang, Wen-Hui', 'Svarovskaia, Evguenia S', 'Barr, Rebekah', 'Pathak, Vinay K']","['Zhang WH', 'Svarovskaia ES', 'Barr R', 'Pathak VK']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Replication/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology/*genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation, Missense', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/chemistry/*genetics', 'Ribonuclease H/chemistry', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2002/07/18 10:00,2002/09/06 10:01,['2002/07/18 10:00'],"['2002/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.152186199 [doi]', '152186199 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Jul 23;99(15):10090-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.152186199.

Disruption of this subtle equilibrium can lead to the onset of leukemia, an increase in the number of lymphocytes being potentially due to both of these parameters. The relative importance of cell proliferation vs. apoptosis during pathogenesis induced by the primate T cell lymphotropic viruses and bovine leukemia virus (BLV) has been difficult to assess because of conflicting data from a range of in vitro and ex vivo experimental systems. Here, we aim to resolve this issue by measuring the rates of cell proliferation and death in the BLV-ovine system, an animal model of human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1). We use a method based on the i.v. injection of 5-bromodeoxyuridine into BLV-infected sheep. We show that B lymphocytes in BLV(+) asymptomatic sheep proliferate significantly faster than in uninfected controls (average proliferation rate: 0.020 per day vs. 0.011 per day). In contrast, the rates of cell death were not significantly different between aleukemic BLV-infected and control sheep (average death rate 0.089 per day vs. 0.094 per day, respectively). We conclude that the increase in the number of B cells during BLV-induced lymphocytosis results from higher proliferation rates but is not due to a significant decrease in apoptosis, in contrast to data from in vitro (ex vivo) experiments. The imbalance created by the net increase in proliferation in the absence of compensating cell death reveals a complex mechanism of feedback regulation controlling homeostasis in the blood compartment.","['Debacq, Christophe', 'Asquith, Becca', 'Kerkhofs, Pierre', 'Portetelle, Daniel', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Kettmann, Richard', 'Willems, Luc']","['Debacq C', 'Asquith B', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Portetelle D', 'Burny A', 'Kettmann R', 'Willems L']","['Department of Applied Biochemistry and Biology, Faculty of Agronomy, 5030 Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Death/*physiology', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*pathology', 'Kinetics', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine/physiology', 'Lymphocytosis/*etiology/pathology', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Sheep', 'Virus Replication']",2002/07/18 10:00,2002/09/06 10:01,['2002/07/18 10:00'],"['2002/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.142100999 [doi]', '142100999 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Jul 23;99(15):10048-53. doi: 10.1073/pnas.142100999.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of the central nervous system can also cause a dementia, and amyloid deposition in the central nervous system is significantly higher in HIV-1-infected individuals compared with uninfected controls. Here we report that Abeta fibrils stimulated, by 5-20-fold, infection of target cells expressing CD4 and an appropriate coreceptor by multiple HIV-1 isolates but did not permit infection of cells lacking these receptors. Abeta enhanced infection at the stage of virus attachment or entry into the cell. Abeta fibrils also stimulated infection by amphotrophic Moloney leukemia virus, herpes simplex virus, and viruses pseudotyped with the envelope glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus. Other synthetic fibril-forming peptides similarly enhanced viral infection and may be useful in gene delivery applications utilizing retroviral vectors. These data suggest that Abeta deposition may increase the vulnerability of the central nervous system to enveloped viral infection and that amyloidogenic peptides could be useful in enhancing gene transfer by enveloped viral vectors.","['Wojtowicz, Woj M', 'Farzan, Michael', 'Joyal, John L', 'Carter, Kara', 'Babcock, Gregory J', 'Israel, David I', 'Sodroski, Joseph', 'Mirzabekov, Tajib']","['Wojtowicz WM', 'Farzan M', 'Joyal JL', 'Carter K', 'Babcock GJ', 'Israel DI', 'Sodroski J', 'Mirzabekov T']","['Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Amyloid beta-Peptides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (amyloid beta-protein (1-40))', '0 (amyloid beta-protein (1-42))', '4C905MSK4W (Hexadimethrine Bromide)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'HIV-1/*pathogenicity', 'Hexadimethrine Bromide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', 'Peptide Fragments/*physiology', 'Simplexvirus/*pathogenicity', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/*pathogenicity']",2002/07/18 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/07/18 10:00'],"['2002/07/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M203518200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)36728-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Sep 20;277(38):35019-24. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M203518200.

Bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine herpesvirus 4, foot-and-mouth disease virus, and parainfluenza 3 virus have been isolated from milk from cows with clinical mastitis. Intramammary inoculations of bovine herpesvirus 1 or parainfluenza 3 virus-induced clinical mastitis, while an intramammary inoculation of foot-and-mouth disease virus resulted in necrosis of the mammary gland. Subclinical mastitis has been induced after a simultaneous intramammary and intranasal inoculation of lactating cows with bovine herpesvirus 4. Bovine leukaemia virus has been detected in mammary tissue of cows with subclinical mastitis, but whether this virus was able to induce bovine mastitis has not been reported. Bovine herpesvirus 2, vaccinia, cowpox, pseudocowpox, vesicular stomatitis, foot-and-mouth disease viruses, and bovine papillomaviruses can play an indirect role in the aetiology of bovine mastitis. These viruses can induce teat lesions, for instance in the ductus papillaris, which result in a reduction of the natural defence mechanisms of the udder and indirectly in bovine mastitis due to bacterial pathogens. Bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, bovine immunodeficiency virus, and bovine leukaemia virus infections may play an indirect role in bovine mastitis, due to their immunosuppressive properties. But, more research is warranted to underline their indirect role in bovine mastitis. We conclude that viral infections can play a direct or indirect role in the aetiology of bovine mastitis; therefore, their importance in the aetiology of bovine mastitis and their economical impact needs further attention.","['Wellenberg, G J', 'van der Poel, W H M', 'Van Oirschot, J T']","['Wellenberg GJ', 'van der Poel WH', 'Van Oirschot JT']","['Division of Infectious Diseases and Food Chain Quality, Institute for Animal Science and Health (ID-Lelystad), P.O.

Concerns of aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity have led to studies of alternate regimens. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ciprofloxacin-piperacillin is equivalent to tobramycin-piperacillin as empirical therapy for neutropenic fever. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind multicenter trial. SETTING: Seven U.S. university-affiliated hospitals and one private research center. PATIENTS: Febrile (temperature >/= 38 degrees C), neutropenic (neutrophil level < 1 x 10(9) cells/L) hospitalized patients who had leukemia, lymphoma, or solid tumors, or were undergoing bone marrow transplantation. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received piperacillin, 50 mg/kg of body weight intravenously every 4 hours, and ciprofloxacin, 400 mg intravenously every 8 hours, or tobramycin, 2 mg/kg intravenously every 8 hours. MEASUREMENTS: Success was defined as resolution of infection and previously positive cultures without the need to give additional antimicrobial agents. RESULTS: 543 febrile episodes were evaluated, of which 471 were clinically evaluable (234 in the ciprofloxacin-piperacillin group and 237 in the tobramycin-piperacillin group). Success rates in the ciprofloxacin-piperacillin group (63 of 234 febrile episodes) and tobramycin-piperacillin group (52 of 237 episodes) were similar (27% vs. 22%, respectively; difference, 5.0 percentage points [95% CI, -2.3 to 12.8 percentage points]), as was survival (96.2% of patients receiving ciprofloxacin-piperacillin versus 94.1% of patients receiving tobramycin-piperacillin; difference, 2.1 percentage points [CI, -2.2 to 6.4 percentage points]). Additions to the initial antimicrobial regimen were the most common reason for treatment failure in both groups (accounting for 67% of failures in the ciprofloxacin-piperacillin group and 72% in the tobramycin-piperacillin group; difference, 5.0 percentage points [CI, -13.8 to 3.7 percentage points]). Fevers resolved faster in patients receiving ciprofloxacin-piperacillin than in patients receiving tobramycin-piperacillin (mean, 5 vs. 6 days) (P = 0.005). No significant differences in adverse events or toxicity were noted (P = 0.083).

The median follow-up period was 5 years (24-120 months). RESULTS: In January 1994, the 5-year overall (including all causes of death) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 50 and 48%, respectively. The 5-year DFS was 47.9% in the STBI group, and 47.8% in the FTBI group (p = 0.77). It was 44% in the HIGH group, 53% in the MEDIUM group, and 34% in the LOW group (LOW vs. MEDIUM, p = 0.009). The 5-year IP incidence was 17% in all patients, 16% in the STBI group and 18% in the FTBI group (p = 0.37), but it was significantly higher in patients receiving high instantaneous dose rate TBI (56% in the HIGH, 13% in the MEDIUM, 20% in the LOW groups; HIGH vs. MEDIUM, p = 0.002). However, sex (p = 0.37), age (18% for > 20 vs. 10% for < or = 20 years, p = 0.37), and body weight (> 60 kg vs. < or = 60 kg, p = 0.09) did not influence the IP incidence in univariate analyses. Multivariate analysis (Cox model) revealed that the instantaneous dose rate (p = 0.05), and the age (p = 0.04) were the two independent factors influencing the incidence of IP. CONCLUSION: This retrospective study including only the patients transplanted with ABMT conditioned with CY alone and STBI or FTBI concluded that instantaneous dose rate and age significantly influenced the incidence of IP, whereas sex, body weight, and fractionation did not.","['Ozsahin, M', 'Belkacemi, Y', 'Pene, F', 'Laporte, J', 'Rio, B', 'Leblond, V', 'Korbas, D', 'Touboul, E', 'Gorin, N C', 'Schlienger, M', 'Laugier, A']","['Ozsahin M', 'Belkacemi Y', 'Pene F', 'Laporte J', 'Rio B', 'Leblond V', 'Korbas D', 'Touboul E', 'Gorin NC', 'Schlienger M', 'Laugier A']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Hopital Tenon, Paris, France. ozsahin@imr.psi.ch']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects/methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1996/01/01 00:00,2002/07/26 10:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/26 10:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(95)02063-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(95)02063-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Jan 1;34(1):71-7. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(95)02063-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This would suggest that oncogene(s) reside in this region. We have cloned the junctional sequence of t(1;14)(q25;q32) in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells by an inverse PCR method. A novel sequence was fused to the joining region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. We confirmed this rearrangement by Southern blot analysis, genomic PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization. We found a coding sequence which is homologous to the mouse Lhx4 cDNA sequence 17 kb from the breakpoint. The human Lhx4 gene encodes 390 amino-acids, including one tandem pair of LIM domains and one homeodomain. The human Lhx4 gene consists of six exons. Lhx4 protein is very homologous to human Lhx3 protein except in the N-terminal region. The transcripts of the Lhx4 gene were not detected in adult multiple tissues analysed by Northern blotting, but were detected in the leukemic cells carrying t(1;14)(q25;q32) by reverse-transcription PCR. The protein expression of Lhx4 in these leukemic cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Lhx4 activated the reporter gene carrying the mouse alpha-glycoprotein subunit promoter region, which is regulated by Lhx3. LIM protein and homeodomain protein genes are frequently involved in translocations of hematological malignancies. The Lhx4 gene is deregulated in the leukemic cells and Lhx4 protein may play an important role, possibly as an activator, in leukemogenesis.","['Kawamata, Norihiko', 'Sakajiri, Sakura', 'Sugimoto, Kei-Ji', 'Isobe, Yasushi', 'Kobayashi, Hirofumi', 'Oshimi, Kazuo']","['Kawamata N', 'Sakajiri S', 'Sugimoto KJ', 'Isobe Y', 'Kobayashi H', 'Oshimi K']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Juntendo University School of Medicine, 2-1-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan. kawamata@med.juntendo.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LHX4 protein, human)', '0 (LIM-Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'LIM-Homeodomain Proteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2002/07/16 10:00,2002/08/03 10:01,['2002/07/16 10:00'],"['2001/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2002/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205628 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Jul 25;21(32):4983-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205628.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF416729', 'GENBANK/AY053457']",,,,,,,,,

Transcriptional and postranscriptional regulation.,4957-68,"Phorbol esters are tumor promoters that bind and activate both conventional and new Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. In various circumstances, PKC-dependent signaling pathways can promote cell survival and protect against cell death. This was first analysed in Jurkat T cells where Phorbol Myristate Acetate (PMA) was found to inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis as judged by DiOC6(3) staining, caspase activation and DNA fragmentation, indicating that PMA exerts its protective effect upstream or at the mitochondrial level in these cells. PMA activated most of the main kinase pathways in T cells such as PKCs, p42/44MAPK, p38MAPK and p90Rsk but not JNK and Akt. A pharmacological approach allowed us to identify that nPKCs are both necessary and likely sufficient to promote T cell survival. Besides this post-transcriptional regulation, nPKCs may also regulate apoptosis at the transcriptional level. cDNA arrays were used to identify a set of genes whose expression was modulated in death versus survival conditions. Following PMA treatment, expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-x increased while that of c-Myc was significantly reduced. Moreover, survivin expression decreased upon CH11 or PMA treatment. c-Myc, survivin and Bcl-x modulation seems to be regulated at the transcriptional level while decrease in Mcl-1 protein in CH11-treated cells resulted especially from a caspase-dependent proteolysis. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PMA-mediated inhibition of apoptosis is a complex process that is integrated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level and point out to the potential role of Mcl-1, Bcl-x, c-Myc and survivin in this process.","['Herrant, Magali', 'Luciano, Frederic', 'Loubat, Agnes', 'Auberger, Patrick']","['Herrant M', 'Luciano F', 'Loubat A', 'Auberger P']","['INSERM U 526, Equipe labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, IFR 50, Faculte de Medecine, Avenue de Valombrose, 06107 Nice Cedex 2, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', '*Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Survivin', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*metabolism']",2002/07/16 10:00,2002/08/03 10:01,['2002/07/16 10:00'],"['2002/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2002/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205689 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Jul 25;21(32):4957-68. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205689.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here on the incidence of ACLA-induced differentiation on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and cell invasiveness. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as mediators of ACLA-induced effects. By using a fluorescent probe, we showed that subtoxic (i.e. differentiating) concentration of ACLA generate reactive oxygen species in HL-60 cells. ACLA-differentiated cells exhibited an increased proMMP-9 secretion which has been observed by gelatin zymography and immunoassay. Antioxidants were able to inhibit ACLA-induced differentiation and proMMP-9 secretion. Furthermore, RT-PCR showed that ACLA increased MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP-1) expression in a ROS-dependent manner. In addition, the migration and invasion capacities of HL-60 cells were enhanced by ACLA treatment, but only partially reversed by antioxidants. Altogether, these results evidenced ROS as messengers of ACLA-induced differentiation and MMP-9 expression.","['Richard, Doriane', 'Hollender, Patrick', 'Chenais, Benoit']","['Richard D', 'Hollender P', 'Chenais B']","['Unite MeDIAN, CNRS FRE-2141, Universite de Reims-Champagne Ardenne, Faculte de Pharmacie, F-51096 Reims Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '127497-59-0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (pro-matrix metalloproteinase 9)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/*pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', '*Cell Movement', 'Collagenases/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Enzyme Precursors/genetics/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2/genetics/metabolism']",2002/07/16 10:00,2003/01/28 04:00,['2002/07/16 10:00'],"['2002/07/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/16 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2002 Aug;21(2):393-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To this end, empty-vector control (U937/pCEP4) and U937/Bcl-2 cells were exposed to two UCN-01 concentrations following IR: i) a 50 nM concentration, which by itself was minimally toxic to both cell lines, and ii) a 150 nM concentration, which modestly induced apoptosis (e.g., ~19%) in control cells after 24 h. The effects of UCN-01 on IR responses were examined in relation to apoptosis induction, suspension culture growth inhibition, loss of clonogenic survival, and cell cycle perturbations. IR (2 Gy) alone minimally induced apoptosis in both U937 transfectant cell lines (e.g., <5% at 24 h in each case). Although UCN-01 failed to potentiate IR-mediated apoptosis at either early (e.g., 24 h) or late (e.g., 72 h) intervals, exposure to 50 or 150 nM UCN-01 resulted in a significant, albeit modest, reduction in proliferation and colony formation in irradiated U937/pCEP4 and U937/Bcl-2 cells. Despite failing to enhance apoptosis, UCN-01 treatment abrogated IR-induced G2/M arrest in both cell lines, an event associated with enhanced activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1), promotion of G0/G1 arrest, and dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). Together, these findings indicate that exposure of U937 cells ectopically-expressing Bcl-2 to the combination of UCN-01 + IR leads to a further reduction in cell proliferation, and that this phenomenon appears to involve a non-apoptotic mechanism.","['Cartee, Leanne', 'Sankala, Heidi', 'Davis, Christine', 'Smith, Rebecca', 'Maggio, Sonia', 'Lin, Peck-Sun', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Cartee L', 'Sankala H', 'Davis C', 'Smith R', 'Maggio S', 'Lin PS', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'U937 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/*radiation effects']",2002/07/16 10:00,2003/01/28 04:00,['2002/07/16 10:00'],"['2002/07/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/16 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2002 Aug;21(2):351-9.,"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA72955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to p-nitrotoluene (greater than 99% pure) in feed for 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and rat and mouse bone marrow cells. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm p-nitrotoluene (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 55, 110, or 240 mg p-nitrotoluene/kg body weight to males and 60, 125, or 265 mg/kg to females) for 105 or 106 weeks. Survival, Body Weights, and Feed Consumption: Survival of all exposed groups of rats was similar to that of the control groups. Mean body weights of 5,000 ppm male and 2,500 and 5,000 ppm female rats were less than those of the controls during most of the study; mean body weights of 1,250 ppm females were less during the second year of the study. Feed consumption by 5,000 ppm females was less than that by the controls during year 2 of the study. Biomarkers of Exposure: Two urinary metabolites were followed during the study as biomarkers of exposure. The ratios of p-nitrobenzoic acid to creatinine and of p-acetamidobenzoic acid to creatinine determined at 2 weeks and at 3, 12, and 18 months were linearly related to exposure concentration in males and females. Pathology Findings: The incidence of clitoral gland adenoma or carcinoma (combined) was significantly greater in 2,500 ppm females than that in the controls and exceeded the historical control ranges. The incidence of clitoral gland neoplasms was not increased in 5,000 ppm females, possibly because of the lower body weights in this group. The incidences of subcutaneous fibroma and of subcutaneous fibroma or fibrosarcoma (combined) in 2,500 ppm male rats were significantly increased and exceeded the historical control ranges. The incidences of several nonneoplastic kidney lesions were significantly increased in exposed groups of rats, and the severities of these lesions generally increased with increasing exposure concentration. In the spleen, incidences of hematopoietic cell proliferation and pigmentation were significantly increased in the 2,500 and 5,000 ppm groups. Significantly increased incidences of various types of altered cell foci in the liver of males and females were associated with exposure. Incidences of germinal epithelial atrophy of the testis in 5,000 ppm males and endometrial cystic hyperplasia of the uterus in 2,500 and 5,000 ppm females were significantly increased. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia were significantly decreased in all exposed groups except 1,250 ppm females. The incidence of interstitial cell adenoma of the testis in 5,000 ppm males was significantly decreased. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm p-nitrotoluene (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 170, 345, or 690 mg/kg to males and 155, 315, or 660 mg/kg to females) for 105 or 106 weeks. Survival, Body Weights, and Feed Consumption: Survival of all exposed groups of male and female mice was similar to that of the control groups. Mean body weights of 5,000 ppm males and females were less than those of the control groups during most of the study. Mean body weights of 2,500 ppm males were less than those of the controls after week 92. Feed consumption by all exposed groups of mice was similar to that by the control groups. Pathology Findings: The incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) was significantly greater in 5,000 ppm male mice than in the controls, as was the incidence of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia in this group. The incidences of alveolar epithelial bronchiolization were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males and females. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: p-Nitrotoluene was not mutagenic in any of several strains of S. typhimurium, with or without metabolic activation enzymes (S9). A positive response to p-nitrotoluene was observed in the L5178Y mouse lymphoma cell assay in trials with S9. Significantly increased sister chromatid exchange frequencies were observed in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells treated with p-nitrotoluene with and without S9. Chromosomal aberrations were also induced in Chinese hamster ovary cells treated with p-nitrotoluene in the presence of S9; no increased aberrations were seen without S9. p-Nitrotoluene did not induce a significant reproducible increase in the frequency of micronuclei in bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes of male rats or male mice when administered by intraperitoneal injection. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity* of p-nitrotoluene in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of subcutaneous skin neoplasms. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of p-nitrotoluene in female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of clitoral gland neoplasms.

Affected individuals show hypolobulated neutrophil nuclei with coarse chromatin. Presumed homozygous individuals have ovoid neutrophil nuclei, as well as varying degrees of developmental delay, epilepsy and skeletal abnormalities. Homozygous offspring in an extinct rabbit lineage showed severe chondrodystrophy, developmental anomalies and increased pre- and postnatal mortality. Here we show, by carrying out a genome-wide linkage scan, that PHA is linked to chromosome 1q41-43. We identified four splice-site, two frameshift and two nonsense mutations in LBR, encoding the lamin B receptor. The lamin B receptor (LBR), a member of the sterol reductase family, is evolutionarily conserved and integral to the inner nuclear membrane; it targets heterochromatin and lamins to the nuclear membrane. Lymphoblastoid cells from heterozygous individuals affected with PHA show reduced expression of the lamin B receptor, and cells homozygous with respect to PHA contain only trace amounts of it. We found that expression of the lamin B receptor affects neutrophil nuclear shape and chromatin distribution in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings have implications for understanding nuclear envelope-heterochromatin interactions, the pathogenesis of Pelger-like conditions in leukemia, infection and toxic drug reactions, and the evolution of neutrophil nuclear shape.","['Hoffmann, Katrin', 'Dreger, Christine K', 'Olins, Ada L', 'Olins, Donald E', 'Shultz, Leonard D', 'Lucke, Barbara', 'Karl, Hartmut', 'Kaps, Reinhard', 'Muller, Dietmar', 'Vaya, Amparo', 'Aznar, Justo', 'Ware, Russell E', 'Sotelo Cruz, Norberto', 'Lindner, Tom H', 'Herrmann, Harald', 'Reis, Andre', 'Sperling, Karl']","['Hoffmann K', 'Dreger CK', 'Olins AL', 'Olins DE', 'Shultz LD', 'Lucke B', 'Karl H', 'Kaps R', 'Muller D', 'Vaya A', 'Aznar J', 'Ware RE', 'Sotelo Cruz N', 'Lindner TH', 'Herrmann H', 'Reis A', 'Sperling K']","['Gene Mapping Center, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine and Franz Volhard Clinic, HELIOS Klinikum, Charite, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (lamin B receptor)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Female', 'Founder Effect', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Haplotypes/genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', '*Mutation', 'Pedigree', 'Pelger-Huet Anomaly/*genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sweden']",2002/07/16 10:00,2002/09/07 10:01,['2002/07/16 10:00'],"['2002/07/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/ng925 [doi]', 'ng925 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2002 Aug;31(4):410-4. doi: 10.1038/ng925.

In this study, we show that synaptotagmin II (Syt II), a member of the Syt family of proteins, is required for TPA-induced degradation of PKCalpha. Thus, whereas the kinase half-life in TPA-treated cultured mast cells (the mast cell line rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3) is 2 hours, it is doubled in RBL-Syt II(-) cells, in which the cellular level of Syt II is reduced by >95% by transfection with Syt II antisense cDNA. We demonstrate that in TPA-treated RBL cells, PKCalpha travels from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where it is delivered to early endosomes on its route to degradation. By contrast, in TPA-treated RBL-Syt II(-) cells, PKCalpha is diverted to recycling endosomes and remains distributed between the plasma membrane and the perinuclear recycling endocytic compartment. Notably, in both RBL and RBL-Syt II(-) cells, a fraction of PKCalpha is delivered and maintained in the secretory granules (SG). These results implicate Syt II as a critical factor for the delivery of internalized cargo for degradation. As shown here, one consequence of Syt II suppression is a delay in PKCalpha downregulation, resulting in its prolonged signaling.","['Peng, Ze', 'Grimberg, Elena', 'Sagi-Eisenberg, Ronit']","['Peng Z', 'Grimberg E', 'Sagi-Eisenberg R']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Antisense Elements (Genetics))', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Synaptotagmin II)', '0 (Syt2 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antisense Elements (Genetics)/pharmacology', 'Cell Compartmentation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Cytosol/drug effects/enzymology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Endocytosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Endosomes/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Mast Cells/cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*deficiency/genetics', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Kinase C/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Protein Transport/drug effects/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Secretory Vesicles/drug effects/enzymology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Synaptotagmin II', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/07/16 10:00,2003/06/17 05:00,['2002/07/16 10:00'],"['2002/07/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/17 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/16 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2002 Aug 1;115(Pt 15):3083-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While many methods have been developed to analyze such data, most have been visualization-based. Methods that yield quantitative conclusions have been diverse and complex. RESULTS: We present two straightforward methods for identifying specific genes whose expression is linked with a phenotype or outcome variable as well as for systematically predicting sample class membership: (1) a conservative, permutation-based approach to identifying differentially expressed genes; (2) an augmentation of K-nearest-neighbor pattern classification. Our analyses replicate the quantitative conclusions of Golub et al. (1999; Science, 286, 531-537) on leukemia data, with better classification results, using far simpler methods. With the breast tumor data of Perou et al. (2000; Nature, 406, 747-752), the methods lend rigorous quantitative support to the conclusions of the original paper. In the case of the lymphoma data in Alizadeh et al. (2000; Nature, 403, 503-511), our analyses only partially support the conclusions of the original authors.

Assessing the clinical relevance of the BCRP will require sensitive and specific methods for detecting its expression and function that allow high-volume specimen throughput and employ widely available instrumentation. METHODS: The BXP-34 and BXP-21 monoclonal antibodies were evaluated for flow cytometric detection of BCRP expression. The modulation of efflux of rhodamine-123, 3,3'-diethyloxacarbocyanine iodide, doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone by fumitremorgin C was studied as an assay for BCRP function in BCRP-overexpressing cell lines and controls. RESULTS: BXP-34 and BXP-21 allowed detection of BCRP expression by flow cytometry in all BCRP-expressing cell lines. Mitoxantrone was the only substrate transported by BCRP in all lines, and with mitoxantrone at a 3-microM concentration, light emission (>670 nm) caused by excitation at 488 nm was sufficiently intense to allow detection of differences in retention associated with low levels of BCRP expression. CONCLUSIONS: Immunophenotyping with BXP-21 or BXP-34 and fumitremorgin C modulation of mitoxantrone retention allow detection of BCRP expression and function by flow cytometry with standard instrumentation. These assays will facilitate determination of the role of BCRP in clinical drug resistance.","['Minderman, Hans', 'Suvannasankha, Attaya', ""O'Loughlin, Kieran L"", 'Scheffer, George L', 'Scheper, Rik J', 'Robey, Robert W', 'Baer, Maria R']","['Minderman H', 'Suvannasankha A', ""O'Loughlin KL"", 'Scheffer GL', 'Scheper RJ', 'Robey RW', 'Baer MR']","['Leukemia Section, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Science Building 616, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. hans.minderman@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*analysis/*biosynthesis/immunology/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mitoxantrone/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/07/13 10:00,2002/12/04 04:00,['2002/07/13 10:00'],"['2002/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.10111 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 2002 Jun 1;48(2):59-65. doi: 10.1002/cyto.10111.,"['1R21 CA 89938-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have found that spontaneous, symptomatic hypoglycemia (SH) may also occur in such patients. PROCEDURE: Between 1995 and 1999, patients treated according to the AIEOP-ALL-95 study received BFM-type intensive chemotherapy; mercaptopurine (6-MP) was given (60 mg/m(2)/days, orally for 14 days) during the second part of induction and during consolidation therapy (25 mg/m(2)/day, orally for 8 weeks); thioguanine (6-TG) was given during reinduction therapy with protocol II (60 mg/m(2)/day, orally for 14 days); continuation therapy consisted of a combination of 6-MP (50 mg/m(2)/day orally) and methotrexate (MTX, 20 mg/m(2)/weekly, i.m.). We reviewed the charts of all patients treated for childhood ALL at our two centers. This was done to assess the incidence and the characteristics of all episodes of SH: sweating, pallor, nausea, abdominal pain with or without transient alterations of alertness, in the presence of blood glucose level of under 60 mg/dl. RESULTS: Six of 86 patients (6.9%) developed 18 episodes of SH. Five were male, none was older than 5 years, and four were only 3 years old. SH episodes occurred during consolidation (n = 2), reinduction (n = 7), and continuation (n = 9) phases. CONCLUSIONS: SH is a rare complication associated with administration of the purine analogues, mercaptopurine and thioguanine to children with reduced fat storage and young age.","['Ziino, Ottavio', 'Russo, Delia', 'Orlando, Maria Antonietta', 'Benigno, Vincenzo', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Arico, Maurizio']","['Ziino O', 'Russo D', 'Orlando MA', 'Benigno V', 'Locatelli F', 'Arico M']","['Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Ospedale dei Bambini ""G.

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is a useful tool for the detection of fusion transcript resulting from specific chromosomal translocation of the leukemic cells. In general, fusion transcripts are determined individually, a process which is labor intensive in order to detect all major fusion transcripts. PROCEDURE: We use a multiplex RT-PCR assay to detect both the CML- and ALL-type BCR-ABL transcripts of the t(9;22), all described variants of the E2A-PBX1 transcripts of t(1;19), the MLL-AF4 transcripts of t(4;11), and all described variants of TEL-AML1 (also termed ETV6-CBFA2) of the cryptic t(12;21) in 165 leukemic samples at diagnosis. RESULTS: The study yielded a completely concordant result with those obtained by the individual RT-PCR assay. In this cohort of Taiwan children, the relative frequencies of the four translocations of B-lineage ALL were as following: 6% with ALL-type t(9;22)/BCR-ABL, 7% t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1, 3% t(4;11)/MLL-AF4, and 18% t(12;21)/TEL-AML1, comparable to those in the Western countries. CONCLUSION: Multiplex RT-PCR assay is an efficient, sensitive, accurate, and cost-effective diagnostic tool, which will likely improve our ability in accurately and rapidly risk-stratifying children with ALL.","['Liang, Der-Cherng', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Yang, Chao-Ping', 'Hung, Iou-Jih', 'Chen, Shu-Huey', 'Jaing, Tang-Her', 'Liu, Hsi-Che', 'Chang, Wan-Hui']","['Liang DC', 'Shih LY', 'Yang CP', 'Hung IJ', 'Chen SH', 'Jaing TH', 'Liu HC', 'Chang WH']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']",2002/07/13 10:00,2002/08/07 10:01,['2002/07/13 10:00'],"['2002/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10092 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2002 Jul;39(1):12-7. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10092.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this prospective study, we determined the magnitude of acute arrhythmogenicity of those agents in children. PROCEDURE: Thirty-three patients with diverse malignancies (leukemia n = 16, Wilms tumor n = 3, brain tumor n = 3, lymphoma n = 3, others n = 8) were studied with Holter monitors 24 hr before, during, and in the first 24 hr following the first-dose therapy. RESULTS: Two patients experienced conduction disturbances (phases of 2nd degree sinuatrial and atrioventricular blocks) during a 4-hr period corresponding to a 30 mg/m(2) daunorubicin infusion. Eight patients experienced supraventricular extrasystole (SE), ventricular extrasystole (VE), and/or short salvos of supraventricular (SVT) and/or ventricular tachycardia (VT). Six had leukemia (therapy: daunorubicin + vincristine), one had a lymphoma (therapy: vincristine + cyclophosphamide), and the last one a brain tumor (therapy: carboplatin + procarbazine). Three patients with leukemia had pretreatment arrhythmias (1 VT, 2 SVT). One of them and the five other patients had arrhythmias during and after the first-dose therapy (2 VE, 2 SVT, 1 SVT + VE, 1 VE + SE + SVT). No patient had life-threatening arrhythmias and no prognostic value of those disturbances could be demonstrated.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: PubMed and Medline were searched for prospective trials and reviews of febrile neutropenia in children. Magnitude and duration of fever and neutropenia, comorbidities, and therapeutic strategies were examined. RESULTS: Twenty-seven prospective trials and five reviews were identified. The child with cancer and low-risk febrile neutropenia is clinically well and afebrile within 24-96 hr of antibiotic therapy and has evidence of marrow recovery with a rising phagocyte count. Disqualifying comorbidities include leukemia at diagnosis or in relapse, uncontrolled cancer, age under 1 year, medical condition(s) that would otherwise require hospitalization and social or economic conditions that may potentially compromise access to care or compliance. Therapeutic strategies include parenteral or oral antibiotics in the hospital with early discharge or parenteral antibiotics in the outpatient setting followed by oral or parenteral therapy and daily reassessment. Although as many as 25% of low-risk patients require modification of therapy and/or hospitalization, life-threatening or fatal infection is exceptional. CONCLUSION: One-third to one-half the children with febrile neutropenia are at low-risk of serious infection. In the context of clinic trials, they can be safely managed with inpatient or outpatient strategies that maintain close follow-up and reduce the burden of antibiotic therapy. Adoption of these alternative strategies as the standard of care should proceed with caution guided by written protocols.","['Orudjev, Elmar', 'Lange, Beverly J']","['Orudjev E', 'Lange BJ']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, The University of Pennsylvania, School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Algorithms', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*complications/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Fever/*microbiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Monocytes', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications/*etiology/therapy', 'Neutrophils', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment']",2002/07/13 10:00,2002/08/03 10:01,['2002/07/13 10:00'],"['2002/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10073 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2002 Aug;39(2):77-85. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10073.,,,51,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concentration that induced 50% growth inhibition (IC(50)) against CPT was 0.14 and 0.20 microM in parental K562/WT and MCF7/WT cells, respectively. The drug resistant subline KH30 and MCF7/VP cells, which both overexpress MRP1, presented IC(50) values of 0.63 and 3.10 microM, respectively. The resulting resistance indexes were 3.80 and 12.50, respectively. However, in KH300 cells, a cell line that preferentially overexpresses Pgp, the IC(50) of CPT was 0.08 microM and thus did not exhibit resistance against CPT. In MCF7/DoX cells, preferentially overexpressing Pgp, but also a significant level of MRP1, the IC(50) of CPT was 0.64 microM and thus presented a resistance index of 3.26 against CPT. The cytotoxic effect of CPT was modulated in cells expressing MRP1 (MCF7/VP, HT29 cells) by the specific MRP1 modulators, probenecid and MK571. These results led us to consider CPT as a substrate for MRP1 and a potential modulator of MRP1 activity. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of nontoxic concentrations of CPT to sensitize MRP1-overexpressing cells to daunorubicin (DNR). In MCF7/VP and KH30 cells, nontoxic concentrations of CPT were able to enhance cytotoxicity of DNR and its nuclear accumulation. Sequential and simultaneous associations of CPT (100 nM) and DNR provided complete reversal of resistance, thus showing a synergistic effect in KH30 cells. However, simultaneous association (with 10 or 20 nM CPT) had an additive effect in MCF7/VP. These data suggest that CPT could be proposed as a candidate for the reversal of the MRP1 phenotype at clinically achievable concentrations.","['Chauvier, David', 'Kegelaer, Gregory', 'Morjani, Hamid', 'Manfait, Michel']","['Chauvier D', 'Kegelaer G', 'Morjani H', 'Manfait M']","['Unite MeDIAN, CNRS UMR 6142, UFR de Pharmacie, IFR53, 51 rue Cognacq Jay, 51096 Reims, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharm Sci,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2985195R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '139568-96-0 (Ccl6 protein, mouse)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chemokines, CC/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/07/13 10:00,2003/01/14 04:00,['2002/07/13 10:00'],"['2002/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/jps.10162 [doi]', 'S0022-3549(16)31061-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pharm Sci. 2002 Aug;91(8):1765-75. doi: 10.1002/jps.10162.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss Inc. and the American Pharmaceutical Association'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified a population-based cohort of 1,065 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis in the Swedish In-patient Register. Through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register, we followed the cohort for cancer occurrence for up to 26 years. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) between observed and expected numbers of cancers were used as a measure of relative risk. There was a 2-fold overall increased risk for cancer in the cohort. The increase was most pronounced for bladder cancer (SIR = 4.8; 95% CI 2.6-8.1), squamous cell skin cancer (SIR = 7.3; 95% CI 4.4-12), leukemias (SIR = 5.7; 95% CI 2.3-12) and for malignant lymphomas (SIR = 4.2; 95% CI 4.2-8.3).

The first question is answered by comparing the occurrence of cancer in twins to that in singletons; the second is answered in probandwise analysis of monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins or siblings. We used the nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database on 10.2 million individuals and 62,574 0-66-year-old twins to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all main cancer compared to cancer in singletons. In probandwise analysis, the SIR was calculated for the co-twin of an affected twin. The overall risk of cancer in same or opposite sex twins was at the level of the risk for singletons. Testicular cancer was increased among same sex twins and all twins to an SIR of 1.43. Melanoma was decreased in these groups of twins to an SIR of 0.84. Some other cancer sites were increased or decreased in some groups of twins, but none in all twins. The SIR of breast cancer was 1.01 and 1.04 in same and opposite sex twins, respectively. Probandwise analysis showed increased risks for Hodgkin's disease in males and breast cancer and childhood acute lymphoid leukemia among females. The data on this unselected population of twins suggest that twinning per se is not a risk factor of cancer. However, because twins are smaller than singletons at birth, some possible effects could be masked by such differences. In utero hormonal exposures may be related to the risk of testicular cancer. The protective effects in melanoma may be due to socioeconomic factors.","['Hemminki, Kari', 'Li, Xinjun']","['Hemminki K', 'Li X']","['Department of Biosciences at Novum, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden. kari.hemminki@cnt.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Twin Study']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Diseases in Twins/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2002/07/13 10:00,2002/08/07 10:01,['2002/07/13 10:00'],"['2002/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.10441 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2002 Jun 20;99(6):873-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.10441.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Overall cancer incidence was not elevated compared with the general population of Sweden (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.98-1.08). A reduced rate for all respiratory cancers (SIR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.59-0.91) and for lung cancer (SIR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.58-0.91) was found among both men and women. Elevated rates were found for prostate (SIR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.06-1.34) and bone cancer (SIR = 6.00; 95% CI = 1.24-17.52) in men. The bone cancer excess was based on three observed cases, two of which occurred at a site unrelated to the implant and the site of the third tumor is unknown. Rates of connective tissue cancer and leukemia-lymphoma were not elevated significantly among knee implant recipients. Long-term follow-up (>or= 10 years) did not show a significant excess risk for all cancer (SIR = 1.10; 95% CI = 0.86-1.38) or for any site-specific cancer, including bone cancer, lymphoma, or leukemia. Subgroup analyses for patients with rheumatoid arthritis produced results similar to the overall results. CONCLUSIONS: This epidemiologic study of cancer risk among patients with knee implants is the largest to date. It provides evidence that the incidence of cancer among patients with knee implants is similar to that of the general population. Continued follow-up of this cohort is warranted to evaluate further potential long-term effects of these implants.","['Fryzek, Jon P', 'Ye, Weimin', 'Signorello, Lisa B', 'Lipworth, Loren', 'Blot, William J', 'McLaughlin, Joseph K', 'Nyren, Olof']","['Fryzek JP', 'Ye W', 'Signorello LB', 'Lipworth L', 'Blot WJ', 'McLaughlin JK', 'Nyren O']","['International Epidemiology Institute, Rockville, Maryland 20850, USA. fryzek@iei.ws']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/surgery', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fractures, Bone/surgery', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Knee Prosthesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Osteoarthritis/surgery', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2002/07/13 10:00,2002/08/03 10:01,['2002/07/13 10:00'],"['2002/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.10580 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2002 Jun 1;94(11):3057-62. doi: 10.1002/cncr.10580.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard therapy for such patients is undetermined. Imatinib mesylate, a Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown activity in CML. METHODS: The authors report on a patient with CML and marrow as well as extramedullary nodal T cell lymphoid blastic phase who was treated with imatinib mesylate. RESULTS: The patient achieved complete morphologic and cytogenetic remission within two months of therapy. Competitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of marrow cells was negative after 15 months. Response had lasted for 26+ months at the time of writing.

However, there are few studies on FLT3/ITD in childhood AML, and the clinical significance of FLT3/ITD is thus unclear. METHODS: FLT3/ITD was analyzed in 80 children with de novo AML. The genomic DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was performed to identify FLT3/ITD. Genescan analysis to determine the allelic distribution was then performed for those PCR products with aberrant bands. Direct sequencing of PCR products was also carried out in each sample with FLT3/ITD. RESULTS: The incidence of FLT3/ITD was 11.3% (9 out of 80 patients) in AML, with 25% (3 out of 12 patients) in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and 8.8% (6 out of 68 patients) in non-M3 AML. The size of duplicated fragments varied from 21 base pairs (bp) to 75 bp, and the mutant to wild type ratio of FLT3 ranged from 0.28 to 16.60 in the nine patients with FLT3/ITD. The incidence of FLT3/ITD in childhood AML in patients > 10 years of age was 24%, compared to 5% of those patients <or= 10 years of age (P = 0.011). The six non-M3 AML patients with FLT3/ITD were all older than 10 years of age. In APL, FLT3/ITD was found in 2 of 2 patients with S-form PML/RARalpha, compared with 1 in 10 patients with non-S form PML/RARalpha(P = 0.045). There were no cytogenetic abnormalities or fusion transcripts derived from common specific translocations found in non-M3 AML patients with FLT3/ITD. There was no significant difference in treatment outcome between APL patients with FLT3/ITD and those without FLT3/ITD. The authors failed to find a correlation between the treatment outcome and the presence of FLT3/ITD in non-M3 AML patients. Instead, the authors found that all three patients with a mutant FLT3 to wild type ratio of greater than 2.0 died within eight months after diagnosis; two of them failed to achieve complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: The current study shows that the mutant FLT3 to wild type ratio, but not the presence of FLT3/ITD itself, may serve as a potential marker to improve risk-assessment in childhood AML.","['Liang, Der-Cherng', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Hung, Iou-Jih', 'Yang, Chao-Ping', 'Chen, Shu-Huey', 'Jaing, Tang-Her', 'Liu, Hsi-Che', 'Chang, Wan-Hui']","['Liang DC', 'Shih LY', 'Hung IJ', 'Yang CP', 'Chen SH', 'Jaing TH', 'Liu HC', 'Chang WH']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2002/07/13 10:00,2002/08/01 10:01,['2002/07/13 10:00'],"['2002/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.10598 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2002 Jun 15;94(12):3292-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.10598.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Randomized-controlled trials of azoles (fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and miconazole) or intravenous amphotericin B formulations compared with placebo/no treatment or polyene-based controls in severely neutropenic chemotherapy recipients were evaluated using meta-analytical techniques. RESULTS: Thirty-eight trials that included 7014 patients (study agents, 3515 patients; control patients, 3499 patients) were analyzed. Overall, there were reductions in the use of parenteral antifungal therapy (prophylaxis success: odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.48-0.68; relative risk reduction [RRR], 19%; number requiring treatment for this outcome [NNT], 10 patients), superficial fungal infection (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.20-0.43; RRR, 61%; NNT, 12 patients), invasive fungal infection (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.35-0.55; RRR, 56%; NNT, 22 patients), and fungal infection-related mortality (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.41-0.82; RRR, 47%; NNT, 52 patients). Invasive aspergillosis was unaffected (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.62-1.44). Although overall mortality was not reduced (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.74-1.03), subgroup analyses showed reduced mortality in studies of patients who had prolonged neutropenia (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.95) or who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59-0.99). The multivariate metaregression analyses identified HSCT, prolonged neutropenia, acute leukemia with prolonged neutropenia, and higher azole dose as predictors of treatment effect. CONCLUSIONS: Antifungal prophylaxis reduced morbidity, as evidenced by reductions in the use of parenteral antifungal therapy, superficial fungal infection, and invasive fungal infection, as well as reducing fungal infection-related mortality. These effects were most pronounced in patients with malignant disease who had prolonged neutropenia and HSCT recipients.","['Bow, Eric J', 'Laverdiere, Michel', 'Lussier, Nathalie', 'Rotstein, Coleman', 'Cheang, Mary S', 'Ioannou, Stratis']","['Bow EJ', 'Laverdiere M', 'Lussier N', 'Rotstein C', 'Cheang MS', 'Ioannou S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, the University of Manitoba and CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. ebow@hsc.mb.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Mycoses/*prevention & control', 'Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2002/07/13 10:00,2002/08/01 10:01,['2002/07/13 10:00'],"['2002/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.10610 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2002 Jun 15;94(12):3230-46. doi: 10.1002/cncr.10610.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The GE not only contains precursor neurons of the basal ganglia, it also contributes significantly to the population of interneurons in the cerebral cortex and to a population of thalamic neurons. The latter migrate through a distinct transient structure, the gangliothalamic body (GTB). The GE also represents an intermediate target for growing thalamic axons (on their way to the cerebral cortex) and cortical axons (on their way to the thalamus). In developmental neuropathology the GE plays an important role in prematurely born infants. The pathogenesis of GE bleedings is discussed with regard to the abundant expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptors on GE cells. The consequences of such bleedings are discussed in view of cellular responses, such as the induction of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expression in GE cells after hemorrhage.","['Ulfig, Norbert']",['Ulfig N'],"['Neuroembryonic Research Laboratory, Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany. norbert.ulfig@med.uni-rostock.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Anat Rec,The Anatomical record,0370540,,IM,"['Cell Movement', 'Cerebral Cortex/cytology/*embryology', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Infant, Premature', 'Infant, Premature, Diseases', 'Neurons/cytology', 'Thalamus/cytology/*embryology']",2002/07/13 10:00,2002/12/04 04:00,['2002/07/13 10:00'],"['2002/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ar.10104 [doi]'],ppublish,Anat Rec. 2002 Jul 1;267(3):191-5. doi: 10.1002/ar.10104.,,,53,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This sequence was contained in the bacterial artificial chromosome RP11-65J3, which in fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments on normal metaphases was found to detect, in addition to the predicted clear signal at 9q34, a faint but distinct signal at 22q11.2, where the BCR gene is located, suggesting the presence of a large region of homology between the two chromosomal regions. Indeed, blast analysis of the RP11-65J3 sequence against the entire human genome revealed the presence of a stretch of homology, about 76 kb long, located approximately 150 kb 3' to the BCR gene, and containing the 126-bp insertion sequence. Evolutionary studies using fluorescence in situ hybridization identified the region as a duplicon, which transposed from the region orthologous to human 9q34 to chromosome 22 after the divergence of orangutan from the human-chimpanzee-gorilla common ancestor about 14 million years ago. Recent sequence analyses have disclosed an unpredicted extensive segmental duplication of our genome, and the impact of duplicons in triggering genomic disorders is becoming more and more apparent. The discovery of a large duplicon relatively close to the ABL and BCR genes and the finding that the 126-bp insertion is very close to the duplicon at 9q34 open the question of the possible involvement of the duplicon in the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome translocation.","['Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Storlazzi, Clelia T', 'Giugliano, Emilia', 'Surace, Cecilia', 'Anelli, Luisa', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Zagaria, Antonella', 'Jimenez Velasco, Antonio', 'Heiniger, Anabel', 'Scaravaglio, Patrizia', 'Torres Gomez, Antoni', 'Roman Gomez, Jose', 'Archidiacono, Nicoletta', 'Banfi, Sandro', 'Rocchi, Mariano']","['Saglio G', 'Storlazzi CT', 'Giugliano E', 'Surace C', 'Anelli L', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Zagaria A', 'Jimenez Velasco A', 'Heiniger A', 'Scaravaglio P', 'Torres Gomez A', 'Roman Gomez J', 'Archidiacono N', 'Banfi S', 'Rocchi M']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy. saglio@csi.it']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Evolution', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Primates/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2002/07/13 10:00,2002/09/06 10:01,['2002/07/13 10:00'],"['2002/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.152171299 [doi]', '152171299 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Jul 23;99(15):9882-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.152171299.

Within cells, MTX is metabolized to more active methotrexate polyglutamates (MTXPG), and these polyglutamates are subsequently cleaved in lysosomes by gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH). GGH is reported to act as either an endopeptidase or an exopeptidase, exhibiting species differences in these functions. To better define the in vivo functions of GGH in human leukemia cells, we characterized GGH activity with different MTXPG substrates (MTX with three to five glutamates) in human T- and B-lineage leukemia cell lines, and in primary leukemia cells from newly diagnosed patients with ALL. Parameters estimated from fitting a series of hypothetical mathematical models to the data revealed that the experimental data were best fit by a model where GGH simultaneously cleaved multiple glutamyl residues, with highest activity at cleaving the outermost or two outermost residues from a polyglutamate chain. The model also revealed that GGH has a higher affinity for longer chain polyglutamates. Together, these findings provide new insights to the intracellular disposition of MTX in human ALL cells, and provides a mechanism-based model for characterizing differences among patients and genetic subtypes of ALL.","['Panetta, John Carl', 'Wall, Amelia', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Evans, William E']","['Panetta JC', 'Wall A', 'Pui CH', 'Relling MV', 'Evans WE']","[""Departments of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/*metabolism']",2002/07/13 10:00,2003/01/22 04:00,['2002/07/13 10:00'],"['2002/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Jul;8(7):2423-9.,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have shown that they are functionally involved in the growth and invasion of cancer cells. However, there are only a few publications on CAs in hematological malignancies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Here we investigated the presence of CA isozymes in six malignant hematopoietic cell lines and malignant blast cells of bone marrow samples collected from patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. RESULTS: Because three of the malignant hematopoietic cell lines expressed CA II, we also set out to examine its expression in a series of bone marrow samples. Positive reactions were found in 16 of 26 cases (62%) of acute myeloid leukemia, 11 of 15 cases (73%) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 1 of 2 cases (50%) of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that CA II expression is not restricted to only one cell lineage but may result from a genetic aberration that occurs in both myeloid and lymphatic lineages or in their progenitor cell. Because CA II is expressed in most patients with leukemic blast cells, CA inhibitors may prove to be of value as an adjunct to chemotherapy for such cancers.","['Leppilampi, Mari', 'Koistinen, Pirjo', 'Savolainen, Eeva-Riitta', 'Hannuksela, Jokke', 'Parkkila, Anna-Kaisa', 'Niemela, Onni', 'Pastorekova, Silvia', 'Pastorek, Jaromir', 'Waheed, Abdul', 'Sly, William S', 'Parkkila, Seppo', 'Rajaniemi, Hannu']","['Leppilampi M', 'Koistinen P', 'Savolainen ER', 'Hannuksela J', 'Parkkila AK', 'Niemela O', 'Pastorekova S', 'Pastorek J', 'Waheed A', 'Sly WS', 'Parkkila S', 'Rajaniemi H']","['Departments of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Clinical Chemistry,University of Oulu, 90220 Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 4.2.1.- (Carbonic Anhydrase II)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Carbonic Anhydrase II/*metabolism', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*enzymology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/07/13 10:00,2003/01/22 04:00,['2002/07/13 10:00'],"['2002/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Jul;8(7):2240-5.,"['DK40163/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK53405/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM34182/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to define the methylation characteristics of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using bisulfite-PCR followed by restriction enzyme digestion (COBRA), we have analyzed the methylation status of 10 promoter-associated CpG islands in 80 untreated adult patients with ALL. RESULTS: Mean methylation density of MDR1, THBS2, MYF3, ER, p15, THBS1, CD10, C-ABL, and p16 was 24.5%, 20.8%, 17.6%, 16.1%, 11.3%, 8.9%, 4.5%, 3.7%, and 1.3% respectively. p73 was methylated in 17 of 80 cases (21.2%). A total of 86.2% of the cases had methylation of at least one gene, and 42.5% of the cases had methylation of three or more genes. MDR1 methylation was inversely correlated with age (P = 0.01). CD10 methylation inversely correlated with CD10 expression (P = 0.0001). Methylation of MDR1 and THBS1 was inversely associated with the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, whereas C-ABL methylation correlated with the presence of the p210 variant of the Philadelphia chromosome. In univariate analysis, methylation of THBS1 was associated with a favorable outcome (P = 0.02), whereas methylation of p73, p15, and C-ABL was associated with a trend toward worse prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant DNA methylation of promoter-associated CpG islands is very common in adult ALL and potentially defines subgroups with distinct clinical and biological characteristics.","['Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Daniel, Jerry', 'Smith, Terry L', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Lee, Ming-Sheng', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Garcia-Manero G', 'Daniel J', 'Smith TL', 'Kornblau SM', 'Lee MS', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Issa JP']","['Departments of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

Median patient age was 55 years; 34% were 60 years or older, and median chronic-phase duration was 33 months. Overall, 94% achieved a complete hematological response, and 71% had a cytogenetic response [major (Ph+ cells <35%) in 62% and complete in 45%]. At a median follow-up of 17 months, 241 patients (92%) were still taking imatinib mesylate; estimated 18-month freedom from progression and survival rates were 93 and 96%. Multivariate analysis of factors associated with major cytogenetic response identified long chronic phase, marrow basophilia, high percentage of Ph+ cells before therapy, and prior hematological resistance to IFN-alpha as being adverse factors. This model was used to generate good-, intermediate- and poor-risk subgroups who had estimated major cytogenetic response rates of 93, 53, and 34%, respectively. Univariate analysis in terms of survival identified leukocytosis, high percentages of peripheral and marrow blasts, marrow basophilia, and the presence of cytogenetic clonal evolution as being adverse factors. Achieving a cytogenetic response at 3 or 6 months of therapy was associated with prolonged survival. In a subset analysis, survival rates among 161 patients with Ph-positive CML after hematological or cytogenetic failure after IFN-alpha who had been treated with imatinib mesylate were better than those for similar patients treated previously with other regimens. In summary, imatinib mesylate is highly effective in chronic-phase CML after IFN-alpha failure. We identified pretreatment and treatment-associated factors that were associated with higher major cytogenetic response rates and with improved survival.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Talpaz, Moshe', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Smith, Terry L', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Koller, Charles', 'Beran, Milosav', 'Keating, Michael', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Shan, Jenny', 'Resta, Debra', 'Capdeville, Renaud', 'Hayes, Kimberly', 'Albitar, Maher', 'Freireich, Emil J', 'Cortes, Jorge E']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Talpaz M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Smith TL', 'Giles FJ', 'Faderl S', 'Thomas DA', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Issa JP', 'Andreeff M', 'Kornblau SM', 'Koller C', 'Beran M', 'Keating M', 'Rios MB', 'Shan J', 'Resta D', 'Capdeville R', 'Hayes K', 'Albitar M', 'Freireich EJ', 'Cortes JE']","['Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We treated 237 patients (median age, 50 years; age range, 18-82 years) with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive accelerated-phase CML with oral imatinib mesylate at daily doses of 400 mg (26 patients) or 600 mg (211 patients) and evaluated response and survival characteristics in univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Among the 200 patients with accelerated-phase CML for whom follow-up was 3 months or more, rates of complete and partial hematological response were 80% and 10%. Cytogenetic responses were evident in 90 patients [45%; complete response in 47 patients (24%) and partial response (Ph 1-34%) in 21 patients (11%)]. The estimated 18-month survival rate was 73%. The estimated complete hematological response rate at 18 months was 68%; that for cytogenetic response was 82%. In multivariate analyses, a diagnosis-to-treatment interval of 3 years or more, splenomegaly, and peripheral blasts predicted poor major cytogenetic response; age >60 years, marrow basophilia, and clonal evolution predicted poor survival. The 600-mg drug dose was associated with better cytogenetic response and survival in univariate analysis (P < 0.01) but not in multivariate analysis. Landmark analysis showed that achieving a cytogenetic response at 3 months or a major cytogenetic response (Ph < 35%) at 6 months was associated with better long-term survival. Seven of 15 patients who were in a second chronic phase achieved major cytogenetic response. The incidence of severe nonhematological toxic effects was 23%; drug discontinuation for severe toxicity was needed in 3% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib mesylate was active against Ph-positive, accelerated-phase CML, and the prognostic factors identified in this study could aid in tailoring treatment strategies to specific risk groups.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Smith, Terry L', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Yang, Ying', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Wierda, William', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Keating, Michael', 'Resta, Debra', 'Capdeville, Renaud', 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Kantarjian HM', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes JE', 'Smith TL', 'Rios MB', 'Shan J', 'Yang Y', 'Giles FJ', 'Thomas DA', 'Faderl S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Jeha S', 'Wierda W', 'Issa JP', 'Kornblau SM', 'Keating M', 'Resta D', 'Capdeville R', 'Talpaz M']","['Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

DX-8951f is active in a human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) severe combined immunodeficient mouse model. In a leukemia Phase I study, we investigated the toxicity profile and pharmacokinetics of DX-8951f in patients with primary refractory or relapsed AML or acute lymphocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DX-8951f was given as an i.v. infusion over 30 min daily for 5 or 7 days. The starting dose was 0.6 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days (3.0 mg/m(2)/course). Courses were given every 3-4 weeks according to toxicity and antileukemic efficacy. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (AML, 21 patients; myelodysplastic syndrome, 1 patient; acute lymphocytic leukemia, 2 patients; CML-BP, 1 patient) were treated. Stomatitis was the dose-limiting toxicity, occurring in two of two patients treated at 1.35 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days, two of three treated at 1.2 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days, and one of six treated at 0.9 mg/m(2)/day for 7 days. The recommended Phase II dose was 0.9 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days. The pharmacokinetics of DX-8951 was linear and well fit by a two-compartment model.

The bryostatin 1 maximally tolerated dose (MTD) was identified as 50 microg/m(2), with myalgias representing the major dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Other DLTs included prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and hepatotoxicity. Of the 23 patients who completed their course of therapy and were fully evaluable for response, the large majority of whom had unfavorable prognostic characteristics, 4 complete remissions (CRs) were obtained. An additional 3 patients were treated at a 3 g/m(2) ara-C (1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine) dose level to determine whether this HiDAC dose could be administered in conjunction with bryostatin 1. All 3 of these patients experienced DLT, and this dose was considered above the MTD. However, one of the latter patients, who was heavily pretreated, also achieved a CR that persisted 5+ months without maintenance. Finally, 1 patient post-HiDAC and autologous bone marrow transplantation achieved a 5+ month leukemia-free survival although she did not meet the criteria for a CR because of persistent transfusion requirements. Correlative laboratory studies performed on blasts from 9 patients revealed that in vivo administration of bryostatin 1 resulted in variable effects on total blast PKC activity, including decreases in 4 samples, increases in 2, and no change in 3. Previous in vivo bryostatin 1 exposure also exerted disparate effects on the extent of apoptosis observed in blasts exposed to ara-C ex vivo, although increases were noted in a subset of patient samples. Interestingly, in vivo administration of bryostatin 1 by itself induced lethality in some patient specimens. No clear relationship between the in vivo effects of bryostatin 1 on blast PKC activity and the extent of ara-C-related apoptosis that occurred ex vivo was apparent. Together, these findings demonstrate that bryostatin 1 can be safely administered as a continuous infusion before and after a split course of HiDAC in patients with refractory leukemia, and identify the bryostatin 1 MTD as 50 microg/m(2) when given by this schedule. Furthermore, the achievement of several CRs in the setting of a Phase I trial in which many patients had particularly high-risk features (e.g., short initial remission, previous HiDAC or autologous bone marrow transplantation, and multiple previous salvage regimens) suggests that this regimen has activity in acute leukemia and warrants additional investigation.","['Cragg, Louise H', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Feldman, Eric', 'Roberts, John', 'Murgo, Anthony', 'Winning, Mary', 'Tombes, Mary Beth', 'Roboz, Gail', 'Kramer, Lora', 'Grant, Steven']","['Cragg LH', 'Andreeff M', 'Feldman E', 'Roberts J', 'Murgo A', 'Winning M', 'Tombes MB', 'Roboz G', 'Kramer L', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23284, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bryostatins', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Lactones/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",2002/07/13 10:00,2003/01/22 04:00,['2002/07/13 10:00'],"['2002/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Jul;8(7):2123-33.,"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA92950/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have suggested that depletion of CD8+ T cells from the infused donor lymphocytes can reduce the incidence of graft-versus-host disease associated with DLI without reducing antileukemia activity. In this situation however, the immune effector cells responsible for tumor rejection have not been identified. The goal of this study was to characterize these effector populations. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied three representative patients with relapsed chronic myeloid leukemia who achieved complete molecular remission after receiving CD8+ T-cell-depleted DLI from HLA-identical sibling donors. Effector T cells were characterized in patient samples after in vitro stimulation and functional assessment. T-cell clones relevant to the immune response were then isolated and further characterized. RESULTS: Analysis of peripheral blood samples collected after DLI indicated the presence of a high frequency of circulating host-reactive cytolytic CD8+ T cells secreting IFN-gamma. These HLA class I-restricted CTLs were specific for recipient minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAs) because they did not recognize target cells of donor origin. One CTL clone was further expanded in vitro and shown to recognize a broadly expressed mHA presented by HLA-B5701.

Since androgens can modulate the programmed cell death in responsive cell lines, we decided to investigate the induction of apoptosis in THP-1 cells following their differentiation into macrophage-like cells and exposure to sex hormones. In addition, we decided to evaluate the proto-oncogene Bax and Fas (CD 95) and cleaved PARP (poly-adp-ribose-polymerase) expression in the same cultured cells. The results showed for the first time the dose-/time-dependent regulation of the apoptotic event in human monocytic THP-1 cells treated with different concentrations of androgens. No significant changes were observed for estrogen-treated and unstimulated control cells. In particular, the cells, after stimulation with androgens but not with estrogens, were found to be positive for the proto-oncogene Bax, Fas, and for cleaved subunits of PARP expression as demonstrated with different assays including immunocytochemical assay and Western blot analysis. In conclusion, these results support the possibility of sex hormone modulation of apoptosis in macrophage-like cells, with interesting therapeutic perspectives in rheumatoid arthritis.","['Cutolo, Maurizio', 'Sulli, Alberto', 'Craviotto, Chiara', 'Felli, Lamberto', 'Pizzorni, Carmen', 'Seriolo, Bruno', 'Villaggio, Barbara']","['Cutolo M', 'Sulli A', 'Craviotto C', 'Felli L', 'Pizzorni C', 'Seriolo B', 'Villaggio B']","['Laboratory and Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Specialities, University of Genova, Genova, Italy. mcutolo@unige.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Estradiol/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Testosterone/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis/genetics']",2002/07/13 10:00,2002/08/16 10:01,['2002/07/13 10:00'],"['2002/07/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.2002.tb04216.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2002 Jun;966:204-10. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2002.tb04216.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The amino derivative of AMP397 was negative in wild-type strains TA98 and TA100. AMP397 was negative in a mouse lymphoma tk assay, which included a 24h treatment without S9. A weak micronucleus induction in vitro was found at the highest concentrations tested in V79 cells with S9. AMP397 was negative in the following in vivo studies, which included the maximum tolerated doses of 320mg/kg in mice and 2000mg/kg in rats: MutaMouse assay in colon and liver (5x320mg/kg) at three sampling times (3, 7 and 31 days after the last administration); DNA binding study in the liver of mice and rats after a single treatment with [14C]-AMP397; comet assay (1x2000mg/kg) in jejunum and liver of rats, sampling times 3 and 24h after administration; micronucleus test (2x320mg/kg) in the bone marrow of mice, sampling 24h after the second administration.

Active immunotherapy by vaccination with genetically modified autologous leukemia cells is being evaluated in clinical trials. Allogeneic stem cell transplant for adoptive immunotherapy of CLL is yet another modality being investigated. While this modality may have limited application due to morbidity in older patients, it may result in improved survival and possibly cure.

Direct implantation of retrovirus producer cells can bypass some of the limitations, and in situ vector production may result in a large number of gene transfer events. However, the fibroblast nature of most retrovirus packaging cells does not provide for an effective distribution of vector producing foci in vivo, especially in the brain. Effective development of new retrovirus producer cells with enhanced biologic properties may require the testing of a large number of different cell types, and a quick and efficient method to generate them is needed. METHODS: Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) gag-pol and env genes and retrovirus vector sequences carrying lacZ were cloned into different minimal HSV/AAV hybrid amplicons. Helper virus-free amplicon vectors were used to co-infect glioma cells in culture. Titers and stability of retrovirus vector production were assessed. RESULTS: Simultaneous infection of two glioma lines, Gli-36 (human) and J3T (dog), with both types of amplicon vectors, generated stable packaging populations that produced retrovirus titers of 0.5-1.2 x 10(5) and 3.1-7.1 x 10(3) tu/ml, respectively. Alternatively, when cells were first infected with retrovirus vectors followed by infection with HyRMOVAmpho amplicon vector, stable retrovirus packaging populations were obtained from Gli-36 and J3T cells producing retrovirus titers comparable to those obtained with a traditional retrovirus packaging cell line, Psi CRIPlacZ. CONCLUSIONS: This amplicon vector system should facilitate generation of new types of retrovirus producer cells. Conversion of cells with migratory or tumor/tissue homing properties could result in expansion of the spatial distribution or targeting capacity, respectively, of gene delivery by retrovirus vectors in vivo.","['Sena-Esteves, Miguel', 'Hampl, Jurgen A', 'Camp, Sara M', 'Breakefield, Xandra O']","['Sena-Esteves M', 'Hampl JA', 'Camp SM', 'Breakefield XO']","['Molecular Neurogenetics Unit and Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Simplexvirus/*genetics', '*Transduction, Genetic', '*Virus Assembly']",2002/07/12 10:00,2002/12/05 04:00,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.276 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2002 May-Jun;4(3):229-39. doi: 10.1002/jgm.276.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the expression patterns of HB-EGF in normal cycling endometrium and compared its expression with the fertility-associated endometrial epithelial biomarkers alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and homeobox gene, HOXA-10. RNase protection assay (RPA) using RNA made from endometrium collected from different phases of the menstrual cycle demonstrated increased HB-EGF expression during the mid-secretory phase, a pattern similar to, but slightly preceding the expression of alpha(v)beta(3) integrin and HOXA-10. In vitro studies demonstrated stimulation of HB-EGF expression by estradiol-17beta (E(2)) and progesterone (P(4)) alone or in combination in stromal cells. Combined treatment with E(2) + P(4) was, however, required to stimulate epithelial HB-EGF expression. In vitro experiments demonstrated the ability of HB-EGF to stimulate epithelial expression of the key endometrial proteins including LIF, HOXA-10, and the beta(3) integrin subunit. Each has previously been demonstrated to be an important epithelial biomarker expressed during the implantation window. In addition, conditioned media from endometrial stromal cells treated with E(2) + P(4) + relaxin mimicked the stimulatory effect of HB-EGF on epithelial expression of the beta(3) integrin subunit. The stimulatory effect of the stromal-conditioned medium was blocked by antibodies that neutralize a known receptor for HB-EGF. These data suggest that uterine receptivity may be regulated in part by the stromal-derived HB-EGF.","['Lessey, Bruce A', 'Gui, Yaoting', 'Apparao, K B C', 'Young, Steven L', 'Mulholland, Joy']","['Lessey BA', 'Gui Y', 'Apparao KB', 'Young SL', 'Mulholland J']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA. lessey@med.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Reprod Dev,Molecular reproduction and development,8903333,"['0 (HBEGF protein, human)', '0 (Hbegf protein, mouse)', '0 (Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Steroids)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Menstrual Cycle/metabolism', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Steroids/physiology']",2002/07/12 10:00,2003/03/13 04:00,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mrd.10129 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Reprod Dev. 2002 Aug;62(4):446-55. doi: 10.1002/mrd.10129.,"['5K12-HD 01269-2/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 34824/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U5-HD35041/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The second was in the form of coalescing pits (holes) with smooth, minimally remodeled edges. The appearance combined features of multiple myeloma and leukemia, but were mutually exclusive in those diseases. Spheroid lesions with effaced edges were absent in leukemia, while pits were absent in multiple myeloma. Fronts of resorption were not noted in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.

The NUP98-HOXA9 fusion gene has been identified in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia with t(7;11)(p15;p15). We report here a novel NUP98 partner gene, HOXA13, in a patient with de novo AML having t(7;11)(p15;p15). The HOXA13 gene is part of the HOXA cluster genes and contains 2 exons, encoding a protein of 338 amino acids with a homeodomain. The NUP98-HOXA13 fusion protein consists of the N-terminal phenylalanine-glycine repeat motif of NUP98 and the C-terminal homeodomain of HOXA13, similar to the NUP98-HOXA9 fusion protein. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in various leukemic cell lines showed that the HOXA13 gene was expressed significantly more frequently in acute monocytic leukemic cell lines than in other leukemic cell lines (P = 0.039). HOXA13 and three HOXA cluster genes (A9, A10, A11) located at the 5' end of the HOXA9 gene were frequently expressed in myeloid leukemic cell lines. Our results revealed that t(7;11)(p15;p15) was not a single chromosomal abnormality at the molecular level. The protein encoded by the NUP98-HOXA13 fusion gene is similar to that encoded by NUP98-HOXA9, and the expression pattern of the HOXA13 gene in leukemic cell lines is similar to that of the HOXA9 gene, suggesting that the NUP98-HOXA13 fusion protein may play a role in leukemogenesis through a mechanism similar to that of the NUP98-HOXA9 fusion protein.","['Taketani, Takeshi', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Ono, Ryoichi', 'Kobayashi, Yukio', 'Ida, Kohmei', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide']","['Taketani T', 'Taki T', 'Ono R', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Ida K', 'Hayashi Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA13)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2002/07/12 10:00,2002/08/14 10:01,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10077 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2002 Aug;34(4):437-43. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10077.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Defining these transcription factor combinations is an important aspect of research in developmental neurobiology that promises to provide incredible insights into the structure, function, and pathology of the central nervous system. The present study aimed to investigate a possible role for the Stem Cell Leukemia (SCL) gene, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor gene, in the specification of a population of neural cells in the ventral neural tube. Section RNA in situ hybridisation revealed that SCL is transiently expressed within the V2 postmitotic domain of the developing mouse spinal cord between 10.5 and 13.5 days post coitum. Double-immunofluorescence experiments were subsequently carried out to directly compare the expression of SCL with other V2-specific markers at the cellular level. These experiments revealed that SCL is expressed in a medially restricted subpopulation of GATA-3 producing cells, suggesting a possible role for this factor in the differentiation of the GATA population of V2 interneurons.","['Smith, Emma', 'Hargrave, Murray', 'Yamada, Toshiya', 'Begley, C Glenn', 'Little, Melissa Helen']","['Smith E', 'Hargrave M', 'Yamada T', 'Begley CG', 'Little MH']","['Institute for Molecular Bioscience, incorporating the Special Research Centre for Functional and Applied Genomics, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Dyn,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,9201927,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Spinal Cord/*embryology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2002/07/12 10:00,2003/01/15 04:00,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/15 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/dvdy.10093 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Dyn. 2002 Jun;224(2):231-7. doi: 10.1002/dvdy.10093.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, clustering occurs in at least two fragile domains rich in telomere-like arrays. Here we describe a physical map of the distal breakpoint cluster and confirm the presence of inverted head-to-head telomeric sequence arrays. These potentially recombinogenic sequences were not, however, the direct focus for post-irradiation chromosome breakage in AML. Instead, the two arrays bordered a 2.5-kb sequence with properties expected of a nuclear matrix attachment region (MAR). The putative MAR co-localized in the fragile domain with genes important to the hemopoietic system (leukocyte tyrosine kinase, zinc finger protein 106, erythrocyte protein band 4.2, and beta(2)-microglobulin (beta2m)); the beta2m subdomain was a particular focus of breakage. On the basis of these and other data, we suggest that AML-associated chromosome 2 fragility in the mouse is a consequence of domain-specific fragility in genomic domains containing numerous genes critical to the hemopoietic system.

To test the hypothesis that methylselenol itself is responsible for exerting these cellular effects, we examined the apoptotic action on DU145 human prostate cancer cells and the G1 arrest effect on the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) of methylselenol generated with seleno-L-methionine as a substrate for L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane lyase (EC4.4.1.11, also known as methioninase). Exposure of DU145 cells to methylselenol so generated in the sub-micromolar range led to caspase-mediated cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and morphologic apoptosis and resulted in a profile of biochemical effects similar to that of methylseleninic acid (MSeA) exposure as exemplified by the inhibition of phosphorylation of protein kinase AKT and extracellularly regulated kinases 1/2. In HUVEC, methylselenol exposure recapitulated the G1 arrest action of MSeA in mitogen-stimulated G1 progression during mid-G1 to late G1. This stage specificity was mimicked by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The results support methylselenol as an active selenium metabolite for inducing caspase-mediated apoptosis and cell-cycle G1 arrest. This cell-free methylselenol-generation system is expected to have significant usefulness for studying the biochemical and molecular targeting mechanisms of this critical metabolite and may constitute the basis of a novel therapeutic approach for cancer, using seleno-L-methionine as a prodrug.","['Wang, Zaisen', 'Jiang, Cheng', 'Lu, Junxuan']","['Wang Z', 'Jiang C', 'Lu J']","['Center for Cancer Causation and Prevention, AMC Cancer Research Center, Denver, Colorado 80214, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (Organoselenium Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (methylserine phosphate)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', '60343-91-1 (methaneselenol)', '964MRK2PEL (Selenomethionine)', '9900C6V162 (methylselenic acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 4.4.- (Carbon-Sulfur Lyases)', 'EC 4.4.1.11 (L-methionine gamma-lyase)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)', 'Y4S76JWI15 (Methanol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Carbon-Sulfur Lyases/*metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Methanol/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Organoselenium Compounds/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoserine', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Selenium/metabolism', 'Selenomethionine/metabolism']",2002/07/12 10:00,2002/09/25 06:00,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mc.10056 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2002 Jul;34(3):113-20. doi: 10.1002/mc.10056.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five extracts (10 microg/mL) from Hernandia nymphaeaefolia, Cerbera manghas, Pongamia pinnata, Morus australis var. glabra and Thespesia populnea greatly inhibited the growth of K562 cells. When the concentration was decreased to 1 microg/mL, only one extract from H. nymphaeaefolia still inhibited the cell growth. A cytotoxic compound was isolated from the leaves by bioassay-guided fractionation and was identified as (-)-deoxypodophyllotoxin (DPT). The fresh leaves of H. nymphaeaefolia contained a remarkably high amount of DPT (0.21 +/- 0.07% of fresh leaf weight), being clarified by a quantitative HPLC analysis. DPT at 70-80 pM started to inhibit the growth of K562 cells in an all-or-none fashion and at 100 pM or more it produced complete inhibition in all cases. Therefore, the slope of the dose-response curve was very steep. DPT at 100 pM or more decreased the cell viability to 50%-60% and increased the number of cells undergoing apoptosis (annexin V-positive cells). The results indicate that DPT contributes to the cytotoxic action of the extract from the leaves of H. nymphaeaefolia on K562 cells.","['Masuda, Toshiya', 'Oyama, Yasuo', 'Yonemori, Shigetomo', 'Takeda, Yoshio', 'Yamazaki, Yuko', 'Mizuguchi, Shinichi', 'Nakata, Mami', 'Tanaka, Tomochika', 'Chikahisa, Lumi', 'Inaba, Yuzuru', 'Okada, Yoshihiko']","['Masuda T', 'Oyama Y', 'Yonemori S', 'Takeda Y', 'Yamazaki Y', 'Mizuguchi S', 'Nakata M', 'Tanaka T', 'Chikahisa L', 'Inaba Y', 'Okada Y']","['Faculty of Integrated Arts and Sciences, University of Tokushima, Tokushima 770-8502, Japan. masuda@ias.tokushima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '69222-20-4 (deoxypodophyllotoxin)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)', 'Y4S76JWI15 (Methanol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'K562 Cells', 'Magnoliopsida/chemistry', 'Methanol', 'Plant Extracts/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/*chemistry', 'Podophyllotoxin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/07/12 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ptr.902 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2002 Jun;16(4):353-8. doi: 10.1002/ptr.902.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without further assumptions, the structural parameter is typically estimated via a series of auxiliary logrank tests, searching for the structural parameter that back-transforms treated survival times to latent treatment-free survival times which are equally distributed between randomized arms. In this paper we investigate to what extent score tests involving baseline covariates provide more powerful auxiliary tests and lead to more precise estimates of the structural parameter without compromising the alpha-level. We propose a set of estimating equations which combines score components for covariate effects based on the control arm only, with a log-likelihood score for treatment effect based on both arms. Analytic results for exponential models as well as simulation studies for the semi-parametric approach indicate that in many practical situations this incorporation of baseline covariates leads to more precise estimators of the structural effect. Relative efficiency is shown to depend on the selective nature of compliance. In a leukaemia trial we find the length of the 95 per cent confidence interval for the structural parameter is reduced to two-thirds of the original length by incorporating baseline covariates in this way.","['Loeys, T', 'Goetghebeur, E']","['Loeys T', 'Goetghebeur E']","['Department of Applied Mathematics and Informatics, University of Ghent, Krijgslaan 281, Building S9, 9000 Gent, Belgium. tom.loeys@rug.ac.be']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Computer Simulation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', '*Patient Compliance', '*Proportional Hazards Models', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*methods']",2002/07/12 10:00,2002/08/01 10:01,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.1087 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2002 May 15;21(9):1173-88. doi: 10.1002/sim.1087.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the cells were maintained in serum-free defined medium, astrocytes developed at high cell density but rarely at a low one. When leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was supplemented in low-density cultures, the levels of GFAP expression markedly increased to almost the same extent as in high-density culture without TH. This suggests that, in low-density cultures, astrocyte progenitors could not differentiate because of insufficient astrocyte-inducing factors. Interestingly, the addition of TH increased GFAP expression levels only at high density. The number of oligodendrocytes increased with TH addition at both cell densities, although the effects were more remarkable at high density.

At diagnosis, the patient had a polyclonal increase of gamma-globulins. Five years after initial diagnosis, the patient presented with monoclonal gammopathy and infiltration of the bone marrow with neoplastic cells. Initially, the patient had received chemotherapy with different protocols (including etoposide, cyclophosphamide, fludarabin, methotrexate, and vincristine), none of which induced a lasting response. Therapy with rituximab (chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) finally led to partial remission. Eighteen months after rituximab, progressive lymphoma in the abdomen and a monoclonal gammopathy developed. The bone marrow showed infiltration by lymphoplasmacytoid cells (monoclonal expression of the light-chain type lambda, positive for CD20, heterogeneous expression of CD45). The patient achieved another short clinical response with 4 cycles of the CHOP-protocol, but soon the lymphoma progressed again. Five years and 8 months after the initial diagnosis, the patient died from septicemia and progressive lymphoma. By polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the IgH gene it was shown that lymphoma cells were initially oligoclonal in the salivary gland and, later, biclonal in the bone marrow. Sequencing of two bands of apparently same length showed that these manifestations of lymphoma were not identical. Taken together, our data show that the initial low-grade oligoclonal MALT lymphoma was no longer present and a more aggressive biclonal lymphoma with plasmacytoid differentiation had developed. The new lymphoma was clonally distinct and produced high amounts of monoclonal IgG lambda by immunoelectrophoresis. The relationship of the second lymphoma to the initial MALT lymphoma is discussed.","['Pachmann, S', 'Anderegg, B', 'Muller-Hocker, J', 'Nathrath, W', 'Brack, N', 'Tigges, F J', 'Hartenstein, R', 'Munker, R']","['Pachmann S', 'Anderegg B', 'Muller-Hocker J', 'Nathrath W', 'Brack N', 'Tigges FJ', 'Hartenstein R', 'Munker R']","['Stadtisches Krankenhaus Munchen-Harlaching (Departments of Medicine IV and Pathology), Pathologisches Institut der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/complications/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraproteinemias/*etiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rituximab', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/complications/*immunology/therapy', 'Submandibular Gland/pathology']",2002/07/12 10:00,2002/08/01 10:01,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.10104 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2002 Jun;70(2):167-73. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10104.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed by flow cytometry the expression of several members of the Bcl-2 family in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) of 168 MDS samples at diagnosis. The proteins studied were Bcl-2, Bcl-xL (anti-apoptotic), Bax, Bad, Bak, and Bcl-xS (pro-apoptotic). The percentage of BMMNC expressing Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was higher in refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) than in refractory anemia (RA) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (RAS). Conversely pro-apoptotic proteins Bad, Bak, and Bcl-xS were detected in a higher percentage of cells in RA and RAS. RA and RAS were associated with an increased Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL ratio. The expression of anti-apoptotic proteins was also correlated with that of CD34 and P170 and with the percentage of blast cells. Two-color analyses demonstrated that CD34 and Bcl-2 were usually expressed in the same cells. No significant correlation was found with cytogenetic abnormalities. Higher expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-family proteins (Bak, Bad, Bcl-xS) and higher Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL ratio were associated with longer survival and decreased risk of leukemic transformation in univariate analysis, whereas expression of anti-apoptotic proteins was associated with decreased survival. Consequently Bcl-2 proteins expression was well correlated with the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). Our data confirm that the control of apoptosis is deregulated in MDS cells. Moreover, the study of markers such as CD34 (or Bcl-2), Bcl-xL, and Bcl-xS provides additional prognostic information.","['Boudard, Delphine', 'Vasselon, Christian', 'Bertheas, Marie-Francoise', 'Jaubert, Jerome', 'Mounier, Christiane', 'Reynaud, Jacqueline', 'Viallet, Annie', 'Chautard, Sylviane', 'Guyotat, Denis', 'Campos, Lydia']","['Boudard D', 'Vasselon C', 'Bertheas MF', 'Jaubert J', 'Mounier C', 'Reynaud J', 'Viallet A', 'Chautard S', 'Guyotat D', 'Campos L']","['Faculte de Medecine J.

In rare core binding factor leukemia patients an increased dosage of a mutated Asp816(Tyr/Val) kit allele is achieved through nonrandom duplication of chromosome 4 where the c-kit gene is located. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The c-kit gene was studied in the core binding factor leukemia cell line Kasumi-1 with t(8;21) by fluorescence in situ hybridization and mutation analysis. The dosage of Asn822(Lys) mutated allele was evaluated by fluorescence semiquantitative PCR. The correct membrane homing of KIT receptor and its activating status was analysed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting respectively. RESULTS: We identified in the Kasumi-1 cell line a novel Asn822(Lys) ligand-independent c-kit activating mutation and demonstrated by semiquantitative PCR that the mutated allele is about fivefold amplified compared to the normal allele. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization analysis revealed that c-kit amplification maps to minute 4cen-q11 derived marker chromosome, often carrying duplicated signals, which are unequally distributed in the cell population. The Asn822(Lys) mutation affects a highly conserved codon within the tyrosine kinase activation loop leading, likewise the Asp(816) mutants, to constitutive ligand-independent activation of the KIT receptor. DISCUSSION: Results obtained point to the Kasumi-1 cell line as powerful in-vitro model for further investigation of altered KIT signal transduction pathways in acute myeloid leukemia with core binding factor rearrangements and a useful tool for pharmacological therapeutic targeting.","['Beghini, Alessandro', 'Magnani, Ivana', 'Ripamonti, Carla B', 'Larizza, Lidia']","['Beghini A', 'Magnani I', 'Ripamonti CB', 'Larizza L']","['Department of Biology and Genetics, Medical Faculty, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Enzyme Activation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/07/12 10:00,2003/07/26 05:00,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2001/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.thj.6200168 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol J. 2002;3(3):157-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200168.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it has been described in a few cases of pre-B ALL with translocation t(17;19)(q22;p13) which results in the fusion of E2A gene with sequences of HLF gene. Here, we report a case of pre-B ALL with DIC and an apparently normal karyotype by R banding. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) studies were performed on bone marrow cells from the patient at presentation and after three months of therapy. RT-PCR was used to detect the E2A-HLF transcript. The type of rearrangement was characterized by sequencing. RESULTS: The t(17;19)(q22;p13) was detected by FISH analysis. The fusion E2A-HLF was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced, giving a type I rearrangement with a long insertion (146 nucleotides) between E2A exon 13 and HLF exon 4. CONCLUSION: While translocation t(17;19) is undetectable by R-banding technique, it can be detected with FISH and amplified with RT-PCR. Therefore, systematic molecular investigations should be conducted for all patients with pre-B ALL associated with DIC, in order to appreciate the incidence and the prognostic value of this rare abnormality.","['Daheron, Laurence', 'Brizard, Francoise', 'Millot, Frederic', 'Cividin, Marie', 'Lacotte, Laurence', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Brizard, Andre']","['Daheron L', 'Brizard F', 'Millot F', 'Cividin M', 'Lacotte L', 'Guilhot F', 'Brizard A']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie (CNRS FRE 2224), Poitiers University Hospital, France.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/etiology/*genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/genetics', 'Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2002/07/12 10:00,2003/07/26 05:00,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2000/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2001/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.thj.6200169 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol J. 2002;3(3):153-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200169.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous epidemiological studies have mainly focused on cases derived from single institutions or from localized cancer registries. This is the first study in which all cases diagnosed nationwide over a long period of time in a well defined population are analysed. We report the epidemiology of all HCL patients in Iceland, their clinical characteristics, treatment and follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: : All patients diagnosed with HCL in Iceland over a 20 year period, were included in this study. Data was collected retrospectively. RESULTS: Sixteen patients, 13 males and three females were diagnosed with HCL in Iceland from 1981-2000, giving a mean incidence of 4.7/million/year (95% CI: 2.7-7.6) in the population 20 years and older. Eleven patients were treated with a purine analogue, 10 of whom achieved CR. One other patient obtained CR following splenectomy and IFN, giving a total CR rate of 69%. Three other patients (19%) obtained PR, giving a total response rate of 88%. One patient had a variant of HCL and did not respond to any therapy and one patient died of sepsis before any chemotherapy could be given. Six patients with HCL have died, one from complications of HCL. Three patients developed a second malignancy (19%). CONCLUSIONS: The mean incidence of HCL in Iceland is 4.7/million/year. This is slighty higher than the reported incidence in England and Wales, although not significantly higher. The incidence is based on a nationwide information from a well defined stable and racially homogenous island population. Other results are in accordance with previously published studies.","['Kristinsson, Sigurdur Yngvi', 'Vidarsson, Brynjar', 'Agnarsson, Bjarni A', 'Haraldsdottir, Vilhelmina', 'Olafsson, Orn', 'Johannesson, Gudmundur M', 'Eyjolfsson, Gudmundur I', 'Bjornsdottir, Johanna', 'Onundarson, Pall T', 'Reykdal, Sigrun']","['Kristinsson SY', 'Vidarsson B', 'Agnarsson BA', 'Haraldsdottir V', 'Olafsson O', 'Johannesson GM', 'Eyjolfsson GI', 'Bjornsdottir J', 'Onundarson PT', 'Reykdal S']","['Department of Hematology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland. sigrunre@landspitali.is']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Iceland/epidemiology', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/complications/*epidemiology/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retrospective Studies']",2002/07/12 10:00,2003/07/26 05:00,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2002/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.thj.6200167 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol J. 2002;3(3):145-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200167.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this single center study was to evaluate the prognostic factors and compare the prognostic scoring systems in Chinese patients with MDS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight patients diagnosed as primary MDS in our Institution were studied retrospectively to identify significant prognostic factors and to assess the predictive value of 11 previously described prognostic systems, including French-American-British (FAB) classification, World Health Organization (WHO) classification, Mufti, Sanz, Morra, Aul, Oguma, Toyama, Morel and international prognostic scoring system (IPSS). RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 50 years (range 13-82). The 2- and 5-year survival rate of the patients were 55.22+/-4.90% and 26.09+/-6.36% respectively, with a median survival of 31 months (range 1-127 months). Fifty patients (39.1%) had progressed to acute leukemia (AL) with a median time of 8 months (range 1-43 months). Major independent variables indicated by multivariate analysis were the percentage of bone marrow (BM) blast cells and complex karyotype aberrations for survival (P=0.042 and 0.042, respectively) and only the percentage of BM blast cells for AL transformation (P=0.023). All the systems except Mufti scores successfully discriminated risk groups concerning both survival and AL evolution, especially in the high risk group, ranging from 10 to 20 months and from 4 to 7 months, respectively. The FAB and WHO classification, as well as Sanz, Oguma, Morel and IPSS possessed lower P value (P<0.0001) than that of the rest scoring systems. CONCLUSION: The patients in our study were younger than these of the Western population, whereas the survival and AL transformation ratio were comparable to these previous studies. The BM blast proportion and complex chromosomal defects were highly significant for predicting outcome in MDS patients. Most investigated systems effectively stratified patients into groups with different life expectancies and identified a subset of patients with poor clinical outcome. The FAB, WHO classification, as well as Sanz, Oguma, Morel and IPSS scoring systems were more applicable for predicting survival and leukemia progression.","['Zhao, Wei-Li', 'Xu, Lan', 'Wu, Wen', 'Yan, Hua', 'Tang, Wei', 'Hu, Jiong', 'Chen, Yu', 'Li, Jun-Ming', 'Zeng, Xiao Ying', 'Xiong, Shu-Min', 'Shen, Zhi-Xiang', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Wang, Zhen-Yi', 'Chen, Sai-Juan']","['Zhao WL', 'Xu L', 'Wu W', 'Yan H', 'Tang W', 'Hu J', 'Chen Y', 'Li JM', 'Zeng XY', 'Xiong SM', 'Shen ZX', 'Chen Z', 'Wang ZY', 'Chen SJ']","['Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genome Research, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, 197 Rui Jin Er Road, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'China', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate']",2002/07/12 10:00,2003/07/26 05:00,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2002/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.thj.6200173 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol J. 2002;3(3):137-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200173.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood transfusion, the established treatment, has an immediate effect in improving patients' hemoglobin levels. However, this effect is transient and transfusion is associated with several risks, including infections and mild to life-threatening immunologic reactions. A newer option is recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin); a biological treatment that leads to increased hemoglobin levels over an extended time without the risks of blood transfusion. Extensive evidence has shown that epoetin is effective in the treatment of cancer-associated anemia. An international expert panel met to develop treatment recommendations for the use of epoetin in MM and CLL patients. Based on the available data, it is recommended that treatment be initiated only after other possible causes of anemia are eliminated. Epoetin should be administered to any patient with hemoglobin < or=10 g/dl. Patients with hemoglobin 10-12 g/dl should receive epoetin if they suffer from significant symptoms of anemia and/or have progressively decreasing hemoglobin values. Dosage should be initiated at 10 000 IU three times/week or 40 000 IU once/week and be titrated to maintain hemoglobin at 12 g/dl. Nonresponsive patients (<1 g/dl increase over four weeks) may have their dose increased to 20 000 IU three times/week or 60 000 IU once/week, respectively. Epoetin treatment should be discontinued if there is no response to the increased dosage, or hemoglobin >14 g/dl. Treatment should resume for patients who exceed 14 g/dl, at a reduced dosage, if their hemoglobin falls below 12 g/dl.","['Ludwig, Heinz', 'Rai, Kanti', 'Blade, Joan', 'Dammacco, Franco', 'Degos, Laurent', 'Itri, Loretta', 'Kyle, Robert', 'Liso, Vicenzo', 'Littlewood, Timothy James', 'Mandelli, Franco', 'Meloni, Giovanna', 'Molica, Stefano', 'Osterborg, Anders', 'Pangalis, Gerassimos A', 'San Miguel, Jesus', 'Schmitt, Barbara', 'Voliotis, Dimitrios']","['Ludwig H', 'Rai K', 'Blade J', 'Dammacco F', 'Degos L', 'Itri L', 'Kyle R', 'Liso V', 'Littlewood TJ', 'Mandelli F', 'Meloni G', 'Molica S', 'Osterborg A', 'Pangalis GA', 'San Miguel J', 'Schmitt B', 'Voliotis D']","['Department of Medicine and Medical Oncology, Wihelminenspital, Montleartstrasse 37, A-1171 Vienna, Austria.

Ten subjects were studied for each group by incubating neutrophils with various doses of alpha-IFN. Basal neutrophil adhesions for CML patients, BD patients and healthy volunteers were similar. However, BD patients had greater basal phagocytosis than CML patients, and both groups had greater basal phagocytosis than healthy volunteers. Neutrophil adhesion and phagocytosis of CML patients increased following incubation with higher doses of alpha-IFN, and phagocytosis approached the high levels observed with BD neutrophils.

Store-operated Ca(2+) entry is intimately related to the prevalent membrane potential, in that hyperpolarisation enhances Ca(2+) influx and depolarisation reduces it. Inwardly rectifying potassium channels are important determinants of the membrane potential and hence will regulate, indirectly, the rate and extent of Ca(2+) entry through store-operated channels. Here we investigated inwardly rectifying potassium currents ( I(RK)) in rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-1) cells, a model system for studying store-operated Ca(2+) influx. I(RK) was voltage dependent in that the current decays during strong hyperpolarisations. Recovery from this decay was both time and voltage dependent. Close to the resting potential of RBL-1 cells, however, I(RK) was stable. Neither store depletion per se nor the subsequent rise in intracellular [Ca(2+)] appeared to alter I(RK) activity. Receptor stimulation reduced the current only weakly. Unexpectedly, intracellular spermine inhibited I(RK) quite strongly and via a mechanism that seemed distinct from that responsible for current rectification. The relevance of these findings to store-operated Ca(2+) influx is discussed.","['Straube, Sebastian', 'Parekh, Anant B']","['Straube S', 'Parekh AB']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signalling, Department of Physiology, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pflugers Arch,Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,0154720,"['0 (Cholinergic Agonists)', '0 (Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', '8Y164V895Y (Carbachol)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Carbachol/pharmacology', 'Cholinergic Agonists/pharmacology', 'Ion Channel Gating/drug effects/physiology', '*Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Potassium/metabolism', 'Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Spermine/*pharmacology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/physiology']",2002/07/12 10:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2001/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2002/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2002/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00424-002-0812-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Pflugers Arch. 2002 Jun;444(3):389-96. doi: 10.1007/s00424-002-0812-2.

However, DC-based immunotherapy remains a challenge and several parameters need to be examined in order to optimize the induction of anti-tumor immune responses. This study focuses on DC vaccination for leukemia and evaluates the in vitro efficacy of three different strategies for generating antigen-loaded DC-based vaccines for the induction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted anti-leukemia cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. These included direct fusion of DC with leukemia cells to generate DC-leukemia cell hybrids, and DC pulsed with either apoptotic leukemia cell fragments or whole tumor cell lysates. Using either the U937 cell line or primary human acute myeloid leukemia blasts (AML), DC-leukemia cell hybrids were found to be the most potent in vitro inducers of CTL activity. DC pulsed with apoptotic tumor cell fragments were less efficient, but induced a more potent CTL response compared to tumor lysate-pulsed DC. The CTL responses were both MHC class I-restricted and antigen-specific, as shown by the inability of the CTL to lyse other control targets.

METHODS: We evaluated 192 patients with previously untreated B-cell CLL who were entered onto the fludarabine treatment arm (25 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days every 28 days) of CALGB study 9011, an intergroup study with participation from SWOG, CTG/NCI-C and ECOG. Patients were required to have serum creatinine within 1.5 times normal. Hematologic indices and infections were recorded during the first 28-day cycle of treatment. A time-to-toxicity endpoint was evaluated over the entire course of fludarabine treatment. Creatinine clearance (CrCl(est)) was estimated using serum creatinine, age and body mass index. RESULTS: The median age was 64 years (range 37-87 years) and median CrCl(est) was 62 ml/min (range 27-162 ml/min, interquartile range 52-79 ml/min). We found no association between age and incidence of hematologic toxicity or infection during the first cycle of treatment. There was a strong association between CrCl(est) and the time-to-toxicity endpoint. Patients with CrCl(est) below 80 ml/min had increased incidence of toxicity during their treatment course ( P<0.0001). Pretreatment anemia, thrombocytopenia and Rai stage were highly associated with the incidence of neutrophil toxicity and grade III/IV hematologic toxicities during the first cycle of treatment ( P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Patient age was not an independent risk factor for fludarabine-related toxicity, but CrCl(est) was associated with time to toxicity.","['Martell, Robert E', 'Peterson, Bercedis L', 'Cohen, Harvey Jay', 'Petros, William P', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Morrison, Vicki A', 'Elias, Laurence', 'Shepherd, Lois', 'Hines, John', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Schiffer, Charles A', 'Hurwitz, Herbert I']","['Martell RE', 'Peterson BL', 'Cohen HJ', 'Petros WP', 'Rai KR', 'Morrison VA', 'Elias L', 'Shepherd L', 'Hines J', 'Larson RA', 'Schiffer CA', 'Hurwitz HI']","['Geriatrics Research, Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Hematology/Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Body Mass Index', 'Creatinine/*blood', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Humans', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/*adverse effects/analogs & derivatives']",2002/07/12 10:00,2002/08/22 10:01,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2001/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-002-0443-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2002 Jul;50(1):37-45. doi: 10.1007/s00280-002-0443-5.

METHODS: Ten consecutive children treated on the MRC ALL97 protocol were studied. Six were randomized to TG and four to MP. Leucocyte and erythrocyte thiopurine nucleotide metabolites were measured after the children had been titrated to the standard thiopurine protocol dose, or higher. RESULTS: Children taking TG accumulated significantly higher erythrocyte TGN concentrations than those taking MP (median difference 1171 pmol/8 x 10(8) erythrocytes, 95% CI 766 to 2169, P<0.02), but there was no significant difference in the concentration range of leucocyte TGNs generated from TG or MP. In those children taking TG, median TGN concentrations were 5142 pmol/8 x 10(8) leucocytes and 1472 pmol/8 x 10(8) erythrocytes (3.5-fold difference, median difference 3390 pmol/8 x 10(8) cells, 95% CI 1559 to 7695, P=0.005), compared to 5422 pmol/8 x 10(8) leucocytes and 261 pmol/8 x 10(8) erythrocytes (20-fold difference, median difference 5054 pmol/8 x 10(8) cells, 95% CI 2281 to 6328, P=0.03) in those taking MP. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the accumulation of significantly higher erythrocyte TGN concentrations for TG compared with MP, the accumulation of leucocyte TGNs in children taking TG was similar to the range of leucocyte TGNs in children taking MP. Therefore, when correlating intracellular TGNs to clinical effect, the range of erythrocyte TGN metabolites will be higher for those children taking TG than in those taking MP.","['Lancaster, D L', 'Patel, N', 'Lennard, L', 'Lilleyman, J S']","['Lancaster DL', 'Patel N', 'Lennard L', 'Lilleyman JS']","[""Imperial Cancer Research Fund Children's Cancer Group, Barts and the London School of Medicine, The Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, London E1 1BB, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocyte Count', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",2002/07/12 10:00,2002/08/22 10:01,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2001/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-002-0442-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2002 Jul;50(1):33-6. doi: 10.1007/s00280-002-0442-6.

The latter has recently been recognized as a risk factor for the development of osteoporosis later in life. To determine long-term effects of the disease itself and its treatment, we assessed the bone status of a group of long-term survivors of childhood ALL, all treated with high doses of steroids (dexamethasone) and methotrexate and without cranial irradiation. All 21 subjects enrolled in this cross-sectional study were diagnosed to have non-high-risk precursors acute lymphoblastic leukemia (12 boys and 9 girls, mean age 16.5 yr, range 12.2-25.4 yr). Standard deviation (SD) scores were calculated using a tibial ultrasound device and spinal dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) device as bone assessment techniques. SD scores of those two different bone assessment techniques were compared. The mean SOS (speed of sound) SD scores (SDS) of the tibia (mean 0.26, standard deviation [sd] 1.00) were not significantly different from our reference value of 0. There was no significant difference between the SOS SDS in boys and girls. With DXA, no significant difference was seen between the mean BMD SDS and the reference data and no significant difference in BMD between boys and girls was found. The individual mean SDS for bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar spine are 0.24 (sd 1.02), total body 0.17 (sd 1.00), and apparent BMD (BMAD) 0.07 (sd 1.09). Spearman's correlation between mean SOS SDS and mean BMD of lumbar spine was 0.47, mean SOS SDS and mean BMAD SDS was 0.43, and mean SOS SDS and mean BMD of total body was 0.49. These correlations were significant at the 0.05 level (two tailed). Despite high-dose dexamethasone and methotrexate used for treatment of these children with ALL, no long-term side effects on the bone mineral status of the subjects, measured with DXA or tibial ultrasonometry, could be determined.","['Lequin, M H', 'van der Shuis, I M', 'Van Rijn, R R', 'Hop, W C J', 'van ven Huevel-Eibrink, M M', 'MuinckKeizer-Schrama, S M P F', 'van Kuijk, C']","['Lequin MH', 'van der Shuis IM', 'Van Rijn RR', 'Hop WC', 'van ven Huevel-Eibrink MM', 'MuinckKeizer-Schrama SM', 'van Kuijk C']","[""Department of Pediatric Radiology, Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. lequin@rons.azr.nl""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Densitom,Journal of clinical densitometry : the official journal of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry,9808212,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['*Absorptiometry, Photon/methods', 'Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Bone Density/drug effects', 'Bone Diseases/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Tibia/*diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology', 'Ultrasonography/instrumentation']",2002/07/12 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2001/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2001/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['JCD:5:2:167 [pii]', '10.1385/jcd:5:2:167 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Densitom. 2002 Summer;5(2):167-73. doi: 10.1385/jcd:5:2:167.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study represents the first attempt to characterize the effects of hypoxia on the maintenance of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progenitors. CD34(+) cells isolated from apheresis products of CML patients were incubated in hypoxia (1% O(2)) and normoxia (20% O(2)). After 8 days of culture, their proliferation, capacity for colony-forming-cell (CFC) generation in secondary cultures (pre-CFC), and phenotype (CD34 and platelet-activating factor receptor [PAF-R]) were compared with those of normal cells, and tyrosine phosphorylation in CML cells was measured. Hypoxia inhibits the proliferation of CD34(+) cells and preserves the pre-CFC capacity and cell-surface CD34 expression of CML cells better than normoxia. The PAF-R expression, which was absent on freshly isolated cells, was detected at the cell surface in both populations after 8 days of culture, but with a lower percentage of positive cells in CML cell cultures. Incubation in hypoxia suppressed the PAF-R expression of normal cells and increased it in CML cells, resulting in a similar expression in the two populations. These effects could be linked to inhibition by hypoxia of the tyrosine hyperphosphorylation of cellular proteins, a major hallmark of CML cells.","['Desplat, Vanessa', 'Faucher, Jean-Luc', 'Mahon, Francois Xavier', 'Dello Sbarba, Persio', 'Praloran, Vincent', 'Ivanovic, Zoran']","['Desplat V', 'Faucher JL', 'Mahon FX', 'Dello Sbarba P', 'Praloran V', 'Ivanovic Z']","['Laboratoire de Greffe de Moelle, Universite Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (platelet activating factor receptor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', '*Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2002/07/12 10:00,2003/01/09 04:00,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/stemcells.20-4-347 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2002;20(4):347-54. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.20-4-347.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although much work has focused on the regulation of bone resorption by IL-6 and related cytokines, their effects on osteoblast development and bone formation have not been as well studied. Previously, we reported that LIF inhibits, in a non-IL-6-dependent manner, osteoblast differentiation and bone nodule formation in the rat calvaria (RC) model, an effect that is antagonized by dexamethasone (Dex). The culture time-sensitive window suggested that LIF targets late preosteoblasts or early osteoblasts, and that this stage-specific effect coincided with a period of low endogenous production of LIF and IL-6. To detect potential crosstalk between members of this family, we have extended these observations by assessing the expression levels of other LIF/IL-6 cytokines (CNTF, OSM, IL-11, CT-1) and their receptors in the same RC cell model treated with or without LIF or Dex. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that IL-11 and its receptor, CNTF and its receptor, LIFR, and gp130 were constitutively expressed throughout the culture period. Expression of CT-1 and OSM increased with culture time - that is, with osteoblast differentiation - whereas the specific receptor for OSM (OSMR) was highly expressed at early timepoints and either plateaued or decreased thereafter. Continuous treatment with Dex (10(-8) mol/L) inhibited the endogenous production of IL-6, LIF, OSM, IL-11R, and OSMR, but had no detectable effect on the expression of IL-11, CT-1, CNTF, CNTFR, LIFR, or gp130. Finally, treatment with exogenously added LIF stimulated IL-6, LIF, LIFR, and OSMR, but had no other detectable effects. These data indicate that multiple members of the LIF/IL-6 family and their receptors are expressed in RC cell cultures, and are differentially regulated by Dex and LIF, suggesting that these cytokines play a complex and interdependent role, further modulated by glucocorticoid levels, in osteoprogenitor differentiation and bone nodule formation.","['Liu, F', 'Aubin, J E', 'Malaval, L']","['Liu F', 'Aubin JE', 'Malaval L']","['INSERM U403, Hopital E.

Recent studies suggest that Pgp is also responsible for the intracellular transport of cholesterol from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum. Leukemic cells from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia have an elevated uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDL) when compared with white blood cells from healthy individuals. Since elevated LDL receptor expression and multidrug resistance are both common events in leukemic cells, we investigated LDL receptor expression in sensitive and drug resistant human leukemic cell lines. We found a 2- to 10-fold higher uptake of LDL in five out of five drug resistant K562 cell lines. All three drug resistant HL60 cell lines studied also had higher uptake than the parental cells. The LDL receptor expression in vincristine resistant Pgp positive K562 cells was less sensitive to downregulation by sterols than in parental cells. There was no selective effect of the Pgp inhibitor PSC-833 or other Pgp modulators on LDL receptor activity in Pgp positive cells. Since also resistant Pgp, multidrug resistance protein 1, and breast cancer resistance protein negative cells exhibited an elevated LDL receptor activity, we conclude that overexpression of these proteins is not the mechanism behind the elevated LDL uptake in the drug resistant leukemic cell lines. The findings are of interest for the concept of using lipoproteins as carriers of cytotoxic drugs in cancer treatment.","['Tatidis, Loukas', 'Masquelier, Michele', 'Vitols, Sigurd']","['Tatidis L', 'Masquelier M', 'Vitols S']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute & Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. loukas.tatidis@ks.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '0 (Sterols)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases/metabolism', 'Leukemia', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*metabolism', 'Membrane Fluidity', 'Receptors, LDL/drug effects/metabolism', 'Sterols/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",2002/07/12 10:00,2002/08/16 10:01,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295202010183 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01018-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2002 Jun 15;63(12):2169-80. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01018-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A MM2 energy optimized molecular model of a 1:1 complex of compound 6 with DNA reveals that the iso-CFI compound fits snugly within the minor groove. Using a MTT based experiment, the cytotoxicity of compounds 4-7 were determined against the growth of murine leukemia (L1210), mastocytoma (P815) and melanoma (B16) cell lines. The concentrations of compounds required to inhibit the growth of these tumor cells by 50% is in the range of 10(-8)M. These compounds were also tested against a panel of human cancer cells by the National Cancer Institute, demonstrating that the compounds exhibited a high level of activity against selected solid tumors. At a concentration of 0.0084 microM (based on the IC(50) of compound 17 (seco-CBI-TMI) against the growth L1210 cells), while compounds 4 and 17 were toxic against murine bone marrow cells as judged by a colony forming study of freshly isolated murine progenitor hematopoeitic cells, compound 5, a seco-CFQ compound, was significantly less toxic. Flow cytometric analysis of P815 cells that had been incubated for 24h with compounds 4 and 5 at their cytotoxic IC(50) concentrations indicated the induction of apoptosis in a large percentage of cells, thereby suggesting that this might be the mechanism by which the iso-CFI compounds kill cells.","['Howard, Tiffany T', 'Lingerfelt, Brian M', 'Purnell, Bethany L', 'Scott, Adrienne E', 'Price, Carly A', 'Townes, Heather M', 'McNulty, LuAnne', 'Handl, Heather L', 'Summerville, Kaitlin', 'Hudson, Stephen J', 'Bowen, J Phillip', 'Kiakos, Konstantinos', 'Hartley, John A', 'Lee, Moses']","['Howard TT', 'Lingerfelt BM', 'Purnell BL', 'Scott AE', 'Price CA', 'Townes HM', 'McNulty L', 'Handl HL', 'Summerville K', 'Hudson SJ', 'Bowen JP', 'Kiakos K', 'Hartley JA', 'Lee M']","['Department of Chemistry, Furman University, Greenville, SC 29613, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Duocarmycins)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Quinolines)', '118292-35-6 (pyrindamycin B)', '118292-36-7 (pyrindamycin A)', '6DPT9AB2NK (indoline)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Adducts/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Duocarmycins', 'Furans/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Indoles', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Pyrroles/*chemistry/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Quinolines', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2002/07/12 10:00,2003/07/31 05:00,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/31 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0968089602001578 [pii]', '10.1016/s0968-0896(02)00157-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2002 Sep;10(9):2941-52. doi: 10.1016/s0968-0896(02)00157-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its activities are shared by IL-6-related cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor and oncostatin M. The pleiotropy and redundancy of IL-6 functions have been identified by using a unique receptor system comprising two functional proteins: an IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and gp130, the common signal transducer of cytokines related to IL-6. Signal transduction through gp130 is mediated by two pathways: the JAK-STAT (Janus family tyrosine kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway and the Ras mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The negative regulators of IL-6 signaling have also been identified, although the physiological roles of the molecules are not yet fully understood. The pathological roles of IL-6 have also been clarified in various disease conditions, such as inflammatory, autoimmune, and malignant diseases. On the basis of the findings, a new therapeutic approach to block the IL-6 signal using humanized anti-IL-6R antibody for rheumatoid arthritis, Castleman's disease, and multiple myeloma has been attempted.","['Naka, Tetsuji', 'Nishimoto, Norihiro', 'Kishimoto, Tadamitsu']","['Naka T', 'Nishimoto N', 'Kishimoto T']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan. naka@imed3.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Arthritis Res,Arthritis research,100913255,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology']",2002/07/12 10:00,2003/05/23 05:00,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2002/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2002/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/23 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/ar565 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Res. 2002;4 Suppl 3:S233-42. doi: 10.1186/ar565.

IL-15 and IL-2 utilize heterotrimeric receptors that include the cytokine-specific private receptors IL-2Ralpha and IL-15Ralpha, as well as two receptor elements that they share, IL-2Rbeta and gammac. Although IL-2 and IL-15 share two receptor subunits and many functions, at times they provide contrasting contributions to T-cell-mediated immune responses. IL-2, through its pivotal role in activation-induced cell death (AICD), is involved in peripheral tolerance through the elimination of self-reactive T cells. In contrast, IL-15 in general manifests anti-apoptotic actions and inhibits IL-2-mediated AICD. IL-15 stimulates the persistence of memory phenotype CD8+ T cells, whereas IL-2 inhibits their expression. Abnormalities of IL-15 expression have been described in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease and in diseases associated with the retrovirus HTLV-I (human T-cell lymphotropic virus I). Humanized monoclonal antibodies that recognize IL-2Ralpha, the private receptor for IL-2, are being employed to inhibit allograft rejection and to treat T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.

In these preclinical studies, long-term correction of the bleeding disorders and in some cases a permanent cure has been realized. However, complications related to the induction of neutralizing antibodies or viral promoter inactivation often precludes stable phenotypic correction. Several gene therapy phase I clinical trials have been initiated in patients suffering from severe hemophilia A or B. The results from the extensive pre-clinical studies and the preliminary clinical data are encouraging. It is likely that successful gene therapy for hemophilia will become a reality at the beginning of this new millennium, serving as the trailblazer for gene therapy of other diseases.","['VandenDriessche, T', 'Collen, D', 'Chuah, M K']","['VandenDriessche T', 'Collen D', 'Chuah MK']","['Center for Transgene, Technology and Gene Therapy, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology, University of Leuven, 49 Herestraat B-3000 Leuven, Belgium. thierry.vandendriessche@med.kuleuven.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Gene Ther,Current gene therapy,101125446,"['9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)', '9001-28-9 (Factor IX)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Dependovirus/genetics', 'Dogs', 'Factor IX/genetics', 'Factor VIII/genetics', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Hemophilia A/genetics/*therapy', 'Hemophilia B/genetics/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics']",2002/07/12 10:00,2002/08/01 10:01,['2002/07/12 10:00'],"['2002/07/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1566523013348508 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Gene Ther. 2001 Sep;1(3):301-15. doi: 10.2174/1566523013348508.,,,139,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, clinical application has been hampered by difficulties in stem cell engraftment following treatment of donor bone marrow inocula with LLME at the concentrations necessary to purge DPPI-expressing T-cells. Noting that T-cells can mediate graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) responses via both perforin (usually co-expressed in cytotoxic granules with DPPI) and Fas ligand pathways in a murine model, we hypothesized that LLME might be useful for treatment of delayed DLIs for potential GVL activity with a decreased risk of GVHD induction. In regard to the clinical setting, the ex vivo use of LLME for this purpose would circumvent any toxicity issues for donor stem cells, because by that time patients would have already achieved successful engraftment. For our preclinical studies, we used the haploidentical C57BL/6 (B6) (H2b) --> ((B6 x DBA/2)F1 (H(2b/d)) murine model with lethally irradiated hosts that had received transplants of T-cell-depleted bone marrow cells and were challenged with the MMD2-8 myeloid leukemia line (H2d) of DBA/2 origin. A DLI of LLME-treated donor splenocytes, from B6 mice presensitized to recipient alloantigens, was administered in varying doses 14 days post-marrow transplantation, and the potential for both GVHD and GVL activity was assessed. All mice that received any dose of LLME-treated DLI survived indefinitely, without evidence of cachexia nor B-cell hypoplasia, in contrast to the severe and lethal GVHD induced by mock-treated DLI. Histological analysis largely correlated with the symptomatic findings and revealed no GVHD-like lesions in the spleens of LLME-treated DLI recipients, although some mice displayed various degrees of hepatic mononuclear infiltration. Most notably, mice given LLME-treated DLI also experienced DLI dose-dependent increases in survival against the challenge with the MMD2-8 leukemia. LLME-treated splenocytes remained immunocompetent, as these cells could proliferate in response to mitogens and to restimulation with ovalbumin when used as a recall antigen. In conclusion, LLME-treated DLI possesses immune potential and, in particular, GVL activity without inducing clinically evident GVHD.","['Hsieh, Michael H', 'Varadi, Gabor', 'Flomenberg, Neal', 'Korngold, Robert']","['Hsieh MH', 'Varadi G', 'Flomenberg N', 'Korngold R']","['Kimmel Cancer Institute, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '13022-42-9 (leucyl-leucine-methyl ester)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/methods', 'Dipeptides/*pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Graft vs Host Disease/pathology/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects', 'Haplotypes', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*methods', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Risk', 'Transplantation Immunology/*drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/07/11 10:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2002/07/11 10:00'],"['2002/07/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['S1083879102500288 [pii]'],ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2002;8(6):303-15.,"['CA-09683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-77401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-55593/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The closed-form solutions for retroviral concentrations and time course profile of transduced cell colonies are presented to clarify the contributions of the processes involved in the retroviral transduction system. To manifest the usefulness of the closed-form solutions, the neomycin-resistant gene encoding retroviruses produced by two different packaging cells (human 293 cells and murine GP+ E86/LNCX cells) were employed to transduce NIH 3T3 cells, which formed neomycin-resistant colonies after G418 selection.

Our study showed that the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein pseudotyped retrovirus produced from 293 packaging cells exhibited much higher transduction rate (k = 0.0480 cm/h) than the ecotropic retrovirus (k = 0.0102 cm/h) produced from GP + E86/LNCX cells.

In this study, we investigated the cellular uptake of clozapine into human promyelocytic leukaemia HL-60 cells using HPLC with electrochemical detection. On incubation with 1.25 to 40 microM clozapine for 30 min, a saturable, energy- and temperature-dependent uptake process takes place (K m = 18.8 microM, k cat = 1.36 nmol/5 min/mg protein at 37 degrees C). This suggests membrane passage of clozapine by a carrier mechanism. 10 microM Indatraline, an inhibitor of dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin (5-HT) reuptake, but not the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine, markedly reduced the transport of clozapine by 62 %, whereas addition of 10 mM glucose to the incubation medium increased intracellular clozapine concentrations by 28 %. Since cyclosporine A, vinblastine or verapamil up to a final concentration of 10 microM did not alter the intracellular accumulation of clozapine, an involvement of P-glycoprotein seems to be unlikely.

In this study, the potential of LDE as a carrier for anticancer drugs was investigated. METHODS: LDE was associated with carmustine, and the cytotoxicity of the LDE-carmustine complex was studied in a neoplastic cell line and its biodistribution was studied in mice. The plasma kinetics of the complex and its uptake by tumor and normal tissue were determined in cancer patients. Finally, an exploratory clinical study to determine the toxicity profile of LDE-carmustine at escalating dose levels was conducted in 42 advanced cancer patients refractory to conventional chemotherapy. RESULTS: Carmustine formed a stable association with LDE. The pharmacological action of carmustine, as tested in cancer cells, was not diminished by association with LDE compared with the free drug and was indeed mediated by the LDL receptor. The biodistribution in mice and plasma kinetics in patients of the emulsion were not changed by association of the drug.

This preclinical study was undertaken to investigate its potential for inclusion in combination chemotherapy regimens. The in vitro cytotoxicity of F 11782 incubated simultaneously with the following drugs was investigated: aclarubicin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide, 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C, paclitaxel, topotecan or vinorelbine. METHODS: The combinations were first evaluated in vitro against the GCT27 human testicular teratoma cell line and then against the A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cell line using median effect analysis. RESULTS: F 11782 in combination with cisplatin, mitomycin C, etoposide or doxorubicin showed synergistic cytotoxicity against both cell lines. Moreover, F 11782 combined with cisplatin or mitomycin C showed antitumour activity in vivo against P388 murine leukaemia grafted intravenously. Such synergy might have resulted from the identified nucleotide excision repair inhibitory activity of F 11782. CONCLUSIONS: F 11782 appears to be a promising candidate for combination chemotherapy, especially with DNA-damaging agents.","['Barret, Jean-Marc', 'Kruczynski, Anna', 'Etievant, Chantal', 'Hill, Bridget T']","['Barret JM', 'Kruczynski A', 'Etievant C', 'Hill BT']","['Division de Cancerologie, Centre de Recherche Pierre Fabre, 17 avenue Jean Moulin, 81100 Castres, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Pyrans)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'QN043X3ZDW (tafluposide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Naphthalenes/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Pyrans/*pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/enzymology']",2002/07/11 10:00,2002/08/15 10:01,['2002/07/11 10:00'],"['2001/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-002-0451-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2002 Jun;49(6):479-86. doi: 10.1007/s00280-002-0451-5.

METHODS: A cohort based on the engineering industry was established. Industries assumed to use resistance welding in production were chosen in order to increase the prevalence of high exposed subjects and to reduce the influence of confounding factors. All men and women employed in these branches during 1985-94 were selected, 537 692 men and 180 529 women. Occupation, based on census information from 1980, 1985, and 1990, was linked to a job exposure matrix on ELF-MF. Four exposure groups were used by stratifying on mean workday ELF-MF exposure, using the lowest exposure group as reference. Cancer incidence was obtained by linkage to the Swedish Cancer Registry. RESULTS: Men in the very high exposure group showed an increased incidence of tumours of the kidney, pituitary gland, and biliary passages and liver; for these cancer sites an exposure-response relation was indicated. Women in the very high exposure group showed an increased incidence of astrocytoma I-IV, with a clear exposure-response pattern. An association was suggested in the high exposure group only, for cancer of the corpus uteri and multiple myeloma. Decreased risks in the very high exposure group among men were found for cancer of the colon and connective tissue/muscle. CONCLUSIONS: The results on cancer of the liver, kidney, and pituitary gland among men are in accordance with previous observations. Regarding brain tumours and leukaemia, the outcome for women provided further support of an association. The hypothesis of a biological mechanism involving the endocrine system was partly supported.","['Hakansson, N', 'Floderus, B', 'Gustavsson, P', 'Johansen, C', 'Olsen, J H']","['Hakansson N', 'Floderus B', 'Gustavsson P', 'Johansen C', 'Olsen JH']","['Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. niclas.hakansson@imm.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Nervous System Diseases/epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sex Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology', '*Welding']",2002/07/11 10:00,2002/08/28 10:01,['2002/07/11 10:00'],"['2002/07/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.59.7.481 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2002 Jul;59(7):481-6. doi: 10.1136/oem.59.7.481.,,,,,PMC1740327,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Members of the Bcl-2 family of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins have been implicated in this process in rodents. We investigated the expression of Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bax, and BAD at 13-21 gestational wk in the human fetal ovary and of Mcl-1 in the adult ovary. mRNA expression of Mcl-1 and its short form Mcl-1s, Bcl-2, Bax, and BAD was demonstrated in fetal ovary by RT-PCR. Hybridization array analysis suggested a selective increase in Mcl-1 expression between 14 and 18 wk gestation, which was confirmed by quantitative PCR. There was a corresponding change in the expression of Mcl-1 protein, detected by immunohistochemistry, from germ cells at the periphery of the ovary at 14-16 wk to the largest germ cells, including oocytes within newly formed primordial follicles, at 21 wk. Mcl-1 was also expressed by oocytes of primordial and preantral follicles in the adult. Bax and BAD immunostaining was detected in both somatic and germ cells in the fetal ovary, whereas Bcl-2 was restricted to somatic cells: no changes in expression were observed. Apoptotic cells, detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, were observed in all fetal ovaries but were infrequent. These results confirm that Bcl-2 family members are differentially expressed in several cell types within the developing human ovary. Increased mRNA expression and the changing distribution of Mcl-1 in germ cells as they develop into primordial follicles as well as persistence in the growing oocyte in the adult may indicate an important role for this survival/antiapoptotic factor throughout germ cell development and maturation.","['Hartley, P S', 'Bayne, R A L', 'Robinson, L L L', 'Fulton, N', 'Anderson, R A']","['Hartley PS', 'Bayne RA', 'Robinson LL', 'Fulton N', 'Anderson RA']","['Medical Research Council Human Reproductive Sciences Unit, Centre for Reproductive Biology, 37 Chalmers Street, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK EH3 9ET.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Female', 'Fetus/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oocytes/*physiology', 'Ovarian Follicle/*embryology', 'Ovary/embryology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Distribution', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein']",2002/07/11 10:00,2002/08/03 10:01,['2002/07/11 10:00'],"['2002/07/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.87.7.8644 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2002 Jul;87(7):3417-27. doi: 10.1210/jcem.87.7.8644.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impact of GH therapy on disease recurrence has been studied in survivors of pediatric brain tumors, but few data are available on the risk of disease recurrence in survivors of other tumor types who are treated with GH. Likewise, the risk of second neoplasms (SN) associated with GH use has not been systematically evaluated. We studied 361 GH-treated cancer survivors (including 172 brain tumor survivors) from among 13,539 survivors enrolled in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a cohort of 5-yr survivors of childhood cancer. Using a time-dependent Cox model, we compared risk of recurrence, risk of SN, and risk of death between survivors who did and did not receive treatment with GH. The relative risk of disease recurrence was 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.37-1.86; P = 0.65) for GH-treated survivors. The relative risk of recurrence was not increased for any of the major cancer diagnoses. GH-treated subjects were diagnosed with 15 SN, all solid tumors and no secondary leukemias, for an overall relative risk of 3.21 (95% confidence interval, 1.88-5.46; P < 0.0001). This was mainly due to a small excess number of SN observed in GH-treated survivors of acute leukemia. The risk of death was not associated with GH use (P = 0.43). We conclude that GH therapy does not appear to increase the risk of disease recurrence or death in survivors of childhood cancer. The increased number of SN, particularly in survivors of acute leukemia, is of concern, but the data need to be interpreted with caution given the small number of events.","['Sklar, Charles A', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Mitby, Pauline', 'Occhiogrosso, Glenn', 'Qin, Jing', 'Heller, Glenn', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Robison, Leslie L']","['Sklar CA', 'Mertens AC', 'Mitby P', 'Occhiogrosso G', 'Qin J', 'Heller G', 'Yasui Y', 'Robison LL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA. sklarc@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth Hormone/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', '*Survivors']",2002/07/11 10:00,2002/08/03 10:01,['2002/07/11 10:00'],"['2002/07/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.87.7.8606 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2002 Jul;87(7):3136-41. doi: 10.1210/jcem.87.7.8606.,['U24 CA 55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellular zinc levels in the ZD cells were 64% of ZN controls; levels in the ZA cells were not different, but levels in ZS cells were significantly higher (40%) than in ZN cells. No difference in p53 mRNA abundance was detected among all treatments; however, p53 nuclear protein levels were >100% higher in the ZD and ZS cells and almost 200% higher in the ZA cells than in ZN controls. In addition, p21 mRNA abundance, a downstream target of p53 protein, was increased in the ZS cells compared with both the ZN control and ZD cells. In the ZS cells, bax and mcl-1 were also approximately 50% higher compared with ZN controls, whereas bcl-2 mRNA was increased compared with ZA cells. Moreover, caspase-3 activity of ZD cells was not different from that of ZN controls but was reduced to 83 and 69% of ZN controls in ZA and ZS cells, respectively.

From January 1995 to December 1999, 67 ALL patients (34 in the PBPCT group and 33 in the BMT group) were included in this study. Median age for both groups was 8 years (range, 1-18). There were 24 patients in first or second CR in the PBPCT group and 28 such patients in the BMT group. Preparatory regimens were TBI-based in 26/34 in the PBPC group and 25/33 in the BMT group. GVHD prophylaxis was CsA alone in 38 patients (18 PBPCT vs 20 BMT) and CsA plus short Mtx in 29 (16 PBPCT vs 13 BMT). Engraftment was achieved in all cases.

In U937-zeta J and U937-zeta B cells, enforced PKC zeta expression, conferred by stable transfection of PKC zeta cDNA, resulted in total inhibition of VP-16- and mitoxantrone-induced apoptosis and decreased drug-induced cytotoxicity, compared with U937-neo control cells. In PKC zeta-overexpressing cells, drug resistance correlated with decreased VP-16-induced DNA strand breaks and DNA protein cross-links measured by alkaline elution. Kinetoplast decatenation assay revealed that PKC zeta overexpression resulted in reduced global topoisomerase II activity. Moreover, in PKC zeta-overexpressing cells, we found that PKC zeta interacted with both alpha and beta isoforms of topoisomerase II, and these two enzymes were constitutively phosphorylated. However, when human recombinant PKC zeta (rH-PKC zeta) was incubated with purified topoisomerase II isoforms, rH-PKC zeta interacted with topoisomerase II beta but not with topoisomerase II alpha. PKC zeta/topoisomerase II beta interaction resulted in phosphorylation of this enzyme and in decrease of its catalytic activity. Finally, this report shows for the first time that topoisomerase II beta is a substrate for PKC zeta, and that PKC zeta may significantly influence topoisomerase II inhibitor-induced cytotoxicity by altering topoisomerase II beta activity through its kinase function.","['Plo, Isabelle', 'Hernandez, Helene', 'Kohlhagen, Glenda', 'Lautier, Dominique', 'Pommier, Yves', 'Laurent, Guy']","['Plo I', 'Hernandez H', 'Kohlhagen G', 'Lautier D', 'Pommier Y', 'Laurent G']","['INSERM E9910, Institut Claudius Regaud, 20 rue du Pont Saint Pierre, 31052 Toulouse cedex, France. plo@icr.fnclcc.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (protein kinase C zeta)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Etoposide/toxicity', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitoxantrone/toxicity', 'Neoplasm Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'U937 Cells']",2002/07/10 10:00,2002/10/18 04:00,['2002/07/10 10:00'],"['2002/07/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M204654200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)69987-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Aug 30;277(35):31407-15. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M204654200.

To elucidate the role of angiotensin II (Ang II) at a cellular level, we analyzed the Ang II-induced gene expression profile. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genes induced on Ang II stimulation (10(-7) mol/L, 45 minutes) in rat smooth muscle cells were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction selected subtraction. In addition to known genes, such as interleukin 6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and c-fos, we identified CYR61, an angiogenic immediate early gene. Northern blot analysis revealed a rapid 2.5-fold increase of CYR61 transcript levels by Ang II, peaking at 30 minutes, which was blunted by Ang II type 1 receptor blockade. Exposure of rat aortic rings to Ang II (30 minutes) revealed a 2-fold, and intraperitoneal injection of Ang II (30 minutes) in mice a 3-fold, increase of aortic CYR61 transcripts. In arteriosclerotic aortas of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, CYR61 transcripts confirmed by in situ hybridization and proteins shown by immunohistochemistry were elevated, whereas they were hardly detectable in wild types. In human carotid atherectomies and arteriosclerotic coronary arteries, immunohistochemical analysis revealed expression of CYR61 within connective tissue in neointima, adventitia, and surrounding small capillaries and blood vessels, colocalized with ACE and Ang II. Normal human arteries showed no significant staining for CYR61. CONCLUSIONS: CYR61, an angiogenic factor, is induced by Ang II in vascular cells and tissue. The expression of CYR61, colocalized with Ang II and ACE, in small vessels of human arteriosclerotic lesions is consistent with the notion that the activated renin-angiotensin system may contribute to plaque neovascularization by enhancing regulators of microvessel formation and cell proliferation.","['Hilfiker, Andres', 'Hilfiker-Kleiner, Denise', 'Fuchs, Martin', 'Kaminski, Karol', 'Lichtenberg, Artur', 'Rothkotter, Hermann-Josef', 'Schieffer, Bernhard', 'Drexler, Helmut']","['Hilfiker A', 'Hilfiker-Kleiner D', 'Fuchs M', 'Kaminski K', 'Lichtenberg A', 'Rothkotter HJ', 'Schieffer B', 'Drexler H']","['Department of Cardiology and Angiology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Circulation,Circulation,0147763,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inducing Agents)', '0 (Apolipoproteins E)', '0 (CCN1 protein, human)', '0 (CCN1 protein, mouse)', '0 (CCN1 protein, rat)', '0 (Cysteine-Rich Protein 61)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1)', '0 (Receptors, Angiotensin)', '11128-99-7 (Angiotensin II)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inducing Agents/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Angiotensin II/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Aorta/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Apolipoproteins E/genetics', 'Arteriosclerosis/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Blood Vessels/chemistry', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cysteine-Rich Protein 61', 'Growth Substances/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1', 'Receptors, Angiotensin/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', '*Up-Regulation']",2002/07/10 10:00,2002/07/20 10:01,['2002/07/10 10:00'],"['2002/07/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.cir.0000021426.87274.62 [doi]'],ppublish,Circulation. 2002 Jul 9;106(2):254-60. doi: 10.1161/01.cir.0000021426.87274.62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The highest level of inhibition was achieved in our long-term assay with MOLT-3 cells acutely infected with HIV-1 (IIIB) and treated with free phosphorothioate-modified ODNs (PS-ODNs). The highest level of specificity was observed in our short-term assay with MOLT-3 cells acutely infected with HIV-1 (IIIB) and treated with free PS-ODNs. The highest potency (IC50 level) was observed in our short-term chronic-infection model with (DLS)-delivered ODNs in which the DLS delivery improved the ODN activity up to 106 times compared to the activity of free ODNs. Thus, the near blocking of HIV replication obtained when using PS-ODNs appears because of the addition of extracellular and/or membrane effects. The higher efficacy of PS-ODNs compared to unmodified ODNs, when both are delivered with the DLS system, was demonstrated solely in our short-term assay with MOLT-3 cells. Important variations in the level of sequence specificity were observed and depended on the type of control used and the type of cell assay employed. It seems that all 3 groups of control-tested, random, sense sequence, and non-antisense T30177 ODNs might have distinct activity and, consequently, different modes of action in inhibiting HIV replication. Our data buttress the notion that the contribution of the sequence-specific mediated mode of action is minor compared to the other mechanisms involved in ODN antiviral activity.","['Lavigne, Carole', 'Yelle, Jocelyn', 'Sauve, Gilles', 'Thierry, Alain R']","['Lavigne C', 'Yelle J', 'Sauve G', 'Thierry AR']","['Departement de Microbiologie et Immunologie, Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3C 3J7.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AAPS PharmSci,AAPS pharmSci,100897065,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)']",IM,"['Anti-HIV Agents/administration & dosage/*chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'HIV Infections/metabolism', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Oligonucleotides/administration & dosage/*chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/administration & dosage/*chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/virology', '*Terminology as Topic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",2002/07/10 10:00,2002/08/14 10:01,['2002/07/10 10:00'],"['2002/07/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1208/ps040209 [doi]'],ppublish,AAPS PharmSci. 2002;4(2):E9. doi: 10.1208/ps040209.,,,,,PMC2751296,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A negative prognostic implication of increased angiogenesis has been established for acute and chronic myeloid and lymphocytic leukemias, myeloproliferative diseases, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and hairy cell leukemia. An association between the return of increased marrow vascularity to normal levels and durability of response has been established in some of these diseases. Elevated levels ofproangiogenic factors have been associated with a poor prognosis in the acute and chronic leukemias, multiple myeloma, and NHL. These data lend support to the reduction of activity of proangiogenic factors as a therapeutic modality. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated as the major proangiogenic factor that regulates multiple endothelial cell functions, including mitogenesis. A direct relationship between VEGF and leukemic blasts and malignant plasma cells has been established, but VEGF may have a function distinct from its role in angiogenesis. Current protocols with anti- VEGF agents in patients with hematologic malignancies involve the use of monoclonal antibody, blockers of the VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase pathway, thalidomide (Thalomid) and its analogs, and cyclooxygenase inhibitors. The receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors also affect platelet-derived growthfactor, c-kit, and Flt-3 to varying degrees, considerably broadening their potential efficacy. This review will summarize several angiogenesis inhibitors in clinical development.","['Giles, Francis J']",['Giles FJ'],"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, M. D.

STUDY DESIGN: Fifty-five cases of acute leukemia were enrolled in this study. A complete hemogram and routine bone marrow examination, including cytochemistry, was done. Mycloperoxidase-negative cases were evaluated on a flow cytometer using monoclonal antibodies. DNA indices were determined by flow cytometry in all cases, and p53 was detected immunohistochemically using the alkaline phosphatase/antialkaline phosphatase technique. RESULTS: Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) was diagnosed in 32 cases; acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was diagnosed in 18 (14 B lineage and 4 T line age). Four cases showed mixed lineage leukemia, and undifferentiated acute leukemia was diagnosed in one case. The mean/range of SPF for these groups were 3.76/0.33-6.91, 6.25/0.15-21.4, 2.89/0.35-10.64, 2.60/0.72-6.94 and 7.34, respectively. Aneuploidy was detected in two cases of B-lineage ALL and tetraploidy in a case of AML-M7, while all others were diploid p53. Was detected in 6 of 55 cases (10.90%). Follow-up was available for 24 patients. Five patients relapsed, and four had B-cell type ALL and were diploid and expressed no p53 gene. SPF% did not show any correlation with outcome. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that within acute leukemia subtypes, there is a wide variation in SPF. SPF does not seem to correlate with outcome. Immunophenotyping is essential to determine the lineage in myeloperoxidase-negative cases. It is perhaps the only way to diagnose mixed lineage leukemia and aberrant expression of markers presently. The p53 gene was detected less frequently. However, more studies are required from different centers with longer follow-up to evaluate prognostic significance.","['Powari, Manish', 'Varma, Neelam', 'Varma, Subhash', 'Marwaha, Ram Kumar', 'Sandhu, Harpreet', 'Ganguly, Nirmal Kumar']","['Powari M', 'Varma N', 'Varma S', 'Marwaha RK', 'Sandhu H', 'Ganguly NK']","['Department of Haematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Anal Quant Cytol Histol,Analytical and quantitative cytology and histology,8506819,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/classification', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*diagnosis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",2002/07/10 10:00,2003/01/08 04:00,['2002/07/10 10:00'],"['2002/07/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/08 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/10 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anal Quant Cytol Histol. 2002 Jun;24(3):159-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A possible causal role for formaldehyde is likely for cancer of the buccal cavity and nasopharynx. Exfoliated buccal cells are good source of tissue for monitoring human exposure to inhaled and ingested occupational and environmental genotoxicants. To assess the cytogenetic damage related to occupational exposure to airborne chemicals during shoe-making and the processes in pathology and anatomy laboratories, the micronuclei (MN) count per 3000 cells was measured in buccal smears from shoe-workers (group I, n = 22) exposed to mainly n-hexane, toluene and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and from anatomy and pathology staff (group II, n = 28) exposed to formaldehyde (FA). Eighteen male university staff were used as controls. The mean time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations of n-hexane, toluene and MEK in 10 small shoe workshops were 58.07 p.p.m., 26.62 p.p.m. and 11.39 p.p.m., respectively. The measured air concentrations of FA in the breathing zone of the anatomy and pathology laboratory workers were between 2 and 4 p.p.m. Levels of 2,5-hexadione (2,5-HD) and hippuric acid (HA), metabolic markers of n-hexane and toluene exposure, respectively, were significantly higher in the urine of workers in group I than in control subjects (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively).

The effects of smoking, age and duration of exposure on the frequency of micronucleated buccal cells from workers in all three groups studied were also evaluated.

Two versions of the virus were made in which EGFP expression was driven either by the Rous sarcoma virus U3 enhancer or by a combination of sequences from the Syn1 and Pgk-1 promoters. Both of these viruses efficiently transduced neural stem cells isolated from embryonic rat hippocampus, and robust EGFP expression was observed in neurons derived from these cells following differentiation in vitro.","['Owens, G C', 'Mistry, S', 'Edelman, G M', 'Crossin, K L']","['Owens GC', 'Mistry S', 'Edelman GM', 'Crossin KL']","['The Neurosciences Institute, San Diego, CA 92121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gammaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Engineering', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hippocampus/*embryology', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Nervous System Diseases/therapy', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism/*virology', 'Rats', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Transfection']",2002/07/09 10:00,2002/08/28 10:01,['2002/07/09 10:00'],"['2001/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3301780 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 2002 Aug;9(15):1044-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301780.,['HD09635/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gelatin matrix without cells or with untransduced stromal cells were the two control groups. The defect area was completely filled with new bone in experimental rats after 4 weeks, while limited bone formation occurred in either control group. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the defect in the gene therapy group was 67.8 +/- 5.7 mg/cm(2) (mean +/- s.d., n = 4), which was 119 +/- 10% of the control BMD of bone surrounding the defect (57.2 +/- 1.5 mg/cm(2)). In contrast, BMD of rats implanted with untransduced stromal cells was five-fold lower (13.8 +/- 7.4 mg/cm(2), P < 0.001). Time course studies revealed that there was a linear increase in BMD between 2-4 weeks after inoculation of the critical size defect with 2.5 x 10(6) implanted BMP4 cells.

Previous studies have shown that covalent binding and crosslinking of DNA is associated with the cytotoxic and antitumor activities of this compound. In this study, cell cycle perturbations, effects on DNA synthesis and the cell death process initiated by Nitracrine were studied in murine leukemia L1210 cells. We show that exposure of L1210 cells to Nitracrine at the IC(99) concentration delayed progression through the S phase and transiently arrested cells in G(2)/M as found by flow cytometry. Higher drug concentration (2 x IC(99)) inhibited cell cycle progression in the S phase and induced rapid cell death. Both studied concentrations of the drug produced different effects on DNA synthesis as determined by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, with a delay in the S phase progression at EC(99) concentration and irreversible arrest in early S phase at the higher dose (2 x IC(99)). At both concentrations of Nitracrine cell death occurred preferentially in the S phase as revealed by the TUNEL assay. When cells treated with the drug for 4 hours were post-incubated in the presence of 1 mM caffeine this led to rapid cell death and suppression of the G(2) arrest. This was associated with a about 10-fold increase in the cytotoxicity of Nitracrine. Similar effects were observed for another DNA crosslinking agent, cis-platinum, and to a lesser extent, for DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin.

We observed that hCAP-18 was targeted for storage in lysosome-related organelles when expressed constitutively in the rat basophilic leukemia and the mouse promyelocytic (MPRO) cell lines.

Without cationic lipids, no antisense-mediated inhibition of bcl-2 synthesis was achieved with G3139 and NOV 2009. Instead, G3139, but not NOV 2009, induced similar changes as ODN 2006 in proliferation, expression of costimulatory and antigen-presenting molecules, as well as in bcl-2 and bcl-xL levels of primary B-CLL cells. G3139 and ODN 2006 inhibited in vitro, spontaneous apoptosis in B-CLL cells of patients with high serum thymidine kinase activity (s-TK, marker for proliferative activity of malignant B cells), whereas in patients with low s-TK activity, apoptosis was induced. In conclusion, our results suggest that modulation of malignant B cell apoptosis by G3139 depends on its immunostimulatory properties rather than on antisense-mediated reduction of bcl-2 expression.

Despite the fact that they promote the survival and proliferation of normal lymphocytes, the underlying mechanisms by which various Rel/NF-kappaB proteins with different transcriptional regulatory capacities might facilitate transformation remain to be established. Here we show that the proliferation and tumorigenicity of Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV)-transformed pre-B cells are enhanced in the absence of NF-kappaB1 and that this coincides with elevated levels of cyclin D1. Support for a link between cyclin D1 expression and v-Abl transformation came from the finding that proliferation of transformed pre-B cells was reduced in the absence of cyclin D1, while enforced cyclin D1 expression increased the proliferation and tumorigenicity of wild-type transformants. A reduction in endogenous cyclin D1 levels that coincided with NF-kappaB1 transgene reversal of enhanced nfkb1(-/-) pre-B-cell transformation, coupled with NF-kappaB1 inhibition of v-Abl-induced kappaB-dependent murine cyclin D1 transcription, lends support to a model in which v-Abl-induced cyclin D1 transcription in transformed pre-B cells is controlled by Rel/NF-kappaB dimers with different activities.","['Nakamura, Yukio', 'Grumont, Raelene J', 'Gerondakis, Steve']","['Nakamura Y', 'Grumont RJ', 'Gerondakis S']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria 3050, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/pathogenicity', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology/virology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cyclin D1/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'G1 Phase', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, abl/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NF-kappa B/deficiency/*physiology', 'Protein Subunits', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Survival Rate', 'Thymoma/etiology/pathology']",2002/07/09 10:00,2002/08/06 10:01,['2002/07/09 10:00'],"['2002/07/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.22.15.5563-5574.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2002 Aug;22(15):5563-74. doi: 10.1128/MCB.22.15.5563-5574.2002.,,,,,PMC133951,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is seen in approximately 12 to 15% of AML cases and is present in about 40% of AML cases with a French-American-British classified M2 phenotype. We have generated a murine model of the t(8;21) translocation by retroviral expression of AML1-ETO in purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Animals reconstituted with AML1-ETO-expressing cells recapitulate the hematopoietic developmental abnormalities seen in the bone marrow of human patients with the t(8;21) translocation. Primitive myeloblasts were increased to approximately 10% of bone marrow by 10 months posttransplant. Consistent with this observation was a 50-fold increase in myeloid colony-forming cells in vitro. Accumulation of late-stage metamyelocytes was also observed in bone marrow along with an increase in immature eosinophilic myelocytes that showed abnormal basophilic granulation. HSC numbers in the bone marrow of 10-month-posttransplant animals were 29-fold greater than in transplant-matched control mice, suggesting that AML1-ETO expression overrides the normal genetic control of HSC pool size. In summary, AMLI-ETO-expressing animals recapitulate many (and perhaps all) of the developmental abnormalities seen in human patients with the t(8;21) translocation, although the animals do not develop leukemia or disseminated disease in peripheral tissues like the liver or spleen. This suggests that the principal contribution of AML1-ETO to acute myeloid leukemia is the inhibition of multiple developmental pathways.","['de Guzman, Cristina G', 'Warren, Alan J', 'Zhang, Zheng', 'Gartland, Larry', 'Erickson, Paul', 'Drabkin, Harry', 'Hiebert, Scott W', 'Klug, Christopher A']","['de Guzman CG', 'Warren AJ', 'Zhang Z', 'Gartland L', 'Erickson P', 'Drabkin H', 'Hiebert SW', 'Klug CA']","['Department of Human Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1824 6th Avenue South, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chronic Disease', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukopoiesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Cells/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2002/07/09 10:00,2002/08/06 10:01,['2002/07/09 10:00'],"['2002/07/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.22.15.5506-5517.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2002 Aug;22(15):5506-17. doi: 10.1128/MCB.22.15.5506-5517.2002.,"['T32 CA009467/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32 CA 09467/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC133929,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we review recent developments in understanding endogenous mammalian gene regulation via the use of designed transcription factors (TFs). These include mutated forms of naturally occurring TFs that exhibit dominant-negative activity, and designed proteins with novel, predetermined DNA-binding specificities. Systematic targeting of designed TFs to particular promoters is helping to illuminate the complex rules that chromatin imposes on TF access and action in vivo. We evaluate the potential applications of these proteins as probes of mammalian chromatin-based regulatory pathways and their potential for the therapy of human disease, highlighting leukemia in particular.","['Urnov, Fyodor D', 'Rebar, Edward J', 'Reik, Andreas', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Urnov FD', 'Rebar EJ', 'Reik A', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Sangamo Biosciences, Pt.

Adverse effects include neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, and infectious complications. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of 2-CdA (2-6 seven-day cycles) in the treatment of late-stage, recalcitrant Sezary syndrome. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of six patients with Sezary syndrome who had received 2-CdA cycles at Mayo Clinic, Rochester between March 1995 and March 2000. Variables assessed from the records included improvement in global appearance, extent of erythroderma, size of lymph nodes, pruritus, and leukocyte, lymphocyte, and absolute Sezary cell counts. RESULTS: Two patients, both with stage III Sezary syndrome, whose previous treatment consisted of only two modalities, responded well to the treatment, with moderate to total clearing of erythroderma and pruritus associated with a significant decrease in Sezary cell counts. The other four patients had only a partial response (one patient) or no response (three patients) to 2-CdA. The mortality rate was 50%. All three patients died of Staphylococcus aureus sepsis. However, only one patient was receiving 2-CdA treatment when he died. The other two patients died 8 and 9 weeks after the last 2-CdA cycle. This high mortality rate is attributed to infectious complications after 2-CdA treatment in patients with recalcitrant disease. CONCLUSION: 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine shows efficacy in stage III Sezary syndrome, but it also carries a substantial risk of septic complications and mortality. It can be used if no other suitable alternatives are available. Caution should be exercised in all these patients regarding skin care and avoidance of infections or sepsis.","['Bouwhuis, Saskia A', 'el-Azhary, Rokea A', 'McEvoy, Marian T', 'Gibson, Lawrence E', 'Habermann, Thomas M', 'Witzig, Thomas E', 'Pittelkow, Mark R']","['Bouwhuis SA', 'el-Azhary RA', 'McEvoy MT', 'Gibson LE', 'Habermann TM', 'Witzig TE', 'Pittelkow MR']","['Department of Dermatology and the Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sezary Syndrome/*drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Survival Rate']",2002/07/09 10:00,2002/09/21 10:01,['2002/07/09 10:00'],"['2002/07/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['1501 [pii]'],ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 2002 Jun;41(6):352-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of their malignant lymphomas (ML) show a peculiar histology suggestive of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). To determine whether ML resembling ATLL are indeed ATLL, re-analysis of 34 cases occurring in Jujuy, a province of Argentina, was conducted, concentrating on immunological phenotype, integration of HTLV-1 proviral DNA, expression of HTLV-1 p40Tax and p27Rex, and infection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The ML were 22 cases of mature peripheral T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell neoplasm (mT/NKN), 11 B-cell malignant neoplasms and one Hodgkin's lymphoma. Polymerase chain reaction against the HTLV-1 proviral DNA, using DNA extracted from paraffin sections, indicated integration of the HTLV-1 proviral DNA in three cases of eight mT/NKN. Two other cases of mT/NKN were positive for anti-HTLV-1 antibodies. Expression of p40Tax and p27Rex was detected in all five of these mT/NKN cases associated with HTLV-1. As such, these five mT/NKN were rediagnosed as ATLL. In situ hybridization signals for EBV-encoded small nuclear early region-1 were detected in nine cases of mT/NKN, of which five cases of NK-cell lymphoma were found to have cytoplasmic CD3 expression, a CD56 phenotype and positivity of TIA1. According to the new World Health Organization classification, the mT/NKN class includes five cases of ATLL and five cases of NK-cell lymphomas.

Nine patients developed a leukaemia after MOPP and four after ABVD; 11 patients were diagnosed as acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL) and two as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Both cases of ALL were observed after ABVD and were associated with a 11q23 translocation. The 15-year actuarial risk of secondary leukaemia was 2.4% for the whole group of patients, 3.4% after MOPP and 1.3% after ABVD. For the MOPP subgroup, the risk of leukaemia was significantly associated with the extent of irradiation: 2.4% for limited irradiation and 13.9% for extended irradiation (P < 0.001). For the ABVD subgroup, this risk remained low (1.3%) whatever the type of irradiation. Concerning ANLL, the MOPP regimen was significantly associated with a higher risk: 3.4% versus 0.7% for ABVD (P<or=0.05). The 15-year risk of ALL was 0.6 after ABVD regimen. This study demonstrated that ABVD induced less ANLL than MOPP. However, a low risk of ALL with a 11q23 translocation related to topoisomerase II inhibitors was observed.","['Delwail, Vincent', 'Jais, Jean-Philippe', 'Colonna, Pierre', 'Andrieu, Jean-Marie']","['Delwail V', 'Jais JP', 'Colonna P', 'Andrieu JM']","['Department of Hematology, Hopital J.Bernard, Poitiers, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ABVD protocol', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2002/07/09 10:00,2002/09/12 10:01,['2002/07/09 10:00'],"['2002/07/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['3564 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03564.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Jul;118(1):189-94. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03564.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The distinction between AA and h-MDS is important because there is a higher risk of progression to acute leukaemia in patients with h-MDS compared with AA. Recent studies suggest that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays an important role in the development of AA. In order to determine the potential importance of TNF-alpha in the differential diagnosis of hypoplastic bone marrow (BM) disorders, we examined whether analysis ofTNF-receptor expression could be used as a tool to differentiate AA from h-MDS. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that BM stem cells (CD34+) from AA patients have markedly greater TNF receptor (R) 1 and TNFR2 expression than those from patients with MDS and h-MDS. We suggest that the BM stem cells with a high expression of TNFR in patients with AA may be potently sensitive to TNF-alpha stimulation of differentiation. Thus, we propose that quantification of TNFR expression in BM stem cellsmay be a useful method to distinguish AA from h-MDS.","['Kasahara, Senji', 'Hara, Takeshi', 'Itoh, Hiroyasu', 'Ando, Kazuki', 'Tsurumi, Hisashi', 'Sawada, Michio', 'Yamada, Toshiki', 'Ohnishi, Hiroo', 'Moriwaki, Hisataka']","['Kasahara S', 'Hara T', 'Itoh H', 'Ando K', 'Tsurumi H', 'Sawada M', 'Yamada T', 'Ohnishi H', 'Moriwaki H']","['First Department ofInternal Medicine, Gifu University School of Medicine, Gifu, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*diagnosis/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', '*Antigens, CD34', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*analysis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II', 'Stem Cells/immunology/*metabolism']",2002/07/09 10:00,2002/09/12 10:01,['2002/07/09 10:00'],"['2002/07/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['3592 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03592.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Jul;118(1):181-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03592.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As VEGF exerts its effects via two receptors, VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) and VEGFR-2, we evaluated the significance of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 protein levels in AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and their relationship to VEGF protein levels. Western blot analysis and radioimmunoassay confirmed and quantified specific protein levels in bone marrow samples from 41 MDS and 66 AML previously untreated patients. VEGFR-1 levels were significantly higher in AML than in MDS (P = 0.0004), but no significant difference was found in the VEGFR-2 levels (P = 0.5). No significant correlation between VEGFRs levels and duration of survival was found. VEGF protein levels were significantly higher in MDS than in AML (P < 0.0001). A Cox proportional-hazard regression model showed increasing VEGF levels to significantly correlate with shorter survival of patients with MDS (P = 0.008), a finding similar to our previous report of the inverse relationship between VEGF levels and survival of AML patients. We found a significant correlation between VEGF and VEGFR-2 levels in both AML and MDS (P < 0.0000001 andP < 0.0002 respectively) but not between VEGF and VEGFR-1 levels. These data suggest that VEGF expression, rather than the expression of its receptors, is the determining factor in the biological behaviour of AML and MDS, and that VEGFRs are differentially expressed in AML and MDS.","['Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Beran, Miloslav', 'Rogers, Anna', 'Keating, Michael', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Verstovsek S', 'Estey E', 'Manshouri T', 'Giles FJ', 'Cortes J', 'Beran M', 'Rogers A', 'Keating M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, M.

Patients with T-lineage ALL showed a lower expression of BCRP (P = 0.044). Kaplan-Meier analysis of the relapse-free interval showed no prognostic significance of BCRP expression when different levels of BCRP expression were used as cut-off points. No significant difference in expression of BCRP mRNA was measured between initial-stage and relapsed-stage ALL or between normal MNC obtained from BM and ALL patients.

Therefore, factors determining survival in 136 human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A, B, DRB1-matched adult BMT recipients were reviewed. Fifty-four per cent of patients had chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and 36% had acute leukaemia or myelodysplasia. Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was either cyclosporin A (CSA)/methotrexate (64%) or T-cell depletion and CSA/corticosteroids (34%). The probability of donor engraftment by d 45 was 97% (95% CI: 94-100). Incidence of grades III-IV acute GvHD was 18% (95% CI: 12-24) at 100 d, and chronic GvHD was 42% (95% CI: 32-52) at 2 years. At 2 years, 14% (95% CI: 8-20) had relapsed. Multiple regression analysis showed that adverse risk factors for survival were non-CML diagnosis, age > 35 years, diagnosis to transplant time of > 18 months [chronic-phase CML (CML-CP) only]; and grades III-IV acute GvHD. Patients <or= 35 years with early CML-CP had a 2 year survival of 77% (95% CI: 54-100), which compared with a survival in advanced CML patients <or=35 years of 67% (95% CI: 37-97) and 37% (95% CI: 20-54) in non-CML patients. Two year survival for patients > 35 years with early CML-CP was 55% (95% CI: 33-77), 40% (95% CI: 19-61) in advanced CML and 14% (95% CI:1-27) in non-CML.

We studied the dynamic analysis of immune recovery with regard to potential factors affecting its speed, including age, type of HCT, diagnosis, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection reactivation. Absolute counts of different lymphocyte subsets and immunoglobulin serum levels were determined in peripheral blood of patients on d -7 and +16, and then at various intervals up to 24 months post transplant. Common patterns of immune recovery after both allogeneic and autologous HCT were identified: (i) CD4+CD45RO+ peripheral T-cell expansion on d +16; (ii) inverted CD4+:CD8+ ratio from d +30 onwards; (iii) rapid natural killer (NK) cell (CD16+/-CD56+) count normalization. We observed prolonged T-cell lymphopenia (CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD4+CD45RA+) until 24 months after autologous HCT, whereas in the allogeneic setting CD3+CD4+ cells, including naive CD45RA+ cells, returned to normal values at 9 months post transplant. Age > 10 years and coexistence of GvHD and CMV reactivation were associated with a substantial delay in T- (CD4+, including CD45RA+) and B-cell recovery after allogeneic HCT. Multidrug GvHD prophylaxis resulted in impaired T- (CD4+, CD4+CD45RA+) and B-cell reconstitution only in the early phase after allogeneic HCT (up to 4 months). Our results demonstrated that T-cell recovery was severely impaired in children after autologous HCT. It should be emphasized that specific approaches to enhance immune reconstitution are necessary to control minimal residual disease and avoid the risk of infectious complications in the autologous setting. Thymic involution after allogeneic HCT seems to be associated with age and coexistence of GvHD and CMV reactivation.","['Kalwak, Krzysztof', 'Gorczynska, Ewa', 'Toporski, Jacek', 'Turkiewicz, Dominik', 'Slociak, Malgorzata', 'Ussowicz, Marek', 'Latos-Grazynska, Elzbieta', 'Krol, Marzena', 'Boguslawska-Jaworska, Janina', 'Chybicka, Alicja']","['Kalwak K', 'Gorczynska E', 'Toporski J', 'Turkiewicz D', 'Slociak M', 'Ussowicz M', 'Latos-Grazynska E', 'Krol M', 'Boguslawska-Jaworska J', 'Chybicka A']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Wroclaw University of Medicine, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/complications', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/blood', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/surgery', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/surgery', 'Prospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Virus Activation']",2002/07/09 10:00,2002/09/12 10:01,['2002/07/09 10:00'],"['2002/07/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['3560 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03560.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Jul;118(1):74-89. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03560.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age at transplant was 44 years (range 19-61). Eighteen patients had excess blasts ranging from 5% to 30% at the time of transplantation. Two graft failures were observed (4%). Neutrophil (> 0.5 x 109/l) and platelet engraftment (> 50 x 109/l) was reached after a median of 17 d (range 11-38) and 27 d (range 11-48) respectively.

Earlier transplantation in the course of disease, male donor, use of unmanipulated grafts, allogeneic transplantation and occurrence of acute GvHD favoured better DFS, but did not reach statistical significance. The 5-year estimated probability of relapse was 49%. The data showed a trend for a lower relapse probability of acute GvHD grade II-IV (24% vs 54%; P = 0.07), and for a higher relapse rate in patients with T cell-depleted grafts (62% vs 45%), suggesting a 'graft-versus-CMML effect'.","['Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Zabelina, Tatjana', 'Guardiola, Philipe', 'Runde, Volker', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Van Biezen, Anja', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Zander, Axel R', 'De Witte, Theo']","['Kroger N', 'Zabelina T', 'Guardiola P', 'Runde V', 'Sierra J', 'Van Biezen A', 'Niederwieser D', 'Zander AR', 'De Witte T']","['University-Hospital Hamburg, Germany. nkroeger@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/07/09 10:00,2002/09/12 10:01,['2002/07/09 10:00'],"['2002/07/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['3552 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03552.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Jul;118(1):67-73. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03552.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unusual IgG1kappa kidney deposits were observed. The heavy and light chain variable region sequences of that cryoprecipitating monoclonal Ig were characterized. Light microscopy revealed glomerulonephritis typical of cryoglobulinaemia, with neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, endocapillary hyperplasia and few protein thrombi. Electron microscopic study clearly evidenced numerous subepithelial mixed granular and organized deposits with a unique microtubular organization, reminiscent of the GOMMID. The Ig molecule sequence revealed alterations of charge and hydrophobicity potentially promoting a crystal-like aggregation and the aggregation of microtubules.

In allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for leukaemia treatment, however, preservation of the graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effect is another critical requirement for clinical application. In this study, we have compared the effect on GVL of using CD28 and CD40 co-stimulatory blockades as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in a murine allogeneic BMT model with simultaneous transfer of BCL1 leukaemia. Despite the relative improvement of GVHD as assessed by survival and body weight in both treatment regimes, treatment with anti-CD154 moAb clearly diminished the GVL effect, whereas treatment with anti-CD80 and CD86 MoAbs maintained this effect. Although T cell-mediated effector function at 14 days post-BMT assessed by IFNgamma expression and cytotoxicity against host alloantigen was comparable between both co-stimulatory blockades, IL-12 mRNA expression was preferentially reduced by CD40 blockade. Our results suggest the differential involvement of the CD28 and CD40 co-stimulatory pathways in the development of GVHD and GVL effects.

In conclusion, we have shown that the serum concentration of bFGF and TGFbeta1 in CLL patients were significantly reduced after 2-CdA chemotherapy that resulted in remission.

It has also been shown to have growth inhibitory activity toward solid tumors in vivo. However, the antitumor activity of resveratrol against hematologic tumors in vivo has not been examined. In this study, the antileukemic activity of resveratrol in vitro and in vivo was examined using a mouse myeloid leukemia cell line (32Dp210). Treatment of 32Dp210 leukemia cells with resveratrol at micromolar concentrations (25-50 micromol/L) significantly and irreversibly inhibited their clonal growth in vitro. The clonal growth inhibition by resveratrol was associated with extensive cell death and an increase in hypodiploid (sub-G1) cells. Resveratol caused internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, suggesting apoptosis as the mode of cell death in 32Dp210 cells. DNA fragmentation was associated with activation of caspase-3, because cleavage of procaspase-3 was detected in resveratrol-treated cells. Although 32Dp210 cells treated with resveratrol in vitro did not produce leukemia in vivo, only a weak antileukemic effect of resveratrol was observed when administered orally. At doses of 8 mg or 40 mg/kg body daily, five times/wk, resveratrol did not affect the survival of mice injected with leukemia cells. Weak potential antileukemic activity of resveratrol was suggested only at a dose of 80 mg/kg body (2 survivors of 14 mice treated). Thus, despite strong antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities of resveratrol against 32Dp210 cells in vitro, a potential antileukemia effect in vivo, if present, occurs only in a small fraction of mice.","['Gao, Xiaohua', 'Xu, Yong X', 'Divine, George', 'Janakiraman, Nalini', 'Chapman, Robert A', 'Gautam, Subhash C']","['Gao X', 'Xu YX', 'Divine G', 'Janakiraman N', 'Chapman RA', 'Gautam SC']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI 48202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '0 (Stilbenes)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', '*Flavonoids', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phenols/*pharmacology', 'Polymers/*pharmacology', 'Polyphenols', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/physiology', 'Vitis/chemistry']",2002/07/05 10:00,2002/07/27 10:01,['2002/07/05 10:00'],"['2002/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/27 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jn/132.7.2076 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nutr. 2002 Jul;132(7):2076-81. doi: 10.1093/jn/132.7.2076.,['CA85976/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, host responses to DNA damage are not uniform and can be modified by various factors. Here, we report that a split low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) (1.5 Gy twice) to the host causes prominent apoptosis in bone marrow cells of Friend leukemia virus (FLV)-infected C3H mice but not in those of FLV-infected DBA mice. In C3H mice, the apoptosis occurs rapidly and progressively in erythroid cells, leading to lethal host anemia, although treatment with FLV alone or TBI alone induced minimal apoptosis in bone marrow cells. A marked accumulation of P53 protein was demonstrated in bone marrow cells from FLV-infected C3H mice 12 h after treatment with TBI. Although a similar accumulation of P53 was also observed in bone marrow cells from FLV-infected DBA mice treated with TBI, the amount appeared to be parallel to that of mice treated with TBI alone and was much lower than that of FLV- plus TBI-treated C3H mice. To determine the association of p53 with the prominent enhancement of apoptosis in FLV- plus TBI-treated C3H mice, p53 knockout mice of the C3H background (C3H p53(-/-)) were infected with FLV and treated with TBI. As expected, p53 knockout mice exhibited a very low frequency of apoptosis in the bone marrow after treatment with FLV plus TBI. Further, C3H p53(-/-) --> C3H p53(+/+) bone marrow chimeric mice treated with FLV plus TBI survived even longer than the chimeras treated with FLV alone. These findings indicate that infection with FLV strongly enhances radiation-induced apoptotic cell death of hematopoietic cells in host animals and that the apoptosis occurs through a p53-associated signaling pathway, although the response was not uniform in different host strains.","['Kitagawa, Masanobu', 'Yamaguchi, Shuichi', 'Hasegawa, Maki', 'Tanaka, Kaoru', 'Sado, Toshihiko', 'Hirokawa, Katsuiku', 'Aizawa, Shiro']","['Kitagawa M', 'Yamaguchi S', 'Hasegawa M', 'Tanaka K', 'Sado T', 'Hirokawa K', 'Aizawa S']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Aging and Developmental Sciences, Division of Gerontology and Gerodontology, Graduate School, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan. masa.pth2@med.tmd.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Anemia/*mortality', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', 'Gamma Rays', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Retroviridae Infections/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",2002/07/05 10:00,2002/08/10 10:01,['2002/07/05 10:00'],"['2002/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.15.7790-7798.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Aug;76(15):7790-8. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.15.7790-7798.2002.,,,,,PMC136359,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A highly polymorphic nine-residue sequence within Pit1, designated region A, has been proposed as the virus binding site, because mutations in this region abolish Pit1-mediated cellular infection by GALV and FeLV-B. However, a direct correlation between region A mutations deleterious for infection and loss of virus binding has not been established. We report that cells expressing a Pit1 protein harboring mutations in region A that abolish receptor function retain the ability to bind virus, indicating that Pit1 region A is not the virus binding site. Furthermore, we have now identified a second region in Pit1, comprising residues 232 to 260 (region B), that is required for both viral entry and virus binding. Epitope-tagged Pit1 proteins were used to demonstrate that mutations in region B result in improper orientation of Pit1 in the cell membrane. Compensatory mutations in region A can restore proper orientation and full receptor function to these region B mutants. Based on these results, we propose that region A of Pit1 confers competence for viral entry by influencing the topology of the authentic binding site in the membrane and hence its accessibility to a viral envelope protein. Based on glycosylation studies and results obtained by using N- and C-terminal epitope-tagged Pit1, region A and region B mutants, and the transmembrane helices predicted with the PHD PredictProtein algorithm, we propose a new Pit1 topology model.","['Farrell, Karen B', 'Russ, Jill L', 'Murthy, Ravi K', 'Eiden, Maribeth V']","['Farrell KB', 'Russ JL', 'Murthy RK', 'Eiden MV']","['Unit on Molecular Virology, Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Regulation, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Virus/*chemistry/*metabolism']",2002/07/05 10:00,2002/08/10 10:01,['2002/07/05 10:00'],"['2002/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.15.7683-7693.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Aug;76(15):7683-93. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.15.7683-7693.2002.,,,,,PMC136385,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BALB/c mice were primed and given boosters twice with EnvA-expressing NIH 3T3 cells. Resulting hybridomas were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against RCANBP virions and SU-A-immunoglobulin G immunoadhesin. One highly reactive hybridoma clone, mc8C5, was subcloned and tested in immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation (IP), and Western blotting assays. In all three assays, mc8C5-4 subgroup-specifically recognizes SR-A Env, through the SU domain, expressed from different vectors in both avian and mammalian cells. This multifunctionality is notable for a mouse monoclonal. We furthermore observed a preference for binding to terminally glycosylated Env over core-glycosylated Env precursor in IPs, suggesting that the epitope is at least partially conformational and dependent on glycosylation. Most importantly, we found mc8C5-4 inhibited Env function: in vitro, the monoclonal not only interferes with binding of the EnvA receptor, Tva, but it also blocks the Tva-induced conformational change required for activation of the fusion peptide, without inducing that change itself. Infection of Tva-expressing avian or mammalian cells by avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV) or EnvA-pseudotyped murine leukemia virus, respectively, is efficiently inhibited by mc8C5-4. The apparent interference of the monoclonal with the EnvA-Tva complex formation suggests that the epitope seen by mc8C5 overlaps with the receptor binding site. This is supported by the observation that mutations of basic residues in hr2 or of the downstream glycosylation site, which both impair Tva-binding to EnvA, have similar effects on the binding of mc8C5. Thus, anti-ASLV-SU-A mc8C5-4 proves to be a unique new immunoreagent that targets the receptor-binding site on a prototypical retroviral envelope.","['Ochsenbauer-Jambor, Christina', 'Delos, Sue E', 'Accavitti, Mary Ann', 'White, Judith M', 'Hunter, Eric']","['Ochsenbauer-Jambor C', 'Delos SE', 'Accavitti MA', 'White JM', 'Hunter E']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Avian Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Tva receptor)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*metabolism', 'Avian Proteins', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Virus/*chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*immunology']",2002/07/05 10:00,2002/08/10 10:01,['2002/07/05 10:00'],"['2002/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.15.7518-7527.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Aug;76(15):7518-27. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.15.7518-7527.2002.,"['P30 AI027767/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI22470/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29884-22/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA044579/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI022470/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA44579/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-AI-27767/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC136349,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing the rate of DNA synthesis is expected to reduce the frequency of RT template switching, whereas annealing the nascent DNA with acceptor template promotes template switching. We performed a mutational analysis of the murine leukemia virus (MLV) NC zinc finger domain to study its effect on RT template switching in vivo and to explore the role of NC during reverse transcription. The effects of NC mutations on RT template switching were determined by using a previously described in vivo direct-repeat deletion assay. A trans-complementation assay was also developed in which replication-defective NC mutants were rescued by coexpression of replication-defective RT mutants that provided wild-type NC in trans. We found that mutations in the MLV NC zinc finger domain increased the frequency of template switching approximately twofold. When a predicted stem-loop RNA secondary structure was introduced into the template RNA, the template-switching frequency increased 5-fold for wild-type NC and further increased up to an additional 6-fold for NC zinc finger domain mutants, resulting in an overall increase of as much as 30-fold. Thus, wild-type NC increased the efficiency with which RT was able to reverse transcribe through regions of RNA secondary structure that might serve as RT pause sites. These results provide the first in vivo evidence that NC enhances the rate of DNA synthesis by RT in regions of the template possessing stable RNA secondary structure.","['Zhang, Wen-Hui', 'Hwang, Carey K', 'Hu, Wei-Shau', 'Gorelick, Robert J', 'Pathak, Vinay K']","['Zhang WH', 'Hwang CK', 'Hu WS', 'Gorelick RJ', 'Pathak VK']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, Maryland 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Nucleocapsid Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Dogs', 'Genes, Switch', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Nucleocapsid Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Templates, Genetic', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",2002/07/05 10:00,2002/08/10 10:01,['2002/07/05 10:00'],"['2002/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.15.7473-7484.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Aug;76(15):7473-84. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.15.7473-7484.2002.,['N01-CO-56000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC136396,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the possible role of HB-EGF in hypoxic-ischemic induction of neurogenesis, we measured its expression, effects, and target receptors in embryonic murine cerebral cortical cultures and in adult rat brain. Hypoxia increased HB-EGF expression by approximately 50% in cortical cultures, where expression was associated with mature and immature neurons. HB-EGF (5-100 ng/ml) stimulated by approximately 80% the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into cultured cells that expressed the HB-EGF receptors epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ErbB1) and N-arginine dibasic convertase (NRDc). Intracerebroventricular administration of HB-EGF in adult rats increased BrdU labeling in the subventricular zone and in the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus, where EGFR/ErbB1 and NRDc were also expressed and where ischemia-induced neurogenesis is observed. We conclude that HB-EGF stimulates neurogenesis in proliferative zones of the adult brain that are also affected in ischemia and that it does so by interacting with EGFR/ErbB1 and possibly NRDc. Therefore, HB-EGF may help to trigger proliferation of neuronal precursors in brain after hypoxic or ischemic injury.","['Jin, Kunlin', 'Mao, Xiao Ou', 'Sun, Yunjuan', 'Xie, Lin', 'Jin, Lan', 'Nishi, Eiichiro', 'Klagsbrun, Michael', 'Greenberg, David A']","['Jin K', 'Mao XO', 'Sun Y', 'Xie L', 'Jin L', 'Nishi E', 'Klagsbrun M', 'Greenberg DA']","['Buck Institute for Age Research, Novato, California 94945, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Hbegf protein, mouse)', '0 (Hbegf protein, rat)', '0 (Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebral Cortex/cytology/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neurons/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/analysis', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism']",2002/07/05 10:00,2002/07/30 10:01,['2002/07/05 10:00'],"['2002/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['20026486 [doi]', '22/13/5365 [pii]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2002 Jul 1;22(13):5365-73. doi: 20026486.,"['P01 NS035965/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS35965/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC6758221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that cellular Ser/Thr protein phosphatases (PPs) play an important role in mediating these processes. Inhibitors specific for PP1 and PP2A decreased basal expression of RXR alpha RNA and protein in T lymphocyte leukemia Jurkat cells and prevented activation-induced RXR alpha accumulation in these cells. In addition, these inhibitors attenuated the RXR responsive element (RXRE)-dependent transcriptional activation in transient transfection assays. Inhibitors of calcineurin (CN), by contrast, did not have any effect on the basal RXR alpha expression and even augmented activation-induced RXR alpha expression. Expression of a dominant-active (DA) mutant of CN together with a DA mutant of protein kinase C (PKC)theta;, a novel PKC isoform, significantly increased RXRE-dependent transcription. Expression of catalytically inactive PKC theta; or a dominant-negative mutant of PKC theta; failed to synergize with CN and did not increase RXRE-dependent transcription. Expression of a DA mutant of PKC alpha or treatment with PMA was found to attenuate PKC theta; and CN synergism. We conclude that PP1, PP2A, and CN regulate levels and transcriptional activation function of RXR alpha in T cells. In addition, CN synergizes with PKC theta; to induce RXRE-dependent activation, a cooperative function that is antagonized by the activation of the conventional PKC alpha isoform. Thus, PKC theta; and PKC alpha may function as positive and negative modulators, respectively, of CN-regulated RXRE-dependent transcription during T cell activation.","['Ishaq, Mohammad', 'Fan, Ming', 'Wigmore, Kip', 'Gaddam, Arunasri', 'Natarajan, Ven']","['Ishaq M', 'Fan M', 'Wigmore K', 'Gaddam A', 'Natarajan V']","['Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology, Science Applications International Corporation-Frederick, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD 21702, USA. mishaq@nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Calcineurin Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCQ protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-theta)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcineurin/*metabolism/physiology', 'Calcineurin Inhibitors', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Protein Kinase C-theta', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Response Elements/drug effects/*immunology', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/*immunology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/*immunology']",2002/07/05 10:00,2002/08/29 10:01,['2002/07/05 10:00'],"['2002/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.2.732 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Jul 15;169(2):732-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.2.732.,['N01-CO-56000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax inhibits TGF-beta-induced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression and Smad2 phosphorylation. Competitive interaction studies show that Tax inhibits TGF-beta signaling, in part, by disrupting the interaction of the Smads with the transcriptional co-activator p300.

By mutating these residues in HIV-1 and MLV RTs (which are strict DNA polymerases) the enzymes were shown to function also as RNA polymerases. Owing to the uniqueness of MMTV as a type B retrovirus, we have generated a Phe-119-Val mutant of MMTV RT to study the involvement of this residue in affecting the catalytic features of this RT. The data presented here show that the mutant MMTV RT can incorporate both deoxyribonucleosides and ribonucleosides while copying either RNA or DNA. In addition, this mutant RT shows resistance to nucleoside analogues and an enhanced fidelity of DNA synthesis; all relative to the wild-type enzyme. The Phe-119-Val mutant is also different from the wild-type enzyme in its preference for most template primers tested and in its ability to synthesize DNA under non-processive and processive conditions. Overall, it is likely that the aromatic side chain of Phe-119 is located at the dNTP-binding site of MMTV RT and thus might be part of a putative ""steric gate"" that prevents the incorporation of nucleoside triphosphates. Since the only three-dimensional structures of RTs published so far are those of HIV-1 and MLV, it is likely that MMTV RT folds quite similarly to these RTs.","['Entin-Meer, Michal', 'Sevilya, Ziv', 'Hizi, Amnon']","['Entin-Meer M', 'Sevilya Z', 'Hizi A']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', '681HV46001 (Ribose)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Drug Resistance, Viral', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/genetics/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleosides/pharmacology', '*Phenylalanine', 'Point Mutation', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/drug effects/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/metabolism', 'Ribonucleosides/metabolism', 'Ribose/*metabolism', 'Valine']",2002/07/05 10:00,2002/12/11 04:00,['2002/07/05 10:00'],"['2002/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2002/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BJ20020712 [doi]', 'BJ20020712 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2002 Oct 15;367(Pt 2):381-91. doi: 10.1042/BJ20020712.,,,,,PMC1222887,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, the CD95-resistant B-leukaemia lines SEM, RS4;11, and REH were used to investigate the mechanisms of resistance to CD95-signalling. We found that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) treatment increased the presence of high molecular weight forms of CD95 in these cells as judged by Western analysis, and treatment of protein extracts with Peptide: N -glycosidase F indicated that the majority of high molecular weight forms were due to N-linked glycosylation. Treatment of whole cells with neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae substantially reduced the relative molecular mass of CD95 observed after IFN-gamma treatment and partially sensitized the three leukaemia lines to CD95-mediated death. To further characterize the different steps of oligosaccharide processing that may regulate CD95 signalling, the leukaemic cells were treated with IFN-gamma and the glycosidase inhibitors castanospermine, 1-deoxymannojirimycin (DMM), and swainsonine. Treatment with DMM, a mannosidase inhibitor, efficiently reduced the appearance of high molecular weight forms of CD95 after IFN-gamma treatment, and sensitized SEM and REH cells to CD95-mediated death. However, the IFN-gamma-induced increases of CD95 on the cell surface were not altered by treatment with any of the glycosidase inhibitors, suggesting that the generation of complex oligosaccharide structures is not required for trafficking of CD95, but may instead be used as a mechanism of partially blocking CD95 signalling in these cells. In conclusion, IFN-gamma treatment of the B-lineage leukaemia lines provides a novel, inducible system for the further characterization of post-translational modifications involved in modulating sensitivity to CD95-signalling.","['Dorrie, Jan', 'Sapala, Katrin', 'Zunino, Susan J']","['Dorrie J', 'Sapala K', 'Zunino SJ']","['Chair of Genetics, Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Staudtstr. 5, Erlangen, D91058, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indolizines)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '19130-96-2 (1-Deoxynojirimycin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'Q0I3184XM7 (castanospermine)', 'RSY4RK37KQ (Swainsonine)']",IM,"['1-Deoxynojirimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Glycoside Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Indolizines/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Oligosaccharides/pharmacology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Swainsonine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vibrio cholerae/enzymology', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",2002/07/05 10:00,2003/03/29 05:00,['2002/07/05 10:00'],"['2002/07/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/cyto.2002.1030 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.2002.1030 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2002 Apr 21;18(2):98-107. doi: 10.1006/cyto.2002.1030.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The diagnosis of malignant lymphoma was therefore confirmed. The patient, was treated with THP-COP therapy, which proved very effective. Thereafter, a biopsy specimen was found to be positive for MT1 (CD43) staining but negative for myeloperoxidase and chloroacetate esterase staining on immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, no rearrangement of the IgH JH, TCR C beta 1 or TCR J gamma gene was detected by Southern blot analysis. On basis of these findings and the previous results of flow cytometry, we changed the diagnosis from malignant lymphoma to granulocytic sarcoma.

Anagrelide has the US Food and Drug Administration's approval to be used for treating patients with thrombocythemia secondary to chronic myeloproliferative disorders. In contrast, the use of IFN-alpha and hydroxyurea are considered ""off-label."" We performed an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis to compare anagrelide, hydroxyurea, and IFN-alpha for treating essential thrombocythemia, in terms of estimated impact on life expectancy. The case used for this analysis was of a 40-year-old man with essential thrombocythemia. Clinical assumptions were based on information obtained from nonrandomized clinical trials, and the economic assumptions were derived from information abstracted from observational studies. Lifelong treatment use of anagrelide versus hydroxyurea would cost approximately $72,000 per additional year of life gained, while the use of IFN-alpha was found to be both more costly and less effective than anagrelide. The results were very sensitive to the risk of leukemia caused by hydroxyurea, with an incremental cost-effectiveness of anagrelide compared with hydroxyurea of $156,969 per additional year of life gained if the lifetime leukemia risk drops from a baseline of .08 to.05. Given that many commonly used medical interventions cost in the range of $50,000 to $100,000 per year of life gained, and the generally poor outcome associated with treatment-related leukemia that can result from hydroxyurea, anagrelide could be considered a therapeutic alternative that is clinically effective at an acceptable cost.","['Golub, Robert', 'Adams, Jared', 'Dave, Sundeep', 'Bennett, Charles L']","['Golub R', 'Adams J', 'Dave S', 'Bennett CL']","['Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Fernberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Fibrinolytic Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Factors/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Quinazolines/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytosis/*drug therapy/*economics']",2002/07/04 10:00,2002/07/24 10:01,['2002/07/04 10:00'],"['2002/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0093-7754(02)70150-4 [pii]', '10.1053/sonc.2002.33758 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2002 Jun;29(3 Suppl 10):28-32. doi: 10.1053/sonc.2002.33758.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA).

One approach is to assign the patient to a risk category from which treatment recommendations follow. The principal risks of essential thrombocythemia include thrombosis, major hemorrhage, and conversion to leukemia or myelofibrosis. Risk factors for thrombosis include age and prior thrombosis. Smoking and obesity have been implicated in isolated series. High-risk patients with essential thrombocythemia can be defined as those 60 years of age or older or those who have had a thrombosis at any age. These patients should be treated with hydroxyurea. If hydroxyurea cannot be tolerated, anagrelide and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) are alternatives. Low-dose aspirin (40 to 325 mg) can be used for patients whose platelet counts are < 1,500 x10(9)/L. Low-risk patients are those less than 60 years old who have not had thrombosis, who have no cardiovascular risk factors, and whose platelet counts are < 1,500 x 10(9)/L. These patients can be observed or placed on low-dose aspirin. Intermediate-risk patients are those less than 60 years who have not had thromboses, but who have platelet counts > 1,500 x 10(9)/L or who have significant cardiovascular risk factors. These patients should have their risk factors treated and may be given low-dose aspirin if the platelet count is < 1,500 x 10(9)/L. They can be observed or treated with anagrelide, hydroxyurea, or IFN-alpha. The Mayo Clinic experience suggests that no specific treatment affects outcomes of pregnancies. In high-risk pregnant women who need treatment, IFN-alpha is used. The principal risks of polycythemia vera are thrombosis, postpolycythemia myeloid metaplasia, and acute leukemia. Risk factors for thrombosis include age, the use of phlebotomies, the rate of phlebotomies, and a prior history of thrombosis. Platelet counts have not been definitively linked to an increased risk of thrombosis. High-risk polycythemia vera patients are those 60 years of age or older (some groups use 70 years) or those of any age who have had thrombosis. They should be treated with phlebotomy and hydroxyurea or IFN-alpha. Selected patients may be treated with anagrelide. A typical target range for phlebotomy is a hematocrit of < 42% for women and < 45% for men. Low-dose aspirin can be used if the platelet count is < 1,500 x 10(9)/L. Low-risk patients are those less than 60 years old who have had no thrombosis, no cardiovascular risk factors, and whose platelets are < 1,500 x 10(9)/L. These patients can be managed with phlebotomy alone or phlebotomy and low-dose aspirin. Intermediate-risk patients are those who are less than 60 years old, who have not had thrombosis, but who have platelet counts > 1,500 x 10(9)/L or who have cardiovascular risk factors. The cardiovascular risk factors should be treated, along with phlebotomy alone or with IFN-alpha. Low-dose aspirin is reasonable for those with platelet counts < 1,500 x 10(9)/mL. Anagrelide can be used with phlebotomy in selected patients. Women of childbearing age who are in the low-risk or intermediate-risk group can be treated with phlebotomy alone and low-dose aspirin if the platelet count is < 1,500 x 10(9)/L. For high-risk patients or pregnant patients, IFN-alpha can be added.","['Solberg, Lawrence A Jr']",['Solberg LA Jr'],"['Mayo Medical School, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Jacksonville, FL 32224, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspirin/therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Fibrinolytic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', 'Polycythemia Vera/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Quinazolines/therapeutic use', 'Risk Assessment', 'Thrombocytosis/physiopathology/*therapy']",2002/07/04 10:00,2002/07/24 10:01,['2002/07/04 10:00'],"['2002/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0093-7754(02)70147-4 [pii]', '10.1053/sonc.2002.33755 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2002 Jun;29(3 Suppl 10):10-5. doi: 10.1053/sonc.2002.33755.,,,17,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA).

If the excessive production of red cells and/or platelets is controlled, patients with these disorders may have prolonged survival. However, the clinical course of these patients can be complicated by a variety of events, including thrombotic episodes, bleeding episodes, arthropathies, pruritus, weakness, weight loss, neurologic impairment, erythromelalgia, fever, abdominal pain, and the life-threatening consequences of progression to myelofibrosis and/or acute leukemia. Effective control of hematopoiesis by phlebotomy or a variety of therapeutic agents has resulted in a reduction or elimination of many of these clinical events, but has not altered the evolution to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia. Use of each of these therapeutic strategies is also associated with a range of adverse events. Monitoring overall survival or a reduction in the frequency of clinical events has previously served as a means of assessing the results of these therapeutic interventions. Quality-of-life instruments have not been applied in a systematic fashion to the evaluation of outcomes in patients with these chronic myeloproliferative disorders. Quality-of-life assessments evaluate not only the state of well-being of a patient that results from an assessment of the individual's ability to perform everyday activities, which are reflective of physical, psychological, and social well-being, but also patient satisfaction with the control of disease and/or treatment-related symptoms. Quality-of-life instruments have been used to assess the clinical course of patients suffering from a variety of disorders, ranging from cancer to renal failure to chronic fatigue syndrome. Information about quality-of-life outcomes can contribute to the evaluation of variations in dose and timing of administration of therapeutic agents. It is possible that the side effects of a particular therapy may outweigh the disease regression achieved with a particular therapy.

Most solid tumors and hematopoietic malignancies often show abnormal chromosome numbers, the aneuploidy. The chromosomal aneuploidy keeps cells in the state of chromosomal instability (CIN) that will increase the mutation rate of cells affected and thus push them deeper into the process of tumorigenesis. The yeast genetic studies showed that normal distribution of chromosome during mitosis is under the surveillance of a set of genes, the spindle assembly checkpoint genes, that include the BUB and MAD gene groups and MPS. In some colorectal cancers with CIN it was found to have hBUB1 gene mutated and the mutated gene functions dominantly. We have examined a series of breast cancer cell lines with or without CIN for the hBUB1 gene mutation and found none. However, we detected various degrees of deletion in the coding sequences of the hBUB1 gene in cells from T lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines, Molt3 and Molt4, and cells from some acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. So far the lesions of deletion are in the kinetochore localization domain of the hBUB1 gene that may explain why the deletion lesions in the BUB1 gene cause aneuploidy in lymphoma and lymphoma cells. The deletions are heterozygous in nature.

The wild-type Bcr product has several recognizable structural and functional motifs including a domain that contains guanine nucleotide exchange activity for Rho family GTPases (DH/PH domain). Although this domain is retained within p210 Bcr-Abl, it has no known signaling activities in vivo. Here we report that a fragment of Bcr that encodes the isolated DH/PH domain is a potent activator of the NF-kappaB transcription factor. Within the context of full length Bcr, this activity is regulated by proximal flanking sequences that suppress the DH/PH domain encoded guanine nucleotide exchange activity. NF-kappaB activation by Bcr is not mediated by nuclear translocation, but rather by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent modification of the RelA/p65 transactivation domain. Although we were able to demonstrate that Bcr can function as an exchange factor for Cdc42 in vivo, NF-kappaB activation appears to occur via a Cdc42-independent mechanism. These studies constitute direct evidence that the Bcr RhoGEF domain can function in vivo, and identify a new signaling activity that may contribute to the transforming potential of p210 Bcr-Abl.","['Korus, Malgorzata', 'Mahon, Gwendolyn M', 'Cheng, Li', 'Whitehead, Ian P']","['Korus M', 'Mahon GM', 'Cheng L', 'Whitehead IP']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey, NJ 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bcr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",2002/07/04 10:00,2002/08/01 10:01,['2002/07/04 10:00'],"['2002/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2002/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205678 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Jul 11;21(30):4601-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205678.,['CA-77493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Parents' experiences of their children's initial diagnosis and treatment of ALL. FINDINGS: The parents' insights provided a clear indication that the initial stage of treatment is highly stressful and parents may be overwhelmed by the experience. The situational stress translated into three potentially overwhelming emotional states: the stress of uncertainty, the shock of diagnosis, and a feeling of being trapped in an unpleasant emotional roller-coaster ride. Honesty from healthcare professionals, the opportunity to share feelings, and an affirmation of the harshness of the situation were reported as helpful in dealing with the sense of being overwhelmed. CONCLUSION: Parents need honest information and sensitive emotional support to come to terms with the stresses associated with their children's diagnosis and initial treatment of ALL. Parents must have access to a safe environment where they can express their feelings and have the harsh reality of the initial stage of treatment affirmed. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Parents need considerable emotional support to negotiate the initial stage of treatment for ALL. Parents of children diagnosed with ALL must have honest information about diagnosis and treatment, as much information as possible for planning their daily lives, an opportunity to express real feelings, access to moments of personal space where feelings can be processed, and compassionate understanding of the emotional difficulties associated with this difficult life journey.","['McGrath, Pam']",['McGrath P'],"['University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Australia. p.mcgrath@uq.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oncology Nursing/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*nursing/psychology/therapy', 'Stress, Psychological/etiology/*nursing']",2002/07/04 10:00,2002/10/29 04:00,['2002/07/04 10:00'],"['2002/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/29 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1188/02.ONF.988-996 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 2002 Jul;29(6):988-96. doi: 10.1188/02.ONF.988-996.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NB4, a human promyelocytic leukemic cell line that expresses high levels of cell-surface CD13/aminopeptidase N, does not undergo endothelial IL-8-induced apoptosis. Consequently, we investigated the relationship between cell-surface aminopeptidase activity and endothelial IL-8 induction of apoptosis in various leukemic cell lines. METHODS: CD13/aminopeptidase N activity and IL-8-induced apoptosis were examined in leukemic cell lines. Endothelial IL-8-induced apoptosis was examined further in NB4 cells, K562 cells (human chronic myelogenous leukemic cells expressing low levels of CD13/aminopeptidase N), CD13/aminopeptidase N-transfected K562 (K562/CD13) cells that overexpress aminopeptidase, and mock-transfected K562 cells (vector only). These cells were also cocultured with a vascular endothelial cell layer to investigate the association between aminopeptidase activity and apoptosis in this system. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Endothelial IL-8 induced apoptosis in K562 cells but not in K562/CD13 cells. A combination of an aminopeptidase inhibitor (such as bestatin) and endothelial IL-8 induced apoptosis in NB4 cells and K562/CD13 cells (2.88-fold difference [95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.82-fold to 3.94-fold], P =.004 for bestatin-treated NB4 cells and 4.31-fold difference [95% CI = 3.52-fold to 5.10-fold], P<.001 for bestatin-treated K562/CD13 cells). When aminopeptidase activity in NB4 cells was modulated by aminopeptidase inhibitors, a statistically significant correlation was found between aminopeptidase activity and the proportion of apoptotic cells induced by endothelial IL-8 (r = -.837, P<.001 by Pearson's correlation coefficient; r = -.697, P =.013 by Spearman's correlation analysis by ranks). K562/CD13 cells cocultured with vascular endothelial cells did not undergo apoptosis, but the addition of bestatin resulted in the induction of apoptosis in K562/CD13 cells (2.70-fold difference [95% CI = 1.77-fold to 3.63-fold], P<.001). Bestatin treatment increased the level of IL-8 mRNA in and the amount of IL-8 secreted by vascular endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of cell-surface CD13/aminopeptidase N appear to allow leukemic cells to resist endothelial IL-8-induced apoptosis. The combination of endothelial IL-8 and bestatin induce leukemic cells expressing high levels of CD13/aminopeptidase N to undergo apoptosis. Bestatin may be useful for treating patients with leukemia.","['Mishima, Yuji', 'Matsumoto-Mishima, Yuko', 'Terui, Yasuhito', 'Katsuyama, Misa', 'Yamada, Muneo', 'Mori, Masaki', 'Ishizaka, Yukihito', 'Ikeda, Kazuma', 'Watanabe, Jun-ichiro', 'Mizunuma, Nobuyuki', 'Hayasawa, Hirotoshi', 'Hatake, Kiyohiko']","['Mishima Y', 'Matsumoto-Mishima Y', 'Terui Y', 'Katsuyama M', 'Yamada M', 'Mori M', 'Ishizaka Y', 'Ikeda K', 'Watanabe J', 'Mizunuma N', 'Hayasawa H', 'Hatake K']","['Biochemical Research Laboratory, Morinaga Milk Industry Co.

They originate from the bone marrow and upon stimulation with bacterial products, cytokines or CD40 ligation they acquire the ability to migrate to the secondary lymphoid organs. In vitro DC can be generated from human CD34(+) bone marrow cells and CD14(+) peripheral blood monocytes after culture with different cytokine combinations. Since most leukemic cells and tumors in general are devoid of APC capacities, various strategies have been used to increase their recognition and confer the capacity of antigen presentation on them. Because of our interest in the design of vaccine immunotherapy protocols for the adjuvant treatment of patients with lymphoid malignancies (LM), we chose to explore the capacity of human acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and plasma cell leukemia to differentiate into cells with APC and DC features. Our results among a sample of 10 patients demonstrate that such approach is feasible. Leukemic cells could be induced in the presence of IL-4 and CD40L to exhibit a DC morphology with a phenotype of mature DC-like cells. They could also induce a potent proliferative response in naive CD4(+) T cells. In addition, they expressed chemokine receptor CCR7 and CD62L, and could drive T cells towards a T(h)1 response with secretion of IFN-gamma. Our strategy leading to increased LM cell immunogenicity may have potential clinical applications and LM appear to be attracting candidates for adjuvant vaccination and adoptive immunotherapy.","['Mohty, Mohamad', 'Isnardon, Daniel', 'Charbonnier, Aude', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, Marina', 'Merlin, Michele', 'Sainty, Danielle', 'Olive, Daniel', 'Gaugler, Beatrice']","['Mohty M', 'Isnardon D', 'Charbonnier A', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M', 'Merlin M', 'Sainty D', 'Olive D', 'Gaugler B']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie des Tumeurs, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Universite de la Mediterranee, 232 Boulevard Ste Marguerite, 13273 Marseille Cedex, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'L-Selectin/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology', 'Receptors, CCR7', 'Receptors, Chemokine/metabolism']",2002/07/04 10:00,2003/05/21 05:00,['2002/07/04 10:00'],"['2002/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/dxf036 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 2002 Jul;14(7):741-50. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxf036.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This abnormality is the result of a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosome 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11), and its presence is not restricted to chronic myelogenous leukemia, but can also be found in 30% of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults. In the 1980s, the molecular counterpart of the chromosomal rearrangement was identified to consist of the juxtaposition of parts of the BCR and ABL genes to form a BCR-ABL hybrid gene. The resulting chimeric proteins (P210 and P190), which retain constitutively activated tyrosine kinase activity, have demonstrated a causative role in the genesis of the leukemic process. Although many aspects of the BCR-ABL driven transformation remain unsolved, great advances in understanding the molecular pathology of Ph-positive leukemias resulted in meaningful improvement in the clinical setting. Molecular tools to diagnose disease (PCR, FISH, and southern blot) and to monitor minimal residual disease after potential curative treatment are now in current practice, and new powerful therapeutic tools have emerged that target the molecular oncogenic pathways activated in Ph-positive cells. Among them, specific ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors recently obtained extraordinary results in many clinical protocols. This review summarizes the most recent advances in this field with special focus on the putative mechanisms of the transformation and progression of chronic myelogenous leukemia and on the major impact that understanding the molecular biology of these diseases is having in clinical practice.","['Cilloni, Daniela', 'Guerrasio, Aagelo', 'Giugliano, Emilia', 'Scaravaglio, Patrizia', 'Volpe, Gisella', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Cilloni D', 'Guerrasio A', 'Giugliano E', 'Scaravaglio P', 'Volpe G', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Saglio G']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Hospital S.

An adverse effect linked to the use of these drugs is the development of acute myeloid leukemia, a disorder usually associated with chromosomal translocation. To examine podophyllotoxin-induced DNA rearrangement, we developed an assay system to measure illegitimate recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes. This approach uses juxtaposed CAN1-CYH2 negative selection markers that are introduced into the LEU2 locus, which is located on chromosome III, in a yeast strain carrying the mutated can1 and cyh2 genes. Upon formation of a deletion over the active CAN1-CYH2 genes, a cell becomes resistant to both canavanine and cycloheximide. To introduce drugs into the cell, we used a yeast strain carrying an ISE2 mutation, thereby making the cell drug-permeable. Here we show that treatment of cells with etoposide (VP-16) increases the rate of illegitimate recombination in yeast, indicating that VP-16 stimulates DNA topoisomerase-mediated illegitimate recombination. Structural analysis of the resulting recombinants indicate that most are formed by deletion mutations on chromosome III, which take place between short homologous regions of DNA. We propose a model for illegitimate recombination, in which VP-16 facilitates formation of a cleavable complex between DNA topoisomerase II and DNA, thus promoting DNA double-strand breakage with the resulting DNA ends joined by a non-homologous mechanism.","['Asami, Yasuo', 'Jia, Din-Wu', 'Tatebayashi, Kazuo', 'Yamagata, Kazutsune', 'Tanokura, Masaru', 'Ikeda, Hideo']","['Asami Y', 'Jia DW', 'Tatebayashi K', 'Yamagata K', 'Tanokura M', 'Ikeda H']","['Center for Basic Research, The Kitasato Institute, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8642, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Amino Acid Transport Systems)', '0 (CAN1 protein, Candida albicans)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.85 (3-Isopropylmalate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['3-Isopropylmalate Dehydrogenase', 'Alcohol Oxidoreductases/genetics', 'Amino Acid Transport Systems/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Fungal/*genetics', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Recombination, Genetic/*drug effects/genetics', 'Ribosomal Proteins/genetics', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*drug effects/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2002/07/04 10:00,2002/09/06 10:01,['2002/07/04 10:00'],"['2002/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0378111902006224 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(02)00622-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2002 May 29;291(1-2):251-7. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(02)00622-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It exhibits appreciable amino acid identity to FRAT1 (77%) which was initially isolated as frequently being overexpressed in a murine leukemia virus insertion model in murine tumors. FRAT proteins are thought to play a role in Wnt signaling. They can bind to glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and Dishevelled, two proteins involved in Wnt signal transduction. Both hFRAT1 and hFRAT2 are intronless genes localized to the same portion of chromosome 10q24.1 and separated by only 10.7 kb. In a broad range of human tissues FRAT1 and FRAT2 are readily detected and expressed in a near identical pattern. Both species are repressed when the human embryonal carcinoma cell line, NT2/D1, is induced to differentiate with all-trans retinoic acid (RA). This treatment had no appreciable effect on FRAT levels in two other RA-sensitive cell lines that were not of germ cell tumor origin. The overlapping expression patterns suggest these two genes share a regulatory region. Both FRAT genes exhibited three species of mRNA, which varied in representation between tissues. When transiently overexpressed in COS-1 cells, the FRAT proteins were detected in the cytosol and concentrated in the nucleus.

The protocol called for prophylactic C1 whole brain external beam irradiation, 18 Gy in 2 Gy/fraction for 9 fractions. We hypothesized that a correlation would be found between the number of children irradiated on protocol by an institution and the compliance rate of that institution with radiotherapy quality assurance (QA) guidelines. We also hypothesized that QA compliance would improve as the study progressed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We scored the radiation dose as a minor deviation from protocol guidelines if the dose to the prescription point differed from the protocol by 6-10%, and a major deviation if it differed from protocol by > 10%. Treatment volumes were scored as a minor deviation if the margins were less than specified or the fields were excessively large. A major deviation was defined as the transection of a potential leukemia-bearing volume such as would be caused by blocking the cribriform plate, optic nerve, or temporal lobe. When the treating physician submitted a treatment plan and simulator film at the initiation of therapy to the Quality Assurance Review Center (QARC), a rapid turn-around review of the plan and suggestions for improvement was provided. At the end of therapy, all simulator and port films were reviewed at the QARC. RESULTS: We reviewed the data from 353 patients treated at 73 institutions in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Of these patients, 2% (n = 7) were not assessable for QA because of incomplete information. Minor quality deviations were found in 27.7% of patients (n = 98) and major deviations in 7.9% (n = 28). The frequency of major deviations for institutions placing 1-4 patients on study was 11% vs. 5.5% for institutions placing > or =5 patients (p < 0.09). The frequency of minor deviations was 28.6% for institutions placing 1-4 patients on study vs. 27.1% for institutions placing >5 patients (p not significant). The frequency of major deviations fell over time (1996-1997, 15.5% vs. 1998-2001, 4.7%, p < 0.001). The frequency of minor deviations did not (1996-1997, 29.9% vs. 1998-2001, 26.9%, p not significant). CONCLUSION: For a relatively simple radiotherapy field, with clearly written protocol guidelines and rapid turn-around corrections from QARC, the rate of minor deviations was no different between institutions placing 1-4 patients on study and those placing > or =5. A trend (p < 0.09) was noted, however, for major deviations to decrease as a function of institutional experience, as well as over time (p < 0.001), supporting the validity of the hypothesis that pediatric clinical experience matters in QA for C1 whole brain leukemia radiotherapy.","['Halperin, Edward C', 'Laurie, Fran', 'Fitzgerald, T J']","['Halperin EC', 'Laurie F', 'Fitzgerald TJ']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. halperin@radonc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Brain/*radiation effects', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*standards', 'Humans', 'Photons', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Quality Assurance, Health Care', 'Radiotherapy Dosage']",2002/07/04 10:00,2002/08/10 10:01,['2002/07/04 10:00'],"['2002/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['S036030160202833X [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(02)02833-x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Jul 15;53(4):1001-4. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(02)02833-x.,"['5U10CA15525-29/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29511/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, we carried out PCR analysis of DNA extracted from sorted EGFP(-)/EYFP(-) cells and confirmed the presence of cells genetically marked by either vector in this population, indicating the persistence of cells that have downregulated or lost retroviral gene expression.

The harmful influences of side-stream cigarette smoke on human health are its adverse effects on the immune system, especially when already compromised by other agents. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a clinical disorder caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To facilitate studies, murine AIDS was induced in C57BL/6 mice by LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus infection, which mimics human AIDS. After 2 weeks of retroviral infection, the mice were exposed to side-stream cigarette smoke for 30 min, 5 days/week for 12 weeks using a side-stream cigarette smoke exposure system. Murine retrovirus infection reduced the in vitro proliferation of T lymphocytes stimulated by concanavalin A, increased the release of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), increased the hepatic lipid peroxidation and decreased the alpha-tocopherol levels in liver, lung and heart. Concomitant side-stream cigarette smoke exposure for 12 weeks further inhibited the proliferation of T cells, increased the release of TNF-alpha, IL-6 cytokines and enhanced the hepatic lipid peroxidation from retrovirus infected mice. The loss of alpha-tocopherol was also further enhanced by side-stream cigarette smoke exposure during retrovirus infection. Our conclusions are that side-stream cigarette smoke induced increasing oxidative stress, reducing nutrient concentrations and suppressing immune function could make mice with murine AIDS more susceptible to opportunistic infections, potentially accelerating murine AIDS progression. Thus, the reduction of side-stream cigarette smoke exposure is an important health issue in AIDS patients to improve the quality and quantity of their lives.","['Zhang, Jin', 'Du Ester, En-Jie', 'Watson, Ronald Ross']","['Zhang J', 'Du Ester EJ', 'Watson RR']","['Health Promotion Science Division, College of Public Health, The University of Arizona Health Science Center, Tuscon 85724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lipid Peroxides)', '0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)', 'H4N855PNZ1 (alpha-Tocopherol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lipid Peroxides/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'Oxidative Stress/immunology', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*adverse effects', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology', 'Up-Regulation/immunology', 'alpha-Tocopherol/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2002/07/04 10:00,2002/12/27 04:00,['2002/07/04 10:00'],"['2002/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/27 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1567-5769(02)00012-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s1567-5769(02)00012-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2002 May;2(6):759-66. doi: 10.1016/s1567-5769(02)00012-7.,['HL63667/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the in vitro biological activity of this compound by examining its effect on proliferation and differentiation in myeloid leukemia cell lines (HL-60, NB4, U937,THP-1, ML-1, Kasumi-1) and fresh samples from 17 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Resveratrol (20 microM, 4 days) alone inhibited the growth in liquid culture of each of the 6 cell lines. Resveratrol (10 microM) enhanced the expression of adhesion molecules (CD11a, CD11b, CD18, CD54) in each of the cell lines except for Kasumi-1. Moreover, resveratrol (25 microM, 4 days) induced 37% of U937 cells to produce superoxide as measured by the ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT). The combination of resveratrol (10 microM) and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) (50 nM, 4 days) induced 95% of the NB4 cells to become NBT-positive, whereas <1% and 12% of the cells became positive for NBT after a similar exposure to either resveratrol or ATRA alone, respectively. In U937 cells exposed to resveratrol (25 microM, 3 days), the binding activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) protein was suppressed. Eight of 19 samples of fresh acute leukemia cells reduced NBT after exposure to resveratrol (20 microM, 4 days).

A 63-year-old man presented with anemia and reticulocytopenia in May 1997. A bone marrow examination revealed erythroid aplasia with normal production of myeloid cells and megakaryocytes with a normal karyotype. After the diagnosis of pure red cell aplasia was made, the patient was treated with prednisolone and then with cyclosporin A (CyA). Two weeks after the initiation of CyA treatment, the peripheral reticulocyte count began to increase with a regrowth of erythroid cells in the bone marrow. Meanwhile, the peripheral white blood cell and platelet counts also increased to more than 10,000/microL and 1,000,000/microL, respectively. Examination of a bone marrow aspirate in December 1997 revealed myelodysplastic changes with trisomy 8. Despite the discontinuation of CyA and the administration of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine stearyl monophosphate, leukemia developed in August 1998. In September 1998, the patient died of sepsis during a neutropenic period that followed remission-induction therapy. In the mechanism of pathogenesis, CyA may induce upon pure red cell aplasia a secondary myeloproliferative disorder with myelodysplasia and leukemia. An alternative possibility is that CyA reduces autoimmune-mediated suppression of the underlying stem cell disorder and that the result of this reduction is the manifestation of myeloproliferation and leukemia.","['Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Shirasaki, Haruhisa', 'Kuwata, Atsushi', 'Yamashita, Taro', 'Imamura, Shin', 'Tsutani, Hiroshi', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Yamauchi T', 'Shirasaki H', 'Kuwata A', 'Yamashita T', 'Imamura S', 'Tsutani H', 'Ueda T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical University, Matsuoka, Japan. tyamauch@fmsrsa.fukui-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/chemically induced/pathology', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Trisomy']",2002/07/04 10:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2002/07/04 10:00'],"['2002/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02982116 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 Jun;75(5):514-8. doi: 10.1007/BF02982116.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined whether the activities of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAPK, and Akt kinase, are functional in B-CLL cells, because these kinases play critical roles in activation in response to BCR stimulation, tumor cell growth, and survival. In B-CLL cells, BCR cross-linking neither induced activation nor enhanced the activities of Lyn, Syk, p21ras, JNK, p38 MAPK, or Akt kinases, whereas p38 MAPK and Akt were constitutively active. In contrast, BCR cross-linking resulted in ERK activation, although the activation in quiescent cells was case dependent. These results suggest that some signaling pathways, such as the activation of ERK through BCR, are functional in B-CLL cells despite the extensive impairment of signaling pathways.","['Kawauchi, Kiyotaka', 'Ogasawara, Toshie', 'Yasuyama, Masako']","['Kawauchi K', 'Ogasawara T', 'Yasuyama M']","[""Department of Medicine, Tokyo Women's Medical University Daini Hospital, Japan. ochamegm@dnh.twmu.ac.jp""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Precursors/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism/physiology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', '*JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/*immunology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Syk Kinase', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'src-Family Kinases/physiology']",2002/07/04 10:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2002/07/04 10:00'],"['2002/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02982115 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 Jun;75(5):508-13. doi: 10.1007/BF02982115.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MSF belongs to the septin family of proteins, which includes other MLL fusion partners, hCDCrel1 and Septin 6, and has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of human ovarian tumor and murine T-cell lymphoma. We describe here a 64-year-old man with de novo acute myelomonocytic leukemia (French-American-British subtype M4) with t(11;17)(q23;q25). His leukemia was successfully induced into a first remission, which, however, lasted only briefly. A second remission was never attained, and the patient died of sepsis 16 months after the diagnosis of leukemia. Examination of his leukemic cells at diagnosis revealed an MLL gene rearrangement, by Southern blotting, and an MLL-MSF fusion transcript, by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Sequence analysis of the RT-PCR product further revealed that MLL exon 5 was fused in-frame to MSF exon 3. Further clinical and molecular analyses of acute leukemias with the MLL-MSF transcript may shed more light on the clinical characteristics and molecular mechanisms of the MLL-septin type leukemias.","['Yamamoto, Koh', 'Shibata, Fumi', 'Yamaguchi, Mitsuko', 'Miura, Osamu']","['Yamamoto K', 'Shibata F', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Miura O']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLL-MSF fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SEPTIN9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Septins)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*GTP Phosphohydrolases', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Septins', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2002/07/04 10:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2002/07/04 10:00'],"['2002/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02982114 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 Jun;75(5):503-7. doi: 10.1007/BF02982114.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Certain hematological malignancies have a different prevalence in our country than in countries with Caucasian populations. Data indicate that the prevalence of CML in our country is similar to that found in Caucasians; however, the prevalence of the other CMPDs has not been studied. METHODS: In a total of 8069 individuals studied between June 1983 and March 2001 in the Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna de Puebla, we assessed the prevalence of CML, PT, AMM, and PV. Some of the clinical features of these individuals were also assessed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Forty-nine patients with CML, 14 with PT, 7 with AMM, and 3 with PV were identified. The clinical presentations of these CMPDs were not different from those described in Caucasians. CONCLUSIONS: We found that CML was more than 3 times more frequent than PT, that both PV and AMM were exceptional, and that PT, AMM, and PV were significantly less frequent in Mexican than in Caucasian populations (P < .01).","['Ruiz-Arguelles, Guillermo J', 'Lopez-Martinez, Briceida', 'Lobato-Mendizabal, Eduardo', 'Ruiz-Delgado, Guillermo J']","['Ruiz-Arguelles GJ', 'Lopez-Martinez B', 'Lobato-Mendizabal E', 'Ruiz-Delgado GJ']","['Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna de Puebla, PUE, Mexico. gruiz1@puebla.megared.net.mx']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology', 'Mexico/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Polycythemia Vera/epidemiology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/epidemiology', 'Racial Groups', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/epidemiology', 'Topography, Medical']",2002/07/04 10:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2002/07/04 10:00'],"['2002/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02982113 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 Jun;75(5):499-502. doi: 10.1007/BF02982113.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the safety and efficacy of reduced-intensity conditioning consisting of low-dose (600 cGy) total body irradiation and cytosine arabinoside (1 g/m2) together with a continuous infusion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) in patients with CML in the chronic phase. Fractionated splenic irradiation (5 Gy) was also administered as part of the conditioning treatment. Eight patients older than 40 years underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling following this conditioning. Regimen-related toxicities (equal to or greater than grade III) were not observed. Rapid restoration of 100% donor chimerism was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization methods in 5 sex-mismatched transplant recipients. One patient died from severe acute graft-versus-host disease and another from Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia early in the course of transplantation. A sustained engraftment was achieved in 5 long-term survivors; in 1 case, the graft was rejected but the Philadelphia chromosome and BCR/ABL-negative autologous hemopoiesis were restored. After a minimum follow-up period of 60 months, 6 patients, including the patient with restored autologous hemopoiesis, were still alive and in remission with 100% donor chimerism. Six years after the transplantation, 1 patient experienced a cytogenetic relapse, which was successfully treated with donor lymphocyte infusions. In summary, this reduced-intensity conditioning resulted in a cure with markedly reduced regimen-related toxicities in this relatively older cohort of patients with CML.","['Okamoto, Shinichiro', 'Watanabe, Reiko', 'Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Mori, Takehiko', 'Izeki, Tohru', 'Nagayama, Hitomi', 'Ishida, Akaru', 'Takayama, Nobuyuki', 'Yokoyama, Kenji', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Asano, Shigetaka', 'Ikeda, Yasuo']","['Okamoto S', 'Watanabe R', 'Takahashi S', 'Mori T', 'Izeki T', 'Nagayama H', 'Ishida A', 'Takayama N', 'Yokoyama K', 'Tojo A', 'Asano S', 'Ikeda Y']","['Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. okamoto@sc.itc.keio.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Survival', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2002/07/04 10:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2002/07/04 10:00'],"['2002/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02982112 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 Jun;75(5):493-8. doi: 10.1007/BF02982112.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper presents a methodology for such an overall analysis using three-way methods applied to a data set on female mortality rates for 17 tumour sites of 43 countries for the years 1968-1985. Multivariate techniques like biplots and three-mode principal component analysis within an overall three-way analysis-of-variance framework were used. We confirmed the known patterns of comparatively high mortality for women due to cancer of the bladder, intestines, pancreas, rectum, breast, ovary, skin and leukaemia and the relatively low mortality rates for liver cancer in Western and Northern Europe, the USA, Australia and New Zealand. Also, the reverse pattern was observed for Middle and Southern Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore, and in Japan, and in some but not all Latin American countries. The relatively mortality due to cancer was high in the lungs, mouth, larynx and oesophagus in the British Isles, but was much less in other European countries. Mortality due to cancer of the thyroid, uterus, gall bladder and stomach was high in Middle European countries, as was the case in Japan, Chile and Costa Rica. Rates were low for Southern European countries, North America, Australia and New Zealand. Specific deviating patterns in the data were the more rapidly decreasing mortality rates for stomach cancer in Chile and Japan and the more rapidly increasing mortality rates for lung cancer in the USA, Scotland and Denmark. In conclusion, using three-way methods, it was feasible to analyse the cancer mortality data in their entirety. This enabled the simultaneous comparison of trends in relative mortality rates between all countries due to all tumour sites, as well as the identification of specific deviating trends for specific tumour sites in specific countries.","['Kroonenberg, P M', 'Murakami, T', 'Coebergh, J W W']","['Kroonenberg PM', 'Murakami T', 'Coebergh JW']","['Department of Education, Leiden University, Wassenaarseweg 52, 2333 AK Leiden, The Netherlands. kroonenb@fsw.leidenuniv.nl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Stat Methods Med Res,Statistical methods in medical research,9212457,,IM,"['Cross-Cultural Comparison', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Developed Countries/statistics & numerical data', 'Developing Countries/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mortality/trends', 'Neoplasms/classification/*mortality']",2002/07/04 10:00,2002/12/27 04:00,['2002/07/04 10:00'],"['2002/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/27 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1191/0962280202sm287ra [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Methods Med Res. 2002 Jun;11(3):275-92. doi: 10.1191/0962280202sm287ra.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we show that carnosic acid (2.5-10 microM) inhibits proliferation of HL-60 and U937 human myeloid leukemia cells (half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 6-7 microM) without induction of apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Growth arrest occurred concomitantly with a transient cell cycle block in the G1 phase, which was accompanied by an increase in the immunodetectable levels of the universal cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21WAFI and p27Kipl. Carnosic acid caused only a marginal induction of differentiation, as monitored by the capacity to generate superoxide radicals and the expression of cell surface antigens (CD11b and CD14) and receptors for the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine. However, at low concentrations, this polyphenol substantially augmented (100- to 1,000-fold) the differentiating effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and all-trans retinoic acid. Furthermore, such combinations of carnosic acid and any of these differentiation inducers synergistically inhibited proliferation and cell cycle progression. These results indicate that carnosic acid is capable of antiproliferative action in leukemic cells and can cooperate with other natural anticancer compounds in growth-inhibitory and differentiating effects.","['Steiner, M', 'Priel, I', 'Giat, J', 'Levy, J', 'Sharoni, Y', 'Danilenko, M']","['Steiner M', 'Priel I', 'Giat J', 'Levy J', 'Sharoni Y', 'Danilenko M']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Soroka Medical Center of Kupat Holim, Beer-Sheva 84 105, Israel. misha@bgumail.bgu.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)']",IM,"['Abietanes', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Rosmarinus/chemistry', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'U937 Cells/pathology']",2002/07/04 10:00,2002/12/17 04:00,['2002/07/04 10:00'],"['2002/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01635581.2001.9680624 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2001;41(1-2):135-44. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2001.9680624.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In those instances, one should not overcall something, but rather should state what the problems are, and what are most likely to be the diagnostic possibilities.","['Ben-Ezra, Jonathan']",['Ben-Ezra J'],"['Department of Pathology, Medical College of Virginia, Hospitals of Virginia Commonwealth University, POB 980250, Richmond, VA 23298, USA. jbenezra@vcu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*pathology', 'Biomarkers', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/diagnosis/pathology', '*Lymphoproliferative Disorders/classification/diagnosis/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/*pathology']",2002/07/04 10:00,2003/01/09 04:00,['2002/07/04 10:00'],"['2002/07/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0889-8588(02)00007-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0889-8588(02)00007-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 2002 Apr;16(2):321-37. doi: 10.1016/s0889-8588(02)00007-2.,,,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed lower levels of WT1 transcript in AML M5 (P = 0.0015); no association was found between expression levels and sex, initial leukocyte count and karyotype-based prognostic groups. There was significant correlation between very low WT1 expression at presentation and excellent outcome (EFS P = 0.0014). Combined analysis of WT1 levels, three-colour flow cytometry residual disease detection and the course of the disease in 222 samples from 28 children with AML showed remarkable correlation. Fourteen patients expressed high WT1 levels at presentation. In eight of them, who suffered relapse or did not reach complete remission, dynamics of WT1 levels clearly correlated with the disease status and residual disease by flow cytometry.

In this report we investigated the applicablility of T cell receptor gamma (TCRG) gene rearrangements as targets for MRD detection by real-time quantitative PCR analysis. Seventeen children with precursor-B-ALL and 15 children with T-ALL were included in this study. Using an allele-specific (ASO) forward primer in combination with germline Jgamma reverse primers and Jgamma TaqMan probes, a reproducible sensitivity of < or =10(-4) (defined by strict criteria) was obtained in only four out of 19 (21%) TCRG gene rearrangements in precursor-B-ALL patients and in 10 out of 15 (67%) TCRG gene rearrangements in T-ALL patients. The main reason for not obtaining a reproducible sensitivity of < or =10(-4) in approximately 60% of cases was the non-specific amplification of TCRG gene rearrangements in normal T-lymphocytes. A maximal sensitivity of < or =10(-4) (defined by less strict criteria) was obtained in 42% of TCRG gene rearrangements in precursor-B-ALL patients. The number of inserted nucleotides was significantly higher in T-ALL (mean: 8.5) as compared to precursor-B-ALL (mean: 6.8) and appeared to be the most important predictor for reaching a reproducible sensitivity < or =10(-4). The usage of a touchdown PCR or the usage of an ASO reverse primer in combination with Vgamma member forward primers and TaqMan probes did not clearly improve the overall results. Nevertheless, RQ-PCR analysis of TCRG gene rearrangements in follow-up samples obtained from 12 ALL patients showed the applicability of this method for MRD detection. We conclude that RQ-PCR analysis of TCRG gene rearrangements can be used for the detection of MRD, but that sensitivities might be limited due to non-specific amplification. This method is applicable in the majority of T-ALL patients and in almost half of precursor-B-ALL patients, particularly when used as second-choice target for confirmation of the MRD results obtained via the first-choice target.","['van der Velden, V H J', 'Wijkhuijs, J M', 'Jacobs, D C H', 'van Wering, E R', 'van Dongen, J J M']","['van der Velden VH', 'Wijkhuijs JM', 'Jacobs DC', 'van Wering ER', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor gamma', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2002/07/03 10:00,2002/07/20 10:01,['2002/07/03 10:00'],"['2001/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402515 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jul;16(7):1372-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402515.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Isoprenylation of target proteins, like the GTP-binding protein Ras, is essential for their membrane localization and subsequent participation in intracellular signaling cascades. Lovastatin effectively decreased the viability of plasma cells from cell lines (n = 10) and myeloma patients' samples (n = 8) in a dose- and time-dependent way. Importantly, co-incubation of lovastatin with dexamethasone had a synergistic effect in inducing plasma cell cytotoxity. This effect was not the consequence of a change in the protein expression levels of Bcl-2 or Bax induced by lovastatin. The decrease in plasma cell viability was the result of induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation. Mevalonate effectively reversed the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of lovastatin in plasma cells. The cytotoxic activity of lovastatin was higher in Pgp expressing cell lines, but did not correlate with the multidrug resistance (MDR)-related proteins LRP, Bcl-2 and Bax. Lovastatin treatment resulted in a shift of Ras localization from the membrane to the cytosol that was reversed by mevalonate.

Here, four cases of IgDlambda MM were studied to address the question of light chain receptor revision in a 'single cell' model. Detailed analyses of both IGK and IGL alleles of each case were performed by Southern blotting, (RT-) PCR, and sequencing. The expressed IgV genes were extensively mutated and Cmu deletion was confirmed in two cases. In addition, in the four MM a total of six non-functional deletional IGK rearrangements were identified, which proved to be unmutated.

After 4 days of culture, median cell recovery was 10% (range, <1% to 37%) of cell recovery in parallel untreated cultures. Clotrimazole also inhibited recovery of primary ALL cells cultured on stromal feeder layers. After leukemic cells from 16 cases of ALL were cultured for 7 days with 10 microM clotrimazole, median cell recovery was <1% (range, <1% to 16%) of that in parallel untreated cultures. Clotrimazole was active against leukemic cells with genetic abnormalities associated with poor response to therapy and against multidrug-resistant cell lines. In contrast, mature T lymphocytes and bone marrow stromal cells were not affected. Clotrimazole induced depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores in ALL cells, which was followed by apoptosis, as shown by annexin V binding and DNA fragmentation.

Simultaneous exposure (24 h) of myelomonocytic leukemia cells (U937) to SAHA (1 microM) and FP (100 nM), which were minimally toxic alone (1.5 +/- 0.5% and 16.3 +/- 0.5% apoptosis respectively), produced a dramatic increase in cell death (ie 63.2 +/- 1.9% apoptotic), reflected by morphology, procaspase-3 and -8 cleavage, Bid activation, diminished DeltaPsi(m), and enhanced cytochrome c release. FP blocked SAHA-mediated up-regulation of p21(CIP1) and CD11b expression, while inducing caspase-dependent Bcl-2 and pRb cleavage. Similar interactions were observed in HL-60 and Jurkat leukemic cells. Enhanced apoptosis in SAHA/FP-treated cells was accompanied by a marked reduction in clonogenic surivival. Ectopic expression of either dominant-negative caspase-8 (C8-DN) or CrmA partially attenuated SAHA/FP-mediated apoptosis (eg 45 +/- 1.5% and 38.2 +/- 2.0% apoptotic vs 78 +/- 1.5% in controls) and Bid cleavage. SAHA/FP induced-apoptosis was unaffected by the free radical scavenger L-N-acetyl cysteine or the PKC inhibitor GFX. Finally, ectopic Bcl-2 expression marginally attenuated SAHA/FP-related apoptosis/cytochrome c release, and failed to restore clonogenicity in cells exposed to these agents. Together, these findings indicate that SAHA and FP interact synergistically to induce mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in human leukemia cells, and suggest that this process may also involve engagement of the caspase-8-dependent apoptotic cascade.","['Almenara, J', 'Rosato, R', 'Grant, S']","['Almenara J', 'Rosato R', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/pathology', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Vorinostat']",2002/07/03 10:00,2002/07/20 10:01,['2002/07/03 10:00'],"['2001/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402535 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jul;16(7):1331-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402535.,"['CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 83705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrate that mRNA-electroporated DC can efficiently be prepared for cryopreservation. Using an optimized maturation and freezing protocol after mRNA electroporation, we obtained high transgene-expressing viable mature DC. In addition, we showed that these modified cryopreserved DC retain stimulatory capacity in an influenza model system.

In the present study we have analyzed the role of the homeobox gene, HOXB6, in the program of differentiation of the myeloid cell lines, NB4 and HL60. HOXB6 expression is transiently induced during normal granulocytopoiesis and monocytopoiesis, with an initial induction during the early phases of differentiation, followed by a blockade of expression at early maturation. The enforced expression of HOXB6 in promyelocytic NB4 cells or in myeloblastic HL60 cells elicited inhibition of the granulocytic or monocytic maturation, respectively. Furthermore, HOXB6 was frequently expressed (18 out of 49 cases) in AMLs lacking major translocations while it was expressed at very low frequency (two out of 47 cases) in AMLs characterized by PML/RAR-alpha, AML-1/ETO, CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion and rearrangements of the MLL gene at 11q23.

In one pre-B ALL cell line, INC cells, and primary leukemic cells from 16 patients with pre-B ALL, we found the predominant expression of a non-DNA-binding Ikaros isoform, Ik-6. However, Ik-6 was not detected in pre-T ALL cells. All of pre-B ALL cells expressing Ik-6 were CD10(+), whereas CD10(-) pre-B ALL cells did not express Ik-6. The expression of Ik-6 was not related to karyotype abnormalities such as t(9;22) and t(4;11).

Fc receptor expression increased with normal B cell maturation: CD32(+) cells composed 8.1% +/- 1.2% (mean +/- s.d.) of the least mature (CD34(+)CD10(+)), 19.2% +/- 5.7% of intermediate (CD34(-)CD10(+)), and 82.4% +/- 5.0% of mature (CD34(-)CD10(-)) bone marrow CD19(+) B cells. Forty-five of 57 primary B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples and all six cell lines studied expressed Fc receptors. By RT-PCR and antibody staining, FcgammaRIIA was the Fc receptor predominantly expressed in these cells. FcgammaRIIA ligation in RS4;11 and 380 cells induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD32, CD19, CBL, SYK, P13-K p85 and SHIP, as well as RasGAP association with tyrosine-phosphorylated p62(dok). These signalling events resulted in a marked suppression of leukemia cell growth. After a 7-day exposure to anti-CD32, the recovery of ALL cells cocultured with stroma was reduced to 5.5% +/- 2.8% of control values in 380 cells (n = 14), 19.4% +/- 6.1% (n = 8) in RS4;11, and 4.0% +/- 1.3% (n = 6) in KOPN55bi. CD32 ligation also reduced cell recovery in five of seven CD32(+) primary leukemia samples.

The incidence of deletions in CLL patients was 51.5% encompassing a 265 kb region of minimal deletion (RMD) telomeric to markers D13S319. Two CpG islands were identified within the RMD, the telomeric of which is fully methylated whilst the more centromeric is unmethylated. A novel transcript was identified within the RMD that represents an alternative splice version of Leu1. The nine exons of this transcript span a genomic of 436 kb with exon 1 of Leu1 being the common first exon. The remaining exons were shown to be more frequently deleted than Leu1 itself. All splice forms of this transcript were detectable by RT-PCR but Leu1 detected the most abundant message on Northern blotting. Sequence analysis failed to reveal inactivating mutations in patients with heterozygous deletion of 13q14.3, although a polymorphic T to A variant was identified within exon 1 of Leu1 in leukemic and normal controls.

In this review we discuss immunophenotypic characteristics of major genotypic leukemia categories. We describe immunophenotype of: B-lineage ALL with MLL rearrangements, TEL/AML1, BCR/ABL, E2A/PBX1 translocations, hyperdiploidy, and myc fusion genes; T-ALL with SCL gene aberrations and t(5;14) translocation; and AML with AML1/ETO, PML/RARalpha, OTT/MAL and CBFbeta/MYH11 translocations, trisomies 8 or 11 and aberrations of chromosomes 7 and 5. Whereas some genotypes associate with certain immunophenotypic features, others can present with variable immunophenotype. Single molecules (as NG2, CBFbeta/SMMHC and PML/RARalpha proteins) associated with or derived from specific translocations have been described. More often, complex immunophenotype patterns have been related to the genotype categories. Most known associations between immunophenotype and genotype have been defined empirically. Therefore, these associations should be validated in independent patient cohorts before they can be widely used for prescreening of leukemia. Progress in our knowledge on leukemia will show how the molecular-genetic changes modulate the immunophenotype as well as how the expressed protein molecules further modulate cell behavior.","['Hrusak, O', 'Porwit-MacDonald, A']","['Hrusak O', 'Porwit-MacDonald A']","['Institute of Immunology/CLIP, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*genetics/immunology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Genotype', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping/classification', '*Leukemia/classification/genetics/immunology']",2002/07/03 10:00,2002/07/20 10:01,['2002/07/03 10:00'],"['2001/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2001/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402504 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jul;16(7):1233-58. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402504.,,,251,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lack of large families makes it attractive to exploit methods in addition to genetic linkage analysis for the identification of a susceptibility locus. One strategy that can localise regions of the genome that may harbour tumour suppressor genes is to identify regions of chromosomal imbalance using comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) analysis. We examined 24 familial CLL cases by CGH analysis. Losses that are documented as arising frequently in sporadic CLL were observed at a comparable frequency in familial CLL. However, gains and losses in two regions of the X chromosome - Xp11.2-p21 and Xq21-qter - appear more common in familial CLL than in sporadic CLL.

Currently, patients with PDGFRB or ABL fusion genes are candidates for treatment with Imatinib (STI571), but it is likely that alternative strategies will be necessary for the treatment of most other patients.","['Cross, N C P', 'Reiter, A']","['Cross NC', 'Reiter A']","['Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/enzymology/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2002/07/03 10:00,2002/07/20 10:01,['2002/07/03 10:00'],"['2002/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/07/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402556 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jul;16(7):1207-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402556.,,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Adult survivors of childhood leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (N = 5736) and sibling controls (N = 2565) were administered a long-term follow-up questionnaire allowing assessment of symptoms associated with depression and somatic distress. RESULTS: The majority of respondents in this study did not demonstrate symptomatology indicative of depression or somatic distress. Survivors, however, were significantly more likely than sibling controls to report symptoms of depression and somatic distress. Women were significantly more likely to indicate symptoms of depression and somatic distress than were men; however, this difference did not vary by survivor/sibling status. Similarly, socioeconomic (SES) variables predicted symptomatic levels of depression and somatic distress for both survivors and siblings, and these effects did not vary by survivor/sibling status. Among leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors, in addition to gender and SES, the only treatment variable that predicted scores indicating depressive symptomatology was exposure to intensive chemotherapy. Exposure to intensive chemotherapy also predicted scores indicative of somatic distress symptoms. No other medical variables, including diagnostic category, age at diagnosis, time since diagnosis, and duration of treatment, predicted symptomatic scores for depression and somatic distress. CONCLUSIONS: This large, sibling-controlled, multisite study of young adult survivors of childhood leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma found that survivors had significant increased risk for reporting symptoms of depression and somatic distress and that intensive chemotherapy added to this risk. However, being a cancer survivor did not compound the effects of gender and SES variables on the 2 outcomes measured. The ability of SES, gender, and treatment-related variables to predict psychological symptoms in this cohort of childhood survivors and sibling controls calls for future research into varied biological and psychosocial pathways by which cancer influences future psychosocial functioning.","['Zebrack, Brad J', 'Zeltzer, Lonnie K', 'Whitton, John', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Odom, Lorrie', 'Berkow, Roger', 'Robison, Leslie L']","['Zebrack BJ', 'Zeltzer LK', 'Whitton J', 'Mertens AC', 'Odom L', 'Berkow R', 'Robison LL']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California Los Angeles, School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, USA. bzebrack@mednet.ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Attitude to Health', 'Child', 'Depressive Disorder/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Family', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/*psychology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*psychology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Prevalence', 'Sex Factors', 'Somatoform Disorders/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Stress, Psychological/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Survivors/*psychology']",2002/07/03 10:00,2002/08/29 10:01,['2002/07/03 10:00'],"['2002/07/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1542/peds.110.1.42 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatrics. 2002 Jul;110(1 Pt 1):42-52. doi: 10.1542/peds.110.1.42.,"['F32CA89875-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Pediatrics. 2003 Dec;112(6 Pt 1):1454-5; author reply 1454-5.

Critical role of arginine residues.,34424-33,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 encodes a number of ""accessory"" proteins of unclear function; one of these proteins, p13(II), is targeted to mitochondria and disrupts mitochondrial morphology. The present study was undertaken to unravel the function of p13(II) through (i) determination of its submitochondrial localization and sequences required to alter mitochondrial morphology and (ii) an assessment of the biophysical and biological properties of synthetic peptides spanning residues 9-41 (p13(9-41)), which include the amphipathic mitochondrial-targeting sequence of the protein. p13(9-41) folded into an alpha helix in micellar environments. Fractionation and immunogold labeling indicated that full-length p13(II) accumulates in the inner mitochondrial membrane. p13(9-41) induced energy-dependent swelling of isolated mitochondria by increasing inner membrane permeability to small cations (Na(+), K(+)) and released Ca(2+) from Ca(2+)-preloaded mitochondria. These effects as well as the ability of full-length p13(II) to alter mitochondrial morphology in cells required the presence of four arginines, forming the charged face of the targeting signal. The mitochondrial effects of p13(9-41) were insensitive to cyclosporin A, suggesting that full-length p13(II) might alter mitochondrial permeability through a permeability transition pore-independent mechanism, thus distinguishing it from the mitochondrial proteins Vpr and X of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and hepatitis B virus, respectively.","[""D'Agostino, Donna M"", 'Ranzato, Laura', 'Arrigoni, Giorgio', 'Cavallari, Ilaria', 'Belleudi, Francesca', 'Torrisi, Maria Rosaria', 'Silic-Benussi, Micol', 'Ferro, Tiziana', 'Petronilli, Valeria', 'Marin, Oriano', 'Chieco-Bianchi, Luigi', 'Bernardi, Paolo', 'Ciminale, Vincenzo']","[""D'Agostino DM"", 'Ranzato L', 'Arrigoni G', 'Cavallari I', 'Belleudi F', 'Torrisi MR', 'Silic-Benussi M', 'Ferro T', 'Petronilli V', 'Marin O', 'Chieco-Bianchi L', 'Bernardi P', 'Ciminale V']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, University of Padova, via Gattamelata 64, 35128 Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (rof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arginine', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/chemistry/physiology', '*Mitochondrial Swelling', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/physiology', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Retroviridae Proteins/analysis/chemistry/*physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2002/07/03 10:00,2002/12/04 04:00,['2002/07/03 10:00'],"['2002/07/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/03 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M203023200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)74343-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Sep 13;277(37):34424-33. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M203023200.

We show that DRED binds with high affinity to DR1 sites in the human embryonic (epsilon-) and fetal (gamma-) globin gene promoters, but the adult beta-globin promoter has no DR1 element. DRED is a 540 kDa complex; sequence determination showed that it contains the nuclear orphan receptors TR2 and TR4. TR2 and TR4 form a heterodimer that binds to the epsilon and gamma promoter DR1 sites. One mutation in a DR1 site causes elevated gamma-globin transcription in human HPFH (hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin) syndrome, and we show that this mutation reduces TR2/TR4 binding in vitro. The two receptor mRNAs are expressed at all stages of murine and human erythropoiesis; their forced transgenic expression reduces endogenous embryonic epsilony-globin transcription. These data suggest that TR2/TR4 forms the core of a larger DRED complex that represses embryonic and fetal globin transcription in definitive erythroid cells, and therefore that inhibition of its activity might be an attractive intervention point for treating sickle cell anemia.","['Tanabe, Osamu', 'Katsuoka, Fumiki', 'Campbell, Andrew D', 'Song, Weimin', 'Yamamoto, Masayuki', 'Tanimoto, Keiji', 'Engel, James Douglas']","['Tanabe O', 'Katsuoka F', 'Campbell AD', 'Song W', 'Yamamoto M', 'Tanimoto K', 'Engel JD']","['Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Cell Biology, and Robert H.Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208-3500, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (NR2C1 protein, human)', '0 (NR2C2 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nr2c1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nr2c2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 2, Group C, Member 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Dimerization', 'Drug Design', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Fetal Blood/metabolism', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Hemoglobinopathies/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 2, Group C, Member 1', 'Point Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Steroid/chemistry/*physiology', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone/chemistry/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/07/03 10:00,2002/08/16 10:01,['2002/07/03 10:00'],"['2002/07/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/cdf340 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2002 Jul 1;21(13):3434-42. doi: 10.1093/emboj/cdf340.,"['T32 CA079447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA60553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA79447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL024415/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL24415/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC126089,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that intact PML nuclear bodies are not required for the induction of senescence. We have determined further that of seven known PML isoforms, only PML IV is capable of causing premature senescence, providing the first evidence for functional differences among these isoforms. Of interest is the fact that in contrast to PML(+/+) fibroblasts, PML(-/-) cells are resistant to PML IV-induced senescence. This suggests that although PML IV is necessary for this process to occur, it is not sufficient and requires other components for activity. Finally, we provide evidence that PML IV-induced senescence involves stabilization and activation of p53 through phosphorylation at Ser46 and acetylation at Lys382, and that it occurs independently of telomerase and differs from that elicited by oncogenic Ras. Taken together, our data assign a specific pro-senescent activity to an individual PML isoform that involves p53 activation and is independent from PML nuclear bodies.","['Bischof, Oliver', 'Kirsh, Olivier', 'Pearson, Mark', 'Itahana, Koji', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Dejean, Anne']","['Bischof O', 'Kirsh O', 'Pearson M', 'Itahana K', 'Pelicci PG', 'Dejean A']","['Unite de Recombinaison et Expression Genetique, INSERM U 163, Institut Pasteur, 28 rue du Dr Roux, 75724 Paris Cedex 15, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Daxx protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantigens/physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics/*physiology', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasm Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/physiology', 'Organelles/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'SUMO-1 Protein/physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Telomerase/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/chemistry/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/07/03 10:00,2002/08/16 10:01,['2002/07/03 10:00'],"['2002/07/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/cdf341 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2002 Jul 1;21(13):3358-69. doi: 10.1093/emboj/cdf341.,,,,,PMC126090,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Electron microscopy and image reconstruction techniques showed that CA dimers appear to function as organizational subunits of the cage-like, membrane-bound protein arrays. However, new three-dimensional (3D) data also were consistent with hexagonal (p6) assembly models. The p6 3D reconstructions of membrane-bound M-MuLV CA proteins gave unit cells of a = b = 80.3 A, c = 110 A, gamma = 120 degrees, in which six dimer units formed a cage lattice. Neighbor cage hole-to-hole distances were 45 A, while distances between hexagonal cage holes corresponded to unit cell lengths (80.3 A). The hexagonal model predicts two types of cage holes (trimer and hexamer holes), uses symmetric head-to-head dimer building blocks, and permits the introduction of lattice curvature by conversion of hexamer to pentamer units. The M-MuLV CA lattice is similar to those formed in helical tubes by HIV CA in that hexamer units surround cage holes of 25-30 A, but differs in that M-MuLV hexamer units appear to be CA dimers, whereas HIV CA units appear to be monomers. These results suggest that while general assembly principles apply to different retroviruses, clear assembly distinctions exist between these virus types.","['Mayo, Keith', 'McDermott, Jason', 'Barklis, Eric']","['Mayo K', 'McDermott J', 'Barklis E']","['Vollum Institute and Department of Microbiology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201-3098, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Membranes, Artificial)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Capsid/*chemistry', 'Crystallization', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Membranes, Artificial', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry', 'Virus Assembly']",2002/07/03 10:00,2002/08/09 10:01,['2002/07/03 10:00'],"['2002/07/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/03 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682202914522 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.2002.1452 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2002 Jun 20;298(1):30-8. doi: 10.1006/viro.2002.1452.,"['GM 52914/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 60170/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,['(c) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous histamine (1 mg) in 21 healthy subjects and 12 melanoma patients was determined via model-dependent methods. Drug-drug interactions with subcutaneous interleukin-2 (1.1 mg) were evaluated in a combined cohort of patients with melanoma (n = 8) or renal cell carcinoma (n = 4). Histamine dihydrochloride administered over 10 minutes in healthy subjects peaked at 18 minutes (Cmax 38 nmol/L), attained a distribution volume of 59 L, and was eliminated at 6%/min. The results were similar in a 20-minute infusion in melanoma patients. No gender effects were observed (p > 0.05). Interleukin-2 injected either 10 minutes prior to or 10 minutes following histamine dihydrochloride had no effect on histamine kinetics. Histamine dihydrochloride administered 10 minutes prior to injection of interleukin-2 also had no effect on interleukin-2 kinetics. Maximal concentration of interleukin-2 (2,442 pg/ml) occurred at 2.5 hours with an elimination half-life of 1.7 hours, area under the curve (AUC) of 15,746 pg x h/ml, and volume of distribution and plasma clearance of 194 L and 74 L/h, respectively. However, interleukin-2 Cmax (1,758 pg/ml) and AUC (12,448 pg x h/ml) were reduced when histamine dihydrochloride was infused 10 minutes following interleukin-2, likely due to the pharmacodynamic effects of histamine, including increased heart rate and reduced blood pressure.

This translocation creates a fusion protein consisting of the acute myeloid leukemia-1 transcription factor and the eight-twenty-one corepressor (AML1 ETO), which represses transcription through AML1 (RUNX1) DNA binding sites and immortalizes hematopoietic progenitor cells. We have identified the p14(ARF) tumor suppressor, a mediator of the p53 oncogene checkpoint, as a direct transcriptional target of AML1 ETO. AML1 ETO repressed the p14(ARF) promoter and reduced endogenous levels of p14(ARF) expression in multiple cell types. In contrast, AML1 stimulated p14(ARF) expression and induced phenotypes consistent with cellular senescence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that AML1 ETO was specifically bound to the p14(ARF) promoter. In acute myeloid leukemia samples containing the t(8;21), levels of p14(ARF) mRNA were markedly lower when compared with other acute myeloid leukemias lacking this translocation. Repression of p14(ARF) may explain why p53 is not mutated in t(8;21)-containing leukemias and suggests that p14(ARF) is an important tumor suppressor in a large number of human leukemias.","['Linggi, Bryan', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'van de Locht, Louis', 'Hu, Ming', 'Nip, John', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'van der Reijden, Bert', 'Quelle, Dawn E', 'Rowley, Janet D', 'Cleveland, John', 'Jansen, Joop H', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Hiebert, Scott W']","['Linggi B', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'van de Locht L', 'Hu M', 'Nip J', 'Serve H', 'Berdel WE', 'van der Reijden B', 'Quelle DE', 'Rowley JD', 'Cleveland J', 'Jansen JH', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Hiebert SW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Plasmids', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/*genetics']",2002/07/02 10:00,2002/08/06 10:01,['2002/07/02 10:00'],"['2002/07/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/nm726 [doi]', 'nm726 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2002 Jul;8(7):743-50. doi: 10.1038/nm726.

Here we report a novel gene, mina53 (Myc-induced nuclear antigen with a molecular mass of 53 kDa). The mina53 gene encodes a protein with a molecular weight of 53 kDa, which is localized in the nucleus and with part of the protein concentrated in the nucleolus. When serum-starved cells were activated by serum, the level of c-myc mRNA was elevated, and an increase in mina53 mRNA followed the elevation of c-myc mRNA. When expression of c-myc was reduced in human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, the expression of mina53 mRNA and protein was reduced. The expression of mina53 mRNA and Mina53 protein was induced by ectopic introduction of wild type c-Myc but not by a mutant c-Myc lacking the transactivation domain. When c-Myc in the c-MycER chimeric protein was activated, mina53 mRNA was increased, even in the presence of an inhibitor for protein synthesis. E-box sites are present in a region proximal to the transcription initiation sites of the mina53 gene. The gene expression from the mina53 promoter was elevated by c-Myc through E-box sites. c-Myc protein bound to the mina53 promoter region in vivo in HL60 cells in the proliferating phase but not after treatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Specific inhibition of mina53 expression by an RNA interference method severely suppressed cell proliferation. Taken together, these results indicate that mina53 is a direct target gene of Myc, suggesting that mina53 is involved in mammalian cell proliferation.","['Tsuneoka, Makoto', 'Koda, Yoshiro', 'Soejima, Mikiko', 'Teye, Kwesi', 'Kimura, Hiroshi']","['Tsuneoka M', 'Koda Y', 'Soejima M', 'Teye K', 'Kimura H']","['Division of Human Genetics, Department of Forensic Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume 830-0011, Japan. tsuneoka@med.kurume-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (RIOX2 protein, human)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Dioxygenases', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', '*Genes, myc', 'Histone Demethylases', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/07/02 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/07/02 10:00'],"['2002/07/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/07/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M204458200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)36782-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Sep 20;277(38):35450-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M204458200.

In all respects, MUTZ-3 cells behave as the immortalized equivalent of CD34+ DC precursors. Upon stimulation with specific cytokine cocktails, they acquire a phenotype consistent with either interstitial- or Langerhans-like DCs and upon maturation (mDC), express CD83.

The introduction of universal leukocyte depletion (LD) of the United Kingdom blood supply raises the question as to the degree of protection afforded by this procedure against HTLV-I transmission by blood components. HTLV-I viral DNA removal by leukocyte-depleting filters was assessed in units of whole blood and platelets by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and by nested PCR for HTLV-I Tax DNA. We examined HTLV-I removal by LD filters using a model system of blood units containing exogenous spiked HTLV-I-positive MT-2 cells at a relevant concentration and whole blood donations from asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers. T-lymphocyte removal was assessed in parallel by measurement of endogenous subset-specific CD3 mRNA. In the MT-2 model system we observed 3.5 log(10) to 4 log(10) removal of HTLV-I Tax DNA by filtration of whole blood and 2 log(10) to 3 log(10) removal across platelet filters with 13 of 16 whole blood and 8 of 8 platelet units still positive after filtration. Despite 3 log(10) to 4 log(10) viral removal, HTLV-I Tax DNA could be detected after whole blood filtration in asymptomatic carriers with viral loads above 10(8) proviral DNA copies/L. T-lymphocyte removal was also between 3.5 log(10) and 4.5 log(10). HTLV-I provirus removal was incomplete in the model system and in asymptomatic carriers with viral loads greater than 10(8) copies/L.

To determine effector cell characteristics that result in optimal in vivo antileukemic efficacy, we developed an animal model for human CTL therapy. Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/scid) mice were inoculated with either of 2 primary human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), denoted as SK and OF. Anti-SK and anti-OF CTLs were generated in vitro by repeated stimulation of donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells with either SK or OF cells. Both CTL lines displayed HLA-restricted reactivity against the original targets and non-major histocompatibility class (MHC)-restricted cross-reactivity in vitro. The CTLs were administered intravenously weekly for 3 consecutive weeks to mice engrafted with either SK or OF leukemia. In 3 of 8 SK-engrafted and anti-SK-treated mice, complete remissions were achieved in blood, spleen, and bone marrow. In the remaining 5 animals partial remissions were observed. In 4 of 4 OF-engrafted anti-OF-treated mice partial remissions were observed. The antileukemic effect of specific CTLs was exerted immediately after administration and correlated with the degree of HLA disparity of the donor-patient combination. In cross-combination-treated animals, no effect on leukemic progression was observed indicating that in vivo antileukemic reactivity is mediated by MHC-restricted effector cells. The CTLs, however, displayed an impaired in vivo proliferative capacity. Ex vivo analysis showed decreased reactivity as compared to the moment of infusion. We therefore conclude that the model can be used to explore the requirements for optimal in vivo efficacy of in vitro- generated CTLs.","['Nijmeijer, Bart A', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['Nijmeijer BA', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. b.a.nijmeijer@lumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Animal', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Spleen/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/*immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2002/07/02 10:00,2002/08/31 10:01,['2002/07/02 10:00'],"['2002/07/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v100.2.654 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59939-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jul 15;100(2):654-60. doi: 10.1182/blood.v100.2.654.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we examine the effects of IFN-alpha on cultured hairy cells (HCs), taking into account the possible modifying influence of cell adhesion. We make the novel observation that therapeutic concentrations of IFN-alpha kill nonadherent HCs by inducing apoptosis. In keeping with the persistence of HCs in tissues during therapy, such killing was inhibited by integrin-mediated adhesion to vitronectin or fibronectin. Exposure of HCs to IFN-alpha resulted in a marked increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion. Furthermore, blocking antibodies to TNF-RI or TNF-RII protected HCs from IFN-alpha-induced apoptosis, demonstrating that such killing was mediated by TNF-alpha. In the absence of IFN-alpha, exogenous TNF-alpha did not induce HC apoptosis, showing that IFN-alpha sensitized HCs to the proapoptotic effect of autocrine TNF-alpha. This sensitization to TNF-alpha-induced killing was attributable to suppression of IAP (inhibitors of apoptosis) production known to be regulated by the cytoprotective nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent arm of TNF-alpha signaling. Moreover, engagement of the receptors for fibronectin or vitronectin prevented this IFN-alpha-induced down-regulation of IAPs. Understanding of the signals involved in the combined effects of IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha and abrogation of those induced by integrin engagement offers the possibility of sensitizing other malignant cells to IFN-alpha-induced killing and thereby extending the therapeutic use of this cytokine.","['Baker, Peter K', 'Pettitt, Andrew R', 'Slupsky, Joseph R', 'Chen, Hai J', 'Glenn, Mark A', 'Zuzel, Mirko', 'Cawley, John C']","['Baker PK', 'Pettitt AR', 'Slupsky JR', 'Chen HJ', 'Glenn MA', 'Zuzel M', 'Cawley JC']","['Department of Haematology, University of Liverpool, United Kingdom. pbaker@liv.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autocrine Communication/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrins/physiology', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2002/07/02 10:00,2002/08/31 10:01,['2002/07/02 10:00'],"['2002/07/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v100.2.647 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59938-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jul 15;100(2):647-53. doi: 10.1182/blood.v100.2.647.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD34+CD19- cells from the bone marrow of 9 children with TEL/AML1-positive ALL were purified by flow sorting and subjected to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization, and methylcellulose cultures. In 3 of 8 patients analyzed by RT-PCR, no TEL/AML1-positive cells could be detected in the CD34+CD19- cell fraction. Altogether, the percentage of TEL/AML1-positive cells was low: 1.6% (n = 8; SD 2.2%) by nested real-time RT-PCR and 2.5% (n = 5; SD 2.6%) by fluorescence in situ hybridization. This correlated with the percentage of contaminating CD19+ leukemic cells in the CD34+CD19- cell fraction in 6 control sorts (mean 4.6%, SD 3.6%), indicating that the low levels of leukemic cells detected in the CD34+CD19- cell fraction could be attributed to sorter errors. Methylcellulose cultures in 3 patients provided further evidence that CD34+CD19- cells represent a candidate normal cell population. The clonogenicity of the CD34+CD19- cell fraction was similar to normal progenitors, including growth of primitive granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, megakaryocyte colony-forming units. Each of 92 colonies from cultures with CD34+CD19- cells tested negative for TEL/AML1. In conclusion, our data support the hypothesis that the leukemia in TEL/AML1-positive childhood ALL originates in a CD19+ lymphoid progenitor. This has many therapeutic implications, eg, for purging of autologous stem cell products, flow cytometric monitoring of minimal residual disease, and targeting immunotherapy against the leukemic cell clone.","['Hotfilder, Marc', 'Rottgers, Silja', 'Rosemann, Annegret', 'Jurgens, Heribert', 'Harbott, Jochen', 'Vormoor, Josef']","['Hotfilder M', 'Rottgers S', 'Rosemann A', 'Jurgens H', 'Harbott J', 'Vormoor J']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Muenster, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*analysis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2002/07/02 10:00,2002/08/31 10:01,['2002/07/02 10:00'],"['2002/07/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v100.2.640 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59937-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jul 15;100(2):640-6. doi: 10.1182/blood.v100.2.640.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relationship between these markers and clinical disease is not clear, except where a neoplastic cell population can be identified as in myeloma/monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (MGUS). We have used the distinctive phenotype of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells to determine whether low levels of these cells can be identified in individuals with normal complete blood counts. CLL cells were identified by 4-color flow cytometric analysis of CD19/CD5/CD79b/CD20 expression in 910 outpatients over 40 years old. These outpatients were age- and sex-matched to the general population with normal hematologic parameters and no evident history of malignant disease. CLL phenotype cells were detectable in 3.5% of individuals at low level (median, 0.013; range, 0.002- 1.458 x 10(9) cells/L), and represented a minority of B lymphocytes (median, 11%; range, 3%-95%). Monoclonality was demonstrated by immunoglobulin light-chain restriction in all cases with CLL phenotype cells present and confirmed in a subset of cases by consensus-primer IgH-polymerase chain reaction. As in clinical disease, CLL phenotype cells were detected with a higher frequency in men (male-to-female ratio, 1.9:1) and elderly individuals (2.1% of 40- to 59-year-olds versus 5.0% of 60- to 89-year-olds, P =.01). The neoplastic cells were identical to good-prognosis CLL, being CD5+23+20(wk)79b(wk)11a(-)22(wk)sIg(wk)CD38-, and where assessed had a high degree (4.8%-6.6%) of IgH somatic hypermutation. The monoclonal CLL phenotype cells present in otherwise healthy individuals may represent a very early stage of indolent CLL and should be useful in elucidating the mechanisms of leukemogenesis.","['Rawstron, Andy C', 'Green, Michael J', 'Kuzmicki, Anita', 'Kennedy, Ben', 'Fenton, James A L', 'Evans, Paul A S', ""O'Connor, Sheila J M"", 'Richards, Stephen J', 'Morgan, Gareth J', 'Jack, Andrew S', 'Hillmen, Peter']","['Rawstron AC', 'Green MJ', 'Kuzmicki A', 'Kennedy B', 'Fenton JA', 'Evans PA', ""O'Connor SJ"", 'Richards SJ', 'Morgan GJ', 'Jack AS', 'Hillmen P']","['Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, Academic Unit of Haematology and Oncology, Algernon Firth Building, University of Leeds, United Kingdom. andy.rawstron@hmds.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mass Screening/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Sex Factors']",2002/07/02 10:00,2002/08/31 10:01,['2002/07/02 10:00'],"['2002/07/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v100.2.635 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59936-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jul 15;100(2):635-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v100.2.635.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of murine tumors EL-4, LSA, and P815 to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in vitro led to a significant reduction in cell viability and an increase in apoptosis. Exposure of EL-4 tumor cells to the synthetic cannabinoid HU-210 and the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide led to significant induction of apoptosis, whereas exposure to WIN55212 was not effective. Treatment of EL-4 tumor-bearing mice with THC in vivo led to a significant reduction in tumor load, increase in tumor-cell apoptosis, and increase in survival of tumor-bearing mice. Examination of a number of human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, including Jurkat, Molt-4, and Sup-T1, revealed that they expressed CB2 receptors but not CB1. These human tumor cells were also susceptible to apoptosis induced by THC, HU-210, anandamide, and the CB2-selective agonist JWH-015. This effect was mediated at least in part through the CB2 receptors because pretreatment with the CB2 antagonist SR144528 partially reversed the THC-induced apoptosis. Culture of primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells with THC in vitro reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis. Together, the current data demonstrate that CB2 cannabinoid receptors expressed on malignancies of the immune system may serve as potential targets for the induction of apoptosis. Also, because CB2 agonists lack psychotropic effects, they may serve as novel anticancer agents to selectively target and kill tumors of immune origin.","['McKallip, Robert J', 'Lombard, Catherine', 'Fisher, Michael', 'Martin, Billy R', 'Ryu, Seongho', 'Grant, Steven', 'Nagarkatti, Prakash S', 'Nagarkatti, Mitzi']","['McKallip RJ', 'Lombard C', 'Fisher M', 'Martin BR', 'Ryu S', 'Grant S', 'Nagarkatti PS', 'Nagarkatti M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cannabinoids)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Cannabinoid)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '7J8897W37S (Dronabinol)', 'R6VT8U5372 (HU 211)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cannabinoids/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dronabinol/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Receptors, Cannabinoid', 'Receptors, Drug/*agonists/physiology', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2002/07/02 10:00,2002/08/31 10:01,['2002/07/02 10:00'],"['2002/07/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-01-0098 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59935-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jul 15;100(2):627-34. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-01-0098.,"['DA 0114885/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 09098/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared to other acute myeloid leukemias, M7 is characterized by a higher incidence of abnormalities, a higher complexity of karyotypes, and a different distribution of abnormalities among children and adults. Nine cytogenetic groups were identified: normal karyotypes (group 1), patients with Down syndrome (group 2), numerical abnormalities only (group 3), t(1;22)(p13;q13) or OTT-MAL transcript (group 4), t(9;22)(q34;q11) (group 5), 3q21q26 (group 6), -5/del(5q) or -7/del(7q) or both (group 7), i(12)(p10) (group 8), and other structural changes (group 9). Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were exclusively composed of children (except one adult in group 3), whereas groups 5, 6, 7, and 8 were mainly made up of adults. The main clinical and hematologic features of these groups were described. No new recurrent abnormality was identified, but mapping of all breakpoints allowed us to specify several possible hot spots of rearrangement: 17q22-23, 11q14-21, 21q21-22, and 16q21-22-23. Although 90.5% of cases had no documented antecedent hematologic disorder or exposure to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, the morphologic and the cytogenetic findings indicated that M7 might be a secondary leukemia more often than suggested by preceding history, particularly among adults. The concurrent analyses of morphologic and cytogenetic data also led us to assume that the initial precursor involved might be more immature in adult than in childhood M7.","['Dastugue, Nicole', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, Marina', 'Pages, Marie-Pierre', 'Radford, Isabelle', 'Bastard, Christian', 'Talmant, Pascaline', 'Mozziconacci, Marie Joelle', 'Leonard, Claude', 'Bilhou-Nabera, Christelle', 'Cabrol, Christine', 'Capodano, Anne-Marie', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre, Pascale', 'Lessard, Michel', 'Mugneret, Francine', 'Perot, Christine', 'Taviaux, Sylvie', 'Fenneteaux, Odile', 'Duchayne, Eliane', 'Berger, Roland']","['Dastugue N', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M', 'Pages MP', 'Radford I', 'Bastard C', 'Talmant P', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'Leonard C', 'Bilhou-Nabera C', 'Cabrol C', 'Capodano AM', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre P', 'Lessard M', 'Mugneret F', 'Perot C', 'Taviaux S', 'Fenneteaux O', 'Duchayne E', 'Berger R']","['Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU), Toulouse, France. dastugue.n@chu-toulouse.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Retrospective Studies']",2002/07/02 10:00,2002/08/31 10:01,['2002/07/02 10:00'],"['2002/07/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2001-12-0241 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59934-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jul 15;100(2):618-26. doi: 10.1182/blood-2001-12-0241.,,['Blood. 2002 Nov 15;100(10):3838; author reply 3838-9.

In patients with myeloma, shed syndecan-1 accumulates in the bone marrow, and high levels of syndecan-1 in the serum are an indicator of poor prognosis. To test the effect of soluble syndecan-1 on tumor cell growth and dissemination, ARH-77 B-lymphoid cells were engineered to produce a soluble form of syndecan-1. Controls included vector only (neo)-transfected cells and cells transfected with full-length syndecan-1 complementary DNA that codes for the cell surface form of syndecan-1. Assays reveal that all 3 transfectants have similar growth rates in vitro, but cells expressing soluble syndecan-1 are hyperinvasive in collagen gels relative to controls. When injected into the marrow of human bones that were implanted in severe combined immunodeficient mice, tumors formed by cells expressing soluble syndecan-1 grow faster than tumors formed by neo-transfected cells or by cells expressing cell surface syndecan-1. In addition, cells bearing cell surface syndecan-1 exhibit a diminished capacity to establish tumors within the mice as compared with both neo- and soluble syndecan-1-transfected cells. Tumor cell dissemination to a contralateral human bone is detected significantly more often in the tumors producing soluble syndecan-1 than in controls.

The FR-beta in peripheral blood granulocytes was unable to bind folate and appeared to have a variant GPI membrane anchor, evident from its insensitivity to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C but not nitrous acid. Granulocyte FR-beta lacked mutations, and neither deglycosylation nor detergent solubilization restored folate binding. The posttranslational modification causing its nonfunctionality was evidently absent in FR-beta from AML cells from patient marrow, which bound folate. From flow cytometric analysis of 78 AML bone marrow specimens of different subtypes, 68% expressed FR-beta, most of which were also CD34+. In model cell lines that are FR - (KG-1a, L1210, and Chinese hamster ovary [CHO]) or FR + (KG-1, L1210 JF, and recombinant CHO-FR-beta), selective FR-mediated binding and cytotoxicity was obtained using folate-coated liposomes encapsulating fluorescent calcein (f-L-calcein) and doxorubicin (f-L-DOX), respectively, which could be blocked by 1 mM free folic acid. In the FR-beta-expressing KG-1 human AML cells, treatment with ATRA further increased this specificity.

Because the HLA-mismatched transplants are often T-cell depleted, leukemia relapse rates are high. Treatment of relapsed leukemia after HLA-mismatched SCT is difficult. A novel potential strategy to treat relapsed leukemia after HLA-mismatched SCT is the use of patients' mismatched HLA molecules as antigen-presenting molecules to generate hematopoietic system-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) from the stem cell donor. Adoptive transfer of these hematopoietic system-specific CTLs that are restricted by nonself HLA molecules may eliminate leukemia without affecting the patient's nonhematopoietic cells or donor hematopoietic cells. We investigated the feasibility of this strategy using the hematopoietic system-specific minor histocompatibility antigen HA-1, which is known to induce HLA-A2-restricted CTLs. HLA-A2(-) peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with HLA-A2(+) T2 cells pulsed with synthetic HA-1 peptide or with dendritic cells transduced with the HA-1 cDNA. Tetrameric HLA-A2/HA-1 peptide complexes were used to monitor and enrich HA-1-specific CTLs. In the alloreactive cultures, HA-1-specific CTLs were enriched up to 7% by 3 rounds of antigen-specific stimulations and up to 87% by fluorescence-activated cell sorting of tetramer-positive T cells. The HA-1-specific CTLs showed specific lysis of the relevant target cells, including leukemic cells. Because the polyclonal CTL cultures also contained natural killer cells and allo-HLA-A2-specific CTLs, CTL clones were generated that showed the expected HA-1 specificity only. Thus, HA-1-specific CTLs restricted by nonself HLA-A2 molecules can be generated in an HLA-A2-mismatched setting.","['Mutis, Tuna', 'Blokland, Els', 'Kester, Michel', 'Schrama, Ellen', 'Goulmy, Els']","['Mutis T', 'Blokland E', 'Kester M', 'Schrama E', 'Goulmy E']","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands. t.mutis@lumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HA-1 antigen)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)']",IM,"['Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Clone Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Oligopeptides/*immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'Salvage Therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/*immunology']",2002/07/02 10:00,2002/08/31 10:01,['2002/07/02 10:00'],"['2002/07/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-01-0024 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59925-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jul 15;100(2):547-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-01-0024.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, ectopic activation of the tal-1 gene during T lymphopoiesis occurs in numerous cases of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With the use of transgenic mice, we show that, in adult hematopoiesis, constitutive expression of TAL-1 protein causes disorders in the hematopoietic lineages that normally switch off tal-1 gene expression during their differentiation process. Myelopoiesis was characterized by a moderate increase of myeloid precursors and by Sca-1 antigen persistence. Although no lymphoid leukemia was observed, T lymphopoiesis and B lymphopoiesis were severely impaired. Transgenic mice showed reduced thymic cellularity together with a decrease in double-positive cells and a concurrent increase in the single-positive population. B cells exhibited a differentiation defect characterized by a reduction of the B-cell compartment most likely because of a differentiation block upstream of the intermediate pro-B progenitor. B cells escaping this defect developed normally, but transgenic splenocytes presented a defect in immunoglobulin class switch recombination. Altogether, these results enlighten the fine-tuning of TAL-1 expression during adult hematopoiesis and indicate why TAL-1 expression has to be switched off in the lymphoid lineages.","['Goardon, Nicolas', 'Schuh, Annette', 'Hajar, Iman', 'Ma, Xiaoqian', 'Jouault, Helene', 'Dzierzak, Elaine', 'Romeo, Paul-Henri', 'Maouche-Chretien, Leila']","['Goardon N', 'Schuh A', 'Hajar I', 'Ma X', 'Jouault H', 'Dzierzak E', 'Romeo PH', 'Maouche-Chretien L']","[""Institut Cochin, Departement d'Hematologie, INSERM, CNRS, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ly6a protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching/drug effects', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/etiology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors']",2002/07/02 10:00,2002/08/31 10:01,['2002/07/02 10:00'],"['2002/07/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v100.2.491 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59918-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jul 15;100(2):491-500. doi: 10.1182/blood.v100.2.491.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five of 19 patients developed cytopenias requiring treatment interruption and/or dose reduction, but all were able to continue in CHR on study. In contrast to interferon-alfa treatment, imatinib mesylate-treated CML patients achieved not only CHR but complete morphologic marrow response. Normalization of marrow lagged behind PB response; however, by 8 months, all marrows showed normal or reduced cellularity without morphologic evidence of CML. Eighteen of 19 patients continued in CHR and morphologic marrow remission at 14 months; 1 patient relapsed with chronic phase CML. Although hematologic and marrow responses were uniform, cytogenetic responses were variable. Complete cytogenetic responses occurred in 6 patients, with 4 also in remission by fluorescent in situ hybridization and/or reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Six of 19 had partial and 7 of 19 no cytogenetic response.

Presenting features and outcomes of those children were compared with those of 960 patients with de novo MDS (62 patients) or AML (898 patients). Children with tMDS/tAML were older at presentation (P =.015), had lower white blood cell counts (P =.01), and were more likely to have MDS (21% vs 7%) (P =.02) and trisomy 8 (P =.06).

Disease-free survival after achieving remission was similar (45% vs 53%, P =.868). Children with tMDS/tAML who received intensive-timing induction had better outcomes than those who received standard-timing induction (overall survival 32% vs 0%, P =.54). In this study, the latency period to development of tMDS/tAML was the same for presumed alkylator-induced as for topoisomerase-induced myeloid leukemia. The findings of this study confirm that most children with tMDS/tAML have disease resistant to current therapies. Standard-timing induction appears less effective for this population.","['Barnard, Dorothy R', 'Lange, Beverley', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Buckley, Jonathan', 'Kobrinsky, J Nathan', 'Gold, Stuart', 'Neudorf, Steven', 'Sanders, Jean', 'Burden, Laura', 'Woods, William G']","['Barnard DR', 'Lange B', 'Alonzo TA', 'Buckley J', 'Kobrinsky JN', 'Gold S', 'Neudorf S', 'Sanders J', 'Burden L', 'Woods WG']","['Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS. dorothy.barnard@iwk.nshealth.ca']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertrophy', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/drug therapy/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/07/02 10:00,2002/08/31 10:01,['2002/07/02 10:00'],"['2002/07/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v100.2.427 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59910-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jul 15;100(2):427-34. doi: 10.1182/blood.v100.2.427.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, cGVHD is also associated with fewer relapses. We sought to determine whether severity of cGVHD predicts the magnitude of these effects. One impediment to such an analysis is the current limited/extensive grading system for cGVHD because this classification was designed to identify patients likely to benefit from systemic immune suppression and does not capture the severity of multiorgan involvement. We, therefore, first developed a grading system predictive for survival by using data from 1827 HLA-matched sibling allotransplant recipients reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR). We found Karnofsky performance score, diarrhea, weight loss, and cutaneous and oral involvement to be independent prognostic variables, from which we generated a grading scheme. We tested this scheme, the limited/extensive classification system, and a classification based on clinical impression of overall cGVHD severity (mild/moderate/severe) in parallel analyses of 1092 HLA-matched sibling transplant recipients from the IBMTR and 553 recipients of unrelated donor marrow from the National Marrow Donor Program. Presence of cGVHD was associated with fewer relapses (relative risk [RR], 0.5-0.6) but more treatment-related mortality (RR, 1.8-2.8) in the 3 analyses. No grading scheme correlated cGVHD severity with relapse rates, but all schemes predicted treatment-related mortality.

Additional infusions were given to 62%, 20%, and 5% of patients in groups A, B, and C, respectively. A lower ICD was associated with less graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; A, 26%; B, 53%; C, 62%; P <.001), less myelosuppression (A, 10%; B, 23%; C, 24%; P =.01), and similar response rate (A, 78%; B, 73%; C, 70%; P =.48). Nonadjusted estimates of 3-year survival, failure-free survival, and DLI-related mortality were 84%, 66%, and 5% respectively, in group A; 63%, 57%, and 20% in group B; and 58%, 45%, and 22% in group C. Outcome analysis was adjusted for patient age, donor type, sex of donor, sex mismatch, disease phase at transplantation, T-cell depletion, interval from transplantation to DLI, GVHD prior to relapse, relapse type, and date of DLI. After adjustment, lower ICD was associated with less GVHD, less myelosuppression, same response rate, better survival, better failure-free survival, and less DLI-related mortality. Our results suggest that the first DLI dose should not exceed 0.2 x 10(8) mononuclear cells/kg.","['Guglielmi, Cesare', 'Arcese, William', 'Dazzi, Francesco', 'Brand, Ronald', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Verdonck, Leo F', 'Schattenberg, Anton', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Devergie, Agnes', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Gomez, Marta', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Elmaagacli, Ahmet', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Apperley, Jane', 'Niederwieser, Dietger']","['Guglielmi C', 'Arcese W', 'Dazzi F', 'Brand R', 'Bunjes D', 'Verdonck LF', 'Schattenberg A', 'Kolb HJ', 'Ljungman P', 'Devergie A', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Gomez M', 'Michallet M', 'Elmaagacli A', 'Gratwohl A', 'Apperley J', 'Niederwieser D']","['Universita La Sapienza, Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Unita TMO Allogenico Giuseppe Papa, Rome, Italy. guglielmi@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Transfusion, Autologous', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*methods/mortality', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/07/02 10:00,2002/08/31 10:01,['2002/07/02 10:00'],"['2002/07/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v100.2.397 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59906-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Jul 15;100(2):397-405. doi: 10.1182/blood.v100.2.397.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We postulate that these adverse health effects are related to proinflammatory mediators produced in the lung and released into the circulation where they initiate a systemic inflammatory response. The present study was designed to determine if alveolar macrophages (AMs) and primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) interact to amplify the production of certain cytokines when exposed to ambient PM(10) (EHC-93). Candidate cytokines were measured at the mRNA level using a RNase protection assay and at the protein level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). When AM/HBEC cocultures were exposed to 100 microg/ml of PM(10), levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), and IL-8 mRNA increased within 2 h (P < 0.05) and 8 h following exposure compared with control cells. GM-CSF mRNA expression was more rapidly induced in cocultured cells compared with HBECs or AMs alone. The concentrations of TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 in the cocultured supernatants collected after 24 h PM(10) exposure increased significantly compared with control cells. There was a significant synergistic effect between AMs and HBECs in the production of GM-CSF and of IL-6 (P < 0.05). Instillation of supernatants from HBECs cultured with PM(10) into lungs of rabbits failed to increase circulating band cell counts or stimulate the bone marrow. However, those from AM/HBEC cocultures exposed to PM(10) increased circulating band cell counts (P < 0.05) and shortened the transit time of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) through the bone marrow compared with control co-cultures (P < 0.01). These results suggest that the interaction between AMs and HBECs during PM(10) exposure contributes to the production of mediators that induce a systemic inflammatory response.","['Fujii, Takeshi', 'Hayashi, Shizu', 'Hogg, James C', 'Mukae, Hiroshi', 'Suwa, Tatsushi', 'Goto, Yukinobu', 'Vincent, Renaud', 'van Eeden, Stephan F']","['Fujii T', 'Hayashi S', 'Hogg JC', 'Mukae H', 'Suwa T', 'Goto Y', 'Vincent R', 'van Eeden SF']","['McDonald Research Laboratory and iCAPTURE Centre, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*physiology', 'Bronchi/cytology', 'Cell Communication/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Neutrophils/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Particle Size', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rabbits']",2002/07/02 10:00,2002/09/12 10:01,['2002/07/02 10:00'],"['2002/07/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1165/ajrcmb.27.1.4787 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2002 Jul;27(1):34-41. doi: 10.1165/ajrcmb.27.1.4787.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This prompted us to investigate the role of Campath-1H as treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in whom fludarabine (FAMP) had produced a marked disease debulking with persistence of bone marrow (BM) infiltration or a complete remission (CR) without the disappearance of the molecular aberration (IgH monoclonal expression). As intravenous Campath-1H is almost invariably associated with reactions, sometimes of WHO grade 3-4, we adopted the subcutaneous route of administration, which proved to induce rare and mild adverse reactions but had comparable efficacy. DESIGN AND METHODS. Nine patients (7 males, 2 females) with a median age of 55 years (range 41-61) who responded to FAMP (1 had a CR, 5 a nodular partial remission [PRN], and 3 a partial remission [PR]), according to NCI Working Group Criteria, received subcutaneous Campath-1H, three times a week for 6 weeks in escalating doses up to 10 mg. Monoclonal rearrangement of IgH was present in all patients before immunotherapy. Patients received acyclovir and cotrimoxazole as infection prophylaxis. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), at the dosage of 5-10 microg/kg/die, or intermediate-dose Ara-C (800 mg/m(2)/q 12h x 6 doses), was administered to obtain peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization. RESULTS: All patients were evaluable for response. Five patients, 2 in PR and 3 in PRN after FAMP treatment, reached a CR. Three patients, one in PR, one in PRN and one in CR, converted to a molecular remission. In four out of seven patients PBSC harvesting was successful; more than 2.5 x 10(6) cells/kg were collected from all these patients. Collection was polyclonal for IgH gene rearrangement in three cases. One patient has been transplanted after cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation as conditioning regimen, without complications and with rapid hemopoietic engraftment. All patients were evaluable for toxicity. A WHO grade 1-2 skin reaction was observed in 5 patients at the site of injection. No infectious episodes were recorded. Two out of three patients presenting cytomegalovirus reactivation, without pneumonia, were successfully treated with oral gancyclovir. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous Campath-1H administered to CLL patients with residual BM disease after FAMP proved to be safe and effective. Of nine patients, three obtained a molecular CR and five converted into a morphologic and immunophenotypic CR. In four of seven patients submitted to PBSC mobilization, this treatment also allowed a harvest uncontaminated by CD5/CD19 double-positive CLL cells, which was polyclonal for IgH gene rearrangement in three cases.","['Montillo, Marco', 'Cafro, Anna Maria', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra', 'Brando, Bruno', 'Oreste, Pierluigi', 'Veronese, Silvio', 'Rossi, Valentina', 'Cairoli, Roberto', 'Pungolino, Ester', 'Morra, Enrica']","['Montillo M', 'Cafro AM', 'Tedeschi A', 'Brando B', 'Oreste P', 'Veronese S', 'Rossi V', 'Cairoli R', 'Pungolino E', 'Morra E']","[""Divisione di Ematologia, Dipartmento di Ematologia, Ospedale Niguarda Ca' Granda, piazza Ospedale Maggiore 3, 20162 Milan, Italy. ematologia@ospedale-niguarda.it""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/drug therapy', 'Therapeutic Equivalency', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",2002/07/02 10:00,2003/07/15 05:00,['2002/07/02 10:00'],"['2002/07/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/15 05:00 [medline]', '2002/07/02 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Jul;87(7):695-700; discussion 700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A similar bcr-abl transcript has also been described by others. DESIGN AND METHODS: Sequence analysis of the fusion region showed a join between part of exon e8 of the bcr gene and an intronic sequence of abl intron 1b spliced on exon a2 of the abl gene, giving rise to an in-frame e8-int-a2 bcr-abl transcript, translated into a 197.5 kDa BCR-ABL protein of 1804 amino acid residues, which we named p200 BCR-ABL. RESULTS: In this work, employing protein comparison analysis (pFAM) we show that these novel bcr-abl transcripts retain the DBL homology (DH) domain and the recently recognized CDC24 homology domain, but not the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of the bcr gene. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This observation, along with the myeloid immunophenotype of the tumor and, at least in one case, the patient's correspondingly good response to alpha-interferon therapy, suggests that p200 BCR-ABL is more similar to p210 BCR-ABL, in which the DH, CDC24 and PH domains are all maintained, than to p185, in which these domains are all lost.","['Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Amabile, Marilina', 'Giannini, Barbara', 'Terragna, Carolina', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Baccarani, Michele']","['Martinelli G', 'Amabile M', 'Giannini B', 'Terragna C', 'Ottaviani E', 'Soverini S', 'Saglio G', 'Rosti G', 'Baccarani M']","['Molecular Biology Unit, Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology L. e A.

In a DNA synthesis assay, OSM reduced tritiated thymidine incorporation by 53% in Calu-1 lung carcinoma cells. Radiolabeled cDNAs from untreated Calu-1 cells and 30-h OSM-treated cells were used to probe duplicate nylon membrane cDNA expression arrays. This study revealed OSM-mediated expression of mRNAs encoding tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Northern blot analysis showed that the steady-state level of tPA mRNA is nearly undetectable in Calu-1 cells. Exposure of these cells to OSM for 30 h increased tPA mRNA expression by 20-fold and PAI-1 mRNA expression by 5-fold. Exposure of these cells to other gp130 receptor family cytokines, including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-11, do not significantly affect DNA synthesis or induction of tPA/PAI-1. Western blot studies demonstrated that OSM mediates a marked increase in secretion of the tPA protein. Secreted tPA was present in the conditioned medium almost exclusively as tPA/PAI-1 complexes. Inhibitor studies demonstrated that OSM-mediated induction of tPA and PAI-1 mRNAs is largely dependent upon activation of the MEK1/2 pathway.

LBR- and LBR-D 160 bound to HA only after phorbol ester (PMA) activation, while LBR-V160 failed to bind HA even after PMA treatment. Histopathological analysis disclosed that LBR-V160 was less invasive than LBR- and LBR-D160 cell lines. In vitro growth of cell lines analyzed by sulforhodamine-B uptake showed that doubling time for the three lines was 10.24 h (LBR-), 16.75 h (LBR-V160) and 16.29 h (LBR-D160). Mortality rate was determined after i.p. injection of 10(4) cells. Mice inoculated with LBR- died at 23 2.11) days, while those inoculated with LBR-V160 or LBR-D160 died at 41 (+/- 9.53) or 41 (+/- 4.96) days, respectively. Our results demonstrated that leukemic murine T cells cultured in the long-term presence of VCR or DOX not only presented changes in the resistance phenotype but also variations in their growth and metastatic pattern.","['Lopes, Eloisi C', 'Ernst, Glenda', 'Aulicino, Paula', 'Vanzulli, Silvia', 'Garcia, Mariana', 'Alvarez, Elida', 'Hajos, Silvia E']","['Lopes EC', 'Ernst G', 'Aulicino P', 'Vanzulli S', 'Garcia M', 'Alvarez E', 'Hajos SE']","['Catedra de Inmunologia, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquimica, Universidad de Buenos Aires, IDEHU-CONICET, Argentina. meclopes@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Clin Exp Metastasis,Clinical & experimental metastasis,8409970,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/metabolism', 'Hyaluronic Acid/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/physiology', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",2002/07/02 10:00,2002/07/20 10:01,['2002/07/02 10:00'],"['2002/07/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/07/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1015548706673 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Metastasis. 2002;19(4):283-90. doi: 10.1023/a:1015548706673.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the bone and joint pains are due to neoplastic infiltration, radiologically obvious as metaphyseal clear stripes, parietal enlargement, periosteal reaction, osteolysis and diffuse osteoporosis in the long bone. In Malignant Lymphomas (ML) the bone involvement is rarer, usually bone metastases identifiable with Tc scintigraphy being the cause. In Neuroblastoma (Nbl) cases, bone metastases are commonly associated with abdominal tumor beyond one year of age. Of the total ALL, AML, ML and Nbl cases treated in our Oncology Dept, we selected 43 children with osteoarticular involvement. The sex ratio was 24 boys to 19 girls and the specific malignancy was ALL in 25 cases, AML in 5 cases, ML in 2 cases and Nbl in 10 cases. The following biological parameters were monitored: type of onset, the localization and nature of the bone affectation, differential diagnosis, and the response to therapy. The presence of the osteoarticular involvement has proved to be of no prognostic significance. The spectrum of clinical manifestations varied from mild pain to severe disability, in 7% of the cases being the unique symptoms. The type of lesion did not rise important differential diagnosis issues, excepting the cases with unique osteolytic lesion or diffuse osteoporosis, where the rest of the data and the elevated urine vanilmandelic acid helped to establishing the diagnosis. We conclude that the osteoarticular involvement encountered in different malignancies in children is a major sources of diagnostic problems, but it is not associated with a significant outcome.","['Brumariu, O', 'Miron, I', 'Cernahoschi, I', 'Maimescu, L', 'Bradatan, L', 'Vlad, A', 'Maxim, E']","['Brumariu O', 'Miron I', 'Cernahoschi I', 'Maimescu L', 'Bradatan L', 'Vlad A', 'Maxim E']","['Clinica a IV-a Pediatrie, Facultatea de Medicina, Universitatea de Medicina si Farmacie Gr.T.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with leukemia or lymphoma were escalated in separate strata. Stratum I consisted of 11 patients, median age of 47 years (range, 18 to 68 years), with relapsed or refractory leukemia. Stratum II contained nine patients, median age of 48 years (range, 39 to 68 years), who had refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients received irinotecan at 40 mg/m(2) daily for 3 days, beginning just before the first dose of gemcitabine. Gemcitabine was given at 10 mg/m(2)/min, with the total duration adjusted following a modified continuous reassessment model. RESULTS: Severe myelosuppression and stomatitis/esophagitis were the most serious hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities. Several patients developed febrile neutropenia, nausea, or vomiting. In both strata, the maximum recommended duration of infusion of gemcitabine was 12 hours delivered at 10 mg/m(2)/min (7,200 mg/m(2)). The overall response rate for one cycle of this therapy in this phase I trial for patients with leukemia was 18% (95% confidence interval, 8% to 45%), and for those with lymphoma, 33% (95% confidence interval, 17% to 66%). CONCLUSION: A prolonged infusion of gemcitabine at 10 mg/m(2)/min for 12 hours with 3 days of irinotecan at 40 mg/m(2)/d is a tolerable induction regimen for patients with acute leukemia or lymphoma. Stomatitis/esophagitis should be anticipated; however, this regimen may induce responses in patients with difficult-to-treat hematologic malignancies.","['Bass, Adam J', 'Gockerman, Jon P', 'Hammett, Eve', 'DeCastro, Carlos M', 'Adams, David J', 'Rosner, Gary L', 'Payne, Nancy', 'Davis, Patti', 'Foster, Traci', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Rizzieri, David A']","['Bass AJ', 'Gockerman JP', 'Hammett E', 'DeCastro CM', 'Adams DJ', 'Rosner GL', 'Payne N', 'Davis P', 'Foster T', 'Moore JO', 'Rizzieri DA']","['Division of Medical Oncology and Transplantation, Duke University Medical Center, and the Duke Oncology Consortium, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Camptothecin/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Esophagitis/chemically induced', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Irinotecan', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Recurrence', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vomiting/chemically induced']",2002/06/29 10:00,2002/07/16 10:01,['2002/06/29 10:00'],"['2002/06/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2002.08.166 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Jul 1;20(13):2995-3000. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.08.166.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the adult height of patients who had received GH and estimated their risk of leukemia relapse or development of a second malignancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 910 patients treated for ALL at a single institution, 47 had received GH replacement therapy. The linear growth of these 47 patients was retrospectively evaluated. Their risk of leukemia relapse or second malignancy was compared with that of survivors who did not undergo GH therapy. RESULTS: The median height SD score at the start of GH therapy had decreased by 1.0 since the time of diagnosis of ALL. After a median duration of 4.5 years of GH therapy, adult height SD scores improved and approached height SD scores at the time of diagnosis of ALL. The median adult height for male patients was 173.2 cm (range, 157 to 191.9 cm), and for female patients, it was 158.1 cm (range, 141 to 168 cm). None of the patients developed adverse effects requiring discontinuation of GH treatment. At the 7-year and 11-year landmarks in continuous hematologic remission, there was no statistical evidence that GH therapy was associated with leukemia relapse or development of a second malignancy. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that GH replacement therapy is safe and efficacious for the correction of GH deficiency in survivors of childhood ALL.","['Leung, Wing', 'Rose, Susan R', 'Zhou, Yinmei', 'Hancock, Michael L', 'Burstein, Stephen', 'Schriock, Elizabeth A', 'Lustig, Robert', 'Danish, Robert K', 'Evans, William E', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Leung W', 'Rose SR', 'Zhou Y', 'Hancock ML', 'Burstein S', 'Schriock EA', 'Lustig R', 'Danish RK', 'Evans WE', 'Hudson MM', 'Pui CH']","[""After Completion of Therapy Program and the Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. wing.leung@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Height/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Human Growth Hormone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*deficiency/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tennessee/epidemiology']",2002/06/29 10:00,2002/07/16 10:01,['2002/06/29 10:00'],"['2002/06/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2002.09.142 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Jul 1;20(13):2959-64. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.09.142.,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01-RR00211/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study utilizes a rat ovarian organ culture system to investigate the role of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in this process. Four-day-old rat ovaries were cultured and the degree of primordial to primary follicle transition measured. Insulin increased the primordial to primary follicle transition 30% over control with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) between 2.5 and 5 ng/ml. IGF-1 did not cause an increase in the primordial to primary follicle transition at concentrations up to 100 ng/ml. Ovaries were also treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and neither had an effect on the primordial to primary follicle transition. Ovaries were treated with insulin in conjunction with other factors known to promote the primordial to primary follicle transition in order to discern any potential synergistic effects. Previous experiments have shown that kit ligand (KL), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) promote the primordial to primary follicle transition. Insulin was shown to have an additive effect with KL and LIF, but not bFGF. The fact that insulin can influence the primordial to primary follicle transition at low concentrations (i.e. 5 ng/ml) and that IGF-1 has no effect suggests that insulin is acting at the insulin receptor, not the IGF-1 receptor. The observation that insulin has an additive effect with KL and LIF, but not bFGF, suggests the insulin's site of action is likely the oocyte. In summary, observations suggest that insulin acts as an endocrine type factor to help coordinate primordial to primary follicle transition at the level of the oocyte. The significance of the observations in relation to diabetes and female infertility is discussed.","['Kezele, Phillip R', 'Nilsson, Eric E', 'Skinner, Michael K']","['Kezele PR', 'Nilsson EE', 'Skinner MK']","['Center for Reproductive Biology, School of Molecular Biosciences, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164-4231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Insulin/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Oocytes/drug effects', 'Ovarian Follicle/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Stimulation, Chemical']",2002/06/29 10:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2002/06/29 10:00'],"['2002/06/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/29 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0303720702001144 [pii]', '10.1016/s0303-7207(02)00114-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2002 Jun 28;192(1-2):37-43. doi: 10.1016/s0303-7207(02)00114-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using this model, we have established growth conditions for HL-60, HUVEC, Ishikawa, KB, KB-V1, LNCaP, Lu1, MCF-7, Mel2, P-388, and SW626 cells implanted at the intraperitoneal (i.p.) and subcutaneous (s.c.) compartments of athymic mice. Five cytotoxic natural product isolates (2-6) were tested in this model, along with paclitaxel (taxol) (1). Among the compounds tested, dioscin (2) and 13-methoxy-15-oxozoapatlin (3) were found to be active, indicating their potential to function as cancer chemotherapeutic agents. On the other hand, ochraceolide A (4), alpha-lapachone (5), and 2-(1-hydroxyethyl)naphtha[2,3-b]furan-4,9-quinone (6), all of which were significantly cytotoxic to cultured mammalian cells, did not mediate significant responses with the hollow fiber model. In further xenograft studies using KB cells implanted at the subcutaneous site, compound 3 mediated a statistically significant response which was consistent with the response observed at the subcutaneous compartment in the hollow fiber tests. In sum, these studies illustrate the usefulness of the hollow fiber model in natural product drug discovery programs.

The cytotoxicity of hCPT was not sensitive to the MDR status in K562 cell lines. However, its cytotoxicity was altered by MRP1, but not Pgp, in naturally MRP1-expressing HT29 cells, and etoposide- and doxorubicin-resistant MCF7/VP and MCF7/DOX cells, respectively. These cells were sensitized to hCPT in presence of MK571, probenecid but not verapamil. These results led to consider hCPT as a substrate for MRP1 and a potential modulator of MRP1 activity. The relationship between the cytotoxic effect of anthracyclines and their nuclear localization had been previously demonstrated. We show that MRPI mediated the daunorubicin (DNR) efflux in MCF7/VP and MCF7/DOX cells. The combination of sub-toxic doses of hCPT with DNR resulted in the potentiation of DNR activity, well-correlated with an increase in its nuclear accumulation in MCF7/VP cells. Simultaneous pattern was shown to provide higher cytotoxic response than sequential one. In agreement, hCPT increased also the DNR nuclear accumulation in low MRP1-expressing MCF7/DOX cells. However, the enhancement of cytotoxicity in the DNR-hCPT combination was poorly correlated with the nuclear concentration of DNR in MCF7/DOX cells. In addition to the increase in DNR accumulation, the potentiation of DNR activity by hCPT in MCF7/DOX cells implied a synergistic mechanism between both drugs. These data suggest that the present topoisomerase I/II inhibitors combination may be of clinical interest to overcome MDR phenotype in DNR-treated breast cancer patients.","['Chauvier, David', 'Morjani, Hamid', 'Manfait, Michel']","['Chauvier D', 'Morjani H', 'Manfait M']","['Unite Median, CNRS FRE2141, UFR Pharmacie, IFR53, Reims, France. michel.manfait@univ-riems.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'CW4115HGT9 (homocamptothecin)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Camptothecin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Carcinoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/06/29 10:00,2003/01/23 04:00,['2002/06/29 10:00'],"['2002/06/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/23 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1015244604336 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2002 May;73(2):113-25. doi: 10.1023/a:1015244604336.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, long-term treatment with Interferon alpha can produce or exacerbate immune-mediated complications (IMC). The purpose of this study was to analyze the experience with IMC in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) undergoing IFNalpha treatment. The occurrence of IMC was evaluated in 76 patients (47 male; 29 female) with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive CML. Diagnostic criteria of IMC were performed in patients with symptoms suggestive of particular disorders. Well-documented and clinically evident complications developed in 7 patients after a median of 19 months (range 1-84) of IFNalpha treatment. These included 9.2% patients with Ph-positive CML treated with IFNalpha-containing regimens. Hypothyroidism (H) occurred in 1 patient (1.3%), immune-mediated hemolysis (HEM) in 2 patients (2.6%) and connective tissue disorders (CTD) in 4 patients (5.3%) (2 systemic lupus erythematosus--SLE, 1 Raynaud's phenomena and 1 mixed connective tissue disease--MCTD). IFNalpha was discontinued in 3 patients and the dose was reduced in 2 patients. Five of 7 patients (75%) with immune-mediated complications had some degree of cytogenetic response at the time of the event. The association with female sex was strong and significant (86% vs 33.6%, x2; 48; p = 0.02). The frequency of IMC of clinical relevance with interferon alpha therapy in CML increased (long-term therapy).

The analysis of Vgamma region usage in TCR formation revealed that gammadelta T cells from B-CLL patients predominantly expressed a Vgamma9 segment (26 of 30 cases), usually linked to Cgamma1 region. It should be noticed that the dominant TCR genes expression in a 50% of healthy donors was Vdelta2+/Vgamma9+, however, Vgamma4 and Vgamma8 transcripts were also observed (2 and 3 of 10 cases, respectively).

OBJECTIVE: To study cause specific mortality of leather tanners in Tuscany (Valdarno Inferiore area). METHODS: The cohort included 4874 workers (4150 males and 724 females) employed in 92 tanneries operating in 1996 (Valdarno Inferiore Tanneries Census) which were also operating on 31-12-1970. Ascertainment of vital status was completed for all individuals on 31-12-1998 (end of follow-up), and the cause of death was known for all deceased subjects. Demographic and work history data were obtained from factory payrolls. Regional mortality rates were used for comparison to calculate SMR (Standardised Mortality Ratio) and 90% Confidence Intervals (CI). In addition to the overall cohort analysis, for men only separate analyses were completed for finishers, chrome tanners and vegetable tanners. RESULTS: The study showed an increased mortality from lung cancer among finishers, Standardised Mortality Ratio (SMR) 145, 19 observed (obs) (90% Confidence Intervals, 90% CI 95-212), from bladder cancer in the overall cohort (SMR 134, 9 obs, 90% CI 70-233) and among finishers (SMR 125, 2 obs, 90% CI 22-393) and from pancreatic cancer among finishers (SMR 120, 2 obs, 90% CI 21-379). Mortality from lymphoemopoietic cancer is above expected, and the increase is mainly due to myeloid leukaemia, both in males (SMR 208, 5 obs, 90% CI 82-437) and females (SMR 599, 2 obs, 90% CI 106-1887). No deaths from soft tissue sarcoma were observed. A new finding of the study was the increased mortality from cancer of the endocrine glands (SMR 566, 4 obs, 90% CI 194-1297), psychiatric disorders (SMR 195, 6 obs, 90% CI 85-385) and blood diseases (SMR 329, 4 obs, IC 90% 112-752). CONCLUSIONS: The observations of increased lung cancer mortality among finishers, of bladder cancer in the overall cohort and among finishers, as well as an increase in pancreatic cancer among the latter, confirm previous epidemiological findings among tanners. The increase in myeloid leukemia mortality for both males and females, and the absence of deaths from cancer of the connective tissue, which includes soft tissue sarcomas, are worthy of note. The results should be valued with caution, given the small number of cases and the novelty of some observations.","['Iaia, T E', 'Bartoli, D', 'Calzoni, P', 'Comba, P', 'De Santis, M', 'Dini, F', 'Ercolanelli, M', 'Farina, G A', 'Pirastu, R', 'Seniori Costantini, A', 'Valiani, M']","['Iaia TE', 'Bartoli D', 'Calzoni P', 'Comba P', 'De Santis M', 'Dini F', 'Ercolanelli M', 'Farina GA', 'Pirastu R', 'Seniori Costantini A', 'Valiani M']","['U.O Prevenzione Igiene e sicurezza nei Luoghi di Lavoro, Dipartimento della Prevenzione, Azienda USL 11, Valdarno Inferiore. t.iaia@USL11.tos.it']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Med Lav,La Medicina del lavoro,0401176,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', '*Tanning']",2002/06/29 10:00,2003/05/16 05:00,['2002/06/29 10:00'],"['2002/06/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/16 05:00 [medline]', '2002/06/29 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Lav. 2002 Mar-Apr;93(2):95-107.,,,,,,,,,,,,Studio di coorte di mortalita degli addetti alla concia del cuoio e delle pelli nel territorio dell'azienda USL 11--Zona Valdarno Inferiore.,,,,,,,,,,

Since correlations between CD10, cell cycle and apoptotic abilities were demonstrated in various cell types, we investigated whether differences existed in the cycling/apoptotic abilities of CD10-positive and CD10-negative B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells. Twenty-eight cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (mean age of 6.8 years) were subdivided into two groups according to high (17 cases, 93.2+/-4.5%, MRFI 211+/-82 CD10-positive cells) or low (11 cases, 11.5+/-6.2%, MRFI 10+/-7 CD10-negative cells) expression of CD10. CD10-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells were cycling cells with elevated c-myc levels and propensity to apoptosis, whereas CD10-negative acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells had lower cycling capacities and c-myc levels, and were resistant to apoptosis in vitro. A close correlation between all these properties was demonstrated by the observations that the few CD10-positive cells found in the CD10-negative acute lymphoblastic leukaemia group displayed elevated c-myc and cycling capacities and were apoptosis prone. Moreover, exposure of CD10-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia B cells to a peptide nucleic acid anti-gene specific for the second exon of c-myc caused inhibition of c-myc expression and reduced cell cycling and apoptotic abilities as well as decreased CD10 expression.","['Cutrona, G', 'Tasso, P', 'Dono, M', 'Roncella, S', 'Ulivi, M', 'Carpaneto, E M', 'Fontana, V', 'Comis, M', 'Morabito, F', 'Spinelli, M', 'Frascella, E', 'Boffa, L C', 'Basso, G', 'Pistoia, V', 'Ferrarini, M']","['Cutrona G', 'Tasso P', 'Dono M', 'Roncella S', 'Ulivi M', 'Carpaneto EM', 'Fontana V', 'Comis M', 'Morabito F', 'Spinelli M', 'Frascella E', 'Boffa LC', 'Basso G', 'Pistoia V', 'Ferrarini M']","['Servizi di Immunologia Clinica, Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, IST, Genoa, Italy, and Dipartimento di Oncologia, Biologia e Genetica, Universita di Genova, Genoa, Italy. giovanna.cutrona@istge.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Neprilysin/analysis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/06/28 10:00,2002/08/03 10:01,['2002/06/28 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2002/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6600329 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2002 Jun 5;86(11):1776-85. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6600329.,,,,,PMC2375395,,,,['Copyright 2002 Cancer Research UK'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several cancers have been implicated, but no consistent pattern has emerged. We present a large nationwide analysis of selected cancers near landfill sites in Great Britain. The base population comprised people living within 2 km of 9565 (from a total of 19 196) landfill sites that were operational at some time from 1982 to 1997, with populations living more than 2 km from a landfill as reference. Risks of cancers at the above sites were computed with adjustment for age, sex, year of diagnosis, region and deprivation. National post-coded registers provided a total of 341 856 640 person-years for the adult cancer analyses and 113 631 443 person-years for childhood leukaemia. There were 89 786 cases of bladder cancer, 36 802 cases of brain cancer, 21 773 cases of hepatobiliary cancer, 37 812 cases of adult leukaemia and 3973 cases of childhood leukaemia. In spite of the very large scale of this national study, we found no excess risks of cancers of the bladder and brain, hepatobiliary cancer or leukaemia, in populations living within 2 km of landfill sites. The results were similar if the analysis were restricted to landfill sites licensed to carry special (hazardous) waste. Our results do not support suggestions of excess risks of cancer associated with landfill sites reported in other studies.","['Jarup, L', 'Briggs, D', 'de Hoogh, C', 'Morris, S', 'Hurt, C', 'Lewin, A', 'Maitland, I', 'Richardson, S', 'Wakefield, J', 'Elliott, P']","['Jarup L', 'Briggs D', 'de Hoogh C', 'Morris S', 'Hurt C', 'Lewin A', 'Maitland I', 'Richardson S', 'Wakefield J', 'Elliott P']","[""The Small Area Health Statistics Unit, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Imperial College, St Mary's Campus, Norfolk Place, London W2 1PG, UK. l.jarup@ic.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Child', '*Environmental Exposure', '*Environmental Pollution', '*Housing', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/classification/*epidemiology', '*Refuse Disposal', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom']",2002/06/28 10:00,2002/08/03 10:01,['2002/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2002/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6600311 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2002 Jun 5;86(11):1732-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6600311.,,,,,PMC2375392,,,,['Copyright 2002 Cancer Research UK'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results are given for 2226 case and 3773 control homes. No evidence to support an association between higher radon concentrations and risk of any of the childhood cancers was found. Indeed, evidence of decreasing cancer risks with increasing radon concentrations was observed. Adjustment for deprivation score for area of residence made little difference to this trend and similar patterns were evident in all regions and in all diagnostic groups. The study suggests that control houses had more features, such as double glazing and central heating, leading to higher radon levels than case houses. Further, case houses have features more likely to lead to lower radon levels, e.g. living-rooms above ground level. Consequently the case-control differences could have arisen because of differences between houses associated with deprivation that are not adequately allowed for by the deprivation score.",,,,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Comment']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,['Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)'],IM,"['*Air Pollution, Indoor', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Geography', '*Housing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Radon/*adverse effects', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2002/06/28 10:00,2002/08/03 10:01,['2002/06/28 10:00'],"['2001/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2002/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6600276 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2002 Jun 5;86(11):1721-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6600276.,,,,['UK Childhood Cancer Study Investigators'],PMC2375400,,,['Br J Cancer. 2002 Nov 18;87(11):1336-7.

Indium phosphide was nominated for study because of its widespread use in the microelectronics industry, the potential for worker exposure,and the absence of chronic toxicity data. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to indium phosphide (greater than 99% pure) by inhalation for 14 weeks or 2 years. The frequency of micronuclei was determined in the peripheral blood of mice exposed to indium phosphide for 14 weeks. 14-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed to particulate aerosols of indium phosphide with amass median aerodynamic diameter of approximately 1.2 microm at concentrations of 0, 1, 3, 10, 30, or 100 mg/m3 by inhalation, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week (weeks 1 through 4 and weeks 10 through 14) or 7 days per week (weeks 5 through 9) to accommodate a concurrent teratology study. One male in the 100 mg/m3 group died before the end of the study. Body weight gains of all males and females exposed to 100 mg/m3 were less than those of the chamber controls. As a result of indium phosphide exposure, the lungs of all exposed rats had a gray to black discoloration and were significantly enlarged, weighing 2.7- to 4.4-fold more than those of the chamber controls. Indium phosphide particles were observed throughout the respiratory tract and in the lung-associated lymph nodes. A spectrum of inflammatory and proliferative lesions generally occurred in the lungs of all exposed groups of rats and consisted of alveolar proteinosis, chronic inflammation, interstitial fibrosis, and alveolar epithelial hyperplasia. Pulmonary inflammation was attended by increased leukocyte and neutrophil counts in the blood. The alveolar proteinosis was the principal apparent reason for the increase in lung weights. Indium phosphide caused inflammation at the base of the epiglottis of the larynx and hyperplasia of the bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes. Exposure to indium phosphide affected the circulating erythroid mass. It induced a microcytic erythrocytosis consistent with bone marrow hyperplasia and hematopoietic cell proliferation of the spleen. Hepatocellular necrosis was suggested by increased serum activities of alanine aminotransferase and sorbitol dehydrogenase in all exposed groups of males and in 10 mg/m3 or greater females and was confirmed microscopically in 100 mg/m3 males and females. 14-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were exposed to particulate aerosols of indium phosphide with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of approximately 1.2 microm at concentrations of 0, 1, 3, 10, 30, or 100 mg/m3 by inhalation, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week (weeks 1 through 4 and weeks 10 through 14)or 7 days per week (weeks 5 through 9). Although the effects of indium phosphide exposure were similar in rats and mice, mice were more severely affected in that all males and females in the 100 mg/m3 groups either died or were removed moribund during the study. One male and three females in the 30 mg/m3 group were also removed before the end of the study. In general, body weight gains were significantly less in males and females exposed to 3 mg/m3 or greater compared to those of the chamber controls. Mice exposed to 30 or 100 mg/m3 were lethargic and experienced rapid, shallow breathing. As in rats, lungs were discolored and enlarged 2.6- to 4.1-fold greater than those of chamber controls due to the exposure-induced alveolar proteinosis. Indium phosphide particles were observed in the nose, trachea,larynx, and lymph nodes of some exposed males and females. Alveolar proteinosis, chronic active inflammation,interstitial fibrosis, and alveolar epithelial hyperplasia were observed; these effects were more severe than in rats. Hyperplasia in the bronchial lymph nodes and squamous metaplasia, necrosis, and suppurative inflammation of the larynx were observed in some exposed males and females. Exposure to indium phosphide induced a microcytic erythrocytosis which was consistent with the observed hematopoietic cell proliferation of the spleen.2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS Groups of 60 male and 60 female rats were exposed to particulate aerosols of indium phosphide at concentrations of 0, 0.03, 0.1, or 0.3 mg/m3, 6 hours per day,5 days per week, for 22 weeks (0.1 and 0.3 mg/m3 groups) or 105 weeks (0 and 0.03 mg/m3 groups). Animals in the 0.1 and 0.3 mg/m3 group were maintained on filtered air from exposure termination at week 22 until the end of the studies. Ten males and 10 females per group were evaluated at 3 months. 3-Month Interim Evaluation: Exposure to indium phosphide for 3 months caused a microcytic erythrocytosis and also caused enlarged lungs and lesions in the respiratory tract and lung associated lymph nodes. Although qualitatively similar to those observed in the 14-week studies, these effects were considerably less severe. However, the lesions in the lungs of rats exposed to 0.1 or 0.3 mg/m3 were considered sufficiently severe that exposure was discontinued in these groups, and the groups were allowed to continue unexposed for the remainder of the study. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings: Exposure to indium phosphide had no effect on survival or body weight gain. During the last 6 months of the study, rats in the 0.03 and 0.3 mg/m3 groups became lethargic and males breathed abnormally. Pathology Findings: At 2 years, exposure to indium phosphide caused increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas and carcinomas in rats. Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung occurred in four male rats exposed to 0.3 mg/m3. As observed in the 14-week study and at the 3-month interim evaluation, a spectrum of inflammatory and proliferative lesions of the lung were observed in all exposed groups of males and females;however, the extent and severity of the lesions were generally greater and included atypical hyperplasia,chronic inflammation, alveolar epithelial hyperplasia and metaplasia, alveolar proteinosis, and interstitial fibrosis. Exposure to indium phosphide also caused increased incidences of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland in males and females. Marginal increases in the incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in males and females, fibroma of the skin in males, and carcinoma of the mammary gland in females may have been related to exposure to indium phosphide. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 60 male and 60 female mice were exposed to particulate aerosols of indium phosphide at concentrations of 0, 0.03, 0.1, or 0.3 mg/m3, 6 hours per day,5 days per week, for 21 weeks (0.1 and 0.3 mg/m3 groups) or 105 weeks (0 and 0.03 mg/m3 groups). Animals in the 0.1 and 0.3 mg/m3 groups were maintained on filtered air from exposure termination at week 21 until the end of the studies. Ten males and 10 females per group were evaluated at 3 months. 3-Month Interim Evaluation:Exposure to indium phosphide for 3 months affected the circulating erythroid mass and caused enlarged lungs and lesions in the respiratory tract and lung associated lymph nodes. These effects, although qualitatively similar to those observed in the 14-week studies, were considerably less severe. However, the lesions in the lungs of mice exposed to 0.1 mg/m3 and greater were considered sufficiently severe that exposure was discontinued in these groups and the groups were allowed to continue unexposed for the remainder of the study. Survival and Body Weights: In general, exposure to indium phosphide for 2 years reduced survival and body weight gain in exposed males and females. Pathology Findings:At 2 years, exposure to indium phosphide caused increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas in males and alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas and carcinomas in females. In addition to the alveolar proteinosis and chronic active inflammation seen at earlier time points, serosa fibrosis and pleural mesothelial hyperplasia were also present. The incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms were also significantly increased in exposed males and females. Exposed groups of males and females had increased incidences of eosinophilic foci of the liver at 2 years. Marginal increases in the incidences of neoplasms of the small intestines in male mice may have been related to exposure to indium phosphide. Exposure to indium phosphide also caused inflammation of the arteries of the heart, primarily the coronary arteries and the proximal aorta, and to a lesser extent the lung-associated lymph nodes in males and in females. TISSUE BURDEN ANALYSES: Deposition and clearance studies of indium following long term exposure of rats and mice to indium phosphide by inhalation were performed. Although there were quantitative differences in lung burden and kinetic parameters for rats and mice, qualitatively they were similar. Deposition of indium in the lungs appeared to follow a zero-order (constant rate) process. Retained lung burdens throughout the studies were proportional to exposure concentration and duration. No differences in elimination rates of indium from the lungs were observed as a function of exposure concentration in either rats or mice. These studies indicated that elimination of indium was quite slow. Mice exhibited clearance half-times of 144 and 163 days for the 0.1 and 0.3 mg/m3 groups, respectively, as compared to 262 and 291 days for rats exposed to the same concentrations. The lung deposition and clearance model was used to estimate the total amount of indium deposited in the lungs of rats and mice after exposure to 0.03 mg/m3 for 2 years or to 0.1 or 0.3 mg/m3 for 21 or 22 weeks, the lung burdens at the end of the 2-year study, and the area under lung burden curves (AUC). For both species, estimates at the end of 2 years indicated that the lung burdens in the continuously exposed 0.03 mg/m3 groups were greater than those in the 0.1 or 0.3 mg/m3 groups.

Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to o-nitrotoluene (greater than 99% pure) in feed for 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, rat and mouse bone marrow cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: In the core study, groups of 60 male and 60 female rats were fed diets containing 625, 1,250, or 2,000 ppm o-nitrotoluene (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 25, 50, or 90 mg o-nitrotoluene/kg body weight to males and 30, 60, or 100 mg/kg to females) for 105 weeks. In a 3-month stop-exposure study, groups of 70 male rats were fed diets containing 2,000 or 5,000 ppm o-nitrotoluene (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 125 or 315 mg/kg) for 13 weeks followed by undosed feed for the remainder of the study. A group of 70 male rats receiving undosed feed served as a control group for both male rat studies; 60 female rats receiving undosed feed were the control group for the female core study. Ten control males and 10 males from each stop-exposure group were sacrificed at 3 months. Survival, Body Weights, and Feed Consumption: All 2,000 ppm core study, all 5,000 ppm stop-exposure, and all but three core study 1,250 ppm male rats died before the end of the studies. Survival of 625 ppm core study and 2,000 ppm stop-exposure males and of 2,000 ppm females was significantly less than that of the controls. Mean body weights of all exposed groups of males except the 625 ppm group were generally less than those of the controls throughout the study. Mean body weights of 2,000 ppm females were less than those of the controls during year 2 of the study. Feed consumption by exposed groups of rats was similar to that by the controls. Biomarkers of Exposure: Three urinary metabolites were followed during the study as biomarkers of exposure. The ratios of o-nitrobenzoic acid to creatinine and of o-nitrobenzylmercapturic acid to creatinine determined at 2 weeks and at 3, 12, and 18 months were linearly related to exposure concentration in males and females. The ratio of o-aminobenzoic acid to creatinine was not related to exposure concentration. Pathology Findings: The incidences of malignant mesothelioma in male rats occurred with positive trends in both the core and stop-exposure studies and were significantly greater in exposed groups than in the controls. Incidences of subcutaneous skin neoplasms (fibroma, fibrosarcoma, and lipoma) were increased in exposed groups of males, while the incidences of fibroma or fibrosarcoma (combined) were increased in exposed females. In all exposed groups of males and females except 2,000 ppm core study males, the incidences of mammary gland fibroadenoma were significantly increased. The incidences of mammary gland hyperplasia were significantly increased in 625 and 1,250 ppm females. Increased incidences of mesothelioma, skin neoplasms, and mammary gland fibroadenoma in the stop-exposure males indicated that 3 months of dosing were sufficient to produce a carcinogenic effect. Liver weights of 5,000 ppm stop-exposure males were significantly greater than those of the controls at 3 months. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma in 2,000 ppm core study males and females and of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in 2,000 ppm core study and 5,000 ppm stop-exposure males were significantly increased. Cholangiocarcinoma occurred in three 5,000 ppm stop-exposure males, and a single hepatocholangiocarcinoma occurred in a 625 ppm male and in a 2,000 ppm core study male. Nonneoplastic lesions of the liver included eosinophilic, mixed cell, and clear cell foci in exposed groups of males and females and mixed cell infiltrate in exposed males and basophilic focus in exposed females. The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly increased in 5,000 ppm stop-exposure males, as were alveolar/bronchiolar hyperplasia in most exposed groups of males and females. The incidences of hematopoietic cell proliferation of the spleen and of hyperplasia of the mandibular lymph node (females) and bone marrow were increased in exposed groups of males at 3 months and/or 2 years and in exposed groups of females at 2 years. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia were significantly decreased in all groups of males exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater and in all exposed groups of females; the incidence of testicular interstitial cell adenoma was significantly decreased in 5,000 ppm stop-exposure males. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 60 male and 60 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm o-nitrotoluene (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 165, 360, or 700 mg/kg to males and 150, 320, or 710 mg/kg to females) for 105 weeks. Survival, Body Weights, and Feed Consumption: All 2,500 and 5,000 ppm males died before the end of the study. Survival of 1,250 ppm males and 5,000 ppm females was significantly less than that of the controls. Mean body weights of exposed males and 5,000 ppm females were generally less than those of the controls throughout the study, and those of 2,500 ppm females were less during the second year of the study. Feed consumption by 5,000 ppm males was less than that by the controls. Biomarkers of Exposure: Three urinary metabolites were followed during the study as biomarkers of exposure. The ratios of o-nitrobenzoic acid to creatinine determined at 2 weeks and at 3, 12, and 18 months were linearly related to exposure concentration in males and females. The concentrations of o-nitrobenzylmercapturic acid and o-aminobenzoic acid were below the limit of quantitation at most time points. Pathology Findings: The incidences of hemangiosarcoma in all exposed groups of males and in 5,000 ppm females were significantly greater than those in the controls. Large intestine (cecum) carcinomas were observed in all exposed groups except 5,000 ppm males. The incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms were significantly increased in 2,500 and 5,000 ppm females. Nonneoplastic liver lesions including eosinophilic and basophilic foci and minimal to mild necrosis were enhanced in exposed males and females. Also present were focal hepatocyte syncytial alteration in exposed males and hepatocyte necrosis and focal hepatocyte cytoplasmic vacuolization in 5,000 ppm females. Renal tubule pigmentation occurred more frequently in exposed groups of males and in 5,000 ppm females than in the controls. Olfactory epithelial degeneration occurred in every male and female mouse exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm, and the severity of this lesion increased with increasing exposure concentration. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: o-Nitrotoluene was not mutagenic in any of several strains of S. typhimurium, with or without metabolic activation enzymes (S9). Sister chromatid exchanges were significantly increased in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells following exposure to o-nitrotoluene in the presence of S9; an equivocal response was seen without S9. o-Nitrotoluene did not induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or without S9. o-Nitrotoluene did not induce a significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei in bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes of male rats or male mice when administered by intraperitoneal injection. Results of a peripheral blood micronucleus test were equivocal for male mice and negative for female mice administered o-nitrotoluene in feed for 13 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity* of o-nitrotoluene in male rats based on increased incidences of malignant mesothelioma, subcutaneous skin neoplasms, mammary gland fibroadenoma, and liver neoplasms. The increased incidences of lung neoplasms in male rats were also considered to be exposure related. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitrotoluene in female rats based on increased incidences of subcutaneous skin neoplasms and mammary gland fibroadenoma. The increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma in female rats was also considered to be exposure related. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of -o-nitrotoluene in male and female mice based on increased incidences of hemangiosarcoma, carcinoma of the large intestine (cecum), and hepatocellular neoplasms (females only). Exposure to o--nitrotoluene caused increased incidences of nonneoplastic lesions of the mammary gland (females only), liver, bone marrow, spleen, lung, and mandibular lymph node (females only) in male and female rats and of the liver, kidney, and nose in male and female mice. Decreased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia occurred in exposed groups of rats; the incidence of testicular interstitial cell adenoma was decreased in exposed male rats.

This gene, identified in embryonic stem (ES) cells, is differentially expressed during in vitro ES cell differentiation. We have assessed Ehox function using the ES cell in vitro differentiation system. This has involved molecular and biological analyses of the effects of sense or antisense Ehox expression (using episomal vectors) on ES cell differentiation. Analysis of antisense Ehox-expressing ES cells indicates that they are unable to express marker genes associated with hematopoietic, endothelial, or cardiac differentiation following removal of leukemia inhibitory factor. In contrast, overexpression of Ehox using the sense construct accelerated the appearance of these differentiation markers. ES cell self-renewal and differentiation assays reveal that inhibition of Ehox activity results in the maintenance of a stem cell phenotype in limiting concentrations of leukemia inhibitory factor and the almost complete impairment of the cardiomyocyte differentiation capacity of these cells. We therefore conclude that Ehox is a novel homeobox-containing gene that is essential for the earliest stages of murine ES cell differentiation.","['Jackson, Melany', 'Baird, Janet W', 'Cambray, Noemi', 'Ansell, John D', 'Forrester, Lesley M', 'Graham, Gerard J']","['Jackson M', 'Baird JW', 'Cambray N', 'Ansell JD', 'Forrester LM', 'Graham GJ']","['John Hughes Bennett Laboratories, Department of Oncology, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinburgh EH4 2XU, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ehox protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Embryo, Mammalian/anatomy & histology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/physiology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics/metabolism', 'Plasmids', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Tissue Distribution']",2002/06/28 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/06/28 10:00'],"['2002/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M203459200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)36353-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Oct 11;277(41):38683-92. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M203459200.

In leukemic cells, the calcium release-activated calcium channels provide a major pathway for calcium entry (I(CRAC)) perpetuating progression through the cell cycle. Although I(CRAC) is under mitochondrial regulation, targeting mitochondrial function has not been exploited to control malignant cell growth. The benzothiadiazine diazoxide, which depolarized respiration-dependent mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced the rate of proliferation and arrested human acute leukemic T cells in the G0/G1 phase. Diazoxide did not alter cellular energetics, but rather inhibited the mitochondria-controlled I(CRAC) and reduced calcium influx into tumor cells. The antiproliferative action of diazoxide was mimicked by removal of extracellular calcium or by the tyrphostin A9, an I(CRAC) inhibitor. Deletion of the mitochondrial genome, which encodes essential respiratory chain enzyme subunits, attenuated the inhibitory effect of diazoxide on I(CRAC)-mediated calcium influx and cell proliferation. Thus, manipulation of mitochondrial function and associated calcium signaling provides a basis for a novel anticancer strategy.","['Holmuhamedov, Ekhson', 'Lewis, Lionel', 'Bienengraeber, Martin', 'Holmuhamedova, Madina', 'Jahangir, Arshad', 'Terzic, Andre']","['Holmuhamedov E', 'Lewis L', 'Bienengraeber M', 'Holmuhamedova M', 'Jahangir A', 'Terzic A']","['Division of Cardiovascular Diseases, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Mayo Foundation, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', 'O5CB12L4FN (Diazoxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Calcium Signaling/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Diazoxide/*pharmacology', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/06/28 10:00,2002/07/24 10:01,['2002/06/28 10:00'],"['2002/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1096/fj.01-0996com [doi]', '16/9/1010 [pii]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2002 Jul;16(9):1010-6. doi: 10.1096/fj.01-0996com.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that five different T cell oncogenes (HOX11, TAL1, LYL1, LMO1, and LMO2) are often aberrantly expressed in the absence of chromosomal abnormalities. Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we identified several gene expression signatures that were indicative of leukemic arrest at specific stages of normal thymocyte development: LYL1+ signature (pro-T), HOX11+ (early cortical thymocyte), and TAL1+ (late cortical thymocyte). Hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression signatures grouped samples according to their shared oncogenic pathways and identified HOX11L2 activation as a novel event in T cell leukemogenesis. These findings have clinical importance, since HOX11 activation is significantly associated with a favorable prognosis, while expression of TAL1, LYL1, or, surprisingly, HOX11L2 confers a much worse response to treatment.

To bypass the embryonic lethality, we generated a mouse strain with a conditional AML1-ETO knockin allele that contains a loxP bracketed transcriptional stop cassette 5' to the AML1-ETO fusion site. Activation of this allele in vivo by Cre-mediated recombination resulted in an enhanced replating efficiency of myeloid progenitors, but it did not block their differentiation, nor was it sufficient to induce leukemia.

An extension of the initial successes in molecular oncology will occur more quickly and successfully through an appreciation of lessons learned with the first group of agents in their progress through clinical development.","['Shawver, Laura K', 'Slamon, Dennis', 'Ullrich, Axel']","['Shawver LK', 'Slamon D', 'Ullrich A']","['SUGEN, Inc., 230 East Grand Avenue, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/blood supply/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor']",2002/06/28 10:00,2002/08/14 10:01,['2002/06/28 10:00'],"['2002/06/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/28 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1535610802000399 [pii]', '10.1016/s1535-6108(02)00039-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2002 Mar;1(2):117-23. doi: 10.1016/s1535-6108(02)00039-9.,,,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IPENSpm was cytotoxic to these cells at concentrations greater than 2.5 microM. It induced apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner and its toxicity profile was comparable with etoposide, a well-known anti-tumour agent and inducer of apoptosis. IPENSpm decreased intracellular polyamine content as a result of changes in ornithine decarboxylase activity and increases in spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase and polyamine export. Analysis showed spermine and spermidine as the major intracellular polyamines, while putrescine and acetyl-polyamines were the main export compounds.

Here we investigated the differentiation capacity of mouse ES cells into hepatocytes both in vitro and in vivo. During the culture of embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from ES cells, albumin (ALB) messenger RNA (mRNA) was expressed within 12 days after removal of leukemia inhibitory factor, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) mRNA was observed within 9 days without additional exogenous growth factors. In ES cells and early EBs, by contrast, neither ALB mRNA nor AFP mRNA was observed. ALB protein was first detected at day 15 and the level increased with the culture period. The differentiation of EBs facilitated the synthesis of urea with the culture period, whereas early EBs and ES cells produced no urea. These results suggest that cultured EBs contain hepatocytes capable of producing ALB and urea. ES cells and the isolated cells from EBs were transplanted through portal vein to the liver after 30% partial hepatectomy of female mice pretreated with 2-acetylaminofluorene. Four weeks after transplantation with isolated cells from day-9 EBs, ES-derived cells containing Y-chromosome in the liver were positive for ALB (0.2% of total liver cells), whereas teratoma was found in mice transplanted with ES cells or EBs up to day 6.

To better understand this inefficiency, we localized the expression of Pit2, the amphotropic receptor, in polarized human airway epithelia. Pit2 was expressed on both the apical and basolateral surfaces of the cells, suggesting that factors other than receptor abundance may limit apical gene transfer efficiency. Binding studies performed with radiolabeled amphotropic MuLV suggested that the apically applied virus binds to Pit2. Hypothetical barriers to retroviral gene transfer include the apical glycocalyx and other secreted products of epithelia. In this study, we demonstrated that sialic acid, keratan sulfate and collagen type V are present on the apical surface of well-differentiated human airway epithelia. While enzyme treatment reduced the abundance of these components, the treatment also decreased the transepithelial resistance to approximately 35% of the controls, suggesting that the epithelial integrity was impaired. To attain an airway epithelial culture with a modified apical surface and intact epithelial integrity, we utilized 100 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose, a glycosylation inhibitor, to prevent the glycocalyx from reforming following enzyme treatment. This approach allowed the resistance, but not the apical glycocalyx to recover. Despite this physical modification of the cell surface, the amphotropic retroviral vector failed to transduce airway epithelia following apical application. These results suggest that factors other than apical receptor abundance and the glycocalyx inhibit amphotropic retroviral gene transfer in human airway epithelia.","['Wang, G', 'Williams, G', 'Xia, H', 'Hickey, M', 'Shao, J', 'Davidson, B L', 'McCray, P B']","['Wang G', 'Williams G', 'Xia H', 'Hickey M', 'Shao J', 'Davidson BL', 'McCray PB']","['Program in Gene Therapy, Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (POU1F1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor Pit-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Cell Polarity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cystic Fibrosis/*therapy', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*administration & dosage', 'Glycocalyx/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Respiratory Mucosa/*cytology/ultrastructure', 'Transcription Factor Pit-1', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic/methods', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",2002/06/27 10:00,2002/08/30 10:01,['2002/06/27 10:00'],"['2001/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3301714 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 2002 Jul;9(14):922-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301714.,"['P01 HL051670/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL61460/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 HL51670/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK054759/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK54759/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH061460/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC7091907,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, this apoptotic pathway seems to be bcl-2/bax independent and count only on malignant cells but not normal nor activated lymphocytes.","['Asumendi, A', 'Morales, M C', 'Alvarez, A', 'Arechaga, J', 'Perez-Yarza, G']","['Asumendi A', 'Morales MC', 'Alvarez A', 'Arechaga J', 'Perez-Yarza G']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of The Basque Country, Leioa- 48940, Bizkaia, Spain. gcpasmaa@lg.ehu.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cardiolipins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cardiolipins/*metabolism', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lipid Peroxidation/*drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/06/27 10:00,2002/07/26 10:01,['2002/06/27 10:00'],"['2001/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/05 00:00 [revised]', '2002/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6600356 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2002 Jun 17;86(12):1951-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6600356.,,,,,PMC2375439,,,,['Copyright 2002 Cancer Research UK'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we observed distinct LMR-12 staining in 36 out of 55 non-drug-selected tumour cell lines, including melanomas, renal cell-, colon- and lung carcinomas, whereas in other tumour types, such as leukaemia and ovarian cancer, LMR-12 staining was generally low or absent. The cDNA encoding the LMR-12 antigen was isolated from a library of the multidrug-resistant human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080/DR4 by expression cloning in MOP8 cells. Sequence analysis showed that the LMR-12 antigen is identical to the major histocompatibility complex class I molecule beta 2-microglobulin (beta2-m). The LMR-12/ beta2-m staining results were confirmed by mRNA microarray data from an independent National Cancer Institute study, as well as by newly obtained reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction data. Further analysis of the microarray data showed that beta2-m levels closely reflected levels of major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains and the transporter associated with antigen processing. Since the ABC transporter associated with antigen processing was previously shown to contribute to multidrug-resistance, it may very well be that the observed LMR-12/ beta2-m levels are secondary to (elevated) levels of the transporter associated with antigen processing. A perspective arising from the present study is that drug resistant tumour cells may, by having elevated levels of major histocompatibility complex related molecules, be particular good candidates for alternative therapeutic therapies, such as cytotoxic T cell mediated immune-therapies.","['Scheffer, G L', 'de Jong, M C', 'Monks, A', 'Flens, M J', 'Hose, C D', 'Izquierdo, M A', 'Shoemaker, R H', 'Scheper, R J']","['Scheffer GL', 'de Jong MC', 'Monks A', 'Flens MJ', 'Hose CD', 'Izquierdo MA', 'Shoemaker RH', 'Scheper RJ']","['Department of Pathology, Free University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. rj.scheper@vumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*biosynthesis']",2002/06/27 10:00,2002/07/26 10:01,['2002/06/27 10:00'],"['2002/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/05 00:00 [revised]', '2002/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjc.6600354 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2002 Jun 17;86(12):1943-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6600354.,,,,,PMC2375440,,,,['Copyright 2002 Cancer Research UK'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) are a useful model, because they are capable of robust neurogenesis throughout adulthood. We have investigated the role of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in postnatal neuronal development by using ORNs as a model. LIF is a multifunctional cytokine implicated in various aspects of neuronal development, including phenotype determination, survival, and in response to nerve injury. LIF-deficient mice display significant increases, both in the absolute amount and in the number of cells expressing olfactory marker protein, a marker of mature ORNs. The maturation of ORNs was significantly inhibited by LIF in vitro. LIF activated the STAT3 pathway in ORNs, and transfection of ORNs with a dominant negative form of STAT3 abolished the effect of LIF. These findings demonstrate that LIF negatively regulates ORN maturation via the STAT3 pathway. Thus, LIF plays a critical role in controlling the transition of ORNs to maturity. Consequently, a population of ORNs is maintained in an immature state to facilitate the rapid repopulation of the olfactory epithelium with mature neurons during normal cell turnover or after injury.","['Moon, Cheil', 'Yoo, Joo-Yeon', 'Matarazzo, Valery', 'Sung, Young Kwan', 'Kim, Esther J', 'Ronnett, Gabriele V']","['Moon C', 'Yoo JY', 'Matarazzo V', 'Sung YK', 'Kim EJ', 'Ronnett GV']","['Department of Neuroscience, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Olfactory Marker Protein)', '0 (Omp protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Olfactory Marker Protein', 'Olfactory Receptor Neurons/*cytology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",2002/06/27 10:00,2002/07/20 10:01,['2002/06/27 10:00'],"['2002/06/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.132131699 [doi]', '99/13/9015 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Jun 25;99(13):9015-20. doi: 10.1073/pnas.132131699.,,,,,PMC124415,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HIV-1 NC contains two CCHC-type zinc binding domains. Here, we use optical tweezers to stretch single lambda-DNA molecules through the helix-to-coil transition in the presence of wild-type and several mutant forms of HIV-1 NC with altered zinc-finger domains. Although all forms of NC lowered the cooperativity of the DNA helix-coil transition, subtle changes in the zinc-finger structures reduced NC's effect on the transition. The change in cooperativity of the DNA helix-coil transition correlates strongly with in vitro nucleic acid chaperone activity measurements and in vivo HIV-1 replication studies using the same NC mutants. Moreover, Moloney murine leukemia virus NC, which contains a single zinc finger, had little effect on transition cooperativity.

Our laboratory has been interested in studying mechanisms of resistance to drugs that are targeted to the thymidylate biosynthesis pathway especially those that target thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). We have used leukemia as a model system to study resistance to methotrexate (MTX) and colorectal cancer as the model system to study 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance. In leukemias, we and others have shown that transport, efflux, polyglutamylation and hydrolase activities are major determinants of MTX resistance. We have further reported that some leukemic cells have an increase in DHFR gene copy number possibly contributing to the resistant phenotype. Recently, we have begun to study in detail the molecular mechanisms that govern translational regulation of DHFR in response to MTX as an additional resistance mechanism. Studies thus far involving colorectal tumors obtained from patients have focused predominantly on the predictive value of levels of TS expression and p53 mutations in determining response to 5-FU. Although the predictive value of these two measures appears to be significant, given the variety of resistance to 5-FU observed in cell lines, it is not likely that these are the only measures predictive of response or responsible for acquired resistance to this drug. The enzyme uridine-cytidine monophosphate kinase (UMPK) is an essential and rate-limiting enzyme in 5-FU activation while dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is a catabolic enzyme that inactivates 5-FU. Alterations in UMPK and DPD may therefore explain failure of 5-FU response in the absence of alterations in TS or p53. Transcription factors that regulate TS may also influence drug sensitivity. We have found that mRNA levels of the E2F family of transcription factors correlates with TS message levels and are higher in lung metastases than in liver metastases of colorectal cancers. Moreover, gene copy number of the E2F-1 gene appears to be increased in a significant number of samples obtained from metastases of colorectal cancer. We have also generated mutants of both DHFR and TS that confer resistance to MTX as well as 5-FU by random as well as site-directed mutagenesis. These mutants used alone or as fusion cDNAs of the mutants have proven to be useful in transplant studies where transfer of these mutant cDNAs to bone marrow cells have been shown to confer drug resistance to recipients. The fusion cDNAs of DHFR such as the DHFR-herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSVTK) are also useful for regulation of gene expression in vivo using MTX as the small molecule regulator that can be monitored by positron emission tomography (PET) scanning or by optical imaging using a fusion construct such as DHFR-EGFP.","['Banerjee, Debabrata', 'Mayer-Kuckuk, Philipp', 'Capiaux, Gina', 'Budak-Alpdogan, Tulin', 'Gorlick, Richard', 'Bertino, Joseph R']","['Banerjee D', 'Mayer-Kuckuk P', 'Capiaux G', 'Budak-Alpdogan T', 'Gorlick R', 'Bertino JR']","['Program of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA. banerjed@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.3.1.2 (Dihydrouracil Dehydrogenase (NADP))', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 2.4.2.4 (Thymidine Phosphorylase)', 'EC 2.7.4.- (uridine monophosphate kinase)', 'EC 2.7.4.4 (Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dihydrouracil Dehydrogenase (NADP)', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase/metabolism', 'Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/drug effects/genetics', 'Thymidine Phosphorylase/metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2002/06/27 10:00,2002/08/24 10:01,['2002/06/27 10:00'],"['2002/06/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0925443902000790 [pii]', '10.1016/s0925-4439(02)00079-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2002 Jul 18;1587(2-3):164-73. doi: 10.1016/s0925-4439(02)00079-0.,"['CA-08010/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-61586/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50-CA-86438/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,85,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All other cell and organ systems remain functional. The biological significance of human PNP is degradation of deoxyguanosine, and apoptosis of T-cells occurs as a consequence of the accumulation of deoxyguanosine in the circulation, and dGTP in the cells. Control of T-cell proliferation is desirable in T-cell cancers, autoimmune diseases, and tissue transplant rejection. The search for powerful inhibitors of PNP as anti-T-cell agents has culminated in the immucillins. These inhibitors have been developed from knowledge of the transition state structure for the reactions catalyzed by PNP, and inhibit with picomolar dissociation constants. Immucillin-H (Imm-H) causes deoxyguanosine-dependent apoptosis of rapidly dividing human T-cells, but not other cell types. Human T-cell leukemia cells, and stimulated normal T-cells are both highly sensitive to the combination of Imm-H to block PNP and deoxyguanosine.

Murine retrovirus infection induces dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The present study investigated the cardiovascular effects of chronic MA treatment on uninfected and retrovirus-infected mice. C57BL/6 mice were studied after 12 weeks treatment. The four study groups were (group I) uninfected, MA placebo; (group II) infected, MA placebo; (group III) uninfected, MA treatment; and (group IV) infected and MA treatment. MA injections were given i.p. once a day for 5 days/week with a increasing dose from 15 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg. Left ventricular mechanics were measured in situ a using Millar conductance catheter system for pressure-volume loop analysis. Cardiac pathology was determined with histological analysis. In the uninfected mice, the load independent contractile parameters, pre-load recruitable stroke work (PRSW) and dP/dt(max) vs. Ved, significantly decreased by 32% and 35% in MA treated mice when compared to the saline injected mice. In retrovirus-infected mice, although there were no significant difference in Ees, PRSW, and dP/dt(max) vs. Ved due to MA treatment, they were increased 45%, 15% and 42% respectively when compared to saline treated mice. No further lowered heart function during murine AIDS may be due to the counteraction of the retroviral DCM and the MA induced myocardial fibrosis and hypertrophy (thickening of the ventricular walls). This is supported by increases in the End-diastolic volume (Ved, 38%) and End-systolic volume (Ves, 84%) in the retrovirus-infected saline injected mice, the decreases of 33% and 17% in the uninfected MA-treated mice, but no significant changes in the retrovirus-infected MA treated mice when compared to uninfected saline injected mice.

Severe enzyme deficiency leads to hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria, with altered folate distribution and a phenotype that is characterized by damage to the nervous and vascular systems. Two frequent polymorphisms in the human MTHFR gene confer moderate functional impairment of MTHFR activity for homozygous mutant individuals. The C to T change at nucleotide position 677, whose functional consequences are dependent on folate status, has been extensively studied for its clinical consequences. A second polymorphism, an A to C change at nucleotide position 1298, is not as well characterized. Still equivocal are associations between MTHFR polymorphisms and vascular arteriosclerotic or thrombotic disease. Neural tube defects and pregnancy complications appear to be linked to impaired MTHFR function. Colonic cancer and acute leukemia, however, appear to be less frequent in individuals homozygous for the 677T polymorphism.MTHFR polymorphisms influence the homocysteine-lowering effect of folates and could modify the pharmacodynamics of antifolates and many other drugs whose metabolism, biochemical effects, or target structures require methylation reactions. However, only preliminary evidence exists for gene-drug interactions. This review summarizes the biochemical basis and clinical evidence for interactions between MTHFR polymorphisms and several disease entities, as well as potential interactions with drug therapies. Future investigations of MTHFR in disease should consider the influence of other variants of functionally-related genes as well as the medication regimen of the patients. Animal models for genetic deficiencies in folate metabolism will likely play a greater role in our understanding of folate-dependent disorders.","['Schwahn, B', 'Rozen, R']","['Schwahn B', 'Rozen R']","[""Departments of Pediatrics, Human Genetics and Biology, McGill University-Montreal Children's Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Am J Pharmacogenomics,American journal of pharmacogenomics : genomics-related research in drug development and clinical practice,100967746,"['EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"['Female', 'Genetics, Medical', 'Humans', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)', '*Mutation', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications']",2002/06/27 10:00,2002/07/26 10:01,['2002/06/27 10:00'],"['2002/06/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['010304 [pii]', '10.2165/00129785-200101030-00004 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pharmacogenomics. 2001;1(3):189-201. doi: 10.2165/00129785-200101030-00004.,,,183,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polymorphic variants in xenobiotic metabolizer loci were a natural starting point to study the relevance of these changes. The finding that glutathione S-transferase (GST) T1 null variants increase leukemia risk has implicated oxidative stress in hematopoietic stem cells as an important etiological factor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The importance of these enzyme systems in handling specific substrates has also been confirmed by the finding of an increased risk of therapy-related leukemia in individuals with underactive variants of GSTP1 who have been exposed to a chemotherapeutic agent metabolized by this enzyme. Benzene is a well-recognized leukemogen, and genetic variants in its metabolic pathway can modulate the risk of leukemia following exposure. In particular, underactive variants of the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 gene (NQO1) seem to increase the risk of AML. Other enzymes within the pathway are proving more difficult to study because of the absence of variants that significantly affect the biological activity of the enzyme under study. No effect of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene variants in altering the risk of AML has been seen in our studies. Another pathway recently shown to be important in determining leukemia risk is folic acid metabolism, particularly important in predisposition to acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Polymorphic variants of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) which impair its activity have been shown to be associated with a protective effect. This is thought to be due to an increased availability of nucleotide precursors for incorporation into DNA. This finding implicates misincorporation of uracil into DNA as an important mechanism of leukemic change in lymphoid precursors. Future studies will extend these observations but will require biological material collected from large well-controlled epidemiological studies. The technological challenges imposed by the high throughput of samples required by these studies are currently being addressed.","['Morgan, Gareth J', 'Smith, Martyn T']","['Morgan GJ', 'Smith MT']","['Academic Unit of Haematology & Oncology, University of Leeds, Leeds, England. garethm@lrf.leeds.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",New Zealand,Am J Pharmacogenomics,American journal of pharmacogenomics : genomics-related research in drug development and clinical practice,100967746,['9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Susceptibility/enzymology', 'Genetic Variation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics']",2002/06/27 10:00,2002/12/27 04:00,['2002/06/27 10:00'],"['2002/06/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/27 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['020202 [pii]', '10.2165/00129785-200202020-00002 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pharmacogenomics. 2002;2(2):79-92. doi: 10.2165/00129785-200202020-00002.,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES01896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES06721/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,92,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transduction efficiencies were 4-5 orders of magnitude below those of comparable producer-cell complementations. However, successful usage of a target-cell-derived tRNA primer was proven by cases of correction of single mismatches between Akv-MLV vectors and complementary tRNA primers toward the primer sequence in the integrated vector. Thus, target-cell-derived tRNA-like primers are able to initiate first-strand cDNA synthesis and plus-strand transfer leading to a complete provirus, suggesting that endogenous tRNAs from the infected cell may also have access to the intracellular viral complex at that step of the replication cycle.","['Schmitz, Alexander', 'Lund, Anders H', 'Hansen, Anette C', 'Duch, Mogens', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou']","['Schmitz A', 'Lund AH', 'Hansen AC', 'Duch M', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular and Structural Biology, Aarhus University, C.

Cells were cultured in 0.5, 2 and 5 microM AS2O3, a range of pharmacologically achievable concentrations of AS2O3.

The most frequently observed oral findings of leukemia are mucosal bleeding and ulceration, petechiae, and gingival hyperplasia. This case report describes a 53-year-old male who presented with gingival enlargement and bleeding, fatigue, and recent weight loss as initial manifestations of acute myelomonocytic leukemia. METHODS: A gingival biopsy was performed, revealing the presence of a hypercellular infiltrate of atypical myeloid and monocytic cells. Further work-up consisted of a complete blood count, bone marrow biopsy, and immunohistochemical and histochemical analysis of biopsy material and flow cytometry of peripheral blood. RESULTS: Flow cytometry results confirmed that the infiltrate was of a myelomonocytic origin, and a diagnosis of acute myelomonocytic leukemia was rendered. The patient responded well to a chemotherapeutic induction regimen of cytosine arabinoside and idarubicin hydrochloride, with regression of gingival enlargement and remission of disease. The patient continued with consolidation chemotherapy and an autologous bone marrow transplant, but eventually died 22 months after initial diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Oral health care professionals, especially periodontists, must recognize that gingival enlargement may represent an initial manifestation of an underlying systemic disease. Acute myelogenous leukemia is a hematological disorder with a predilection for gingival involvement.","['Wu, Josephine', 'Fantasia, John E', 'Kaplan, Robert']","['Wu J', 'Fantasia JE', 'Kaplan R']","['Department of Dental Medicine, Long Island Jewish Medical Center, New Hyde Park, NY 11040, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Periodontol,Journal of periodontology,8000345,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gingival Hemorrhage/*etiology', 'Gingival Overgrowth/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/classification', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2002/06/27 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/06/27 10:00'],"['2002/06/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1902/jop.2002.73.6.664 [doi]'],ppublish,J Periodontol. 2002 Jun;73(6):664-8. doi: 10.1902/jop.2002.73.6.664.,,['J Periodontol. 2002 Oct;73(10):1228.

After CT binding, cAMP accumulation may not occur (as in L1210 leukemia cells) or, when occurring (as in SR-4987 stromal cells), may not be coupled with the antiproliferative effect of CT. In WEHI-3B cells CT binds a Gal-GalNac-GM1b receptor and the anticlonogenic effect of CT seems correlated with cAMP accumulation. To demonstrate the central role of cAMP in WEHI-3B cells, starting from the sensitive cell strain we selected and established a clone of WEHI-3B resistant to CT. This revertant clone (WEHI-3B/CT/REV) is currently cultured in the absence of CT and in the proliferation assay shows a dramatic resistance (>46,000 than the parental cells). Stimulation ofWEHI-3B/CT/REV cells by cholera toxin failed to enhance cAMP and the ganglioside-CT binding studied on Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) blots showed that the resistant cells lost the spot correspondent to the migration of Gal-GalNac-GM1b ganglioside. Both the lines respond at the same level to the adenylate cyclase stimulation by forskolin and the incorporation of GM1a did not decrease the resistance of WEHl-3B/CT/REV. These data confirm that Gal-GalNac-GM1b is the most important functional receptor for CT in WEHI-3B cells able to transduce the signal by enhancing cAMP which in turn inhibits cell proliferation (probably by cAMP dependent protein kinase activation). Our study describes the first cell line resistant to CT originated from a susceptible parental strain and provides a new interesting cell model for studying the cAMP dependent mechanisms involved in cell growth regulation.","['Pessina, Augusto', 'Giuliani, Attilia', 'Croera, Cristina', 'Foti, Paola', 'Mascolo, Lucia', 'Gagliardi, Giuseppina', 'Neri, Maria Grazia']","['Pessina A', 'Giuliani A', 'Croera C', 'Foti P', 'Mascolo L', 'Gagliardi G', 'Neri MG']","['Institute of Microbiology, University of Milan, Italy. pessinaa@mailserver.unimi.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['37758-47-7 (G(M1) Ganglioside)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cholera Toxin/*pharmacology', 'Clone Cells', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'G(M1) Ganglioside/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",2002/06/27 10:00,2002/12/28 04:00,['2002/06/27 10:00'],"['2002/06/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1015593226414 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2002 Apr;233(1-2):19-26. doi: 10.1023/a:1015593226414.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The function of N-cadherin on these cells remains unclear. Heterotypic assays between Molt-3 T lymphoblastic leukemia cells and Caco-2 epithelial monolayers were examined under different conditions to assess the functional role of N-cadherin. The results indicate that adherence of Molt-3 cells to Caco-2 monolayers was reduced significantly following pretreatment of Molt-3 cells with 100 microM of an N-cadherin-derived antagonist decapeptide. In contrast, pretreatment of Molt-3 cells with an anti-N-cadherin antibody raised against the first 20 amino acids of N-cadherin sequence led to a surprisingly marked enhancement of Molt-3 cell adherence to Caco-2 monolayers. In addition, the presence of anti-N-cadherin antibody neutralized the inhibitory effect of anti-ICAM-1 on Molt-3 adhesion to Caco-2 monolayers. This novel finding demonstrates that external stimulus through the N-cadherin amino terminus can modulate adhesion of malignant T-cells to epithelia and may promote their ability to invade or metastasize to inflammatory sites.","['Makagiansar, Irwan T', 'Yusuf-Makagiansar, Helena', 'Ikesue, Atsutoshi', 'Calcagno, Anna M', 'Murray, Joseph S', 'Siahaan, Teruna J']","['Makagiansar IT', 'Yusuf-Makagiansar H', 'Ikesue A', 'Calcagno AM', 'Murray JS', 'Siahaan TJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence 66047, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Caco-2 Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cadherins/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'beta Catenin']",2002/06/27 10:00,2002/12/28 04:00,['2002/06/27 10:00'],"['2002/06/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/06/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1015556625038 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2002 Apr;233(1-2):1-8. doi: 10.1023/a:1015556625038.,['CA-85917/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In myelodysplastic syndromes, anemia is an essential feature of the disease. The decrease in hemoglobin may lead to several symptoms such as fatigue, exhaustion, and impaired quality of life, and it may worsen prognosis. Before the introduction of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO, epoetin alfa), red blood cell transfusions were the traditional treatment for improvement of Hb levels. Transfusions, however, are associated with several adverse events and risks, have only transient effects, and have a limited capacity to ameliorate the symptoms of anemia. Epoetin alfa represents a physiologic treatment option, especially in the long-term treatment of cancer- and cancer treatment-associated anemia, and is well tolerated, with response rates as high as 80%. Epoetin alfa is less effective in the treatment of the anemia of myelodysplastic syndrome, but appears to be synergistic with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. However, not every patient responds to epoetin alfa; to avoid unnecessary interventions and costs, predictors of response have been proposed. This article outlines the advantages and disadvantages of the two major treatment forms of anemia: transfusions and epoetin alfa.

The degree of anemia can have prognostic importance, as is the case with multiple myeloma, or be a significant indicator of disease stage, as noted with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Anemia results in fatigue, exhaustion, dizziness, headache, dyspnea, and decreased motivation, seriously affecting a patient's quality of life.

Prognosis is improving in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia and, to some extent, those with acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemias. However, the majority of patients who suffer from a hematologic malignancy live with incurable disease. In CLL, outside the setting of a clinical trial, it is advisable to postpone treatment until the manifestation of clinical symptoms. It is yet to be determined whether treatment strategies based on new prognostic parameters such as cytogenetics can change the course of disease. In indolent lymphomas, cure is not attainable for the vast majority of patients; the median survival of 9 to 10 years has remained unchanged for several decades. Nevertheless, there has been a dramatic change in therapeutic paradigms in the past few years. For the first time, with the use of new cytostatic drugs and recombinant monoclonal antibodies, it is possible to achieve molecular remissions. Whether this will translate into cure or prolonged survival is still to be determined. In Hodgkin's disease, which is curable when treated with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or combined therapy, depending on the stage of disease, the focus of future studies must be on prevention of early relapse and on primary resistant disease, both of which present a very poor prognosis.

In Ba/F3 cells, activation of exogenous AML1 (RUNX1)-ER with 4-hydroxytamoxifen prevents inhibition of G1 progression mediated by CBFbeta-SMMHC, a CBF oncoprotein. We expressed three AML1-ER variants with CBFbeta-SMMHC in Ba/F3 cells. In these lines, CBFbeta-SMMHC expression is regulated by the zinc-responsive metallothionein promoter. Deletion of 72 AML1 C-terminal residues, which includes a transrepression domain, did not alter the activity of AML1-ER, whereas further deletion of 98 residues, removing the most potent AML1 transactivation domain (TAD), prevented rescue of cell cycle inhibition. Notably, the two variants which did not stimulate G1 exacerbated CBFbeta-SMMHC-mediated cell cycle arrest, suggesting that they dominantly inhibit AML1 activities. In addition, the two variants which stimulated G1 also induced apoptosis in 5-15% of the cells, an effect consistent with excessive G1 stimulation. These observations indicate that AML1 activates transcription of one or more genes critical for the G1 to S transition via its C-terminal transactivation domain.

AME is obtained by in-frame fusion of the AML1 and MDS1/EVI1 genes. We have previously shown that AME is a transcriptional repressor that induces leukemia in mice. In order to elucidate the role of AME in leukemic transformation, we investigated the interaction of AME with the transcription co-regulator CtBP1 and with members of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family. In this report, we show that AME physically interacts in vivo with CtBP1 and HDAC1 and that these co-repressors require distinct regions of AME for interaction. By using reporter gene assays, we demonstrate that AME represses gene transcription by CtBP1-dependent and CtBP1-independent mechanisms. Finally, we show that the interaction between AME and CtBP1 is biologically important and is necessary for growth upregulation and abnormal differentiation of the murine hematopoietic precursor cell line 32Dc13 and of murine bone marrow progenitors.","['Senyuk, Vitalyi', 'Chakraborty, Soumen', 'Mikhail, Fady M', 'Zhao, Rui', 'Chi, Yiqing', 'Nucifora, Giuseppina']","['Senyuk V', 'Chakraborty S', 'Mikhail FM', 'Zhao R', 'Chi Y', 'Nucifora G']","['Department of Pathology, The Cancer Center, University of Illinois at Chicago, 900 South Ashland Avenue, Chicago, IL 60607, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (AML1-MDS1-EVI1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (C-terminal binding protein)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alcohol Oxidoreductases', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 1', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphoproteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2002/06/26 10:00,2002/07/24 10:01,['2002/06/26 10:00'],"['2001/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2002/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205436 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 May 9;21(20):3232-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205436.,"['CA 67189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 72675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
