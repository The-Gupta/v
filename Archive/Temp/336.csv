Different kinds of treatment, depending upon the primary disease, often induced a rapid fall in the serum calcium concentration. The serum creatinine concentration always fell simultaneously. The serum phosphate concentration fell in all but two patients. Changes in serum calcium and serum creatinine correlated significantly (p less than 0.001), as did changes in serum calcium and serum phosphate concentrations (p less than 0.05). Serum calcium/serum creatinine and serum calcium/serum phosphate ratios were significantly higher in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism than in patients with hypercalcemia of non-hyperparathyroid origin (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.001). This suggests a different effect of calcium on the glomerular filtration rate in hyperparathyroid and non-hyperparathyroid patients, the latter group being more sensitive to the influence of hypercalcemia.

The other lines was exogenously infected at the level of plimary culture with Rauscher leukemia virus (RLV) and SV and showed gradual inhibition of oncornavirus functions. The presence of oncornavirus type C was not the necessary condition for the development of persistent SV infection, however it influenced the character of persistence. In both systems, sequential loss of the hemagglutinating and interferon-inducing activities, then infectivity of SV (61--82 days), and persistence of the noninfectious antigen of the arbovirus for 9 months were observed. The differences consisted in the time of appearance of homologous interference to SV: in the presence of oncornavirus earlier (40 days), under conditions of repressed oncornavirus genome later (179 days). Electron microscopic examinations showed that in the system infected with RLV and SV there occurred in the course of persistence a sharp activation of phagosome-lysosome complex accompanied by incorporation into phagocytolysomes of numerous intact and partially destroyed virions of SV and RLV and their release from cell with cytoplasmic fragments.

The mortality in adults was 55,6% and in children 35%. Sixty-five per cent of all deaths occurred within 24--48 hours of admission. Residual morbidity in survivors was common. The pattern of acute leukaemia in the same hospital population is predominantly myelocytic in both adults and children.","['Macdougall, L G', 'Strickwold, B']","['Macdougall LG', 'Strickwold B']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],South Africa,S Afr Med J,South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,0404520,,IM,"['Adult', '*African Americans', 'Blacks', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemoid Reaction/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'South Africa']",1978/01/07 00:00,1978/01/07 00:01,['1978/01/07 00:00'],"['1978/01/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/07 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/07 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,S Afr Med J. 1978 Jan 7;53(1):14-6.,,,,,,,,

Using reverse phase chromatography (RPC-5), we have analyzed the changes in the relative quantities of lysine tRNA species which occur in different cellular states of the Friend cell, a transformed murine cell infected with Friend erythroleukemia virus complex. This cell undergoes erythroid differentiation when exposed to various chemicals. Lysine tRNA4 comprises 32% of the total lysine tRNA in rapidly dividing, uninduced Friend cells, but only 16% of the total lysine tRNA in uninducase. Friend cells undergoing erythroid differentiation divide more slowly than uninduced cells, and finally cease proliferation, but lysine tRNA4 becomes the major lysine tRNA species (greater than 50%). This does not appear to reflect erythroid properties of the cell, since the lysine tRNA of the mouse reticulocyte contains very little lysine tRNA4. The non-dividing erythroid Friend cell, therefore, represents an exception to the finding that non-dividing cells usually have little or no lysine tRNA4 present.","['Kleiman, L', 'Woodward-Jack, J', 'Cedergren, R J', 'Dion, R']","['Kleiman L', 'Woodward-Jack J', 'Cedergren RJ', 'Dion R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'RNA, Transfer/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Reticulocytes/metabolism']",1978/03/01 00:00,1978/03/01 00:01,['1978/03/01 00:00'],"['1978/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/5.3.851 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1978 Mar;5(3):851-9. doi: 10.1093/nar/5.3.851.,,PMC342028,,,,,,

Sixty-three patients were randomized in PE and 82 outside a PE. The proportion of patients who survived long enough to receive an adequate trial was higher in the PE (97%) than out (82%) (P = .01). The complete remission (CR) rate was 71% in and 43% out of the PE (P less than .01). Fifty-five patients received PA and 90 received SA. The CR rates were 61% and 45%, respectively. Of the 145 patients, 73 (50%) developed 102 episodes of major infections. Twenty-six of 63 patients in the PE developed major infection compared to 47 of 82 outside a PE (P = .08). The incidence rate of 13% fatal infections in a PE was significantly smaller than the 28% rate outside a PE (P = .04). The number of days with infections at less than 500 neutrophils/mm3 was also significantly lower inside a PE than outside (P less than .01). When comparing patients receiving SA or PA, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of infections. Forty-one patients received OAP Chemotherapy and 104 received adriamycin-OAP plus BCG. The CR rate on OAP was 44% compared with 60% on Ad-OAP + BCG. Infection rates were 76% and 40%, respectively (P less than .01). The median survival time was 72 weeks for patients in PE compared with 42 weeks for patients outside a PE (P less than .01). The prophylactic antibiotic regimens were well tolerated by most patients. This prospective randomized study has demonstrated statistically significant advantages for a lowered risk of fatal infection, higher CR rate and longer survival of patients treated in a PE with prophylactic antibiotics compared with patients treated in a conventional hospital room.

However, inhibition of protein synthesis by emetine in P388/ADR cells was more reversible than in P388/S cells when the cells were exposed to emetine and subsequently incubated in drug-free medium for 1 hour prior to addition of labeled L-leucine. Differences between P388/S and P388/ADR cells were evident in vivo. The duration of inhibition (greater than 90%) of protein and DNA synthesis in P388/ADR cells was about 8 hours compared to 24 hours in P388/S cells following administration of a therapeutic dose of 25 mg emetine/kg to tumor-bearing mice. The level of radioactivity in the P388/ADR cells 24 hours after in vivo administration of the emetine analog, (+/-)-[3'-14C]2,3-dehydroemetine, was only 26% of that in P388/S cells.

The cytotoxicity results in inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis in P388, the latter inhibition occurring a few hours after the inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis. The antibiotic and antitumor activities are destroyed rapidly by ultraviolet light, which gives a product that differs little in amino acid composition, molecular weight, and antigenic property, but can be separated from the native macromomycin by ion exchange chromatography.

Two major findings were obtained: (a) spleen cells from A mice, injected with tumor cells from an in vitro tumor line YAC-1, derived from YACL, could generate a significant syngeneic cytotoxic response. In contrast, spleen cells from A mice injected with tumor cells from the in vivo tumor line failed to generate a syngeneic cytotoxic response. Thus, tumor cells from the in vitro line were more immunogeneic that those from the in vivo line. (b) Spleen cells from A mice which were injected with the cross-reactive allogeneic tumor RBL5, could generate significant cytotoxic responses to the syngeneic tumors YAC and YAC-1.

Their identification and metabolic relationships with ribosomal subunit proteins were investigated using co-electrophoresis of unlabeled polysomal proteins with labeled proteins of either nucleolar preribosomes or ribosomal subunits. The large and small ribosomal subunits contain 40 and 31 proteins, respectively. The nucleolar 80-S preribosomes were analysed after 2 and 5 h of incubation with tritiated valine and leucine and were shown to contain about 55 proteins. Most of them were identical to cytoplasmic ribosomal subunit proteins. The nucleolar 60-S preribosomes contain all the proteins which are common to 80-S preribosomes and large ribosomal subunits, and one additional protein (L10). The ribosomal proteins which were absent from nucleolar particles were found to be labeled in the cytoplasmic ribosomes after the same incubation period. Thus, in addition to the association of the bulk of ribosomal proteins with 45-S RNA within the 80-S preribosomes, results indicate that a group of ribosomal proteins and particularly from the small subunits, become associated at later stages of the maturation process of mammalian ribosomes. It was further shown that a set of 10 proteins, different from ribosomal polypeptides, were present in nucleolar preribosomal particles. Several of them were associated with polyribosomes in the cytoplasm, whereas the others were unique to the nucleolus.","['Auger-Buendia, M A', 'Longuet, M']","['Auger-Buendia MA', 'Longuet M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoproteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleolus/analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/methods', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Nucleoproteins/*analysis', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*analysis', 'Ribosomes/analysis']",1978/04/01 00:00,1978/04/01 00:01,['1978/04/01 00:00'],"['1978/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1978.tb12217.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1978 Apr;85(1):105-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1978.tb12217.x.,,,,,,,,

A third patient had, in one sample, a single abnormal cell with an extra No. 3 and an extra No. 12 (48,XY,+3,+12), and in a later sample, a second cell of poor morphology which also could have been trisomic for no. 12. The two patients with consistent chromosome abnormalities had rapidly progressive disease and a relatively short clinical course from the time of diagnosis (5 and 7 months, respectively). Further data are needed, but the results thus far suggest that patients with consistent chromosome abnormalities could be considered as candidates for aggressive combination chemotherapy.","['Golomb, H M', 'Lindgren, V', 'Rowley, J D']","['Golomb HM', 'Lindgren V', 'Rowley JD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Sex Chromosomes', 'Trisomy', '*Y Chromosome']",1978/04/01 00:00,1978/04/01 00:01,['1978/04/01 00:00'],"['1978/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(197804)41:4<1374::aid-cncr2820410422>3.0.co;2-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1978 Apr;41(4):1374-80. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197804)41:4<1374::aid-cncr2820410422>3.0.co;2-5.,,,,,,,,

In each experiment the Pt + CY combination was supra-additive, as has been shown with other Pt compounds when used with CY. HU at the dose used (1000 mg/kg) was only minimally effective when used alone. However, six of the seven Pt + CY + HU combination regiments enhanced markedly the increased life span of treated mice when compared with the corresponding dual Pt + CY combination. The triple drug regimen yielded cure rates (760-day survival) up to 70% in individual experiments. Collectively, the cure rate was 11% with the various Pt + CY combinations, and was increased to 53% upon inclusion of HU in the regimen. It is suggested that HU may inhibit a process whereby potentially lethal DNA damage produced by Pt + CY would otherwise be repaired. A reduced efficacy of HU when used at a single, high-dose level was also noted, and a possible mechanism and potential significance of this observation are discussed.","['Gale, G R', 'Atkins, L M', 'Meischen, S J', 'Schwartz, P']","['Gale GR', 'Atkins LM', 'Meischen SJ', 'Schwartz P']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Diuresis/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Hydroxyurea/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*therapeutic use']",1978/04/01 00:00,1978/04/01 00:01,['1978/04/01 00:00'],"['1978/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(197804)41:4<1230::aid-cncr2820410402>3.0.co;2-q [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1978 Apr;41(4):1230-4. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197804)41:4<1230::aid-cncr2820410402>3.0.co;2-q.,,,,,,,,

In addition, incubations to generate incomplete saturation of high-affinity intracellular MTX-binding sites were also carried out. Following determination of the total intracellular MTX, cells were pulsed with deoxyuridine (UdR) and its incorporation into DNA examined to assess the role of exchangeable and bound intracellular MTX on DNA synthesis. Further, cell pellets were disrupted and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) activity determined under each experimental condition. Extracellular MTX concentrations in excess of 1 muM depressed UdR incorporation to <2% of control, but incorporation rapidly recovered to 62% of control at the point of MTX-DHFR equivalence, and exceeded control values when all high-affinity sites were not saturated. DHFR activity was undetectable at extracellular MTX concentrations >0.50 muM, and never exceeded 6.09% of control at the ""equivalence point"" where all high-affinity sites were saturated. When less than 10% of potential inhibitor sites were occupied, enzyme activity increased rapidly, but never reached control. However, 5% of the DHFR activity was sufficient to permit UdR incorporation to continue at 50% of control levels, and UdR incorporation returned to control levels at 20% of the DHFR activity. The relationship between cellular MTX content and DNA synthesis or DHFR activity is sigmoid, suggesting a reversible interaction between enzyme and inhibitor. This lends support to the notion that ""free"" intracellular MTX is necessary for a maximal antitumour effect, and may explain its role in ""high-dose"" MTX therapy in man.","['Bender, R A', 'Makula, D M']","['Bender RA', 'Makula DM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Receptors, Drug)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Drug/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*metabolism']",1978/03/01 00:00,1978/03/01 00:01,['1978/03/01 00:00'],"['1978/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1978.60 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1978 Mar;37(3):403-10. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1978.60.,,PMC2009514,,,,,,

The inhibition of exudation that developed was independent of increased levels of serum corticosteroids and occurred in surgically adrenalectomized mice. Thus it was independent of steroid-induced effects on E-PMN. The accumulation of neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes (N-PMN) in TT-induced exudates was unaltered. Furthermore, N-PMN exudation in response to other inflammatory stimuli was similarly unimpaired in virus-infected mice, which confirmed the specificity of the inhibition for E-PMN. The virus entity in the FV complex responsible for the effect was not identified. Friend murine leukemia virus, the indigenous helper virus for the defective spleen focus-forming virus, alone, was incapable of inducing the inhibition. It is possible that the lack of participation of E-PMN in TT-induced immune inflammatory exudates in FV-infected mice reflects an unresponsiveness that contributes to the development and progression of leukemia in FV-infected mice.","['McGarry, M P', 'Styles, B D', 'Mirand, E A']","['McGarry MP', 'Styles BD', 'Mirand EA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['0 (Tetanus Toxoid)'],IM,"['Adrenal Glands/physiology', 'Adrenalectomy', 'Animals', 'Defective Viruses/immunology', 'Eosinophils/*immunology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/radiation effects', 'Inflammation/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Tetanus Toxoid/pharmacology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1978/04/01 00:00,1978/04/01 00:01,['1978/04/01 00:00'],"['1978/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/60.4.803 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1978 Apr;60(4):803-10. doi: 10.1093/jnci/60.4.803.,,,,,,,,

At present, there are no techniques to study directly immune response genes in man and so these observations are still strictly academic.

About 500,000 virions were required to detect activation of the classical pathway whereas 5,000 times as many virions were necessary to initiate the alternative pathway, indicating that in this system only the former is of biological significance. Disruption of the virus with Triton X-100 destroyed its ability to initiate the alternative pathway without affecting its ability to activate the classical pathway. After ultracentrifugation of disrupted virus the active component could be recovered in the supernate and was isolated by isoelectric focusing in granulated gels. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic and analysis and cyanogen bromide digestion studies revealed that the activity resided in a methionine-containing protein having a pI of 7.5 and a molecular weight of approximately equal to 15,000 daltons. The purified protein interacts strongly with Clq and efficiently activates Cl. RNase and lipolytic enzymes had no effect on the isolated protein but incubation with trypsin resulted in loss of activity.

This effect was enhanced by complement and was dose dependent, being almost complete at ALG concentrations of 100 microgram/ml. Inhibition was a property of ALG but not of normal horse globulin. However, short incubation of ALG with bone marrow cells occasionally stimulated colony growth and normal horse globulin regularly stimulated it. Three hours' incubation of bone marrow cells with ALG was needed to produce consistent colony inhibition, which was measurable as a reduction in the expected number of colonies and as a fall in the colony: cluster ratio of surviving cell aggregates. Absorption of ALG on acute myeloid leukaemia blast cells removed the inhibiting property of the ALG while preserving its lymphocytotoxic action. Serum from two patients receiving ALG treatment inhibited colony growth for up to 48 hours after ALG administration. The results suggest the presence in ALG of antibodies specifically cytotoxic to myeloid stem cells which may relate to its myleosuppressive properties in vivo, and also indicate that it should be possible to remove antimyeloid antibodies from ALG by absorption. The use of such purified ALG would have advantages in clinical bone marrow transplantation.","['Barrett, A J', 'Longhurst, P', 'Rosengurt, N', 'Hobbs, J R', 'Humble, J G']","['Barrett AJ', 'Longhurst P', 'Rosengurt N', 'Hobbs JR', 'Humble JG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Antilymphocyte Serum/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Clone Cells', 'Complement System Proteins', 'Cross Reactions', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Leukocytes/*immunology']",1978/02/01 00:00,1978/02/01 00:01,['1978/02/01 00:00'],"['1978/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.31.2.129 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1978 Feb;31(2):129-35. doi: 10.1136/jcp.31.2.129.,,PMC1145202,,,,,,

An initial isolation of ribonucleosides with an affinity gel containing an immobilized phenylboronic acid was used to improve selectivity and sensitivity. Response for all nucleosides was linear from 0.1 to 50 nmoles injected and good quantitation was obtained for 25 microliter or less of sample placed on the HPLC column. Excellent precision of analysis for urinary nucleosides was achieved on matrix dependent and independent samples, and the high resolution of the reversed-phase column allowed the complete separation of 9 nucleosides from other unidentified UV absorbing components at the 1-ng level. Supporting experimental data are presented on precision, recovery, chromatographic methods, minimum detection limit, retention time, relative molar response, sample clean-up, stability of nucleosides, boronate gel capacity, and application to analysis of urine from patients with leukemia and breast cancer. This method is now being used routinely for the determination of the concentration and ratios of nucleosides in urine from patients with different types of cancer and in chemotherapy response studies.","['Gehrke, C W', 'Kuo, K C', 'Davis, G E', 'Suits, R D', 'Waalkes, T P', 'Borek, E']","['Gehrke CW', 'Kuo KC', 'Davis GE', 'Suits RD', 'Waalkes TP', 'Borek E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Chromatogr,Journal of chromatography,0427043,"['0 (Boron Compounds)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)']",IM,"['Boron Compounds', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/urine', 'Ribonucleosides/*urine']",1978/03/21 00:00,1978/03/21 00:01,['1978/03/21 00:00'],"['1978/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1978/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0021-9673(00)88205-9 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chromatogr. 1978 Mar 21;150(2):455-76. doi: 10.1016/s0021-9673(00)88205-9.,,,,,,,,

Mutation of the original tumor probably accounts for the discordant results which have been reported. The LE-L2C subline was used to develop a multimodality therapy model of acute leukemia. Syngeneic strain 2 animals challenged with 3 x 10(5) LE-L2C cells developed overt leukemia in 14 +/- 3 (SD) days. When treated with cytoreductive chemotherapy, they relapsed with either systemic or central nervous system (CNS) disease. However, CNS relapse was prevented by craniospinal irradiation, yielding a uniform pattern of relapse. Preliminary studies suggest that active immunotherapy with nonspecific agents, such as BCG, or immunoreconstitution with thymosin may prolong the duration of remission and increase the percentage of long-term survivors. L2C leukemia may represent a useful animal model for structuring the principles that govern the interrelationship between chemotherapy and immunomudulation.","['Murphy, S']",['Murphy S'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Israel,Isr J Med Sci,Israel journal of medical sciences,0013105,"['0 (BCG Vaccine)', '61512-21-8 (Thymosin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', ""9007-81-2 (Freund's Adjuvant)"", 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'BCG Vaccine/therapeutic use', 'Carmustine/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', ""Freund's Adjuvant/therapeutic use"", 'Guinea Pigs', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Thymosin/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Isr J Med Sci. 1978 Jan;14(1):20-37.,,,,,,,,

Evidence of hemolysis supports the diagnosis, and a positive result of the Coombs test confirms it. Survival time is considerably shorter in patients who have both diseases than in those with chronic lymphocytic leukemia alone. Presenting symptoms in patients with the two diseases may include weakness, dizziness, fever, or hemorrhagic phenomena. If the anemia is severe, palpitations, otic pulsations, and cardiac decompensation are common. Physical examination may show enlargement of reticuloendothelial structures. On the other hand, some patients may be essentially asymptomatic. The hemolytic process must be treated as a separate entity, as even vigorous treatment of the leukemia often does not control it. Corticosteroid therapy is preferred, with splenectomy as a second line of defense. If the patient is not a good surgical risk, chemotherapy should be considered.

No common marker chromosomes were seen among the various tumors and no two tumors with chromosomal changes and identical karyotypes, though some chromosomes were involved more often than others. Excessive chromosomes in the primary tumors were usually due to extra chromosomes in the following groups (numbers of tumors involved are shown in parenthesis): No. 8 (7), No. 13 (4), No. 15 (4), No. 17 (6) and No. 21 (6). On the other hand, chromosomes losses, though much less frequent, involved chromosomes No. 5, No. 6, No. 7, No. 10 and No. 16. Most of the tumor cells with chromosomal changes were hyperdiploid and usually contained less than 60 chromosomes. Only one tumor contained hypodiploid cells.

One of these patients died of thoracic actinomycosis, having received immunosuppressive therapy for leukemia. The others progressed well after treatment. In one patient with intra-abdominal actinomycosis, the disease was confined to the greater omentum and was apparently unrelated to the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts. He recovered after excision of the greater omentum and large dosages of penicillin. A search of the literature reveals that other reports on seemingly isolated intra-abdominal actinomycosis describe disease adjacent to hollow organs which required their removal.

Both hypotheses were tested by comparing mortality and registration rates in cohorts of children from the North and South Islands of New Zealand. When school-children were offered vaccination in both islands, subsequent death rates from lymphomas and leukaemia were similar in the two islands. After withdrawal of vaccination in the South Island, mortality and registration rates for Hodgkin's disease remained similar in the two islands, but there was significant excess of deaths from non-Hodgkin lymphomas in the North Island. The difference in the registration rates for these tumours was much smaller than the difference in mortality rates and was not statistically significant. There was no evidence that BCG vaccination in the North Island prevented leukemia.

The enzyme solubilized by detergent from lymphocytes showed a substantially lower Km for CMP-sialic acid than did the serum enzyme, was less sensitive to several inhibitors, was not irreversible bound to Agarose, and had a substantial cation requirement.

A decrease in the rate of 86Rb transport was observed beginning approximately five hours after stimulation with 1.5% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), a potent inducer of Friend cell differentiation. By 12 to 14 hours after DMSO addition, the transport rate had stabilized at close to 60% of control level. This decrease in the rate of 86Rb transport preceded a previously reported decrease in cell volume. Other chemical inducers of Friend cells, such as hypoxanthine and ouabain, also caused early decreases in 86Rb influx. In contrast, xanthine, which does not induce Friend cell differentiation, also did not affect 86Rb influx. The transport of two amino acid analogues, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid and 2-aminobicyclo [2,2,1]-heptane-2-carboxylic acid, which differ in their mode of uptake, was also measured following induction by DMSO. The transport rates of both compounds decreased after a 12-hour exposure to DMSO. In contrast, the uptake of 3H-colchicine, a drug which diffuses passively across the cell membrane, was not significantly affected. Studies with several variant cell lines which do not synthesize hemoglobin in response to DMSO indicate that these non-inducible cells can be divided into two classes--those that demonstrate early changes in transport very similar to the changes observed in inducible cell lines and those which exhibit only small changes in transport. Results obtained using a revertant clone have helped to distinguish between those transport changes which are associated with the induction of hemoglobin synthesis and those which are not. In addition, these early transport changes may be useful in defining the stage in the differentiation process at which a particular variant line is blocked.","['Mager, D', 'Bernstein, A']","['Mager D', 'Bernstein A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Aminoisobutyric Acids)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '0 (Xanthines)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', 'MLT4718TJW (Rubidium)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/metabolism', 'Aminoisobutyric Acids/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Colchicine/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hypoxanthines/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Radioisotopes', 'Rubidium/metabolism', 'Xanthines/pharmacology']",1978/03/01 00:00,1978/03/01 00:01,['1978/03/01 00:00'],"['1978/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1040940305 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1978 Mar;94(3):275-85. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1040940305.,,,,,,,,

The suspension medium from the bone marrow liquid cultures which sustained megakaryopoiesis was not directly acitive in stimulating megakaryocyte colony formation in the semisolid agar cultures, but potentiated the number of colonies detected when WEHI-3CM was present. Bone marrow-conditioned medium increased the sensitivity of megakaryocyte progenitor cells to the stimulus in WEHI-3CM. Addition of the activities present in the two sources produced a quantitative assay for the detection of mouse megakaryocyte progenitor cells.

The leukemia is therefore used here to test the hypothesis that in leukemia the CFU-C are expelled from the active cell cycle to a resting state and are thereby less sensitive to cycle-dependent chemotherapeutic agents. The L5222 leukemia has the advantage that the leukemic blast cells do not form colonies in agar culture so that normal CFU-C can be assessed under leukemic conditions. To compare the proportions of CFU-C in the S-phase in normal and leukemic rats, two S-phase-specific agents, 3H-thymidine and hydroxyurea, were used to kill proliferating bone marrow cells. Following treatment with 3H-thymidine in vitro, about 41% of the CFU-C were killed in normal and about 25% in leukemic bone marrow. Hydroxyurea administered in vivo resulted in the death of about 33% and 26%, respectively. The results indicate that fewer normal CFU-C are in S-phase in the L5222 leukemia, which might help to explain how enough normal stem cells survive chemotherapy to regenerate the bone marrow.","['Harriss, E B', 'Hoelzer, D']","['Harriss EB', 'Hoelzer D']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Rats', 'Thymidine/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1978/02/01 00:00,1978/02/01 00:01,['1978/02/01 00:00'],"['1978/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)72723-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1978 Feb;51(2):221-7.,,,,,,,,

Anionic congeners of the 9-anilinoacridines.,5-10,"To investigate the possible importance of small levels of sulfonamide anion in the antileukemia (L1210) 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfonanilides, an anionic derivative was prepared, in which -COOH replaced -NHSO2CH3, and shown to have experimental antitumor activity. Analogue synthesis and evaluation show that acceptable placement of the carboxylate function on the 9-anilino ring is restricted to the 1'-position. While the 1'-COOH and 1'-(CH2)2COOH analogues proved active, the intermediate acetate variant (1'-CH2COOH) was inactive. There were marked differences in the effects of added acridine ring substituents, on biologic activity, depending on the function attached to the 9-anilino ring (1'-NHSO2CH3 or 1'-COOH). Consideration of the vector components of possible drug-binding forces, acting on a DNA-intercalated agent, suggests that there may be low-energy barriers to two-dimensional reorientation of a planar, intercalated chromophore in relation to the neighboring purine-pyrimidine base pairs. It is proposed that site forces from an added substituent could lead to modified DNA-binding orientations. Observed acridine-ring substituent effects on biologic activity would then depend on the 9-anilino ring function (1'-NHSO2CH3, 1'-COOH) employed.","['Denny, W A', 'Atwell, G J', 'Cain, B F']","['Denny WA', 'Atwell GJ', 'Cain BF']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Acridines/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00199a002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1978 Jan;21(1):5-10. doi: 10.1021/jm00199a002.,,,,,,,,

The former may be related to genetic and/or perinatal environmental factors and the latter, to environmental factors, in early childhood. Excess occurrences of gliomas among Irish, Scottish and Icelandic offsprings were observed, which possibly indicates the importance of either genetic or environmental factors peculiar to these ethnic groups.

The initial experiments must be performed with subcellular or cellular model systems. For the studies with arabinosyl nucleosides we have chosen those enzyme systems, synthesizing DNA and RNA; being precursor analogues, the different arabinosyl nucleosides have been added in the triphosphate state to the different DNA- and RNA polymerase assays. 1-beta-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine-5'-triphosphate has been found to inhibit the RNA-dependent DNA polymerases (isolated from oncogenic RNA viruses) 200-fold more sensitively than viral and cellular DNA-dependent DNA polymerases. Recent results, showing that RNA-leukemia-virus-related sequences are present in DNA of some human leukemia patients might support the assumption that the efficacy of this antimetabolite in the treatment of acute leukemia is due to its, at least relative selective inhibitory activity on reverse transcriptase. 9-beta-D-Arabinofuranosyladenine-5'-triphosphate is a strong inhibitor of cellular DNA polymerases with the cytological consequence of an inhibition of cell proliferation. The clinical benefit of the compound in treatment of tumors is dependent on their levels of adenosine deaminase. The triphosphate of this compound is a 100-fold more sensitive inhibitor of the herpesvirus DNA polymerase compared to the cellular replicative DNA polymerase. In addition the analogue, incorporated into herpesvirus DNA, acts as chain terminator. These effects are the biochemical basis for the highly selective antiherpesvirus activity of this antimetabolite.

To determine the Fv-2 genotype, G mice were crossed with Fv-2rr mice, and the hybrids were tested for the susceptibility to NB-tropic Friend virus. The (G X Fv-2rr) F1 hybrids were similar to G. In F1 X Fv-2rr backcross generation, three types of mice appeared; 1) G type, 2) Fv-2rr type and 3) Fv-2ss type. Mice of the last type supported virus replication and developed splenomegaly. Mice of types 1), 2) and 3) appeared with the expected ratio of 2:1:1. It will be concluded that in G mice Fv-4r gene suppresses the virus replication, and hence masks the expression of Fv-2s gene.

Patterns obtained from the cell lines were similar to that from normal lymph node lymphocytes and differed markedly to plasma cells.

Since local reaction to BCG occurred much earlier in presensitized than in unvaccinated animals, we speculate that the destruction of tumor cells and hence the antigenic stimulus was too premature in presensitized animals to build up a BCG-mediated antitumor immunity.","['Dopatka, H D', 'Majer, M', 'Hennessen, W', 'Mauler, R']","['Dopatka HD', 'Majer M', 'Hennessen W', 'Mauler R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Dev Biol Stand,Developments in biological standardization,0427140,['0 (BCG Vaccine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'BCG Vaccine/*therapeutic use', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy']",1977/04/13 00:00,1977/04/13 00:01,['1977/04/13 00:00'],"['1977/04/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/04/13 00:01 [medline]', '1977/04/13 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Dev Biol Stand. 1977 Apr 13-15;38:359-62.,,,,,,,,

The fungi which cause most of the infections in cancer patients are Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. These fungi seldom infect individuals with normal host defence mechanisms. Many factors predispose patients to fungal infection, including neutropenia, lymphopenia, gastro-intestinal ulceration, intravenous catheters and adrenal corticosteroid therapy. Candida spp. cause 5 major types of infection: dermatitis, thrush, gastro-intestinal, primary organ and disseminated infection. Aspergillus spp. and Phycomycetes cause pulmonary, disseminated or rhino-cerebral infection. Cryptococcus neoformans usually causes meningitis but may cause pneumonia or disseminated infection. The diagnosis of fungal infection is often made only at postmortem examination, because it is difficult to isolate the aetiological agent from sites of infection. Amphotericin B remains the mainstay of antifungal therapy, but is seldom effective in the patient with compromised host defences. Successful management of these infections in the future will depend upon improvement in diagnostic capabilities as well as the introduction of more effective and less toxic antifungal agents.","['Bodey, G P']",['Bodey GP'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],South Africa,S Afr Med J,South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,0404520,['7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)'],IM,"['Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/complications', 'Candidiasis/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Mycoses/*complications/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Nocardia Infections/complications']",1977/12/10 00:00,1977/12/10 00:01,['1977/12/10 00:00'],"['1977/12/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/12/10 00:01 [medline]', '1977/12/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,S Afr Med J. 1977 Dec 10;52(25):1009-15.,,,,,,,,

To test this thesis, a series of experiments were performed to test the effect of zinc deficiency on the lethality of a variety of solid and ascites tumors in mice and rats. Specifically, the following models were tested: Walker 256 carcinosarcomas, solid and ascites forms in rats; three mouse leukemias (L5178yf, L1210, and P388) in CDF, male mice; and Lewis lung carcinoma in C57BI/6 male mice. Rats receiving a zinc-deficient diet showed marked reduction of tumor growth, both of solid or ascites models, and this was accompanied by striking increase in survival. Survival of mice with transplanted leukemia was also significantly prolonged by zinc deficiency. In addition, growth of the Lewis lung carcinoma was inhibited, but the survival through increased, was probably limited by the adverse effects of zinc deficiency. The results suggest that tumor inhibition is a general effect of zinc deficiency, irrespective of cell type, cell growth rate, species, or site of growth.

Animals were sacrificed on days 2, 5, 9, 11, and 14, and specimens of liver were fixed and embedded for light and electron microscopy. From some mice, samples of bone marrow and spleen were also processed for microscopy. Hepatic erythropoiesis was established as early as 2 to 5 days after inoculation. Often, red cell maturation occurred in typical islands. These included a central macrophage which in many instances appeared to be a Kupffer cell. The number and size of red cell foci increased through day 14. Extensive ineffective erythropoiesis involving erythroblast death occurred within these foci. This premature cell death may be related to large inclusions, thought to be autophagosomes, in the cytoplasm of erythroblasts. A few undifferentiated cells, presumed to be the reticulum cells of Friend virus disease, were observed in the liver at 9 to 14 days after infection. The morphology of these cells resembled that of primitive hemopoietic elements. These studies indicate that the liver, along with the spleen, contributes to the polycythemia in the early phase of Friend virus disease.","['Orlic, D', 'Mirand, E A']","['Orlic D', 'Mirand EA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,,IM,"['Animals', 'Erythroblasts/ultrastructure', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Liver/*physiopathology/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Time Factors']",1977/12/01 00:00,1977/12/01 00:01,['1977/12/01 00:00'],"['1977/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1977 Dec;37(6):579-87.,,,,,,,,

Some of these account for the familiar proneness of certain mouse strains to develop leukemias. The two experiments described below were designed to (a) identify such preleukemic changes in blood-forming tissues and (b) to find ways to manipulate them experimentally with the purpose of preventing leukemia. Preleukemic change of the bone marrow appears to be a mere quantitative departure from normal in a qualitatively non-malignant tissue. It entails increased proneness of immature (precursor) cells to react with latent virus. Our data are consistent with the assumption that this proneness is enhanced (or brought about) by removal of a controlling influence exerted by the mature cells over their precursors (feed-back inhibition). Re-irradiation combined with intravenous bone marrow substitution offsets the leukemogenic influence of an earlier radiation exposure. The effect of re-irradiation on bone marrow displaying preleukemic lesions corroborates conclusions from earlier experiments on the nature of these lesions.","['Ludwig, F C', 'Smoke, M E', 'Schug, W G', 'Bostick, W L']","['Ludwig FC', 'Smoke ME', 'Schug WG', 'Bostick WL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Res Exp Med (Berl),Research in experimental medicine.

The magnitude of the release is defined in terms of the percentage of total excess cancer mortalities relative to the number that would have been expected in the same population had the accident not occurred. The increased risk is expressed as the change in life expectancy as a function of age at the time of exposure. Loss of life-years per person is calculated for an increase of 0.1, 1, 10 and 100% in cancer deaths and are quoted for ages 1, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 years at time of exposure. The variation of the effect with age may be summarised using the ratio of the reduced life expectancy to the reduced life expectancy for a person aged zero at the time of the accident. For the initial external dose, this ratio exhibits a linear decrease up to about age 45 years at the rate of about 2% per year so, for example, the increased risk for a person aged 40 at exposure is 20% of the increased risk of a child just born.

Immunoprecipitation of l-[(35)S]methionine-labeled cell extracts demonstrated that several different virus-specific proteins antigenically related to the virion core (gag) proteins p12 and p30 become radioactive within 1 min of labeling and exhibit labeling kinetics characteristic of primary translation products. The most abundant of these were proteins with molecular weights of 75,000 and 65,000. There were, in addition, two large glycosylated polyproteins with apparent molecular weights of 220,000 and 230,000, which were precipitated by antisera to p30 or p12 but not by antiserum to the major envelope glycoproteins gp69/71. Several lines of evidence, including labeling with d-[(3)H]glucosamine and binding to insolubilized lectins, suggested that the 75,000-dalton internal core polyprotein is slowly processed to form a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 93,000. On the contrary, the 65,000-dalton protein appeared to be an immediate precursor to the virion core proteins. Its processing can involve intermediates containing p30 and p12 antigens with molecular weights of 50,000 and 40,000; however, the latter did not appear to be obligatory intermediates. The detection of the 40,000-dalton protein suggested that the genes for p30 and p12 are adjacent on the viral genome. These results indicated that there are several pathways of synthesis and post-translational processing of polyprotein precursors to the gag proteins and that several of these polyproteins are glycosylated. A comparison of gag precursor processing in rapidly growing, slowly growing, and stationary cells indicated that different pathways are favored under different conditions of cell growth. Our analysis of envelope glycoprotein synthesis has confirmed the existence of two rapidly labeled 90,000-dalton glycoproteins, which appear to be precursors to the envelope glycoproteins gp69/71.","['Evans, L H', 'Dresler, S', 'Kabat, D']","['Evans LH', 'Dresler S', 'Kabat D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', '*Friend murine leukemia virus/growth & development', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Precursors/*biosynthesis', 'Viral Proteins/*biosynthesis']",1977/12/01 00:00,1977/12/01 00:01,['1977/12/01 00:00'],"['1977/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.24.3.865-874.1977 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1977 Dec;24(3):865-74. doi: 10.1128/JVI.24.3.865-874.1977.,,PMC516008,,,,,,

Blocking with monomeric IgM confirmed this interpretation. These results are used to reconcile previously conflicting reports concerning the presence or absence of a receptor for C3 on the hairy cells of LRE, and to suggest that the disease is accompanied by a severe reduction of normal B lymphocytes.","['Burns, G F', 'Cawley, J C', 'Barker, C R', 'Hayhoe, F G']","['Burns GF', 'Cawley JC', 'Barker CR', 'Hayhoe FG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['*Binding Sites', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Complement C3/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology', 'Rosette Formation']",1977/09/01 00:00,1977/09/01 00:01,['1977/09/01 00:00'],"['1977/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1977 Sep;29(3):442-6.,,PMC1541073,,,,,,

The possible relationship between therapy, the monosomy 7 and the other bone marrow abnormalities is briefly discussed.

This finding is compatible with somewhat later origins for the cancers actually caused by the radiation exposures (radiogenic cases) than for other (idiopathic) cases which proved fatal before 10 years of age. Therefore the usual time for incurring congenital anomalies (or the first trimester of foetal life) could be the commonest time for initiating childhood cancers. The theoretical implications of this and other findings of the Oxford Survey are discussed within the framework of a theory which assumes that all mutant cells have cancer potentialities and that defects in the immune surveillance mechanism favour multiplication of these cells (or endogenous sources of self-replicating foreign proteins) as well as live pathogens (or exogenous sources of self-replicating foreign proteins).,"['Kneale, G W', 'Stewart, A M']","['Kneale GW', 'Stewart AM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fetus/*radiation effects', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Male', '*Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Radiography/adverse effects', 'Statistics as Topic']",1977/10/01 00:00,1977/10/01 00:01,['1977/10/01 00:00'],"['1977/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1977.220 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1977 Oct;36(4):501-10. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1977.220.,,PMC2025372,,,,,,

The specificity of the attachment was demonstrated by showing that cells, carrying specific membrane-bound immunoglobulins, attached only to the corresponding anti-immunoglobulins. This indicated that the method could be used for cell sorting. The attachment of cells to proteins was influenced by the amount of bound protein, incubation time, temperature and the degree of trypsinization.

When the cases were histologically reexamined without knowledge of their clinical outcome or initial clinical features, 19 were diagnosed as benign, 10 as malignant, 37 as AH, and 4 as angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy. None of the patients of the first group developed a malignant lymphoma, but lymphoma occurred in 30% of the AH group. This latter group was divided into two subgroups according to the expectation of the course of disease; those with a probably malignant course and those with a probably benign course.

Each form of therapy has advantages and disadvantages, and thus treatment should be individualized. While therapy with radioactive iodine would appear to be ideal since it does not require an operation and is less expensive than surgical management, it suffers from a high rate of progressive hypothyroidism and from the fact that the time until a euthyroid state is obtained is often prolonged. In addition, the long-term carcinogenic risk of the therapy for thyroid neoplasia has never been completely defined since the data most often quoted have a mean follow-up time of only eight years. Furthermore, new ""low-dose"" radioiodine regimens may be more dangerous in this regard. Subtotal thyroidectomy, while not totally without complications, remains a rapid, safe, and effective treatment for Graves' disease. The careful use of propranolol has facilitated the preparation of some patients and has lessened the risk of operation.

These cases only concern the common types of the WHO classification of LS, i.e., the prolymphocytic, the lymhoblastic, and the immunoblastic. Some cases have also been classified by cell surface markers. The secondarily leukemic conversion occurred in 40% of the lymphoblastic types, in 14% of the prolymphocytic types, and in 17% of the immunoblastic types. It never occurred at stage I but could occur after any other stage. The mediastinal involvement was observed in three types, but most often in the lymphoblastic type. The prognosis after an acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) treatment comprising active immunotherapy following chemo(radio)therapy is better for the leukemic prolymphocytic and lymphoblastic LS than for the immunoblastic type. Two patients (one of the lymphoblastic type) are in complete remission after 8 and 5 years, respectively. We have described ten cases of ""d'emblee"" leukemic LS with either large lymphoid or extra-lymphoid masses, bone marrow leukemic cell involvement, and LS aspects of neoplastic cells. Mediastinal abdominal, or other tumor masses are frequent. The prognosis for ""d'emblee"" leukemic LS following an ALL treatment is less favorable than ALL prognosis for patients of all ages including children. However, the first remission curve breaks at the 18th month and may form a plateau for about 30% of the patients of all ages. One patient has been in remission for more than 8 years after immunotherapy. We have also described ten cases of lymphoid neoplasia, whose cells cytologically and by the intensity of Ig secretion resemble leukemic prolymphocytic LS cells. However, the disease is more sensitive to CLL treatment than to LS or ALL treatment. Hence, there may be transitional conditions between leukemic LS and CLL. Finally, we have discussed the different possible frontiers between nonleukemic and leukemic LS and proposed two tests to detect the leukemic stage early: the systematic search for LS cells in the peripheral blood after concentration of nucleated cells by centrifugation and for cells carrying immune markers in the isolated mononuclear cell population of peripheral blood and the bone marrow.","['Mathe, G', 'Misset, J L', 'Gil-Delgado, M', 'Delgado, M', 'De Vassal, F']","['Mathe G', 'Misset JL', 'Gil-Delgado M', 'Delgado M', 'De Vassal F']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Recent Results Cancer Res,Recent results in cancer research.

The association of bone marrow fibrosis with large numbers of myeloblasts in the peripheral blood has rarely been reported and suggests a spectrum of morphological changes in acute myeloproliferative disorders, analogous to the merging of chronic myeloproliferative disorders into one another and into leukemic blast crisis.","['Spector, J I', 'Miller, S']","['Spector JI', 'Miller S']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*pathology']",1978/11/01 00:00,1978/11/01 00:01,['1978/11/01 00:00'],"['1978/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1978 Nov;102(11):564-6.,,,,,,,,

The Candida cells were typically well preserved despite the autolytic changes in parenchymal cells. Extracellular fungi were often coated with fibrin or associated with capillary thrombi, which suggests that Candida cells synthesize a procoagulant substance. The outer flocular coat of the yeast cell appeared to be partially of host origin since it diminished in thickness when organisms were cultured in media devoid of serum protein.

Lower ability to form 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine 5'-triphosphate or to allow access to the intracellular space was eliminated as an explanation for the resistance. Cells from an ara-A-resistant human leukemia were tested, and the DNA synthesis of the cells, in either whole cells or cell-free extract, was unaffected by ara-A or 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine 5'-triphosphate, respectively.

Our findings indicate the non-neoplastic nature of lymphoblastoid cell lines in spite of their high proliferative activity in vitro and their aneuploidy after long-term cultivation.

The 14q+-marker chromosome, observed in Burkitt's lymphoma as well as in other malignant lymphomas, seems to be related to neoplasia, independent on the presence of EBV.

A new approach to the analysis of the data was formulated employing the principles of impulse analysis. This allowed the quantitation of cell transport between various locations making the minimum number of assumptions. It was also possible to take account of the principal defect of this label, its tendency to elute from live cells. 3. In spite of marked lymphocytosis, numbers of cells moving between those tissues whose lymphocytes exchange relatively slowly and the bloodstream was found to be normal. The blood and lymph nodes may therefore accumulate lymphocytes in response to a transport defect which hinders the progress of these cells from one pool to another. 4. The finding that CLL lymphocytes fluxes are normal in certain locations casts doubt on the hypothesis that lymphocyte proliferation is uncontrolled in this disease. An alternative possibility is that cell proliferation is regulated so as to maintain these fluxes within the normal range.","['Bazerbashi, M B', 'Reeve, J', 'Chanarin, I']","['Bazerbashi MB', 'Reeve J', 'Chanarin I']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,['0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Movement', 'Chromium Radioisotopes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood', 'Leukocyte Count', '*Lymphocytes', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood', 'Male', 'Methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological']",1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1978 Jan;20(1):37-51.,,,,,,,,

The drug concentrations varied 100-fold, with high levels associated with neurotoxicity and low levels with a poor response to therapy. CSF-MTX concentration was correlated directly with patient age, suggesting that a constant dose, regardless of age or BSA, should provide more consistent CSF-drug concentrations. In a subsequent study 25 patients treated with a conventional-dose schedule of 12 mg/m2 of BSA were compared with a matched group of 24 patients administered a constant dose of 12 mg. There was significantly less variability of drug levels in the CSF with the constant-dose method than with the dosage derived from BSA.

The problem is most serious in hematological tumors (leukemia, lymphosarcoma) where the primary cause of death is infection. During the period of activity of the disease, and also in relation to the antimitotic treatment, the PMN will decrease in absolute count and will function poorly. The consequence will be a high frequency of bacterial infections, sepsis, pneumonia, skin infections, etc., predominantly caused by gram-negative germs and staphylococcus (any germ considered not to be ""very virulent"" can be found); and it will result in a high mortality rate. When these children are in remission or have solid tumors, the problem is not so acute, and bears more relation to antimitotic treatment and other extraneous factors (hospitalization, catheters, antibiotics, gastrointestinal ulcers...).

To test this hypothesis, we measured the metabolism of a model drug, para-aminosalicylate (PAS). Volunteers and cancer patients ingested a single oral dose (2 g) of PAS and we measured the plasma disappearance curve of the drug and its metabolite. In 7 patients suffering from lymphosarcoma, acute or chronic leukaemia and resistant to cancer chemotherapy, we observed low plasma PAS concentrations, an increase in PAS acetylation and an increased number (and a higher frequency) of abnormal liver-function tests. In 14 patients with malignant blood disease, yet responding well to chemotherapy, the metabolism of PAS is similar to that of healthy controls of the same age and sex. The plasma half-life of PAS is similar in sensitive and resistant patients, but slightly longer than in volunteers. Finally, in urine collected 120 min after drug administration, we observed the same results as in plasma. In conclusion, cancer patients resistant to chemotherapy do not metabolize the model drug PAS as volunteers or sensitive patients do, and this might be relevant to the terminal stage of the disease.","['Lavigne, J G', 'Barry, A', ""d'Auteuil, C"", 'Delage, J M']","['Lavigne JG', 'Barry A', ""d'Auteuil C"", 'Delage JM']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Aminosalicylic Acids)', '5B2658E0N2 (Aminosalicylic Acid)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminosalicylic Acid/blood/*metabolism/urine', 'Aminosalicylic Acids/*metabolism', 'Chronic Disease', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1977/05/01 00:00,1977/05/01 00:01,['1977/05/01 00:00'],"['1977/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1977.91 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1977 May;35(5):580-6. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1977.91.,,PMC2025501,,,,,,

The human myeloid line, K-562, which is highly susceptible to NK cells, was employed. ADCC was assessed with antibody-coated chick erythrocytes as targets. NK cells and ADCC were detected in a 4-hour 51Cr release assay. The magnitude of the enhancement was proportionate to the amount of interferon used in preincubation of the effector cells. Preincubation of tumor-target cells with interferon does not increase their susceptibility or resistance to lysis. The major effect of interferon on the cellular metabolism of the tumor-target cell is inhibition of DNA synthesis, but no direct cytotoxic effect was detected. Our findings may be important in understanding the mode of action of interferon in increasing host resistance to a variety of pathogens and tumors. This may be accomplished by inhibiting the growth of the tumor while simultaneously enhancing the natural killing mechanism for immunosurveillance.","['Attallah, A M', 'Folks, T']","['Attallah AM', 'Folks T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Appl Immunol,International archives of allergy and applied immunology,0404561,"['63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Chickens', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA/biosynthesis']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000232367 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Appl Immunol. 1979;60(4):377-82. doi: 10.1159/000232367.,,,,,,,,

Studied were 364 blood samples drawn from 196 patients; 173 patients had idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; 65 (93 %) of 70 in the acute phase of their disease had elevated PBIgG (values up to 100 times greater than the normal); 98 (76.5 %) of 128 blood samples from patients during a chronic phase had abnormally high PBIgG but the levels of IgG were generally lower than those observed in the acute phase; 75 (75 %) of 100 samples from patients in remission did not have pathologically increased PBIgG. Usually when the platelet count improved (after prednisone therapy or after splenectomy), PBIgG decreased. The PBIgG determination was not useful for predicting the response to prednisone therapy or the further evolution of the disease, except when PGIgG remained elevated after high-dose prednisone therapy; this generally implied a poor prognosis. PBIgG have also been found elevated in other diseases such as lupus erythematosus and in one case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

The clinical, haematological and physiopathological aspects responsible for splenic change are considered for each individual disease on the basis of personal experience.","['Sgro, M', 'Besnati, M', 'Massazza, C']","['Sgro M', 'Besnati M', 'Massazza C']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Minerva Chir,Minerva chirurgica,0400726,,IM,"['Cysts/surgery', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/surgery', 'Humans', 'Hypersplenism', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell', 'Male', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic', '*Splenectomy', 'Splenic Diseases/*surgery', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*surgery', 'Splenic Rupture/surgery', 'Thalassemia']",1979/05/15 00:00,1979/05/15 00:01,['1979/05/15 00:00'],"['1979/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1979/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Minerva Chir. 1979 May 15;34(9):749-58.,Splenectomia.

Animal models useful in studying immune responsiveness in cancer research are discussed, which could be of value in studying the effect of alcoholism. Allogeneic tumor grafts are poorly rejected in immunosuppressed mice. Of the four major cellular elements of the immune system, the macrophage appears to have a critical role in immune surveillance. Several conditions occur which abrogate or restrict the tumoricidal activity of macrophages. Stress induced by physical restraint results in depressed macrophage activation. The tumoricidal activation induced in macrophages by interferon was markedly depressed in the presence of the corticosteroids, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and dexamethasone. In addition, prostaglandins (PGE1 and PGE2) also were found to decrease interferon activation of macrophages. Since immune deficiency is a trait of alcoholism and cancer, animal models with defined, measurable, immunological parameters would be useful in studying the effect of alcohol on cellular immunity.","['Chirigos, M A', 'Schultz, R M']","['Chirigos MA', 'Schultz RM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Prostaglandins E, Synthetic)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/pharmacology', 'Alcoholism/complications/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Carmustine/pharmacology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/etiology', 'Prostaglandins E, Synthetic/pharmacology', 'Stress, Physiological/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1979/07/01 00:00,1979/07/01 00:01,['1979/07/01 00:00'],"['1979/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1979 Jul;39(7 Pt 2):2894-8.,,,,,,,,

Exposure to UV irradiation induced no gaps in L5178Y-R cells.

These results suggest that in the L1010 cell melphalan is transported equally by a BCH-sensitive, sodium-independent L system and a BCH-insensitive, sodium-dependent L system.","['Vistica, D T']",['Vistica DT'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Leucine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Melphalan/*metabolism/pharmacology']",1979/01/19 00:00,1979/01/19 00:01,['1979/01/19 00:00'],"['1979/01/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/19 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(79)90217-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(79)90217-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1979 Jan 19;550(2):309-17. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(79)90217-7.,,,,,,,,

In another group the same dose was injected directly to fetuses of Wistar rats on day 22 p.c. after surgical delivery with subsequent feeding by nurses. The same single dose was given to 1 and 2 days old Wistar rats as well as to 10 and 30 days old Sprague-Dawley rats.

Comparison of survival time and tumor rates between the rats treated diaplacentally or directly on day 22 p.c. and the rats treated neonatally revealed significant differences. This shows that the nervous tissue of the rat is less sensitive to BNU prenatally than in the neonatal phase of development. After application of BNU on day 10 post partum (p.p.) in Sprague-Dawley rats greater than 95% of the animals developed almost exclusively neurogenic tumors with a high percentage of brain tumors. After a single dose on day 30 p.p. a significant increase in survival time and a significant decrease in the total tumor yield is observed in comparison to the animals treated on day 10. Additionally a decrease in the rate of neurogenic tumors is accompanied by an increase of tumors outside the nervous system.

Mo-MuLV83, in contrast to the ecotropic Mo-MuLV, demonstrated a broadened host range, i.e., growth not only on mouse cells but also on mink cells, and recombination involved the env gene function. The genomic RNA of these two viruses shared 42 out of a total of 51 to 53 large T1 oligonucleotides (81%) and possessed a similar subunit size of 36S. Most of these T1 oligonucleotides were mapped in their relative order to the 3' polyadenylic acid end of the viral RNA molecules. There were 10 common oligonucleotides immediately next to the 3' termini. A cluster of 7 (in Mo-MuLV83) or 10 (in Mo-MuLV) unique T1 oligonucleotides were mapped next to the common sequences at the 3' end, and they all appeared concomitantly in a polyadenylic acid-containing RNA fraction with a sedimentation coefficient slightly larger than 18S. Therefore, the env gene of Mo-MuLV was situated at a location approximately 2,000 to 4,000 nucleotides from the 3' end of the genomic RNA, and the gene order of Mo-MuLV appeared to be similar to that of the more rigorously determined avian oncornaviruses. cDNA(SFFV) specific for the xenotropic sequences in the spleen focus-forming virus RNA hybridized to the cluster of unique oligonucleotides of Mo-MuLV83 RNA. This suggests that the loci of recombination involve the homologous env gene region of a xenotropic virus.","['Shih, T Y', 'Weeks, M O', 'Troxler, D H', 'Coffin, J M', 'Scolnick, E M']","['Shih TY', 'Weeks MO', 'Troxler DH', 'Coffin JM', 'Scolnick EM']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Mink', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*analysis/genetics/growth & development', 'Oligonucleotides/*analysis', 'RNA, Viral/*analysis/genetics']",1978/04/01 00:00,1978/04/01 00:01,['1978/04/01 00:00'],"['1978/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.26.1.71-83.1978 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1978 Apr;26(1):71-83. doi: 10.1128/JVI.26.1.71-83.1978.,,PMC354035,,,,,,

This conclusion was reached by investigating the immunological reactivity of C57BL/6 mice following inoculation with two isolates of LLV. Circumstantial evidence obtained by examining the replication of FLC and LLV, the antibody response to E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the ability of syngeneic macrophages administered together with the antigen to restore the response to SRC points to the same conclusion.

L1210 cells were incubated with L4 or E4, and the metabolic and morphological characteristics of the cells were assessed. Dose-dependent inhibition of up to 90% occurs for [3H]thymidine and [14C]uridine incorporation. L4 is 30 to 50 times more potent an inhibitor than is E4. Inhibition begins 2 to 3 hr after exposure of L1210 cells to L4 and persists for as long as the cells are exposed to this isoleuctin. Total DNA and oxygen consumption in L4-treated cultures is also decreased. Whereas protein synthesis assessed by [14C]valine incorporation is less affected, glucose utilization remains unchanged. The binding of L4 and E4 to L1210 cells and human lymphocytes is similar and is reversible by porcine thyroglobulin. Porcine thyroglobulin also reverses L4-induced inhibition of nucleotide incorporation.

Damage produced by radionuclide decay outside the cell nucleus was studied on cells exposed to 125I labeled, monovalent concanavalin A. After labeling, the cells were resynchronized in G1-phase and incubated for 36 h at 4 degrees C to permit dose accumulation. Cell lethality was evaluated by the standard colony assay. Based on radionuclide incorporation data, cellular dimensions, and subcellular radionuclide distributions, the cumulative dose to whole cells, cell nuclei, and cellular cytoplasm was calculated from the known decay properties of 3H and 125I. As expected, DNA associated 125I (LD50: 60 decays/cell; 45 rad) was much more toxic to CHO cells than 3H (LD50: 1350 decays/cell; 380 rad) 380 rad) or external X-irradiation (LD50: 330 rad). In contrast, membrane associated 125I was surprisingly non-toxic (LD50: 19 600 decays/cell). At 19 600 decays/cell the dose to the cell membrane was approximately 52 krad and the overlap dose into the cytoplasm was about 2470 rad. Even at these high dose levels, membrane damage or cytoplasmic damage apparently did not contribute significantly to radiation induced cell death. With 19 600 decays on the plasma membrane the CHO nuclei received an overlap dose of about 410 rad. As can be seen from the LD50 data for 3H and X-rays, a nuclear dose of 410 rad should be sufficient to account for 50% cell death. These findings indicate that, although intranuclear decay by electron capture is extremely destructive, identical decay events in the plasma membrane cause only minimal cell damage. This parallels our earlier studies on 67Ga labeled leukemia cells which showed that electron capture decay in the cytoplasm is also highly ineffective in killing mammalian cells. It therefore appears that radiation-induced cell lethality in dividing mammalian cells results primarily from nuclear damage. Cytoplasmic or membrane contributions to radiation-induced cell death, if any, must be minimal. By implication, these findings refute the enzyme release hypothesis and similar theories designed to explain mitotic death in terms of cytoplasmic or membrane damage rather than nuclear damage.","['Warters, R L', 'Hofer, K G', 'Harris, C R', 'Smith, J M']","['Warters RL', 'Hofer KG', 'Harris CR', 'Smith JM']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Curr Top Radiat Res Q,Current topics in radiation research quarterly,1276745,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/*radiation effects', 'Cell Nucleus/*radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*adverse effects', 'Mitosis/radiation effects', 'Ovary/cytology', 'Tritium/adverse effects', 'X-Rays/adverse effects']",1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Curr Top Radiat Res Q. 1978 Jan;12(1-4):389-407.,,,,,,,,

The data suggested that F-MuLV-induced leukemogenesis may operate in more than 1 cell type. In addition to the primitive erythroid type of cell usually involved in leukemia induced by F-MuLV, nonerythroid Ia-positive cells may also be transformed.

As a follow-up to this chemical lead, a series of closely related phosphonium salts was prepared in which the 1,3-dihydro-1,3-dioxo-2H-isoindole ring system was maintained or in which it was replaced by other moieties such as maleimido, bromo, methoxy, and isoindoline. Syntheses generally involved treatment of the appropriate N-(bromoalkyl)phthalimide with the required phosphine or condensation of the K salt of the substituted imide with beta-(bromoethyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide (12). From the biological data obtained for these compounds, several requirements can be defined for substantial antileukemic activity. Of utmost importance is the presence of a triarylphosphonium halide moiety, coupled to an alkyl chain of two or three carbon atoms. The preferred terminus of the alkyl chain is the 1,3-dihydro-1,3-dioxo-2H-isoindole ring system, although the observed activity of beta-(bromoethyl)-triphenylphosphonium bromide (12) (T/C = 127%) would suggest that a superior carrier molecule could be developed.","['Dubois, R J', 'Lin, C C', 'Beisler, J A']","['Dubois RJ', 'Lin CC', 'Beisler JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Terphenyl Compounds)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Indoles/chemical synthesis/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/chemical synthesis/*therapeutic use', 'Terphenyl Compounds/chemical synthesis/therapeutic use']",1978/03/01 00:00,1978/03/01 00:01,['1978/03/01 00:00'],"['1978/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00201a016 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1978 Mar;21(3):303-6. doi: 10.1021/jm00201a016.,,,,,,,,

The biological activities of these compounds were assayed and compared to the activities of previously reported, naturally occurring maytansinoids. From the data, it is apparent that presence of the C-3 ester is necessary for significant activity, and variations in the ester group are not accompanied by marked changes in activity. However, elimination of the ester group, as in maytansinol (7), maysine (8), normaysine (9), and maysenine (10), results in a significant decrease in biological activity. Blockage of the C-9 carbinolamide via etherification markedly reduces antileukemic and cytotoxic activity and slightly reduces antitubulin activity but has relatively little effect on antimitotic activity against sea urchin eggs. Thus, a free carbinolamide at C-9 is advantageous for optimal activity.","['Kupchan, S M', 'Sneden, A T', 'Branfman, A R', 'Howie, G A', 'Rebhun, L I', 'McIvor, W E', 'Wang, R W', 'Schnaitman, T C']","['Kupchan SM', 'Sneden AT', 'Branfman AR', 'Howie GA', 'Rebhun LI', 'McIvor WE', 'Wang RW', 'Schnaitman TC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (maytansinol)', '14083FR882 (Maytansine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Maytansine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Ovum/drug effects', 'Oxazines/*pharmacology', 'Sea Urchins', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tubulin/metabolism']",1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00199a006 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1978 Jan;21(1):31-7. doi: 10.1021/jm00199a006.,,,,,,,,

The process is saturable, follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Km = 2.5 X 10(-9) M at 37 degrees C), is both temperature and calcium (K50 - 1 X 10(-6) M) dependent, and is inhibited by apo-TCII, indicating the presence of a TCII specific receptor on the cell membrane. B12 also leaves the cell by a calcium-independent pathway bound to either TCII or to a protein with chromatographic properties similar to those of TCIII. Since intact TCII-B12 can be found in the cytosol and can promote B12 uptake by mitochondria, it is proposed that the B12 released from the cell bound to the TCIII-like protein is derived by mitochondrial processing of incorporated TCII-B12.

The effects on virus production were noticeable 2 h after interferon addition and reached their full extent by 13 h. We conclude from these observations that interferon acts upon the late stage(s) of virion maturation, leading both to a decrease in virion production as well as to the formation of defective particles. In contrast, a small but significant increase in the rate at which globin mRNA and hemoglobin accumulate is observed after interferon treatment.","['Luftig, R B', 'Conscience, J F', 'Skoultchi, A', 'McMillan, P', 'Revel, M', 'Ruddle, F H']","['Luftig RB', 'Conscience JF', 'Skoultchi A', 'McMillan P', 'Revel M', 'Ruddle FH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism/microbiology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*growth & development/ultrastructure', 'Globins/biosynthesis', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Models, Biological', 'Morphogenesis', 'Virus Replication']",1977/09/01 00:00,1977/09/01 00:01,['1977/09/01 00:00'],"['1977/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.23.3.799-810.1977 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1977 Sep;23(3):799-810. doi: 10.1128/JVI.23.3.799-810.1977.,,PMC515891,,,,,,

The effects of treating the virus with specific antibody, UV irradiation, and elevated temperature and the requirements for cellular RNA and protein synthesis have been studied as they relate to this virus-induced fusion. The results indicate that intact, but not necessarily infectious, virions are required to promote fusion of fu-1 cells. Neither actinomycin D nor cycloheximide altered the formation of syncytia; thus, neither viral nor cellular RNA or protein synthesis is required for fusion. fu-1 cells infected with the ts3 temperature-sensitive mutant of Moloney murine leukemia virus accumlate large amounts of budding virus on their cell membrane; however, this membrane-associated virus failed to induce syncytia. Upon release of the virus at the permissive temperature, fusion did occur. We conclude that contact or attachment of the immature virus to the cell membrane is not sufficient to promote murine leukemia virus-induced cell fusion; complete virions are required. From these data, we propose that adsorption and penetration of the virus may induce a change in the cell membrane that subsequently promotes the fusion of susceptible cells.","['Wong, P K', 'Yuen, P H', 'Kaufman, S J']","['Wong PK', 'Yuen PH', 'Kaufman SJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Immune Sera)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Fusion/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/drug effects/*growth & development/radiation effects', 'Muscles', 'Mutation', 'Rats', 'Temperature', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Virus Replication']",1977/09/01 00:00,1977/09/01 00:01,['1977/09/01 00:00'],"['1977/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.23.3.768-775.1977 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1977 Sep;23(3):768-75. doi: 10.1128/JVI.23.3.768-775.1977.,,PMC515888,,,,,,

The macrophages increased steadily in number during the first 1-2 wk of culture. The increase was partly derived from division of the macrophages themselves, partly from augmentation from supernatant cells not adherent to the surface of the culture flask. This augmentation occurred mostly in the first 24 hr of culture. The leukaemic macrophages had many features of normal macrophages as regards light microscopy, surface receptors, phagocytic activity and cytochemistry. Under the electron microscope, however, they had many abnormal characteristics, all of which have been recorded previously as features of malignant transformation. Cultures containing the abnormal macrophages and their precursor cells caused local solid tumours when injected into immune-deprived mice. The tumours were composed of rather uniform cells many of which resembled neoplastic reticulum cells. It is concluded that human leukaemic monocytes or promonocytes can develop into macrophages with ultrastructural features of malignancy. This appears to be the first demonstration of the development of neoplastic macrophages. It is suggested that some lymph node tumours of man may be composed of similar neoplastic macrophages and their precursor cells.","['Balkwill, F R', 'Franks, C R', 'Oliver, R T', 'Spector, W G']","['Balkwill FR', 'Franks CR', 'Oliver RT', 'Spector WG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Complement C3', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments', '*Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1977/05/01 00:00,1977/05/01 00:01,['1977/05/01 00:00'],"['1977/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/path.1711220104 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 1977 May;122(1):13-26. doi: 10.1002/path.1711220104.,,,,,,,,

Intraventricular pressure was monitored continuously via the Ommaya reservoirs before and after single doses of 0.5, 1.0 or l.5 gm per kilogram of body weight. The interrelationship between initial pressure, change in pressure, serum osmolarity, and duration of action was investigated, and the ratio of CSF-to-plasma osmolarity was determined 4 to 5 hours after glycerol administration. The effects of chronic 6-hourly and 4-hourly 1 gm per kilogram glycerol doses were studied in a patient with meningeal carcinomatosis and increased intracranial pressure. Our data suggest that as a cerebral dehydrating agent oral glycerol is most effective in patients with markedly increased intracranial pressure. A single 1 gm per kilogram dose is adequate to lower raised intraventricular pressure acutely, but its effect is short-lived. Continuous oral administration must be carefully monitored to avoid the establishment or a reverse osmotic gradient, secondarily increased intracranial pressure, and clinical deterioration.","['Rottenberg, D A', 'Hurwitz, B J', 'Posner, J B']","['Rottenberg DA', 'Hurwitz BJ', 'Posner JB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Neurology,Neurology,0401060,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Electrolytes)', 'PDC6A3C0OX (Glycerol)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Blood/drug effects', 'Blood Glucose/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrolytes/blood', 'Female', 'Glycerol/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Intracranial Pressure/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Time Factors']",1977/07/01 00:00,1977/07/01 00:01,['1977/07/01 00:00'],"['1977/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1212/wnl.27.7.600 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurology. 1977 Jul;27(7):600-8. doi: 10.1212/wnl.27.7.600.,,,,,,,,

From the clinical point of view they represented a subunit with markedly prevalent splenic proliferation. Liver and/or bone-marrow however showed in all cases primarily circumscribed infiltrations of pathognomonic cells or did develop them during the course of disease, even after splenectomy. According to the presented observations this disease is to be placed between chronic lymphocytic leukemia and M. Waldenstrom not only by pathological but also by clinical criteria.","['Theml, H', 'Burger, A', 'Keiditsch, E', 'Enne, W', 'Eggert, K', 'Dietzfelbinger, H', 'Graff, L', 'Zsida, L']","['Theml H', 'Burger A', 'Keiditsch E', 'Enne W', 'Eggert K', 'Dietzfelbinger H', 'Graff L', 'Zsida L']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Med Klin,Medizinische Klinik,0376637,['0 (Immunoglobulin M)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibody-Producing Cells/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Lymphocytosis/complications', 'Lymphoma/blood/complications/*diagnosis/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraproteinemias/complications', 'Splenectomy', 'Splenomegaly/complications']",1977/06/10 00:00,2000/03/22 09:00,['1977/06/10 00:00'],"['1977/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '1977/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Klin. 1977 Jun 10;72(23):1019-32.,Klinische Beobachtungen zur Charakterisierung des splenomegalen Immunozytoms.,,,,,,,

MICRONEq free fatty acid per ml. in vitro incubations demonstrated that isolated L1210 cells readily utilize free fatty acid that is added to the incubation medium. When the cells were incubated with albumin-bound [1-14C]palmitate, about 12 times more radioactivity was incorporated into cell lipids than was oxidized to CO2. Triacylglycerols contained 1.5 to 4 times more radioactivity than phospholipids, and from 48 to 69% of the phospholipid radioactivity was recovered in the choline phosphoglycerides. [1-14C]Palmitate utilization increased as the fatty acid concentration of the medium was raised, the largest increase occurring in the triacylglycerol fraction. Palmitate utilization also was increased by the presence of carbohydrates in the medium, their effectiveness (in descending order) being glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, and glycerol. By contrast, ribose did not produce any stimulatory effect. During a 1-hr incubation, between 82 and 87% of the [1-14C]palmitate that was taken up remained as palmitic acid. From 8 to 15% was elongated to stearate, and only 2 to 3% was desaturated to palmitoleate and oleate. Based upon the lipid content, growth rate, and palmitate utilization rate of the cells, it appears that a major portion of the lipid requirements of the L1210 cell may be supplied by the fatty acid contained in the ascites plasma. In addition, our results suggest that most of the saturated fatty acid taken up is incorporated into cell lipids without structural modification.","['Burns, C P', 'Wei, S P', 'Welshman, I R', 'Wiebe, D A', 'Spector, A A']","['Burns CP', 'Wei SP', 'Welshman IR', 'Wiebe DA', 'Spector AA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)', '0 (Palmitates)', '0 (Phospholipids)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/metabolism', 'Carbohydrates/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Fatty Acids/*metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/metabolism', 'Glucose/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Palmitates/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phospholipids/biosynthesis']",1977/07/01 00:00,1977/07/01 00:01,['1977/07/01 00:00'],"['1977/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1977 Jul;37(7 Pt 1):1991-7.,,,,,,,,

Irradiation of the cells induced single- and double-strand breaks in the DNA with an efficiency of 100 eV/break and 1300 eV/break, respecitvely. Approximately 50% of the single-strand breaks were estimated to be those arising from allali-labile lesions. A linear, dose-dependent increase was found in the template activity of the DNA, indicating the induction of 3'-OH terminals by gamma-irradiation. Post-irradiation incubation of the cells in serum-free medium allowed the majority of the breaks to rejoin within a few hours. Repair of the alkali-labile lesions was, however, found to be much slower than that of ""actual"" single-strand breaks.

When the temperature of the medium was decreased to 25 degrees C, AS RNase was bound to the leukaemic cell surfaces, but it exerted no inhibitory effect on BP-8 cells and showed a partial effect on EL-4 cells even after 24 hours. AS RNase administered to mice with leukaemic cells in diffusion chambers significantly decreased the number of cells inside the chambers as compared to the controls. The number of ascites cells was also significantly reduced after the injection of AS RNase for 1 week into mice with leukaemic cells implanted in the abdominal cavities. The reduction of cells in ascitic fluid did not cause a significant prolongation of survival of experimental mice. Only mice with transplanted BP-8 cells had significantly less cells in ascitic fluid and their survival was prolonged to 48 days in comparison with 25 days' survival in control mice after administration of pure AS RNase. In addition, AS RNase depressed the growth of solid tumours BP-8 and EL-4. AS RNase did not change the weight of body organs except the testes.

A time course of the uptake of radioactivity on incubation of L5178Y lymphoblast with [14C]-1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea was linear for 30 min and then entered a plateau phase; it was markedly temperature dependent. A similar time course for cells incubated with [14C]ethylene-labeled 1-(2-chlorethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea reached equilibrium rapidly, was temperature independent, and resulted in a relatively low level of uptake of radioactivity. However, cells treated with 3-[cyclohexyl-14C]-1-(2-chlorethyl)-1-nitrosourea had a time course that was linear for 30 min, resulted in much higher levels of uptake of radioactivity, and was strongly temperature dependent. These findings, at least for 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea, suggest that some drug decomposition precedes uptake. The percentage of radioactivity found in the cell sap fraction was at least 85% of total cell activity when cells were incubated with any of the three 14C-labeled nitrosoureas. Furthermore, thin-layer chromatography of the cell sap fraction revealed the presence of free intact drug. These findings indicate that intracellular uptake of intact nitrosoureas occurred. A time course of uptake of intact 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea reached equilibrium rapidly with cell/medium distribution ratios of 0.2 to 0.6 and was temperature independent. The addition of excess unlabeled 1,3-bis(2-chlorethyl)-1-nitrosourea or 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea had no effect on uptake of [14C]-1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, These findings suggest that uptake of intact 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea was by passive diffusion. A time course of the uptake of intact 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea with either [14C]ethylene- or ring-labeled drug rapidly reached equilibrium, was temperature independent, and attained a cell/medium ratio greater than unity. Uptake of 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea was sodium independent and was unaffected by the metabolic inhibitors (sodium fluoride, sodium cyanide, or 2,4-dinitrophenol) or by urea, a potential physiological competitor. Furthermore, addition of unlabeled 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea or 1,3-bis(2-chlorethyl)-1-nitrosourea had no effect on uptake of labeled 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea.

Dane particles, supposed to be the infectious entity of HBV, were partially purified by a trap and a rate zonal ultracentrifugation from serum samples of a patient with chronic hepatitis undergoing an immune suppressive treatment because of leukemia. ""Gigasept"" on the basis of succine dialdehyd and formaldehyd served as disinfectant for this investigation. In one experiment partially purified Dane particles were exposed to the action of a 5% solution of ""Gigasept"" on electron microscopic grids. Morphological alterations resulting in derounding, break up of the outer membrane, spiral uncoiling as well as asymmetric enlargement of the space between the outer membrane and the core of the HBV was observed after 2 mins. After 15 mins, the HBV were diffusely stained with loss of the characteristic substructure and became polygonal. The decrease of the number of the particles was proportional to the length of the contact time with the disinfectant. In a second series equal volumes of a 5% solution of ""Gigasept"" and of a HBV containing serum were in contact for 2 hours, with consecutive purification and morphological characterization of the HBV. The sedimentation of the HBs antigenicity differed from the control. A part of the Dane particles was diffusely stained and lost its substructure. Moreover empty particles in the range of the HBc antigen were found. Another part of Dane particles, however, was morphologically unchanged. The relation of intact and non intact particles could possibly serve as parameter for the HBV virucidy.-Thermo inactivation (3 mins, +98 degrees C) of the HBV in a serum was undertaken for comparison.","['Thraenhart, O', 'Dermietzel, R', 'Kuwert, E', 'Scheiermann, N']","['Thraenhart O', 'Dermietzel R', 'Kuwert E', 'Scheiermann N']",['ger'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Zentralbl Bakteriol Orig B,"Zentralblatt fur Bakteriologie, Parasitenkunde, Infektionskrankheiten und Hygiene.

A potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (2'-deoxycoformycin; co-vidarabine), when used in combination with AraA in the treatment of leukemia-bearing mice, increased the formation of AraATP in mouse leukemia cells four- to five-fold over that obtained by treatment with AraA alone.

Ad induces DNA degradation in vivo in both excision repair-competent (HeLa and Me-180) cells and in excision repair-deficient (REQ) cells. When X-irradiated cells are exposed to Ad during the period of repair of DNA single-strand breaks, small numbers of residual breaks persist following completion of repair. These are attributable to those induced by Ad alone. The effects of Ad and X-rays therefore appear to be similar and additive. No clear-cut evidence that Ad can inhibit the repair of X-ray-induced DNA single-strand breakage was found. Ad also induced the formation of DNA double-strand breaks and inhibits the repair of X-ray-induced base damage (repair replication). The induction of DNA strand breakage may be responsible for Ad cell toxicity and may contribute to its capacity to enhance primary X-irradiation damage when the two types of lesions co-exist.","['Byfield, J E', 'Lee, Y C', 'Tu, L']","['Byfield JE', 'Lee YC', 'Tu L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*radiation effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210', 'X-Rays']",1977/02/15 00:00,1977/02/15 00:01,['1977/02/15 00:00'],"['1977/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1977/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910190208 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1977 Feb 15;19(2):186-93. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910190208.,,,,,,,,

This was accomplished by categorizing 71 patients of preliminary CLL by age, sex, distribution of B and T lymphocytes, cell morphology, symptoms at the time of diagnosis, clinical course, electrophoresis and quantitative immunoglobulines. According to these features, the sample of patients was divided into three groups: Group 1: chronic lymphatic leukemia probable. Group 2: immunocytoma probable.

New alkylesters of 1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-5-fluorouracil 5'-phosphate (FUMP-alkylesters) were synthesized and their antitumor activity was examined against 1-beta-D-5-fluorouracil-sensitive and -resistant L5178Y sublines. Only hexadecylester of 1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-5-fluorouracil 5'-phosphate was effective, not only to 1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-5-fluorouracil line but also to 1-beta-D-ribofuranolsyl-5-fluorouracil-resistant subline.

The method provides a complete print-out of an oxygen dissociation curve in 15--20 min and the P50 vlues obtained in normal individuals agree closely with those obtained by classical methods. These apparatuses were used to measure oxygen affinity, ie P50, in anemic children with malignant disease prior to treatment and in children undergoing therapy. Red cell 2,3-DPG levels were also measured. In patients with anemia at the time of diagnosis and prior to therapy, the P50 values and 2,3-DPG levels were elevated as is usual in other types of anemia. However, when oxygen affinity and 2,3-DPG levels were measured in anemic patients receiving treatment, three types of response to anemia were noted: 1) increased P50 and 2,3-DPG; 2) normal or low P50 and 2,3-DPG, and; 3) normal or low P50 with increased 2,3-DPG. Patients who adapted poorly to anemia during treatment had usually received prior intensive chemotherapy and transfusion therapy, and their pattern of red cell glycolytic intermediates was consistent with a red cell population with an increased cell age.

In their reassociation kinetics, GC-content and other physico-chemical properties the blood lymphocyte DNA of the controls and of animals with chronic lymphoid leukemia appear to be similar. Consequently, the genome organization of leukemic animals does not change significantly; a considerable decrease of 5-methyl cytosine of lymphocyte DNA in lymphoid leukemia parallels the decrease of genome methylation in the leukemic cells. This decrease does not affect the unique sequences, but involves all types of repeated sequences (moderately and frequently repeated ones and palindromes).

These animals carried one copy of Moloney virus DNA (M-MuLV) in their germ line and transmitted the virus as a single Mendelian gene to the next generation. Homozygous BALB/Mo mice were used to genetically map the M-MuLV locus. Embryo fibroblasts were fused to established Chinese hamster cells and somatic cell hybrids were selected. Segregation of mouse chromosomal markers in the hybrids was correlated to the loss of M-MuLV-specific sequences as detected by molecular hybridization. Of 15 isozymes located on different mouse chromosomes only triosephosphate isomerase segregated syntenic with the M-MuLV gene, suggesting that the virus was integrated on chromosome No. 6.

However, most of the compounds so far investigated had no effect on the survival time or cell number after s.c. application. Moreover, there was no prolongation of the survival time of leukemia L1210 or L184 bearing mice. This shows that the systemic effects of most of the compounds are low and that they have to come into direct contact with tumour cells during application in order to be active.

Analysis of vital statistics, national nutrition survey data, and on-going prospective study data revealed change in selective dietary intake and increase in cigarette consumption are the major factors responsible for such trend.

The calcifications were evident in the skull roentgenograms of only 4 patients out of 40 in whom both CT scans and plain roentgenograms were available, demonstrating the superior resolution of this new method. Seventy-five percent of the patients were older than 50 years of age. Of the younger patients, 5 had had prior cranial irradiation; 1 had received cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate therapy for meningeal leukemia; and 2 others had deep-seated arteriovenous malformations. Serum concentrations of calcium and phosphorus were normal in all 46 patients in whom they were measured. We conclude that the detection of small calcifications of the basal ganglia in persons above 50 years of age is infrequently associated with either clinical signs of basal ganglia dysfunction or calcium and phosphorus abnormalities. Calcium deposition in these patients may be related to vascular changes associated with aging. In younger patients a specific pathogenetic factor or underlying process is infrequently found.","['Murphy, M J']",['Murphy MJ'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Neurol,Annals of neurology,7707449,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Basal Ganglia', 'Brain Diseases/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Calcinosis/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/complications', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/complications', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1979/12/01 00:00,1979/12/01 00:01,['1979/12/01 00:00'],"['1979/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ana.410060608 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Neurol. 1979 Dec;6(6):507-11. doi: 10.1002/ana.410060608.,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately however, the problem of false positive results is not particularly discussed in these papers. Because of the lack of information it was our aim to compare our own scintigraphic results with postmortem histopathological findings. Our investigations were carried out in 139 patients with various types of malignancy. Included in the investigations were 20 patients with primary liver tumor. The interval between scintigraphic examination and the histological verification ranged from 3 days to 1 year. In 62 of the patients with liver metastases, histopathology revealed liver metastases, while 77 patients showed no liver involvement. We arrived at the correct diagnosis ""liver metastasis"" in 50 out of 62 patients (80.6%). False negative scintigrams (19.4%) were found in most of the respective cases when diffuse malignant involvement such as leukemia and Hodgkin's disease was present, and also when the size of the metastases was less than 2 cm in diameter. Fifty six out of 77 patients (72.7%) without histopathological evidence of liver metastases revealed negative scintigrams. Twenty one (27.3%) false positive scintigrams were mostly due to (diffuse) nonmalignant disease e.g. fibrosis and cirrhosis. The overall accuracy of liver scintigraphy in our study was 76.2%. In 18 of 20 (90%) patients with focal liver disease correct diagnosis was established. 7 patients with benign liver tumors and 11 of 13 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma showed focal defects. Considering the fact that liver scintigraphy is a non-invasive procedure, it can be recommended as screening method. In connection with sonography and computer tomography liver scintigraphy can undoubtedly improve the diagnostic accuracy in detecting liver metastases and primary liver tumors.","['Biersack, H J', 'Helpap, B', 'Bell, E', 'Vogt, R', 'Breuel, H P']","['Biersack HJ', 'Helpap B', 'Bell E', 'Vogt R', 'Breuel HP']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Nuklearmedizin,Nuklearmedizin.

The capacity of ingestion is not an exlusive property of the phagocytes and macrophages of the MFS, so that different neoplastic cells can show it too. This study analyzes the presence of hemophagocytosis by neoplastic cells in a total of 552 bone marrow aspirates corresponding to a series of 130 patients with acute leukemia and 422 patients with diverse solid tumors. In the group of patients with acute leukemia, hemophagocytosis by blastic cells was observed in five cases with acute monocytic leukemia. In the other group with solid tumors, hemophagocytosis was present in three patients with oat-cell lung carcinomas and diffuse bone marrow metastases. The interest of the evaluation of hemophagocytosis by neoplastic cells in the morphological examination of the bone marrow is stressed, as well as it possible value in the cytological diagnosis of acute monocytic leukemia. However, in these circumstances a sdiffuse metastases by solid tumors should be always discarded, since their cytomorphological characteristics are in most cases superimposed to those of the leukemic bone marrow infiltrate.","['Brugues, R M', 'Vives-Corrons, J L', 'Rozman, C', 'Jou, J M', 'Aguilar, J L', 'Cardellach, F', 'Urbano, A', 'Feliu, E']","['Brugues RM', 'Vives-Corrons JL', 'Rozman C', 'Jou JM', 'Aguilar JL', 'Cardellach F', 'Urbano A', 'Feliu E']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Histiocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', '*Phagocytosis']",1979/12/15 00:00,1979/12/15 00:01,['1979/12/15 00:00'],"['1979/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1979/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1979 Dec 15;73(10):399-402.,Valor de la hemofagocitosis en el examen morfologico de la medula osea.,,,,,,,

The surface proteins of MBL-2 cells were selectively radioiodinated and then extracted by Nonidet P40. The solubilized materials were then reacted with a variety of antisera: monospecific antisera to murine leukemia viral proteins (anti-gp69/71, anti-p30, anti-p15, anti-p12 and anti-p10), sera from B6 which regressed murine sarcoma tumors induced by murine sarcoma virus (anti-MSV) and a rabbit anti-MBL-2 antiserum. The resulting radioimmune precipitates were analyzed and compared in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The following results were obtained. (1) Among all anti-viral protein antisera tested only anti-gp69/71 was active and detected a protein doublet of gp69/71 and its degradation fragments of 42,000 and 35,000 daltons. (2) Radioimmune precipitates prepared with anti-MSV showed a SDS-PAGE pattern similar to that seen with anti-gp69/71. This result indicated that the surface antigen detected by the anti-MSV serum on MBL-2 tumor cell was probably a viral envelope antigen. (3) The rabbit anti-MBL-2 serum detected on the cell membrane an antigen of approximately 95,000 daltons which was tumor-associated and did not appear to be related to virion components. The anti-MBL-2-serum still reacted with the 95,000 dalton antigen after absorption with disrupted M-MuLV virus and with gp69/71 and p30 purified from the virus.","['Ng, A K', 'McIntire, K R', 'Suzuki, S', 'Aoki, T', 'Herberman, R B']","['Ng AK', 'McIntire KR', 'Suzuki S', 'Aoki T', 'Herberman RB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Complement System Proteins', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Weight', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/microbiology', 'Rabbits', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Viral Proteins/analysis']",1979/10/15 00:00,1979/10/15 00:01,['1979/10/15 00:00'],"['1979/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1979/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910240420 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1979 Oct 15;24(4):504-12. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910240420.,,,,,,,,

In the bone marrow took place a full remission of the acute leukosis as certained by biopsy of the iliac crest.","['Gunther, C', 'Kubel, M']","['Gunther C', 'Kubel M']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Z Gesamte Inn Med,Zeitschrift fur die gesamte innere Medizin und ihre Grenzgebiete,21730470R,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Skin Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology']",1979/08/01 00:00,1979/08/01 00:01,['1979/08/01 00:00'],"['1979/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Z Gesamte Inn Med. 1979 Aug 1;34(15):suppl 197-200.,Aussergewohnliche kutane Manifestation einer unreifzelligen Leukose.,,,,,,,

When the L1210 cells which have passed through the labyrinth without being trapped are reinjected into another glass bead layer, their retention is similar to that observed after the first injection; it appears, therefore, that the L1210 cells are uniform as concerns the properties which are important for surface interactions under flow conditions.","['Lewandowska, K', 'Doroszewski, J', 'Szlenk, W']","['Lewandowska K', 'Doroszewski J', 'Szlenk W']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement', 'Glass', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210/*physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Rheology', 'Surface Properties']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1979;26(4):439-47.,,,,,,,,

Diffuse marrow involvement was present at diagnosis in some patients in the latter two groups, but their clinical course was not characteristic of the patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia.

Based on a review of the literature and the authors' experience, the value of this test for patients who have acute leukemia does not appear to be well established.","['Myerowitz, R L', 'Layman, H', 'Petursson, S', 'Yee, R B']","['Myerowitz RL', 'Layman H', 'Petursson S', 'Yee RB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/*analysis', 'Candidiasis/etiology/*immunology', 'Counterimmunoelectrophoresis', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies']",1979/12/01 00:00,1979/12/01 00:01,['1979/12/01 00:00'],"['1979/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/72.6.963 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1979 Dec;72(6):963-7. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/72.6.963.,,,,,,,,

The dual-tropic recombinant virus was isolated from a thymoma cell line (Th16.3) and is referred to as BALB/Moloney mink cell focus-inducing virus (BALB/Mo-MCF virus). The nucleic acid sequences of RNA from virions obtained from either a thymoma cell line (Th16.3) or a clonal isolate (BALB/Mo-MCF81) were compared with the genomes of ecotropic and xenotropic viruses. The following inferences were drawn (i) A single nonhomologous region (substitution loop alpha) of about 0.7 kilobase was observed in a heteroduplex formed between Moloney murine leukemia virus complementary DNA (cDNA) and BALB/MoMCF81 RNA. This nonhomology region was mapped between 1.71 and 2.40 kilobases from the 3' end of the genome. (ii) The predominant class of heteroduplexes formed between virion RNA obtained from the thymoma cell line (Th16.3) and Moloney murine leukemia virus cDNA showed a substitution loop similar to that observed with the RNA obtained from a cloned isolate, BALB/Mo-MCF81. However, there were other molecules with additional regions of nonhomology. (iii) Heteroduplexes formed between NZB xenotropic RNA and ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus cDNA exhibited four major nonhomology regions extending 0.75 to 1.46, 2.0 to 2.8, 3.6 to 4.3, and 7.4 to 7.9 kilobases from the 3' end of the genome. (iv) The MCF-specific substitution loop alpha (1.71 to 2.40 kilobases) appeared as a duplex region when NZB xenotropic RNA was hybridized to cDNA transcripts synthesized by virions obtained from thymoma cell line Th16.3. The position of the other substitution loops observed in a heteroduplex formed between NZB xenotropic RNA and Moloney murine leukemia virus cDNA was not affected. (v) Heteroduplexes formed between xenotropic BALB virus 2 cDNA and NZB xenotropic RNA demonstrated a large degree of nucleic acid sequence homology. Of the 29 heteroduplexes examined, 24 appeared to be homoduplexes, and in the remaining 5 heteroduplexes only one region of nonhomology located between 3.2 and 3.8 kilobases from the 3' end of the genome could be identified.

In at least two patients platelet aggregation was convincingly reduced to more than one aggregating agent (ADP, adrenaline, collagen, thrombin, and ristocetin). Granular storage capacity for {(14)C} 5-HT was reduced in five of the six patients tested. The two patients with definitely abnormal aggregation had the greatest reduction in granular storage pool and the longest bleeding times of those tested but, like the other patients, they did not have a clinical haemostatic defect. It was concluded that a granular storage pool defect (SPD) was at least partly responsible for aggregation abnormalities in HCL since the platelet release reaction in response to thrombin appeared to be normal. All our patients ran a chronic course uncomplicated by any of the factors known to predispose to a platelet SPD acquired in the circulation. Although in the one patient tested before and after splenectomy there was some improvement in platelet aggregation after operation, there was no clear general relationship between defective platelet function and either previous splenectomy or platelet count. Since a direct involvement of the megakaryocytic series in the underlying cell proliferation of HCL seems unlikely, it is concluded that the platelet defect can most reasonably be attributed to the production of abnormal platelets as a result of marrow fibrosis and/or infiltration by hairy cells.","['Zuzel, M', 'Cawley, J C', 'Paton, R C', 'Burns, G F', 'McNicol, G P']","['Zuzel M', 'Cawley JC', 'Paton RC', 'Burns GF', 'McNicol GP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,['333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)'],IM,"['Bleeding Time', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood', 'Platelet Aggregation/drug effects', 'Serotonin/blood']",1979/08/01 00:00,1979/08/01 00:01,['1979/08/01 00:00'],"['1979/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.32.8.814 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1979 Aug;32(8):814-21. doi: 10.1136/jcp.32.8.814.,,PMC1145815,,,,,,

Second, plus-strand DNA, after being copied from approximately 600 nucleotides at the 5' end of the minus-strand DNA, then transcribes the first approximately 20 nucleotides of the tRNApro primer (which is covalently attaced to the 5' end of the minus DNA strand). The 3' ends of the minus and plus DNA probably form a hybrid through the homology conferred by the primer binding site sequences. Third, the minus and plus DNA strands are elongated in a continuous fashion resulting in a linear double-stranded DNA molecule containing a 600 nucleotide direct repeat at both ends.

The genetically transmitted Moloney provirus of Balb/Mo mice was detected in a characteristic Eco RI DNA fragment of 16 x 10(6) daltons. No fragment of this size was detected in tissue DNAs from Balb/c mice infected as newborns with Moloney virus. We conclude that a viral integration site, occupied in preimplantation mouse embryos, is not necessarily occupied when virus infects cells in post-natal animals. Balb/Mo and Balb/c mice do carry the AkR structural gene in an Eco RI DNA fragment of 12 x 10(6) daltons. Further restriction analysis of this fragment indicated that both mouse lines carry one AKR-type provirus. Leukemogenesis in Balb/Mo and newborn infected Balb/c mice is accompanied by reintegration of Moloney viral sequences in new chromosomal sites of tumor tissues.

Ethylene oxide has been produced by a Swedish company since the beginning of the 1940s. This paper describes a cohort study of the mortality and the cancer incidence among full-time exposed workers in ethylene oxide production, a group of maintenance workers with intermittent exposure and a group of unexposed controls. Investigation of the production processes in the building at different times has shown that workers were exposed to ethylene dichloride, ethylene chlorohydrin, ethylene, and small amounts of bis-(2-chloroethyl) ether as well as to ethylene oxide and traces of other chemicals. The full-time exposed cohort shows a considerable excess mortality deriving mainly from increased mortality from tumours and also from diseases of the circulatory system. The cancer incidence study, including living persons with malignancies, showed a significant excess in the full-time cohort. Of the 16 patients with tumours in the two more exposed cohorts there were three cases of leukaemia, six of tumours in the alimentary tract and four of urogenital malignancy. The excess mortality and cancer incidence cannot be attributed to any particular chemical in the production process, but ethylene oxide and ethylene dichloride are the prime suspects.","['Hogstedt, C', 'Rohlen, O', 'Berndtsson, B S', 'Axelson, O', 'Ehrenberg, L']","['Hogstedt C', 'Rohlen O', 'Berndtsson BS', 'Axelson O', 'Ehrenberg L']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Ind Med,British journal of industrial medicine,0370637,"['0 (Ethylene Dichlorides)', '753N66IHAN (Ethylene Chlorohydrin)', 'JJH7GNN18P (Ethylene Oxide)']",IM,"['*Chemical Industry', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Ethylene Chlorohydrin/adverse effects', 'Ethylene Dichlorides/adverse effects', 'Ethylene Oxide/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/mortality', 'Male', '*Mortality', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Stomach Neoplasms/chemically induced/mortality', 'Sweden']",1979/11/01 00:00,1979/11/01 00:01,['1979/11/01 00:00'],"['1979/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.36.4.276 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Ind Med. 1979 Nov;36(4):276-80. doi: 10.1136/oem.36.4.276.,,PMC1008604,,,,,,

This ruling provoked debate in the medical and legal communities. Dr. Arnold Relman, Editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, argues that Saikewicz encroaches on existing sound medical practice and requires decision-making machinery that is impractical and inhumane. Relman contends that treatment decision for terminally ill incompetents in Saikewicz-type cases should be made by the physician in consultation with the patient's family. Law professor Charles Baron, in contrast, defends Saikewicz's judicialization approach, arguing that such decision must bemade in an adversary framework that approximates the ideal of the rule of law. In the present Article, Professor Buchanan argues that Relman's criticism of Saikewicz rests on a defective, medical paternalist view of the physician-patient relationship, and that Baron's support of Saikewicz is based on an unjustifiable, legal imperalist view of decision making for incompetents. In Buchanan's view, Relman's approach fails to distinguish appropriately between the making of medical judgments and the making of moral judgments and wrongly assumes that the patient's family typically cannot understand the elements of the decision, while Baron's approach unjustifiably extends the sphere of the legal process by ignoring the special moral relationship that usually exists between the family and its incompetent member. Buchanan proposes an alternative decision-making approach that he believes incorporates the merits, while remedying the defects, of both Baron's and Relman's approaches. The alternative is based on three propositions. (1) The proper presumption in Saikewicz-type cases is that the family of an incompetent is to make decisions concerning treatment. (2) This presumption of the family's dominant role in decision making is defeasible: protection of the patient's rights requires that decisions be made within a framework that allows vigorous discussion and accoutability through impartial review and that provides for legal intervention when necessary. (3) The institutional framework for implementing the features listed in the preceding proposition will rely heavily upon an ethics committee that is neither an all-medical prognosis committee nor an administrative agency of the hospital. Besides evaluating and responding to the Relman and Baron approaches, Buchanan examines the contribution to the Saikewicz debate made by law-and-medicine professor George Annas. In essence, Buchanan rejects Annas's argument that, taken together, the Saikewicz opinion and the Quinlan opinion of the Supreme Court of New Jersey delineate a proper division of medical and legal decision-making responsibility concerning terminally ill incompetents. Buchanan concludes that, contrary to Annas's view, those two cases are not reconcilable.","['Buchanan, A']",['Buchanan A'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Law Med,American journal of law & medicine,7509572,,IM,"['Decision Making', '*Ethics Committees, Clinical', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Humans', '*Intellectual Disability', '*Judicial Role', '*Jurisprudence', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Life Support Care/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Massachusetts', 'Morals', '*Paternalism', 'Quality of Life', 'Withholding Treatment']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Law Med. 1979 Summer;5(2):97-117.,,,['KIE: 09564'],"['KIE: Response to essay by Arnold S.
