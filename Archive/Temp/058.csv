(Annonaceae) includes aromatic plants that have both nutritional and medicinal uses. Essential oils of Xylopia species have antitumour effects. However, the efficacy of the essential oil from the fruit of Xylopia langsdorffiana St. Hil & Tul. (EOX) has not been examined. OBJECTIVE: EOX was evaluated to determine its chemical composition, antitumour activity and toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EOX was obtained from fresh fruits of X. langsdorffiana subjected to hydrodistillation, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to characterize the chemical composition of EOX. The toxicity of EOX was evaluated using haemolysis, acute toxicity and micronucleus assays. The in vitro antitumour activity of EOX was investigated using the sulforhodamine B assay. The sarcoma 180 murine tumour model was used to evaluate the in vivo antitumour activity and toxicity of EOX (50 and 100 mg/kg) after 7 d of treatment. RESULTS: The major components of EOX were alpha-pinene (34.57%) and limonene (31.75%). The HC50 (concentration producing 50% haemolysis) was 293.6 mug/ml. EOX showed greater selectivity for the leukaemia cell line K562, with total growth inhibition (TGI) (concentration producing TGI) of 1.8 mug/ml, and for multidrug-resistant ovarian tumour cell line NCI/ADR-RES (TGI of 45.4 mug/ml). The LD50 was approximately 351.09 mg/kg. At doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg, EOX inhibited the in vivo growth of sarcoma 180 by 38.67 and 54.32%, respectively. EOX displayed minor hepatic alterations characteristic of acute hepatitis and induced no genotoxicity. CONCLUSION: EOX showed in vitro and in vivo antitumour activity and low toxicity, which warrants further pharmacological studies.","['Moura, Ana Paula Gomes', 'Beltrao, Daiene Martins', 'Pita, Joao Carlos Lima Rodrigues', 'Xavier, Aline Lira', 'Brito, Monalisa Taveira', 'Sousa, Tatyanna Kelvia Gomes de', 'Batista, Leonia Maria', 'Carvalho, Joao Ernesto de', 'Ruiz, Ana Lucia Tasca Gois', 'Della Torre, Adriana', 'Duarte, Marcelo Cavalcante', 'Tavares, Josean Fechine', 'da Silva, Marcelo Sobral', 'Sobral, Marianna Vieira']","['Moura AP', 'Beltrao DM', 'Pita JC', 'Xavier AL', 'Brito MT', 'Sousa TK', 'Batista LM', 'Carvalho JE', 'Ruiz AL', 'Della Torre A', 'Duarte MC', 'Tavares JF', 'da Silva MS', 'Sobral MV']","['a Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Federal University of Paraiba-UFPB , Joao Pessoa , Brazil.', 'a Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Federal University of Paraiba-UFPB , Joao Pessoa , Brazil.', 'a Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Federal University of Paraiba-UFPB , Joao Pessoa , Brazil.', 'a Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Federal University of Paraiba-UFPB , Joao Pessoa , Brazil.', 'a Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Federal University of Paraiba-UFPB , Joao Pessoa , Brazil.', 'a Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Federal University of Paraiba-UFPB , Joao Pessoa , Brazil.', 'a Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Federal University of Paraiba-UFPB , Joao Pessoa , Brazil.', 'b Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Multidisciplinary Center for Chemical, Biological and Agricultural , State University of Campinas-UNICAMP , Campinas , Brazil.', 'b Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Multidisciplinary Center for Chemical, Biological and Agricultural , State University of Campinas-UNICAMP , Campinas , Brazil.', 'b Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Multidisciplinary Center for Chemical, Biological and Agricultural , State University of Campinas-UNICAMP , Campinas , Brazil.', 'a Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Federal University of Paraiba-UFPB , Joao Pessoa , Brazil.', 'a Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Federal University of Paraiba-UFPB , Joao Pessoa , Brazil.', 'a Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Federal University of Paraiba-UFPB , Joao Pessoa , Brazil.', 'a Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Federal University of Paraiba-UFPB , Joao Pessoa , Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160825,England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Oils, Volatile)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/physiology', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', '*Fruit', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Oils, Volatile/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/methods', '*Xylopia']",['NOTNLM'],"['Annonaceae', 'cytotoxicity', 'genotoxicity']",2016/08/26 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2016/08/26 06:00'],"['2016/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13880209.2016.1211154 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2016 Dec;54(12):3093-3102. doi: 10.1080/13880209.2016.1211154.

However, a potential complication of a lumbar puncture is a postdural puncture headache. The risk of neoplastic seeding to the central nervous system has led to concern over performing epidural blood patches (EBPs) for the treatment of postdural puncture headaches in patients with cancer. The goal of this retrospective study was to evaluate cancer seeding in the central nervous system in patients diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma. Methods: Institutional electronic records were queried over a 13-year period from 2000 to 2013 for patients with leukemia and/or lymphoma and who received at least one EBP. Demographic and procedural data, cancer treatments, and mortality were all examined. Patient records were reviewed for evidence of new-onset neoplastic central nervous system seeding after an epidural blood patch. Results: A total of 80 patients were identified for review. Eighteen patients had a diagnosis of leukemia, and 62 had lymphoma. Following an EBP, none of the patients experienced new cancer or cancer seeding in the central nervous system following an epidural blood patch at a median follow-up of 3.74 years. Discussion: Though the risks of EBP in the cancer patient population have been hypothesized, no previous studies have assessed the risk of seeding cancer to the central nervous system. Based on our results, an epidural blood patch bears low risk of cancer seeding when used to treat postdural puncture headache that is unresponsive to conservative treatments.","['Demaree, Christopher J', 'Soliz, Jose M', 'Gebhardt, Rodolfo']","['Demaree CJ', 'Soliz JM', 'Gebhardt R']","['Departments of Pain Medicine, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Departments of Pain Medicine, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Pain Med,"Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)",100894201,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Patch, Epidural/*statistics & numerical data', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/pathology/*secondary', 'Causality', 'Child', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Seeding', 'Post-Dural Puncture Headache/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Spinal Puncture/*statistics & numerical data', 'Texas/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer Risk', '*Cancer Seeding', '*Epidural Blood Patch', '*Leukemia', '*Lymphoma']",2016/08/26 06:00,2018/03/22 06:00,['2016/08/26 06:00'],"['2016/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['pnw218 [pii]', '10.1093/pm/pnw218 [doi]']",ppublish,Pain Med. 2017 Apr 1;18(4):786-790. doi: 10.1093/pm/pnw218.,10.1093/pm/pnw218 [doi],"['(c) 2016 American Academy of Pain Medicine.

These new compounds, bearing alpha-hydroxyketone moiety, as more stable zinc binding group (ZBG), were evaluated in vitro as HDAC inhibitors against the human HDACs isoforms 1-9 and in cellular antiproliferative assays on U937 human leukemia cell line. The 1,4-benzodiazepin-2,5-dione (BDZ), capping group and the natural ZBG, (S,R)-2-amino-9-hydroxy-8-oxodecanoic acid (Ahoda), were evaluated in order to probe HDAC inhibition and/or paralogue selectivity. Some of the new derivatives showed an interesting activity against a number of HDAC isozymes. The observed activity profile was rationalized by a computational assisted SAR study, in order to understand how the BDZ classes interact with the enzyme into the catalytic pocket. Despite its poor solubility, compound 17b showed significant antiproliferative profile and HDAC inhibition activity. RESULT: In order to assess how the solubility issue could have affected the biological outcome, bioassay conditions were reproduced and quantification of precipitated particulate material was evaluated by turbidimetric and NMR studies together with physicochemical descriptors prediction. Thus, BDZ 17b has been chosen to be promising lead compounds for further optimization, in order to elucidate molecule- enzyme surface recognition.","['Randino, Rosario', 'Moronese, Ilaria', 'Cini, Elena', 'Bizzarro, Valentina', 'Persico, Marco', 'Grimaldi, Manuela', 'Scrima, Mario', ""D'Ursi, Anna Maria"", 'Novellino, Ettore', 'Sobarzo-Sanchez, Eduardo', 'Rastrelli, Luca', 'Fattorusso, Caterina', 'Petrella, Antonello', 'Rodriquez, Manuela', 'Taddei, Maurizio']","['Randino R', 'Moronese I', 'Cini E', 'Bizzarro V', 'Persico M', 'Grimaldi M', 'Scrima M', ""D'Ursi AM"", 'Novellino E', 'Sobarzo-Sanchez E', 'Rastrelli L', 'Fattorusso C', 'Petrella A', 'Rodriquez M', 'Taddei M']","['Department of Pharmacy, University of Salerno, Via Giovanni Paolo II, 132, Fisciano (SA), Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Curr Top Med Chem,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,101119673,"['0 (FR 235222)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)']",IM,"['Benzodiazepines/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Solubility', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,2016/08/26 06:00,2017/02/10 06:00,['2016/08/26 06:00'],"['2015/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/10 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['CTMC-EPUB-77968 [pii]', '10.2174/1568026616666160824105645 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Top Med Chem. 2017;17(4):441-459. doi: 10.2174/1568026616666160824105645.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to retrospectively evaluate disease characteristics and prognosis in patients with MDS and isolated TCP at a tertiary care center. Fifty patients (12 %) had isolated thrombocytopenia as the first presentation of MDS. Patients had varying MDS sub-classifications and cytogenetic profiles. The most common IPSS-R risk score was low (n = 24), although half of the patients had either IPSS-R intermediate (n = 18), high or very high risk disease (n = 7). Leukemic transformation occurred in 10 patients and there were 14 deaths (28 %) amongst all IPSS-R risk scores. Therapeutic agents used in this patient subgroup included hypomethylating agents and thrombopoietin receptor agonists. Overall, MDS with isolated TCP did not appear to have an inherently indolent course, as has been suggested previously. Future studies are needed to improve risk stratification, identify relevant contributors to disease pathogenesis, and better define treatment modalities.","['Waisbren, Julie', 'Dinner, Shira', 'Altman, Jessica', 'Frankfurt, Olga', 'Helenowski, Irena', 'Gao, Juehua', 'McMahon, Brandon J', 'Stein, Brady L']","['Waisbren J', 'Dinner S', 'Altman J', 'Frankfurt O', 'Helenowski I', 'Gao J', 'McMahon BJ', 'Stein BL']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 251 E Huron St, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.

The aim of this analysis was to characterize venetoclax pharmacokinetics in the plasma and urine of patients with hematological malignancies and evaluate the effect of dose proportionality, accumulation, weak and moderate CYP3A inhibitors, as well as low- and high-fat meals on venetoclax pharmacokinetics. Patients received a once-daily venetoclax dose of 20 to 1200 mg. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using noncompartmental methods. Venetoclax peak exposures were achieved at 5 to 8 hours under low-fat conditions, and the mean terminal-phase elimination half-life ranged between 14.1 and 18.2 hours at different doses. Venetoclax steady-state exposures showed minimal accumulation and increased proportionally over the dose range of 300 to 900 mg. Low-fat and high-fat meals increased venetoclax exposures by approximately 4-fold relative to the fasting state. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors increased venetoclax exposures by 40% to 60%, whereas weak CYP3A inhibitors had no effect. A negligible amount of venetoclax was excreted in the urine. In summary, venetoclax exhibits a pharmacokinetic profile that is compatible with once-daily dosing with food regardless of fat content.

In addition to posttranscriptional gene silencing by miRNAs, the epigenetic mechanisms also include DNA methylation, histone modifications and their crosstalk. Epigenetic modifications were reported to play an important role in many disease onsets and progressions and can be used to explain several features of complex diseases, such as late onset and fluctuation of symptoms. However, miRNAs not only function as a part of epigenetic machinery, but are also epigenetically modified by DNA methylation and histone modification like any other protein-coding gene. There is a strong connection between epigenome and miRNome, and any dysregulation of this complex system can result in various physiological and pathological conditions. In addition, miRNAs play an important role in toxicogenomics and may explain the relationship between toxicant exposure and tumorigenesis. The present review provides information on 63 miRNA genes shown to be epigenetically regulated in association with 21 diseases, including 11 cancer types: cardiac fibrosis, cardiovascular disease, preeclampsia, Hirschsprung's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, temporal lobe epilepsy, autism, pulmonary fibrosis, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colorectal, gastric, cervical, ovarian, prostate, lung, breast, and bladder cancer. The review revealed that hsa-miR-34a, hsa-miR-34b, and hsa-miR-34c are the most frequently reported epigenetically dysregulated miRNAs. There is a need to further study molecular mechanisms of various diseases to better understand the crosstalk between epigenetics and gene expression and to develop new therapeutic options and biomarkers.","['Piletic, Klara', 'Kunej, Tanja']","['Piletic K', 'Kunej T']","['Department of Animal Science, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Groblje 3, 1230, Domzale, Slovenia.', 'Department of Animal Science, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Groblje 3, 1230, Domzale, Slovenia. tanja.kunej@bf.uni-lj.si.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160824,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Disease/*genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histone Code/genetics', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'DNA methylation', 'Epigenetics', 'Histone modification', 'MicroRNA (miRNA)', 'Toxicology']",2016/08/26 06:00,2017/02/22 06:00,['2016/08/26 06:00'],"['2016/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00204-016-1815-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00204-016-1815-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2016 Oct;90(10):2405-19. doi: 10.1007/s00204-016-1815-7.

Direct Bcr-Abl inhibitors are initially successful for the treatment of CML but over time many patients develop drug resistance. In the present study, the effects of CM363, a novel naphthoquinone (NPQ) derivative, were evaluated on human CML-derived K562 cells. CM363 revealed an effective cell growth inhibition (IC50 = 0.7 +/- 0.5 muM) by inducing cancer cells to undergo cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. CM363 caused a dose- and time-dependent reduction of cells in G0/G1 and G2/M phases. This cell cycle arrest was associated with increased levels of cyclin E, pChk1 and pChk2 whereas CM363 downregulated cyclin B, cyclin D3, p27, pRB, Wee1, and BUBR1. CM363 increased the double-strand DNA break marker gammaH2AX. CM363 caused a time-dependent increase of annexin V-positive cells, DNA fragmentation and increased number of apoptotic nuclei. CM363 triggered the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway as reflected by a release of cytochrome C from mitochondria and induction of the cleavage of caspase-3 and -9, and PARP. CM363 showed multikinase modulatory effects through an early increased JNK phosphorylation followed by inhibition of pY-Bcrl-Abl and pY-Stat5. CM363 worked synergistically with imatinib to inhibit cell viability and maintained its activity in imatinib-resistant cells. Finally, CM363 (10 mg/Kg) suppressed the growth of K562 xenograft tumors in athymic mice. In summary, CM363 is a novel multikinase modulator that offers advantages to circumvent imanitib resistance and might be therapeutically effective in Bcrl-Abl-Stat5 related malignancies.","['Guerra, Borja', 'Martin-Rodriguez, Patricia', 'Diaz-Chico, Juan Carlos', 'McNaughton-Smith, Grant', 'Jimenez-Alonso, Sandra', 'Hueso-Falcon, Idaira', 'Montero, Juan Carlos', 'Blanco, Rosa', 'Leon, Javier', 'Rodriguez-Gonzalez, German', 'Estevez-Braun, Ana', 'Pandiella, Atanasio', 'Diaz-Chico, Bonifacio Nicolas', 'Fernandez-Perez, Leandro']","['Guerra B', 'Martin-Rodriguez P', 'Diaz-Chico JC', 'McNaughton-Smith G', 'Jimenez-Alonso S', 'Hueso-Falcon I', 'Montero JC', 'Blanco R', 'Leon J', 'Rodriguez-Gonzalez G', 'Estevez-Braun A', 'Pandiella A', 'Diaz-Chico BN', 'Fernandez-Perez L']","['Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias (IUIBS)-BioPharm Laboratory-Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Epana.', 'Unidad de Apoyo a la Docencia en Enfermeria-Fuerteventura, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Espana.', 'Instituto Canario de Investigacion sobre el Cancer (ICIC), Espana.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias (IUIBS)-BioPharm Laboratory-Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Epana.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias (IUIBS)-BioPharm Laboratory-Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Epana.', 'Instituto Canario de Investigacion sobre el Cancer (ICIC), Espana.', 'Centro Atlantico del Medicamento (CEAMED), Espana.', 'Instituto Canario de Investigacion sobre el Cancer (ICIC), Espana.', 'Departamento de Quimica Organica, Instituto de Bio-Organica Antonio Gonzalez (CIBICAN), Universidad de la Laguna, Espana.', 'Centro Atlantico del Medicamento (CEAMED), Espana.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca, Espana.', 'Instituto de Biomedicina y Biotecnologia de Cantabria (IBBTEC), Espana.', 'Instituto de Biomedicina y Biotecnologia de Cantabria (IBBTEC), Espana.', 'Centro Atlantico del Medicamento (CEAMED), Espana.', 'Instituto Canario de Investigacion sobre el Cancer (ICIC), Espana.', 'Departamento de Quimica Organica, Instituto de Bio-Organica Antonio Gonzalez (CIBICAN), Universidad de la Laguna, Espana.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca, Espana.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias (IUIBS)-BioPharm Laboratory-Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Epana.', 'Instituto Canario de Investigacion sobre el Cancer (ICIC), Espana.', 'Centro Atlantico del Medicamento (CEAMED), Espana.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias (IUIBS)-BioPharm Laboratory-Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Epana.', 'Instituto Canario de Investigacion sobre el Cancer (ICIC), Espana.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcrl-Abl-Stat5', '*imatinib resistance', '*leukemia', '*naphthoquinone']",2016/08/25 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2016/08/25 06:00'],"['2016/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['11425 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11425 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 2;8(18):29679-29698. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11425.,10.18632/oncotarget.11425 [doi],,,,"['Oncotarget. 2018 Aug 14;9(63):32272.

In experimental models, TP53-mutated lymphomas were sensitive to direct inhibition of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), a pivotal regulator of replication. We initially tested the potential of the highly specific Chk1 inhibitor SCH900776 to synergize with nucleoside analogs (NAs) fludarabine, cytarabine and gemcitabine in cell lines derived from B-cell malignancies. In p53-proficient NALM-6 cells, SCH900776 added to NAs enhanced signaling towards Chk1 (pSer317/pSer345), effectively blocked Chk1 activation (Ser296 autophosphorylation), increased replication stress (p53 and gamma-H2AX accumulation) and temporarily potentiated apoptosis. In p53-defective MEC-1 cell line representing adverse chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Chk1 inhibition together with NAs led to enhanced and sustained replication stress and significantly potentiated apoptosis. Altogether, among 17 tested cell lines SCH900776 sensitized four of them to all three NAs. Focusing further on MEC-1 and co-treatment of SCH900776 with fludarabine, we disclosed chromosome pulverization in cells undergoing aberrant mitoses. SCH900776 also increased the effect of fludarabine in a proportion of primary CLL samples treated with pro-proliferative stimuli, including those with TP53 disruption. Finally, we observed a fludarabine potentiation by SCH900776 in a T-cell leukemia 1 (TCL1)-driven mouse model of CLL.

The range of inciting factors is wide for this syndrome and includes thrombocytopenia, underlying infection, coagulopathy, and the frequent use of anticoagulants, given the high incidence of venous thrombosis in this population. Dyspnea, fever, and cough are commonly presenting symptoms. However, clinical manifestations can be variable. Obvious bleeding (hemoptysis) is not always present and can pose a potential diagnostic challenge. Without prompt treatment, hypoxia that rapidly progresses to respiratory failure can occur. Diagnosis is primarily based on radiological and bronchoscopic findings. This syndrome is especially common in patients with hematological malignancies, given an even greater propensity for thrombocytopenia as a result of bone marrow suppression as well as the often prolonged immunosuppression in this patient population. The syndrome also has an increased incidence in individuals with hematological malignancies who have received a bone marrow transplant. We present a case series of 5 patients with acute myeloid leukemia presenting with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage at our institution.

Among them is FoxO1, a transcription factor that imposes quiescence in several cell types, including T lymphocytes. In these cells, the FAM65B encoding gene is a major target of FOXO1. Here, we show that forced expression of FAM65B in transformed cells blocks their mitosis because of a defect of the mitotic spindle, leading to G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Upon cell proliferation arrest, FAM65B is engaged in a complex containing two proteins well known to be involved in cell proliferation i.e. the HDAC6 deacetylase and the 14.3.3 scaffolding protein. In primary T cells, FAM65B is down-regulated upon T cell receptor engagement, and maintaining its expression blocks their proliferation, establishing that the decrease of FAM65B expression is required for proliferation. Conversely, inhibiting FAM65B expression in naive T lymphocytes decreases their activation threshold. These results identify FAM65B as a potential new target for controlling proliferation of both transformed and normal cells.","['Froehlich, Jeanne', 'Versapuech, Margaux', 'Megrelis, Laura', 'Largeteau, Quitterie', 'Meunier, Sylvain', 'Tanchot, Corinne', 'Bismuth, Georges', 'Delon, Jerome', 'Mangeney, Marianne']","['Froehlich J', 'Versapuech M', 'Megrelis L', 'Largeteau Q', 'Meunier S', 'Tanchot C', 'Bismuth G', 'Delon J', 'Mangeney M']","['Inserm, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Cnrs, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Inserm, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Cnrs, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Inserm, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Cnrs, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Inserm, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Cnrs, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Inserm, PARCC, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Inserm, PARCC, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Inserm, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Cnrs, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Inserm, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Cnrs, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Inserm, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Cnrs, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (FOXO1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RIPOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1/*metabolism', 'G2 Phase', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Mitosis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spindle Apparatus/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['T lymphocytes', 'cell cycle', 'cell proliferation', 'leukemia', 'signaling']",2016/08/25 06:00,2018/04/19 06:00,['2016/08/25 06:00'],"['2016/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['11438 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11438 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 27;7(39):63215-63225. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11438.,10.18632/oncotarget.11438 [doi],,,,,PMC5325358,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the role of Ras effector pathways in AML using murine and human AML models. Whereas genetic disruption of NRAS(V12) expression in an NRAS(V12) and Mll-AF9-driven murine AML induced apoptosis of leukemic cells, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and/or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling did not reproduce this effect. Conversely, genetic disruption of RALB signaling induced AML cell death and phenocopied the effects of suppressing oncogenic Ras directly - uncovering a novel role for RALB signaling in AML survival. Knockdown of RALB led to decreased phosphorylation of TBK1 and reduced BCL2 expression, providing mechanistic insight into RALB survival signaling in AML. Notably, we found that patient-derived AML blasts have higher levels of RALB-TBK1 signaling compared to normal blood leukocytes, supporting a pathophysiologic role for RALB signaling for AML patients. Overall, our work provides new insight into the specific roles of Ras effector pathways in AML and has identified RALB signaling as a key survival pathway.","['Eckfeldt, Craig E', 'Pomeroy, Emily J', 'Lee, Robin D W', 'Hazen, Katherine S', 'Lee, Lindsey A', 'Moriarity, Branden S', 'Largaespada, David A']","['Eckfeldt CE', 'Pomeroy EJ', 'Lee RD', 'Hazen KS', 'Lee LA', 'Moriarity BS', 'Largaespada DA']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Ralb protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ral GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*physiology', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ral GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCL2', 'RALB', 'RAS signaling', 'TBK1', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)']",2016/08/25 06:00,2018/02/24 06:00,['2016/08/25 06:00'],"['2016/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['11431 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11431 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Oct 4;7(40):65147-65156. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11431.,10.18632/oncotarget.11431 [doi],,,,,PMC5323144,,"['P30 CA077598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007062/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How viruses coordinate the intracellular trafficking of both RNA and protein components to the assembly sites of infectious particles at the cell surface remains a long-standing question. The mechanisms ensuring packaging of genomic RNA are essential for viral infectivity. Since RNA packaging impacts on several essential functions of retroviral replication such as RNA dimerization, translation and recombination events, there are many studies that require the determination of RNA packaging efficiency and/or RNA packaging ability. Studies of RNA encapsidation rely upon techniques for the identification and quantification of RNA species packaged by the virus. This review focuses on the different approaches available to monitor RNA packaging: Northern blot analysis, ribonuclease protection assay and quantitative reverse transcriptase-coupled polymerase chain reaction as well as the most recent RNA imaging and sequencing technologies.

METHODS: Gene expression of miR-144 was examined using the quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in both ALL cell lines and T-leukemic cells of ALL patients. In ALL cell lines Molt-3 and Jurkat cells, miR-144 was either upregulated or downregulated through lentiviral transduction. The subsequent effects of miR-144 upregulation or downregulation on ALL proliferation, cell-cycle transition and in vivo xenograft were assessed. A possible downstream target of miR-144, human formin-2 (FMN2), was assessed by a dual-luciferase activity assay, qRT-PCR and western blotting. FMN2 was then overexpressed in miR-144-upregulated Molt-3 and Jurkat cells to determine its effect on miR-144 induced tumor suppression on ALL proliferation and cell-cycle transition. RESULTS: MiR-144 was significantly downregulated in both ALL cell lines and T-leukemic cells of ALL patients. Lentiviral transfection successfully induced miR-144 upregulation or downregulation in Molt-3 and Jurkat cells without affecting cell viability. Functional assays demonstrated that miR-144 upregulation suppressed ALL proliferation and cell-cycle transition in vitro, as well as the growth of Jurkat xenograft in vivo, whereas miR-144 downregulation had no functional effect on ALL development. Multiple approaches confirmed that FMN2 was the downstream target of miR-144 in ALL. Finally, overexpressing FMN2 reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-144-upregulation on ALL proliferation and cell-cycle transition. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-144 functions as a tumor suppressor in ALL, very likely through the inverse regulation of its target gene FMN2.","['Jin, Jie', 'Wang, Yu', 'Xu, Yang', 'Zhou, Xu', 'Liu, Yu', 'Li, Xiang', 'Wang, Jin']","['Jin J', 'Wang Y', 'Xu Y', 'Zhou X', 'Liu Y', 'Li X', 'Wang J']","['Department of Hematology, Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (Fmn2 protein, human)', '0 (Formins)', '0 (MIRN144 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Formins', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Microfilament Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['FMN2', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cell-cycle transition', 'miR-144', 'proliferation', 'xenograft']",2016/08/25 06:00,2018/04/03 06:00,['2016/08/25 06:00'],"['2016/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/03 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.2898 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2017 Jun;19(6-7). doi: 10.1002/jgm.2898.,10.1002/jgm.2898 [doi],"['Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A diverse set of cascades have been implicated in various cancers including those mediated by serine/threonine kinases such RAS, PI3K/AKT, and PKC. Signal transduction is a dynamic process involving both ""On"" and ""Off"" switches. Activating mutations of RAS or PI3K can be viewed as the switch being stuck in the ""On"" position resulting in continued signaling by a survival and/or proliferation pathway. On the other hand, inactivation of protein phosphatases such as the PP2A family can be seen as the defective ""Off"" switch that similarly can activate these pathways. A problem for therapeutic targeting of PP2A is that the enzyme is a hetero-trimer and thus drug targeting involves complex structures. More importantly, since PP2A isoforms generally act as tumor suppressors one would want to activate these enzymes rather than suppress them. The elucidation of the role of cellular inhibitors like SET and CIP2A in cancer suggests that targeting these proteins can have therapeutic efficacy by mechanisms involving PP2A activation. Furthermore, drugs such as FTY-720 can activate PP2A isoforms directly. This review will cover the current state of knowledge of PP2A role as a tumor suppressor in cancer cells and as a mediator of processes that can impact drug resistance and immune surveillance.","['Ruvolo, Peter P']",['Ruvolo PP'],"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 0425, Houston, TX 77030, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160803,Netherlands,BBA Clin,BBA clinical,101633879,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'CIP2A', 'Cell cycle', 'Drug resistance', 'Immune surveillance', 'PP2A', 'SET']",2016/08/25 06:00,2016/08/25 06:01,['2016/08/25 06:00'],"['2016/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.bbacli.2016.08.002 [doi]', 'S2214-6474(16)30032-0 [pii]']",epublish,BBA Clin. 2016 Aug 3;6:87-99. doi: 10.1016/j.bbacli.2016.08.002. eCollection 2016 Dec.,10.1016/j.bbacli.2016.08.002 [doi],,,,,PMC4986044,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The morphology and optical properties of the hyaluronan/zinc oxide (HA/ZnO) nanocomposite were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and ultraviolet-vis analysis. Electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the zinc oxide nanoparticles were polydispersed with a mean size of 10.2+/-1.5 nm. The nanoparticles were mostly hexagonal in crystalline form. The HA/ZnO nanocomposite showed the absorption properties in the ultraviolet zone that is ascribed to the band gap of zinc oxide nanocomposite.

On the other hand, HA/ZnO nanocomposite treatment for 72 hours did not cause toxicity to the normal human lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cell line. Using fluorescent dyes and flow cytometry analysis, HA/ZnO nanocomposite caused G2/M cell cycle arrest and stimulated apoptosis-related increase in caspase-3 and -7 activities of the HL-60 cells. Thus, the study shows that the HA/ZnO nanocomposite produced through green synthesis has great potential to be developed into an efficacious therapeutic agent for cancers.","['Namvar, Farideh', 'Azizi, Susan', 'Rahman, Heshu Sulaiman', 'Mohamad, Rosfarizan', 'Rasedee, Abdullah', 'Soltani, Mozhgan', 'Rahim, Raha Abdul']","['Namvar F', 'Azizi S', 'Rahman HS', 'Mohamad R', 'Rasedee A', 'Soltani M', 'Rahim RA']","['Institute of Tropical Forestry and Forest Products (INTROP), Universiti Putra Malaysia, UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia; Research Center for Animal Development Applied Biology, Mashhad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Bioprocess Technology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences.', 'Department of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosis, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia, UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia; Department of Clinic and Internal Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Sulaimani; Department of Laboratory Medical Sciences, Komar University of Science and Technology, Sulaimani City, Kurdistan Region, Northern Iraq.', 'Institute of Tropical Forestry and Forest Products (INTROP), Universiti Putra Malaysia, UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia; Department of Bioprocess Technology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences.', 'Department of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosis, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia, UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Research Center for Animal Development Applied Biology, Mashhad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160726,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['anticancer activity', 'green synthesis', 'hyaluronan', 'zinc oxide nanocomposite']",2016/08/25 06:00,2016/08/25 06:01,['2016/08/25 06:00'],"['2016/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S95962 [doi]', 'ott-9-4549 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2016 Jul 26;9:4549-59. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S95962. eCollection 2016.,10.2147/OTT.S95962 [doi],,,,,PMC4968863,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies requiring subject participation are usually hampered by selection of more educated parents. To prevent such bias, we used unselected nationwide Geographical Information System (GIS)-based registry data, to investigate the influence of socio-economic disparities on the risk of childhood cancer. METHODS: The Geocap study included all French residents diagnosed with cancer aged up to 15 years over the period 2002-2010 (15 111 cases) and 45 000 contemporaneous controls representative of the childhood population. Area socio-economic characteristics used to calculate the European Deprivation Index (EDI) were based on census data collected on the fine scale of the Merged Islet for Statistical Information (IRIS). RESULTS: Overall, the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was lower in the most deprived quintile than in the other quintiles of EDI (ORQ5vs<Q5 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73, 0.88)). The odds ratio for all the other cancers taken together was close to the null (ORQ5vs<Q5 0.99 (95% CI 0.94, 1.04)). CONCLUSION: Living in the most deprived areas was inversely associated with the risk of ALL in childhood. There was no indication that the risk of childhood cancer of any site could be increased by deprivation. Life style or environmental factors potentially underlying the association need further investigation.","['Marquant, Fabienne', 'Goujon, Stephanie', 'Faure, Laure', 'Guissou, Sandra', 'Orsi, Laurent', 'Hemon, Denis', 'Lacour, Brigitte', 'Clavel, Jacqueline']","['Marquant F', 'Goujon S', 'Faure L', 'Guissou S', 'Orsi L', 'Hemon D', 'Lacour B', 'Clavel J']","['Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Centre (CRESS), Epidemiology of childhood and adolescent cancers research group (EPICEA), INSERM, UMR 1153, Paris Descartes University, Villejuif, France.', 'Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Centre (CRESS), Epidemiology of childhood and adolescent cancers research group (EPICEA), INSERM, UMR 1153, Paris Descartes University, Villejuif, France.', 'French National Registry of Childhood Haematological Malignancies (NRCH), Villejuif, France.', 'Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Centre (CRESS), Epidemiology of childhood and adolescent cancers research group (EPICEA), INSERM, UMR 1153, Paris Descartes University, Villejuif, France.', 'French National Registry of Childhood Haematological Malignancies (NRCH), Villejuif, France.', 'French National Registry of Childhood Solid Tumours (NRCST), Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.', 'Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Centre (CRESS), Epidemiology of childhood and adolescent cancers research group (EPICEA), INSERM, UMR 1153, Paris Descartes University, Villejuif, France.', 'Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Centre (CRESS), Epidemiology of childhood and adolescent cancers research group (EPICEA), INSERM, UMR 1153, Paris Descartes University, Villejuif, France.', 'French National Registry of Childhood Solid Tumours (NRCST), Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.', 'Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Centre (CRESS), Epidemiology of childhood and adolescent cancers research group (EPICEA), INSERM, UMR 1153, Paris Descartes University, Villejuif, France.', 'French National Registry of Childhood Haematological Malignancies (NRCH), Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160824,England,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol,Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,8709766,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Life Style', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Residence Characteristics/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Urban Health/statistics & numerical data']",['NOTNLM'],"['children', 'contextual socio-economic status', 'deprivation', 'haematological malignancies', 'solid tumours']",2016/08/25 06:00,2017/03/23 06:00,['2016/08/25 06:00'],"['2016/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ppe.12313 [doi]'],ppublish,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol. 2016 Nov;30(6):612-622. doi: 10.1111/ppe.12313.

Asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (AAP) is a common reason for stopping asparaginase treatment. The aim of this study was to explore if HTG or early elevations in pancreatic enzymes were associated with the subsequent development of AAP. METHOD: Children (1.0-17.9 years) diagnosed with ALL, treated with asparaginase for 30 weeks, according to the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol at the University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark, were eligible. Pancreatic enzymes, triglycerides, and cholesterol were measured regularly. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were included. Seven patients were diagnosed with AAP. HTG was most evident when PEG-asparaginase and dexamethasone were administered concomitantly. Overall, there was no significant difference in triglyceride levels in patients who experienced AAP and patients who did not. An increase in triglyceride levels during concomitant dexamethasone therapy in delayed intensification was significantly associated with an increase in pancreas-specific amylase levels two weeks later (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: AAP does not seem to be associated with HTG. Continuous monitoring of pancreas enzymes does not predict AAP.","['Raja, Raheel Altaf', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Sorensen, Ditte Norbo', 'Frandsen, Thomas Leth']","['Raja RA', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Sorensen DN', 'Frandsen TL']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Section of Biostatistics, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160824,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Triglycerides)', 'EC 3.2.1.1 (Pancreatic alpha-Amylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hypertriglyceridemia/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pancreatic alpha-Amylases/*blood', 'Pancreatitis/blood/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Triglycerides/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*children', '*hypertriglyceridemia', '*l-asparaginase', '*leukemia', '*pancreatitis']",2016/08/25 06:00,2017/06/21 06:00,['2016/08/25 06:00'],"['2016/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/04 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26183 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Jan;64(1):32-38. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26183.

We sought to determine the significance of neuraxis imaging in such patients. PROCEDURE: Magnetic resonance images of children aged 1-17.9 with CNS leukemia at diagnosis of ALL were centrally reviewed and clinical data were retrieved from the medical records and the Nordic leukemia registry. Patients were diagnosed in the period 2000-2012 in Sweden, Finland, or Denmark. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 1,877 patients, and 66 (3.5%) had CNS involvement. Forty-five percent (30/66) had CNS related symptoms. Symptoms included vomiting, facial palsy, headache, visual symptoms, and impaired hearing. CNS imaging was performed in 32 of 66 children (48%), and confirmed CNS involvement in 6 of 21 patients with symptoms (29%) and 5 of 11 (45%) without (P = 0.44). There was no difference in the overall survival between CNS-positive patients with and without signs of leukemic involvement by imaging (P = 0.53). CONCLUSIONS: Radiological imaging of asymptomatic children with CNS leukemia at diagnosis lacks clinical importance, but may be useful in patients with cranial nerve symptoms and negative CSF, as well as for follow-up. Imaging of symptomatic patients is warranted in order to exclude other causes underlying the symptoms.","['Ranta, Susanna', 'Palomaki, Maarit', 'Levinsen, Mette', 'Taskinen, Mervi', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Mellgren, Karin', 'Niinimaki, Riitta', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Harila-Saari, Arja']","['Ranta S', 'Palomaki M', 'Levinsen M', 'Taskinen M', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Mellgren K', 'Niinimaki R', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Heyman M', 'Harila-Saari A']","[""Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of Women's and Children's Health, Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Department of Radiology, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Children and Adolescents Hospital, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Children and Adolescents, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Faculty of Medicine, The Institute of Gynecology, Obstetrics, and Pediatrics, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of Women's and Children's Health, Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of Women's and Children's Health, Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160824,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neuroimaging/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CNS leukemia', '*imaging', '*pediatric']",2016/08/25 06:00,2017/06/21 06:00,['2016/08/25 06:00'],"['2016/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26182 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Jan;64(1):64-70. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26182.

In this study, pathology databases from 4 institutions were queried for PLB in individuals 1 to 21 years old. A total of 54 cases of PLB were identified, including 41 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL, 76%), 8 B-lymphoblastic lymphomas (BLL, 15%), 3 anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL, 6%), and 2 low-grade follicular lymphomas (4%). The male/female ratio was 1.8:1 and median age was 16 years (range, 2-21). Patients with DLBCL were significantly older (P<.001), and patients with ALCL and BLL were significantly younger (P=.050 and P=.008, respectively) when compared with the other patients. Due to necrosis, crush artifact, and/or insufficient material, 30% of cases required multiple biopsies for diagnosis. The femur, tibia, pelvic bones, humerus, and vertebrae were most commonly involved. DLBCL patients had significantly more solitary bone involvement (P=.001), whereas BLL had significantly more polyostotic involvement (P<.001). Of the 37 patients with outcome data, all had no evidence of disease on last follow-up. This largest pediatric series of PLB identifies DLBCL as the most frequent subtype and documents rarer occurrences of BLL, ALCL, and follicular lymphomas.

Recent studies have demonstrated that reduction in cohesin complex levels leads to enhanced self-renewal in hematopoietic stem and progenitors (HSPCs). We sought to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which cohesin mutations promote enhanced HSPC self-renewal as this represents a critical initial step during leukemic transformation. We verified that RNAi against the cohesin subunit Rad21 causes enhanced self-renewal of HSPCs in vitro through derepression of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) target genes, including Hoxa7 and Hoxa9. Importantly, knockdown of either Hoxa7 or Hoxa9 suppressed self-renewal, implying that both are critical downstream effectors of reduced cohesin levels. We further demonstrate that the cohesin and PRC2 complexes interact and are bound in close proximity to Hoxa7 and Hoxa9. Rad21 depletion resulted in decreased levels of H3K27me3 at the Hoxa7 and Hoxa9 promoters, consistent with Rad21 being critical to proper gene silencing by recruiting the PRC2 complex. Our data demonstrates that the cohesin complex regulates PRC2 targeting to silence Hoxa7 and Hoxa9 and negatively regulate self-renewal.

The BRAF V600E mutation is now recognized as the causal genetic event of HCL because it is somatic, present in the entire tumor clone, detectable in almost all cases at diagnosis (encompassing the whole disease spectrum), and stable at relapse. BRAF V600E leads to the constitutive activation of the RAF-MEK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway which represents the key event in the molecular pathogenesis of HCL. KLF2 and CDNK1B (p27) mutations may cooperate with BRAF V600E in promoting leukemic transformation. Sensitive molecular assays for detecting BRAF V600E allow HCL (highly responsive to purine analogs) to be better distinguished from HCL-like disorders, which are treated differently. In vitro preclinical studies on purified HCL cells proved that BRAF and MEK inhibitors can induce marked dephosphorylation of MEK/ERK, silencing of RAF-MEK-ERK pathway transcriptional output, loss of the HCL-specific gene expression profile signature, change of morphology from ""hairy"" to ""smooth,"" and eventually apoptosis. The overall response rate of refractory/relapsed HCL patients to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib approached 100%, with 35% to 40% complete remissions (CRs). The median relapse free-survival was about 19 months in patients who had achieved CR and 6 months in those who had obtained a partial response. Future therapeutic perspectives include: (1) combining BRAF inhibitors with MEK inhibitors or immunotherapy (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) to increase the percentage of CRs and (2) better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance of HCL cells to BRAF inhibitors.","['Falini, Brunangelo', 'Martelli, Maria Paola', 'Tiacci, Enrico']","['Falini B', 'Martelli MP', 'Tiacci E']","['Institute of Hematology and Center for Hemato-Oncology Research (CREO), University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology and Center for Hemato-Oncology Research (CREO), University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology and Center for Hemato-Oncology Research (CREO), University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160823,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (KLF2 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', '*Leukemia, Hairy Cell/enzymology/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*genetics', '*Mutation, Missense', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Rate']",,,2016/08/25 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/08/25 06:00'],"['2016/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)34050-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-07-418434 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Oct 13;128(15):1918-1927. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-07-418434.

Studies have increasingly focused on the activities of HDACs, especially involving non-histone proteins, and their various biological effects. Aberrant HDAC expression observed in several kinds of human tumors makes HDACs potential targets for cancer treatment. Several preclinical studies have suggested that HDAC inhibitors show some efficacy in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia with AML1-ETO, which mediates transcriptional repression through its interaction with a complex including HDAC1. Recurrent mutations in epigenetic regulators are found in T-cell lymphomas (TCLs), and HDAC inhibitors and hypomethylating agents were shown to act cooperatively in the treatment of TCLs. Preclinical modeling has suggested that persistent activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway could serve as a useful biomarker of resistance to HDAC inhibitor in patients with cutaneous TCL. Panobinostat, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, has achieved longer progression-free survival in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) than the placebo in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Panobinostat inhibited MM cell growth by degrading protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit alpha (PPP3CA), a catalytic subunit of calcineurin. This degradation was suggested to be mediated by the blockade of the chaperone function of heat shock protein 90 due to HDAC6 inhibition. Aberrant PPP3CA expression in advanced MM indicated a possible correlation between high PPP3CA expression and the pathogenesis of MM. Furthermore, PPP3CA was suggested as a common target of panobinostat and bortezomib.","['Imai, Yoichi', 'Maru, Yoshiro', 'Tanaka, Junji']","['Imai Y', 'Maru Y', 'Tanaka J']","[""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Department of Pharmacology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20161104,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP3CA protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcineurin/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/enzymology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Hematological malignancy', 'T-cell lymphoma', 'histone deacetylase inhibitor', 'multiple myeloma', 'panobinostat']",2016/08/25 06:00,2017/02/15 06:00,['2016/08/25 06:00'],"['2016/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/12 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13062 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2016 Nov;107(11):1543-1549. doi: 10.1111/cas.13062.

However, the molecular basis of metastatic breast cancer and its therapeutic vulnerabilities remain poorly understood. Here we show that PML is a novel target in aggressive breast cancer. The acquisition of aggressiveness and metastatic features in breast tumours is accompanied by the elevated PML expression and enhanced sensitivity to its inhibition. Interestingly, we find that STAT3 is responsible, at least in part, for the transcriptional upregulation of PML in breast cancer. Moreover, PML targeting hampers breast cancer initiation and metastatic seeding. Mechanistically, this biological activity relies on the regulation of the stem cell gene SOX9 through interaction of PML with its promoter region. Altogether, we identify a novel pathway sustaining breast cancer aggressiveness that can be therapeutically exploited in combination with PML-based stratification.","['Martin-Martin, Natalia', 'Piva,

We have observed that some patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) develop ATLL during treatment at our hospital. The aim of this study was to examine treatment factors associated with onset of ATLL through an evaluation of the therapeutic background of these patients. METHODS: The impact of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery on occurrence of ATLL was evaluated in 146 patients with head and neck SCC who were treated at our hospital between April 2010 and December 2013. RESULTS: Of 146 patients, 17 were HTLV-1 positive and 6 developed ATLL. There was a significant relationship between ATLL development and administration of S-1 chemotherapy (p=0.0003), but not with use of radiotherapy, surgery or other drugs. CONCLUSION: The involvement of S-1 chemotherapy in ATLL development suggests that a test for HTLV-1 antibody should be performed before treatment and that S-1 should not be administered in HTLV-1 positive patients with head and neck carcinoma.","['Nagano, Hiromi', 'Kurono, Yuichi', 'Matushita, Kakushi']","['Nagano H', 'Kurono Y', 'Matushita K']","['Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Japan.

As the International Scale (IS) normalised BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratio at 3 months post-treatment is now an important milestone in patients' treatment schedule, the reliable and reproducible measurement of BCR-ABL1 levels is therefore paramount. IS conversion factors (CF) are established via sample exchange and yearly ratification with an external reference laboratory. Since any change to an established IS CF could lead to discontinuity in longitudinal results, we wished to add an internal verification step as an additional safeguard. We used the Cepheid GeneXpert qPCR and IS calibrated Xpert BCR-ABL Monitor cartridge system, parallel to our in-house pipeline on 50 CML samples, over the period of one week to verify the CF for those samples and compare it to the externally provided CF. The median non-IS in-house BCR-ABL1/ABL1 values were significantly different than that from the IS GeneXpert, but they became non-significant when adjusted to CF provided by the CXM and by the current external CF, validating it. These metrics can help decide to accept or reject an updated CF value, especially where a significant change in CF might lead to a discontinuity in ongoing patient monitoring.","['Gerrard, Gareth', 'Foong, Hui En', 'Mudge, Katherine', 'Alikian, Mary', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Foroni, Letizia']","['Gerrard G', 'Foong HE', 'Mudge K', 'Alikian M', 'Apperley JF', 'Foroni L']","['Centre for Haematology, Imperial College London, Du Cane Road, London W12 ONN, UK; Research Department of Pathology, UCL Cancer Institute, London WC1E 6DE, UK.

The DNA virome of 95 children who later developed ALL was characterised from neonatal blood spots (NBS) using unbiased next-generation sequencing (NGS) and compared with the virome of 95 non-ALL controls. METHODS: DNA was individually extracted from the ALL-patients and controls, pooled, randomly amplified and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq Sequencing System. RESULTS: Virus-like sequences identified in both groups mapped to human endogenous retroviruses and propionibacterium phage, considered a part of the normal microbial flora. Potential pathogens human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) and parvovirus B19 were also identified, but only few samples in both ALL and controls tested positive by PCR follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Unbiased NGS was employed to search for DNA from potential infectious agents in neonatal samples of children who later developed ALL. Although several viral candidates were identified in the NBS samples, further investigation by PCR suggested that these viruses did not have a major role in ALL development.","['Bogdanovic, G', 'Pou, C', 'Barrientos-Somarribas, M', 'Bjerkner, A', 'Honkaniemi, E', 'Allander, T', 'Andersson, B', 'Gustafsson, B']","['Bogdanovic G', 'Pou C', 'Barrientos-Somarribas M', 'Bjerkner A', 'Honkaniemi E', 'Allander T', 'Andersson B', 'Gustafsson B']","['Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sodertalje Hospital, SE-152 86 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, CLINTEC, Karolinska Institutet, S-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, CLINTEC, Karolinska Institutet, S-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, SE-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160823,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'Parvovirus antenatal infection']",IM,"['Bacteriophages/isolation & purification', 'Blood/*virology', 'Blood Specimen Collection', 'Contig Mapping', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Erythema Infectiosum', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn/*blood', 'Male', '*Neonatal Screening', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*virology', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sweden']",,,2016/08/24 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2016/08/24 06:00'],"['2016/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['bjc2016261 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2016.261 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2016 Oct 11;115(8):1008-1014. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2016.261.

GBS has again reached the general public with its possible association with Zika virus. The virus, borne by infected Aedes aegypti mosquitos, is being linked to birth defects when pregnant women are bitten and infected. There are early reports also linking GBS to Zika infection, which could expose a wider range of infected people to the neuropathy. This summer infected Aedes mosquitos will likely reach southern portions of the United States, and travelers to countries where Aedes is endemic will increase. It is important to appreciate that the neurologic consequences of Zika virus are being actively investigated, and firm associations and consequences are yet to be established. Small fiber neuropathies are common and can be due to a number of underlying diseases, and a recent review also indicates that many are idiopathic. One cause is Sjogren syndrome, and a case series reviews clinical features. The diagnosis and underlying features of primary lateral sclerosis are a clinical challenge. Similarities between primary lateral sclerosis and hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP) have long been noted. With a wide spectrum of gene mutations associated with HSP, clinical distinction between the 2 disorders is problematic. A review covers the wide spectrum of HSP. With no cure, the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to respiratory failure is predictable. This could easily result in marked depression among patients, and 2 studies have explored the frequency and severity of depression. The cause of ALS remains unknown, and when no hereditary factor is apparent, environmental questions arise as possible contributing factor(s). The most notable association is with military service, although specific occupational or environmental linkages are not well sorted out. Two recent reports address these issues. There is good news for ALS patients with muscle cramps with the results of a multicenter randomized and placebo-controlled trial showing that mexiletine is effective in reducing this common symptom. The treatment of myasthenia gravis with various agents, the use of patient-reported outcome measures in myasthenia gravis, and the occurrence of myocarditis in this disease are reviewed. Necrotizing autoimmune neuropathies, the co-occurrence of inclusion body myositis and a form of T-cell leukemia are discussed as are valosin-containing protein (VCP)-opathy and bone health in patients with dystrophinopathy.","['Silvestri, Nicholas J', 'Wolfe, Gil I', 'Lacomis, David', 'Bromberg, Mark B']","['Silvestri NJ', 'Wolfe GI', 'Lacomis D', 'Bromberg MB']","['*Department of Neurology, University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Buffalo, NY; Departments of daggerNeurology; double daggerPathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA; and section signDepartment of Neurology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Clin Neuromuscul Dis,Journal of clinical neuromuscular disease,100887391,,IM,,,,2016/08/24 06:00,2016/08/24 06:01,['2016/08/24 06:00'],"['2016/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1097/CND.0000000000000139 [doi]', '00131402-201609000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Neuromuscul Dis. 2016 Sep;18(1):47-59. doi: 10.1097/CND.0000000000000139.,10.1097/CND.0000000000000139 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although several medical interventions in adults with symptomatic or asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction due to other causes are beneficial, it is not known if the same treatments are effective for childhood cancer patients and survivors with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of medical interventions on anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in childhood cancer patients or survivors with the effect of placebo, other medical interventions, or no treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2015, Issue 8), MEDLINE/PubMed (1949 to September 2015), and EMBASE/Ovid (1980 to September 2015) for potentially relevant articles. In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the American Society of Hematology (ASH), the International Conference on Long-Term Complications of Treatment of Children & Adolescents for Cancer, and the European Symposium on Late Complications from Childhood Cancer (from 2005 to 2015), and ongoing trial databases (the ISRCTN Register, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Register, and the trials register of the World Health Organization (WHO); all searched in September 2015). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing the effectiveness of medical interventions to treat anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity with either placebo, other medical interventions, or no treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed the study selection. One review author performed the data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessments, which another review author checked. We performed analyses according to the guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. MAIN RESULTS: In the original version of the review we identified two RCTs; in this update we identified no additional studies. One trial (135 participants) compared enalapril with placebo in childhood cancer survivors with asymptomatic anthracycline-induced cardiac dysfunction. The other trial (68 participants) compared a two-week treatment of phosphocreatine with a control treatment (vitamin C, adenosine triphosphate, vitamin E, oral coenzyme Q10) in leukaemia patients with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Both studies had methodological limitations.The RCT on enalapril showed no statistically significant differences in overall survival, mortality due to heart failure, development of clinical heart failure, and quality of life between treatment and control groups. A post-hoc analysis showed a decrease (that is improvement) in one measure of cardiac function (left ventricular end-systolic wall stress (LVESWS): -8.62% change) compared with placebo (+1.66% change) in the first year of treatment (P = 0.036), but not afterwards. Participants treated with enalapril had a higher risk of dizziness or hypotension (risk ratio 7.17, 95% confidence interval 1.71 to 30.17) and fatigue (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.013).The RCT on phosphocreatine found no differences in overall survival, mortality due to heart failure, echocardiographic cardiac function, and adverse events between treatment and control groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Only one trial evaluated the effect of enalapril in childhood cancer survivors with asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction. Although there is some evidence that enalapril temporarily improves one parameter of cardiac function (LVESWS), it is unclear whether it improves clinical outcomes. Enalapril was associated with a higher risk of dizziness or hypotension and fatigue. Clinicians should weigh the possible benefits with the known side effects of enalapril in childhood cancer survivors with asymptomatic anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.Only one trial evaluated the effect of phosphocreatine in childhood cancer patients with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Limited data with a high risk of bias showed no significant difference between phosphocreatine and control treatments on echocardiographic function and clinical outcomes.We did not identify any RCTs or CCTs studying other medical interventions for symptomatic or asymptomatic cardiotoxicity in childhood cancer patients or survivors.High-quality studies should be performed.","['Cheuk, Daniel K L', 'Sieswerda, Elske', 'van Dalen, Elvira C', 'Postma, Aleida', 'Kremer, Leontien C M']","['Cheuk DK', 'Sieswerda E', 'van Dalen EC', 'Postma A', 'Kremer LC']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20160823,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cardiotonic Agents)', '020IUV4N33 (Phosphocreatine)', '69PN84IO1A (Enalapril)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Adult Survivors of Child Adverse Events', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Anthracyclines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Cardiotonic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Enalapril/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Heart Failure/chemically induced/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Phosphocreatine/*therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",,,2016/08/24 06:00,2016/10/21 06:00,['2016/08/24 06:00'],"['2016/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD008011.pub3 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2016 Aug 23;(8):CD008011. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD008011.pub3.,10.1002/14651858.CD008011.pub3 [doi],,,,,PMC8626738,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2011;(9):CD008011.

As a reliable marker of disease burden, it also serves as the target of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). New more sensitive molecular diagnostic tools for BCR-ABL1 can contribute to therapeutic decision-making, especially in considering drug discontinuation for patients enjoying prolonged deep molecular response. Areas covered: Several novel platforms are transforming CML molecular diagnostics to enable faster point-of-care devices, better understanding of clonal diversity and resistance mutations. Here, we review these molecular platforms, knowing implementation in other hematological malignancies will ensue. Expert commentary: Treatment with TKI in CML is the first example of a highly effective targeted therapy. Monitoring of BCR-ABL1 mRNA is standard in assessing disease burden being highly predictive of outcomes recommended by both European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN); however, studies has demonstrated poor adherence to these recommendations. In both clinical practice and assay performance, further optimizing of BCR-ABL1 monitoring can be envisioned including point-of-care methods for increased availability of rapid, standardized testing and increasingly sensitive molecular assays that allow for quantification of MRD and detecting resistance mutations.","['Yeung, Cecilia Ching Sze', 'Egan, Daniel', 'Radich, Jerald P']","['Yeung CC', 'Egan D', 'Radich JP']","['a Clinical Research Division , Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Ringgold standard institution , Seattle , WA , USA.', 'b Pathology , University of Washington School of Medicine Ringgold standard institution , Seattle , WA , USA.', 'a Clinical Research Division , Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Ringgold standard institution , Seattle , WA , USA.', 'c Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle , WA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160906,England,Expert Rev Mol Diagn,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,101120777,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', '*Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Mutation', 'Point-of-Care Systems', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL1 transcript levels', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*molecular diagnostics', '*monitoring', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance mutations']",2016/08/24 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2016/08/24 06:00'],"['2016/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737159.2016.1227243 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Mol Diagn. 2016 Oct;16(10):1083-1091. doi: 10.1080/14737159.2016.1227243.

In this study we investigated the antileukemia effects and the possible mechanisms of CPX on glucocorticoid (GC)-resistant T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines. The results indicated that CPX inhibited the growth of GC-resistant T-ALL cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and this effect was closely correlated with the downregulation of intracellular ferritin. CPX induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase by upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor of p21 and downregulation of the expressions of cyclin D, retinoblastoma protein (Rb), and phosphorylated Rb (pRb). CPX also enhanced apoptotic cell death by downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1. More importantly, CPX demonstrated a strong synergistic antileukemia effect with GC and this effect was mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of the beta-catenin-c-Myc signaling pathway. These findings suggest that CPX could be a promising antileukemia drug, and modulation of the intracellular ferritin expression might be an effective method in the treatment of ALL. Therefore, integrating CPX into the current GC-containing ALL protocols could lead to the improvement of the outcome of ALL, especially GC-resistant ALL.","['Wu, Jianrong', 'Liu, Huajun', 'Zhang, Ge', 'Gu, Ling', 'Zhang, Yanle', 'Gao, Ju', 'Wei, Yuquan', 'Ma, Zhigui']","['Wu J', 'Liu H', 'Zhang G', 'Gu L', 'Zhang Y', 'Gao J', 'Wei Y', 'Ma Z']","['Department of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 60041, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 60041, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 60041, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 60041, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 60041, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 60041, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center/Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 60041, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center/Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160823,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '19W019ZDRJ (Ciclopirox)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Ciclopirox', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Ferritins/*metabolism', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Pyridones/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",,,2016/08/24 06:00,2017/07/27 06:00,['2016/08/24 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0161509 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-19113 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Aug 23;11(8):e0161509. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0161509. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0161509 [doi],,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2966-361X'],,,PMC4995032,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the survival effect by T cells is largely governed by the TNFR ligand family member CD40L, the exact mechanism of monocyte-derived cell-induced survival is not known. An important role has been attributed to the TNFR ligand, a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), although the exact mechanism remained unclear. Since we detected that APRIL was expressed by CD68+ cells in CLL LN, we addressed its relevance in various aspects of CLL biology, using a novel APRIL overexpressing co-culture system, recombinant APRIL, and APRIL reporter cells. Unexpectedly, we found, that in these various systems, APRIL had no effect on survival of CLL cells, and activation of NF-kappaB was not enhanced on APRIL stimulation. Moreover, APRIL stity mulation did not affect CLL proliferation, neither as single stimulus nor in combination with known CLL proliferation stimuli. Furthermore, the survival effect conveyed by macrophages to CLL cells was not affected by transmembrane activator and CAML interactor-Fc, an APRIL decoy receptor. We conclude that the direct role ascribed to APRIL in CLL cell survival might be overestimated due to application of supraphysiological levels of recombinant APRIL.","['van Attekum, Mha', 'Terpstra, S', 'Reinen, E', 'Kater, A P', 'Eldering, E']","['van Attekum M', 'Terpstra S', 'Reinen E', 'Kater AP', 'Eldering E']","['Academic Medical Center, Department of Hematology, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Academic Medical Center, Department of Experimental Immunology, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Academic Medical Center, Department of Hematology, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Academic Medical Center, Department of Experimental Immunology, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Academic Medical Center, Department of Hematology, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Academic Medical Center, Department of Experimental Immunology, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Academic Medical Center, Department of Hematology, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Academic Medical Center, Department of Experimental Immunology, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160321,United States,Cell Death Discov,Cell death discovery,101665035,,,,,,2016/08/24 06:00,2016/08/24 06:01,['2016/08/24 06:00'],"['2016/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1038/cddiscovery.2016.20 [doi]'],epublish,Cell Death Discov. 2016 Mar 21;2:16020. doi: 10.1038/cddiscovery.2016.20. eCollection 2016.,10.1038/cddiscovery.2016.20 [doi],,,,,PMC4979474,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we detected the expression of OR51B5 in the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line K562 and in white blood cell samples of clinically diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients by reverse transcription-PCR and immunocytochemical staining. The known OR51B5 ligand isononyl alcohol increased the levels of intracellular Ca(2+) in both AML patient blood cells and K562 cells. With calcium imaging experiments, we characterized in greater detail the OR51B5-mediated signaling pathway. Here, we observed an involvement of adenylate cyclase and the downstream L-type and T-type calcium channels. In addition, the activation of OR51B5 leads to an inhibition of cell proliferation in K562 cells. In western blot experiments, we found that incubation with isononyl alcohol led to a reduction in p38-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) phosphorylation that might be responsible for the decreased cell proliferation. In the present study, we characterized the OR51B5-mediated signaling pathway downstream of the activation with isononyl alcohol, which leads to reduced proliferation and therefore provide a novel pharmacological target for CML and AML, the latter of which remains difficult to treat.","['Manteniotis, S', 'Wojcik, S', 'Gothert, J R', 'Durig, J', 'Duhrsen, U', 'Gisselmann, G', 'Hatt, H']","['Manteniotis S', 'Wojcik S', 'Gothert JR', 'Durig J', 'Duhrsen U', 'Gisselmann G', 'Hatt H']","['Department of Cell Physiology, Ruhr-University Bochum , Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Cell Physiology, Ruhr-University Bochum , Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Essen , Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Essen , Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Essen , Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Cell Physiology, Ruhr-University Bochum , Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Cell Physiology, Ruhr-University Bochum , Bochum, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160509,United States,Cell Death Discov,Cell death discovery,101665035,,,,,,2016/08/24 06:00,2016/08/24 06:01,['2016/08/24 06:00'],"['2015/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1038/cddiscovery.2016.10 [doi]'],epublish,Cell Death Discov. 2016 May 9;2:16010. doi: 10.1038/cddiscovery.2016.10. eCollection 2016.,10.1038/cddiscovery.2016.10 [doi],,,,,PMC4979495,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that the TRAIL-resistant SH-SY5Y phenotype is cFLIP (cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein) dependent and not due to low-level functional TRAIL receptor or caspase expression or an inhibitory equilibrium between functional and decoy TRAIL receptors or B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and BH3-only (Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only) family proteins. NGF sensitization of SH-SY5Y cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis was dependent upon TrkA expression, activation and subsequent sequestration of cFLIP. This reduces cFLIP recruitment to TRAIL-activated death receptors and increases the recruitment of caspase-8, leading to TRAIL-induced, caspase-dependent, type II apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. This effect was temporary, inhibited within 6 h by nuclear factor-kappa binding (NF-kappaB)-mediated increase in myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (Mcl-1) expression, abrogated by transient cFLIP or B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) overexpression and optimized by NF-kappaB and Mcl-1 inhibitors. This novel mechanism adds an important pro-apoptotic immunological dimension to NGF/TrkA interaction that may not only help to explain the association between TrkA expression, better prognosis and spontaneous remission in NB, but also provides a novel potential pro-apoptotic therapeutic use for NGF, TRAIL and inhibitors of NF-kappaB and/or Mcl-1 in favourable and unfavourable NBs that express TrkA and exhibit cFLIP-mediated TRAIL resistance.","['Ruggeri, P', 'Cappabianca, L', 'Farina, A R', 'Gneo, L', 'Mackay, A R']","['Ruggeri P', 'Cappabianca L', 'Farina AR', 'Gneo L', 'Mackay AR']","[""Department of Applied Clinical and Biotechnological Sciences, University of L'Aquila , Via Vetoio, Coppito 2, L'Aquila 67100, Italy."", ""Department of Applied Clinical and Biotechnological Sciences, University of L'Aquila , Via Vetoio, Coppito 2, L'Aquila 67100, Italy."", ""Department of Applied Clinical and Biotechnological Sciences, University of L'Aquila , Via Vetoio, Coppito 2, L'Aquila 67100, Italy."", ""Department of Applied Clinical and Biotechnological Sciences, University of L'Aquila , Via Vetoio, Coppito 2, L'Aquila 67100, Italy."", ""Department of Applied Clinical and Biotechnological Sciences, University of L'Aquila , Via Vetoio, Coppito 2, L'Aquila 67100, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160201,United States,Cell Death Discov,Cell death discovery,101665035,,,,,,2016/08/24 06:00,2016/08/24 06:01,['2016/08/24 06:00'],"['2015/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1038/cddiscovery.2016.4 [doi]'],epublish,Cell Death Discov. 2016 Feb 1;2:16004. doi: 10.1038/cddiscovery.2016.4. eCollection 2016.,10.1038/cddiscovery.2016.4 [doi],,,,,PMC4979468,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study is based on findings in solid cancer tumours, which have shown that polyphenols can sensitize cells to chemotherapy, and induce apoptosis and/or cell-cycle arrest. This could enable a reduction of chemotherapy dose and off-target effects, whilst maintaining treatment efficacy. Quercetin, apigenin, emodin, rhein and cis-stilbene were investigated alone and in combination with etoposide and doxorubicin in two lymphoid and two myeloid leukaemia cells lines. Measurements were made of ATP levels (using CellTiter-Glo assay) as an indication of total cell number, cell cycle progression (using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry) and apoptosis (NucView caspase 3 assay and Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide staining). Effects of combination treatments on caspases 3, 8 and 9 activity were determined using Glo luminescent assays, glutathione levels were measured using the GSH-Glo Glutathione Assay and DNA damage determined by anti-gammaH2AX staining. Doxorubicin and etoposide in combination with polyphenols synergistically reduced ATP levels, induced apoptosis and increased S and/or G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in lymphoid leukaemia cell lines. However, in the myeloid cell lines the effects of the combination treatments varied; doxorubicin had a synergistic or additive effect when combined with quercetin, apigenin, emodin, and cis-stilbene, but had an antagonistic effect when combined with rhein. Combination treatment caused a synergistic downregulation of glutathione levels and increased DNA damage, driving apoptosis via caspase 8 and 9 activation. However, in myeloid cells where antagonistic effects were observed, this was associated with increased glutathione levels and a reduction in DNA damage and apoptosis. This study has demonstrated that doxorubicin and etoposide activity were enhanced by polyphenols in lymphoid leukaemia cells, however, differential responses were seen in myeloid cells with antagonistic responses seen in some combination therapies.","['Mahbub, A A', 'Le Maitre, C L', 'Haywood-Small, S L', 'Cross, N A', 'Jordan-Mahy, N']","['Mahbub AA', 'Le Maitre CL', 'Haywood-Small SL', 'Cross NA', 'Jordan-Mahy N']","['Department of Biosciences and Chemistry, Biomolecular Sciences Research Centre, Sheffield Hallam University , Floor 7, The Owen Building, Howard Street, Sheffield, South Yorkshire S1 1WB, UK.', 'Department of Biosciences and Chemistry, Biomolecular Sciences Research Centre, Sheffield Hallam University , Floor 7, The Owen Building, Howard Street, Sheffield, South Yorkshire S1 1WB, UK.', 'Department of Biosciences and Chemistry, Biomolecular Sciences Research Centre, Sheffield Hallam University , Floor 7, The Owen Building, Howard Street, Sheffield, South Yorkshire S1 1WB, UK.', 'Department of Biosciences and Chemistry, Biomolecular Sciences Research Centre, Sheffield Hallam University , Floor 7, The Owen Building, Howard Street, Sheffield, South Yorkshire S1 1WB, UK.', 'Department of Biosciences and Chemistry, Biomolecular Sciences Research Centre, Sheffield Hallam University , Floor 7, The Owen Building, Howard Street, Sheffield, South Yorkshire S1 1WB, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151123,United States,Cell Death Discov,Cell death discovery,101665035,,,,,,2015/01/01 00:00,2015/01/01 00:01,['2016/08/24 06:00'],"['2015/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1038/cddiscovery.2015.43 [doi]'],epublish,Cell Death Discov. 2015 Nov 23;1:15043. doi: 10.1038/cddiscovery.2015.43. eCollection 2015.,10.1038/cddiscovery.2015.43 [doi],,,,,PMC4979421,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia, these features are mediated by the aberrant Wnt/beta-Catenin pathway. In our study, we established the lectin LecB as inducer of the differentiation of the acute myeloid leukemia cell line THP-1 and used it for the investigation of the involved processes. During differentiation, functional autophagy and low beta-Catenin levels were essential. Corresponding to this, a high beta-Catenin level stabilized proliferation and inhibited autophagy, resulting in low differentiation ability. Initiated by LecB, beta-Catenin was degraded, autophagy became active and differentiation took place within hours. Remarkably, the reduction of beta-Catenin sensitized THP-1 cells to the autophagy-stimulating mTOR inhibitors. As downmodulation of E-Cadherin was sufficient to significantly reduce LecB-mediated differentiation, we propose E-Cadherin as a crucial interaction partner in this signaling pathway. Upon LecB treatment, E-Cadherin colocalized with beta-Catenin and thereby prevented the induction of beta-Catenin target protein expression and proliferation. That way, our study provides for the first time a link between E-Cadherin, the aberrant Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling, autophagy and differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia. Importantly, LecB was a valuable tool to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of acute myeloid leukemia pathogenesis and may help to identify novel therapy approaches.","['Kuhn, K', 'Cott, C', 'Bohler, S', 'Aigal, S', 'Zheng, S', 'Villringer, S', 'Imberty, A', 'Claudinon, J', 'Romer, W']","['Kuhn K', 'Cott C', 'Bohler S', 'Aigal S', 'Zheng S', 'Villringer S', 'Imberty A', 'Claudinon J', 'Romer W']","['Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Schanzlestrabetae 1, 79104 Freiburg, Germany; BIOSS-Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Schanzlestrabetae 18, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Schanzlestrabetae 1, 79104 Freiburg, Germany; BIOSS-Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Schanzlestrabetae 18, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Schanzlestrabetae 1, 79104 Freiburg, Germany; BIOSS-Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Schanzlestrabetae 18, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Schanzlestrabetae 1, 79104 Freiburg, Germany; BIOSS-Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Schanzlestrabetae 18, 79104 Freiburg, Germany; International Max Planck Research School for Molecular and Cellular Biology (IMPRS-MCB), Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stubeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Schanzlestrabetae 1, 79104 Freiburg, Germany; BIOSS-Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Schanzlestrabetae 18, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Schanzlestrabetae 1, 79104 Freiburg, Germany; BIOSS-Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Schanzlestrabetae 18, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Centre de Recherches sur les Macromolecules Vegetales (CERMAV), CNRS and Universite Grenoble Alpes , 601 rue de la chimie, 38000 Grenoble, France.', 'Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Schanzlestrabetae 1, 79104 Freiburg, Germany; BIOSS-Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Schanzlestrabetae 18, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Schanzlestrabetae 1, 79104 Freiburg, Germany; BIOSS-Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Schanzlestrabetae 18, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150921,United States,Cell Death Discov,Cell death discovery,101665035,,,,,,2015/01/01 00:00,2015/01/01 00:01,['2016/08/24 06:00'],"['2015/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/03 00:00 [revised]', '2015/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1038/cddiscovery.2015.31 [doi]'],epublish,Cell Death Discov. 2015 Sep 21;1:15031. doi: 10.1038/cddiscovery.2015.31. eCollection 2015.,10.1038/cddiscovery.2015.31 [doi],,,,,PMC4979480,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have reported the existence of an HSP90- associated high molecular weight network complex (HMWNC) that is composed of HSP90 client proteins BCR-ABL, JAK2, and STAT3 in wild type Bcr-Abl+ leukemic cells. Here we showed that the HSP90-HMWNC is present in leukemia cells from CML patients in blast stage, and in Imatinib (IM)-resistant 32Dp210 (T315I) leukemia cells. We found that the HSP90-HMWNC could be disassembled by depleting JAK2 with either Jak2-specific shRNA or treatment with JAK2 inhibitors (TG101209 or Ruxolitinib) and HSP90 inhibitor (AUY922). Combinational treatment with JAK2 and HSP90 inhibitors diminished the activation of BCR-ABL, JAK2 and its downstream targets. As a result, the IM-resistant 32Dp210 T315I cells underwent apoptosis. When administered in mice bearing 32Dp210 T315I leukemia, combinational therapy using Ruxolitinib and AUY922 prolonged the survival significantly. Thus, a combination of JAK2 and HSP90 inhibitors could be a powerful strategy for the treatment of CML, especially in IM-resistant patients.","['Chakraborty, Sandip N', 'Leng, Xiaohong', 'Perazzona, Bastianella', 'Sun, Xiaoping', 'Lin, Yu-Hsi', 'Arlinghaus, Ralph B']","['Chakraborty SN', 'Leng X', 'Perazzona B', 'Sun X', 'Lin YH', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Genes Cancer,Genes & cancer,101516546,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'CML', 'HSP90', 'JAK2', 'drug-resistance', 'network complex']",2016/08/24 06:00,2016/08/24 06:01,['2016/08/24 06:00'],"['2016/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/genesandcancer.111 [doi]', '111 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Cancer. 2016 May;7(5-6):201-208. doi: 10.18632/genesandcancer.111.,10.18632/genesandcancer.111 [doi],,,,,PMC4979592,,['P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated veliparib incorporation into leukemia induction therapy using a previously described topotecan/carboplatin backbone.Experimental Design: Employing a 3+3 trial design, we administered escalating doses of veliparib combined with topotecan + carboplatin in relapsed or refractory acute leukemias, aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).Results: A total of 99 patients received veliparib 10-100 mg orally twice daily on days 1-8, 1-14, or 1-21 along with continuous infusion topotecan 1.0-1.2 mg/m(2)/d + carboplatin 120-150 mg/m(2)/d on days 3-7. The MTD was veliparib 80 mg twice daily for up to 21 days with topotecan 1.2 mg/m(2)/d + carboplatin 150 mg/m(2)/d. Mucositis was dose limiting and correlated with high veliparib concentrations. The response rate was 33% overall (33/99: 14 CR, 11 CRi, 8 PR) but was 64% (14/22) for patients with antecedent or associated aggressive MPNs or CMML. Leukemias with baseline DNA repair defects, as evidenced by impaired DNA damage-induced FANCD2 monoubiquitination, had improved survival [HR = 0.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.92)]. A single 80-mg dose of veliparib, as well as veliparib in combination with topotecan + carboplatin, induced DNA damage as manifested by histone H2AX phosphorylation in CD34(+) leukemia cells, with greater phosphorylation in cells from responders.Conclusions: The veliparib/topotecan/carboplatin combination warrants further investigation, particularly in patients with aggressive MPNs, CMML, and MPN- or CMML-related acute leukemias.

High-dose trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is the treatment of choice. In patients with documented intolerance to this regimen, the preferred alternative is the combination of primaquine plus clindamycin. Treatment success should be first evaluated after 1 week, and in case of clinical non-response, pulmonary CT scan and bronchoalveolar lavage should be repeated to look for secondary or co-infections. Treatment duration typically is 3 weeks and secondary anti-PCP prophylaxis is indicated in all patients thereafter.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid is recommended as the best specimen as it yields good negative predictive value ( A-II: ). Non-invasive specimens can be suitable alternatives ( B-II: ), acknowledging that PCP cannot be ruled out in case of a negative PCR result ( A-II: ). Detecting beta-d-glucan in serum can contribute to the diagnosis but not the follow-up of PCP ( A-II: ). A negative serum beta-d-glucan result can exclude PCP in a patient at risk ( A-II: ), whereas a positive test result may indicate other fungal infections. Genotyping using multilocus sequence markers can be used to investigate suspected outbreaks ( A-II: ). The routine detection of dihydropteroate synthase mutations in cases of treatment failure is not recommended ( B-II: ) since these mutations do not affect response to high-dose co-trimoxazole.

The mortality rate of P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in these patients is 30%-60%, especially after HSCT. The clinical presentation of PCP in haematology differs from that associated with HIV infection, with the disease being acute and more often severe, having a lower fungal burden and being more frequently linked to treatment with corticosteroids. Most cases occur in patients not receiving adequate prophylaxis. The development of new therapies, including targeted treatments and monoclonal antibodies in various haematological diseases, justifies constant vigilance in order to identify new at-risk populations and give prophylaxis accordingly. The fifth and sixth European Conferences on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL-5 and ECIL-6) aimed to review risk factors for PCP in haematology patients and to establish evidence-based recommendations for PCP diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment.

When overexpressed in various cancer types, the BMI1 protein induces cell growth and promotes tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Curcumin, a major phytochemical in turmeric (Curcuma longa), inhibits the proliferation and survival of many types of cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo, and has been reported to reduce BMI1 expression in breast cancer cells. In this study, effects of curcumin and two analogs (bisdemethoxycurcumin and dimethoxycurcumin) on BMI1 expression were evaluated in DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells. Bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC) is naturally occurring in turmeric, whereas dimethoxycurcumin (DMC) is a synthetic analog of curcumin. All three compounds reduced cell survival, but only the natural compound downregulated BMI1 protein expression; curcumin significantly reduced BMI1 levels more than bisdemethoxycurcumin and dimethoxycurcumin. In addition, curcumin and BDMC inhibit survival of the DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells by inducing apoptosis, whereas DMC inhibits survival by a mechanism other than apoptosis.","['Adeyeni, Temitope A', 'Khatwani, Natasha', 'San, KayKay', 'Ezekiel, Uthayashanker R']","['Adeyeni TA', 'Khatwani N', 'San K', 'Ezekiel UR']","['Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science, Saint Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri Department of Health Science and Informatics, Saint Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science, Saint Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science, Saint Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science, Saint Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri uezekiel@slu.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Physiol Rep,Physiological reports,101607800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Diarylheptanoids)', '0 (PRC1 protein, human)', '0 (dimethoxycurcumin)', '2EFO1BP34R (bis(4-hydroxycinnamoyl)methane)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/*drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Curcumin/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Diarylheptanoids', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*drug effects/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*BMI1', '*colorectal cancer', '*phytochemical']",2016/08/24 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2016/08/24 06:00'],"['2016/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['4/16/e12906 [pii]', '10.14814/phy2.12906 [doi]']",ppublish,Physiol Rep. 2016 Aug;4(16). pii: 4/16/e12906. doi: 10.14814/phy2.12906.,10.14814/phy2.12906 [doi] e12906 [pii],"['(c) 2016 The Authors.

Here, we report that Trib2 knockout (KO) mice manifest macrocytic anemia and increase of T lymphocytes. Although Trib2 deficient RBCs have similar half-life as the control RBCs, Trib2 KO mice are highly vulnerable to oxidant-induced hemolysis. Endogenous Trib2 mRNA is expressed in early hematopoietic progenitors, erythroid precursors, and lymphoid lineages, but not in mature RBCs, myeloid progenitors and granulocytes. Consistently, flow cytometric analysis and in vitro colony forming assay revealed that deletion of Trib2 mainly affected erythroid lineage development, and had no effect on either granulocyte or megakaryocyte lineages in bone marrow. Furthermore, a genetic approach using double knockout of Trib2 and C/ebpalpha genes in mice suggested that Trib2 promotes erythropoiesis independent of C/ebpalpha proteins in vivo. Finally, ectopic expression of human Trib2 in zebrafish embryos resulted in increased expression of erythropoiesis-related genes and of hemoglobin. Taking all data together, our results suggest that Trib2 positively promotes early erythrocyte differentiation and is essential for tolerance to hemolysis.","['Lin, Kou-Ray', 'Yang-Yen, Hsin-Fang', 'Lien, Huang-Wei', 'Liao, Wei-Hao', 'Huang, Chang-Jen', 'Lin, Liang-In', 'Li, Chung-Leung', 'Yen, Jeffrey Jong-Young']","['Lin KR', 'Yang-Yen HF', 'Lien HW', 'Liao WH', 'Huang CJ', 'Lin LI', 'Li CL', 'Yen JJ']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Taiwan Mouse Clinic, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Science and Medical Biotechnology, School of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Genomic Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Taiwan Mouse Clinic, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160823,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (tribbles 2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (TRIB2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Anemia, Macrocytic/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hemolysis', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/metabolism', 'Zebrafish']",,,2016/08/24 06:00,2018/05/03 06:00,['2016/08/24 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['srep31444 [pii]', '10.1038/srep31444 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Aug 23;6:31444. doi: 10.1038/srep31444.,10.1038/srep31444 [doi],,,,,PMC4994003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we confirmed that miR-146b-5p expression is lower in TAL1-positive patient samples than in other T-ALL cases. Furthermore, leukemia T-cells display decreased levels of miR-146b-5p as compared to normal T-cells, thymocytes and other hematopoietic progenitors. MiR-146b-5p silencing enhances the in vitro migration and invasion of T-ALL cells, associated with increased levels of filamentous actin and chemokinesis. In vivo, miR-146b overexpression in a TAL1-positive cell line extends mouse survival in a xenotransplant model of human T-ALL. In contrast, knockdown of miR-146b-5p results in leukemia acceleration and decreased mouse overall survival, paralleled by faster tumor infiltration of the central nervous system. Our results suggest that miR-146b-5p is a functionally relevant microRNA gene in the context of T-ALL, whose negative regulation by TAL1 and possibly other oncogenes contributes to disease progression by modulating leukemia cell motility and disease aggressiveness.","['Correia, Nadia C', 'Fragoso, Rita', 'Carvalho, Tania', 'Enguita, Francisco J', 'Barata, Joao T']","['Correia NC', 'Fragoso R', 'Carvalho T', 'Enguita FJ', 'Barata JT']","['Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160823,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (MIRN146 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/methods']",,,2016/08/24 06:00,2018/05/19 06:00,['2016/08/24 06:00'],"['2016/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['srep31894 [pii]', '10.1038/srep31894 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Aug 23;6:31894. doi: 10.1038/srep31894.,10.1038/srep31894 [doi],,,,,PMC4994040,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Macrophages play many critical roles in the regulation of immunity and the progression of autoimmune diseases. However, little information is available regarding the effects of para-nonylphenol on cellular signaling pathways and the death of these cells in vitro. Here, we show that very high concentrations of para-nonylphenol (50-100 muM) induce apoptosis in U937 human monocyte leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner. METHODS: Cell viability was judged using the trypan blue exclusion method. FACS analysis for DNA fragmentation was conducted, cellular signaling pathways were evaluated using western blot analysis, and caspase activity was measured by using substrates. U937 cells were differentiated by PMA. RESULTS: Treatment with > 50 muM para-nonylphenol induced apoptosis in U937 monocyte cells and MCF- 7 and MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cells. We found cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, DNA fragmentation, and decreased expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL. Caspase 3 and 9 were induced, but caspase 1 and 3-inhibitor treatment suppressed apoptosis. Para-nonylphenol decreased the levels of activated AKT and increased the levels of activated JNK/SAPK at 15 min after treatment. Furthermore, with PMA treatment, U937 cells were differentiated into a macrophage-like phenotype and showed attenuated cell death against para-nonylphenol. CONCLUSION: As this assay system is simple and rapid, it may represent a useful artificial tool to clarify the signaling pathways of apoptotic cell death in human monocytes in vitro.","['Santa, Kazuki', 'Ohsawa, Tomonori', 'Sakimoto, Takehiko']","['Santa K', 'Ohsawa T', 'Sakimoto T']","['Department of Physiological Chemistry and Metabolism, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Tokyo,.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This observational and descriptive study was conducted in a Tertiary Care Center of Dehradun, North India over a period of 1 year. All the diagnosed cases of leukemia and myeloproliferative diseases attending the Oncology Department were included. Patients underwent a detailed ocular examination. The hematological parameters were also recorded including hemoglobin (Hb), total leukocyte count (TLC), and platelet count. RESULTS: The study included 102 patients out of which, there were 66 males (64.7%), and 36 were females (35.3%) with an age range of 5-80 years. A total of forty patients showed ocular manifestations (39.3%). Extraocular manifestations were seen in 10.8% patients while intraocular manifestations were noted in 45.1% patients of acute leukemia and 7.7% patients of chronic leukemia. These ocular manifestations showed a significant association with low Hb (P = 0.000), raised TLC (P = 0.004), and low platelet count (P = 0.000). The most common ocular manifestation was intraretinal hemorrhages followed by roth spots. Among acute myeloid leukemia patients (23.5%), the presence of intraretinal hemorrhages was significantly associated with low Hb (Mann-Whitney U-test = 25.000, P = 0.007). The patients of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (25.4%) showed significant association between intraretinal hemorrhages and low platelet count (Mann-Whitney U-test = 44.000, P = 0.046) and roth spots with low Hb (Mann-Whitney U-test = 11.000, P = 0.000). Ocular manifestations were more commonly seen in acute leukemias as compared to chronic leukemias. CONCLUSION: Ocular examination is recommended in all leukemic patients as ocular manifestations may go unnoticed, most patients being asymptomatic and could be an early sign of worsening of disease.","['Dhasmana, Renu', 'Prakash, Amrita', 'Gupta, Neeti', 'Verma, S K']","['Dhasmana R', 'Prakash A', 'Gupta N', 'Verma SK']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Swami Rama Himalayan University, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Swami Rama Himalayan University, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Swami Rama Himalayan University, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India.', 'Department of Medicine, Swami Rama Himalayan University, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Ann Afr Med,Annals of African medicine,101231417,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/epidemiology', 'Retinal Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/08/24 06:00,2017/03/08 06:00,['2016/08/24 06:00'],"['2016/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['AnnAfrMed_2016_15_3_97_188887 [pii]', '10.4103/1596-3519.188887 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Afr Med. 2016 Jul-Sep;15(3):97-103. doi: 10.4103/1596-3519.188887.,10.4103/1596-3519.188887 [doi],,,,,PMC5402809,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The highly polymorphic MHC class I chain-related gene A, MICA, encodes a stress-induced glycoprotein expressed primarily on epithelia. MICA interacts with the invariant activating receptor NKG2D, expressed by cytotoxic lymphocytes, and is located in the MHC, next to HLA-B Hence, MICA has the requisite attributes of a bona fide transplantation antigen. Using high-resolution sequence-based genotyping of MICA, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical effect of MICA mismatches in a multicenter cohort of 922 unrelated donor HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DQB1 10/10 allele-matched HCT pairs. Among the 922 pairs, 113 (12.3%) were mismatched in MICA MICA mismatches were significantly associated with an increased incidence of grade III-IV acute GVHD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-2.23; P < .001), chronic GVHD (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.45-1.55; P < .001), and nonelapse mortality (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.24-1.46; P < .001). The increased risk for GVHD was mirrored by a lower risk for relapse (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.43-0.59; P < .001), indicating a possible graft-versus-leukemia effect. In conclusion, when possible, selecting a MICA-matched donor significantly influences key clinical outcomes of HCT in which a marked reduction of GVHD is paramount. The tight linkage disequilibrium between MICA and HLA-B renders identifying a MICA-matched donor readily feasible in clinical practice.","['Carapito, Raphael', 'Jung, Nicolas', 'Kwemou, Marius', 'Untrau, Meiggie', 'Michel, Sandra', 'Pichot, Angelique', 'Giacometti, Gaelle', 'Macquin, Cecile', 'Ilias, Wassila', 'Morlon, Aurore', 'Kotova, Irina', 'Apostolova, Petya', 'Schmitt-Graeff, Annette', 'Cesbron, Anne', 'Gagne, Katia', 'Oudshoorn, Machteld', 'van der Holt, Bronno', 'Labalette, Myriam', 'Spierings, Eric', 'Picard, Christophe', 'Loiseau, Pascale', 'Tamouza, Ryad', 'Toubert, Antoine', 'Parissiadis, Anne', 'Dubois, Valerie', 'Lafarge, Xavier', 'Maumy-Bertrand, Myriam', 'Bertrand, Frederic', 'Vago, Luca', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Paillard, Catherine', 'Querol, Sergi', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Fleischhauer, Katharina', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Inoko, Hidetoshi', 'von dem Borne, Peter A', 'Kuball, Jurgen', 'Ota, Masao', 'Katsuyama, Yoshihiko', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Lioure, Bruno', 'Peffault de Latour, Regis', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Claas, Frans', 'Moreau, Philippe', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Charron, Dominique', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Zeiser, Robert', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Bahram, Seiamak']","['Carapito R', 'Jung N', 'Kwemou M', 'Untrau M', 'Michel S', 'Pichot A', 'Giacometti G', 'Macquin C', 'Ilias W', 'Morlon A', 'Kotova I', 'Apostolova P', 'Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Cesbron A', 'Gagne K', 'Oudshoorn M', 'van der Holt B', 'Labalette M', 'Spierings E', 'Picard C', 'Loiseau P', 'Tamouza R', 'Toubert A', 'Parissiadis A', 'Dubois V', 'Lafarge X', 'Maumy-Bertrand M', 'Bertrand F', 'Vago L', 'Ciceri F', 'Paillard C', 'Querol S', 'Sierra J', 'Fleischhauer K', 'Nagler A', 'Labopin M', 'Inoko H', 'von dem Borne PA', 'Kuball J', 'Ota M', 'Katsuyama Y', 'Michallet M', 'Lioure B', 'Peffault de Latour R', 'Blaise D', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Claas F', 'Moreau P', 'Milpied N', 'Charron D', 'Mohty M', 'Zeiser R', 'Socie G', 'Bahram S']","[""Laboratoire d'ImmunoRhumatologie Moleculaire, INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR)_S1109, Plateforme GENOMAX, Faculte de Medecine, Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire OMICARE, Federation de Medecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg, and LabEx TRANSPLANTEX, Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France;

The FV Gag N-terminal region is responsible for capsid formation and particle budding via interaction with Env. However, the critical residues or motifs in this region and their functional interaction are currently ill-defined, especially in non-primate FVs. RESULTS: Mutagenesis of N-terminal Gag residues of feline FV (FFV) reveals key residues essential for either capsid assembly and/or viral budding via interaction with the FFV Env leader protein (Elp). In an in vitro Gag-Elp interaction screen, Gag mutations abolishing particle assembly also interfered with Elp binding, indicating that Gag assembly is a prerequisite for this highly specific interaction. Gradient sedimentation analyses of cytosolic proteins indicate that wild-type Gag is mostly assembled into virus capsids. Moreover, proteolytic processing of Gag correlates with capsid assembly and is mostly, if not completely, independent from particle budding. In addition, Gag processing correlates with the presence of packaging-competent FFV genomic RNA suggesting that Pol encapsidation via genomic RNA is a prerequisite for Gag processing. Though an appended heterogeneous myristoylation signal rescues Gag particle budding of mutants unable to form capsids or defective in interacting with Elp, it fails to generate infectious particles that co-package Pol, as evidenced by a lack of Gag processing. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in proteolytic Gag processing, intracellular capsid assembly, particle budding and infectivity of defined N-terminal Gag mutants highlight their essential, distinct and only partially overlapping roles during viral assembly and budding. Discussion of these findings will be based on a recent model developed for Gag-Elp interactions in prototype FV.","['Liu, Yang', 'Betts, Matthew J', 'Lei, Janet', 'Wei, Guochao', 'Bao, Qiuying', 'Kehl, Timo', 'Russell, Robert B', 'Lochelt, Martin']","['Liu Y', 'Betts MJ', 'Lei J', 'Wei G', 'Bao Q', 'Kehl T', 'Russell RB', 'Lochelt M']","['Department of Molecular Diagnostics of Oncogenic Infections, Research Program Infection and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 242, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA.', 'CellNetworks, Bioquant, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 267, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Diagnostics of Oncogenic Infections, Research Program Infection and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 242, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Diagnostics of Oncogenic Infections, Research Program Infection and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 242, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Diagnostics of Oncogenic Infections, Research Program Infection and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 242, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Biology Department, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Molecular Diagnostics of Oncogenic Infections, Research Program Infection and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 242, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'CellNetworks, Bioquant, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 267, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Biochemie Zentrum Heidelberg (BZH), Im Neuenheimer Feld 328, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Diagnostics of Oncogenic Infections, Research Program Infection and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 242, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany. m.loechelt@dkfz.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160822,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Capsid/*metabolism', 'Capsid Proteins/metabolism', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', '*Mutagenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Spumavirus/*genetics/ultrastructure', '*Virus Assembly', '*Virus Release']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Assembly', '*Capsid formation', '*Feline foamy virus', '*Foamy virus', '*Gag', '*Genome packaging', '*Mutagenesis', '*Particle budding and maturation', '*Transmission']",2016/08/24 06:00,2017/05/11 06:00,['2016/08/24 06:00'],"['2016/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-016-0291-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-016-0291-8 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2016 Aug 22;13(1):57. doi: 10.1186/s12977-016-0291-8.,10.1186/s12977-016-0291-8 [doi],,,,,PMC4994201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Correlation coefficients between SUA and serum creatinine (SCr) and kinetic estimated GFR (KeGFR) were retrospectively investigated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, and statistically significant and clinically relevant determinants were studied in multiple regression models. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-six patients were included in the analysis. Baseline SUA was associated with an increased risk for acute kidney injury (AKI; OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.1-1.5, p = 0.003) and laboratory tumor lysis syndrome (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.1-1.5, p = 0.005). Prophylactic uric acid-lowering therapy and hydration resulted in lower SUA values from baseline in 88.1% of the patients, the lowest values were observed on post-induction day 1 (20.4% reduction). Significant linear correlations were observed between SUA and SCr (r = 0.35, p < 0.001) values with a significant inverse correlation between SUA and KeGFR on day 1 (r = -0.33, p < 0.001) that persisted through day 4. By subgroup analysis, patients with primary AML (r = -0.49, p < 0.001), baseline SUA >5.5 mg/dl (r = -0.41, p = 0.002) and baseline eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (r = -0.51, p < 0.001) demonstrated robust relationships between SUA and KeGFR. The relationship was more robust when the groups were combined (primary AML plus baseline SUA >5.5 mg/dl plus baseline eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m2, r = -0.52, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The demonstration of linear relationship between SUA and SCr and inverse relationship between SUA and KeGFR reinforces the emerging translational physiological evidence regarding the role of uric acid in AKI.","['Koratala, Abhilash', 'Singhania, Girish', 'Alquadan, Kawther F', 'Shimada, Michiko', 'Johnson, Richard J', 'Ejaz, A Ahsan']","['Koratala A', 'Singhania G', 'Alquadan KF', 'Shimada M', 'Johnson RJ', 'Ejaz AA']","['Division of Nephrology, Hypertension and Transplantation, University of Florida, Gainesville, Fla., USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160823,Switzerland,Nephron,Nephron,0331777,"['268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/blood/etiology/physiopathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Female', '*Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Humans', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/complications/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/blood/etiology/physiopathology', 'Uric Acid/*blood']",,,2016/08/23 06:00,2017/03/10 06:00,['2016/08/23 06:00'],"['2016/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['000448629 [pii]', '10.1159/000448629 [doi]']",ppublish,Nephron. 2016;134(4):231-237. doi: 10.1159/000448629.

There are now four newer TKIs, three so-called second-generation inhibitors and one third generation inhibitor, all of which are more potent than imatinib in in vitro assays. Areas covered: This paper reviews the current knowledge on the function of BCR-ABL. Furthermore, this paper highlights the impact of this knowledge on the development of a targeted therapy approach in Ph(+) ALL and the obstacles for the successful treatment with these drugs. Expert opinion: Identifying key components involved in disease pathogenesis may lead to new approaches that might overcome resistance mediated to the BCR-ABL TKIs. In a near future, the authors believe that monoclonal antibodies and immunotherapy should also be combined with TKIs and up-front chemotherapy for the successful treatment of ALL.","['Thomas, Xavier', 'Heiblig, Mael']","['Thomas X', 'Heiblig M']","['a Hematology Department , Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon-Sud Hospital , Pierre Benite , France.', 'a Hematology Department , Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon-Sud Hospital , Pierre Benite , France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160831,England,Expert Opin Drug Discov,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Philadelphia chromosome', '*chemotherapy', '*resistance', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2016/08/23 06:00,2017/05/30 06:00,['2016/08/23 06:00'],"['2016/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17460441.2016.1227318 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2016 Nov;11(11):1061-1070. doi: 10.1080/17460441.2016.1227318.

CD123, or interleukin 3 receptor alpha, is overexpressed on most AML and some lymphoid malignancies, such as acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and has been an effective target for T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). The prototypical CAR encodes a VH and VL from one monoclonal antibody (mAb), coupled to a transmembrane domain and one or more cytoplasmic signaling domains. Previous studies showed that treatment of an experimental AML model with CD123-specific CAR T cells was therapeutic, but at the cost of impaired myelopoiesis, highlighting the need for systems to define the antigen threshold for CAR recognition. Here, we show that CARs can be engineered using VH and VL chains derived from different CD123-specific mAbs to generate a panel of CAR+ T cells. While all CARs exhibited specificity to CD123, one VH and VL combination had reduced lysis of normal hematopoietic stem cells. This CAR's in vivo anti-tumor activity was similar whether signaling occurred via chimeric CD28 or CD137, prolonging survival in both AML and ALL models. Co-expression of inducible caspase 9 eliminated CAR+ T cells. These data help support the use of CD123-specific CARs for treatment of CD123+ hematologic malignancies.","['Thokala, Radhika', 'Olivares, Simon', 'Mi, Tiejuan', 'Maiti, Sourindra', 'Deniger, Drew', 'Huls, Helen', 'Torikai, Hiroki', 'Singh, Harjeet', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Laskowski, Tamara', 'McNamara, George', 'Cooper, Laurence J N']","['Thokala R', 'Olivares S', 'Mi T', 'Maiti S', 'Deniger D', 'Huls H', 'Torikai H', 'Singh H', 'Champlin RE', 'Laskowski T', 'McNamara G', 'Cooper LJ']","['Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'The University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Surgery Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Intrexon Corporation, Germantown, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Ziopharm Oncology Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160822,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Single-Domain Antibodies)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'CD28 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Caspase 9/genetics/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Engineering/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Plasmids', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Single-Domain Antibodies/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/*transplantation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9/genetics/immunology']",,,2016/08/23 06:00,2017/07/28 06:00,['2016/08/23 06:00'],"['2016/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0159477 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-14339 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Aug 22;11(8):e0159477. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0159477. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0159477 [doi],,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4279-4115'],,,PMC4993583,"['The technology described in this presentation was licensed by MD Anderson for', 'commercial application to Ziopharm Oncology, Inc., and Intrexon Corporation, in', 'exchange for equity interests in each of these companies.

Identification of p53-reactivating small molecules such as PRIMA-1 holds promise for effective new anticancer therapies. Here, we investigated the effects of small molecule PRIMA-1 on cell viability and expression of p53-regulated genes and proteins in the acute promyelocytic leukemia-derived NB4 cell line. Our results showed that PRIMA-1 had antileukemic properties in acute promyelocytic leukemia-derived NB4 cells. PRIMA-1-triggered apoptosis in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner as indicated by the MTT assay and annexin-V staining. Apoptosis induction by PRIMA-1 was associated with caspase-9, caspase-7 activation and PARP cleavage. p21 protein expression was increased after PRIMA-1 treatment and real-time PCR analysis of proapoptotic p53 target genes indicated upregulation of Bax and Noxa. Western blot analysis showed that IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and its degradation were inhibited by PRIMA-1. Moreover, protein expression of nuclear factor-kappaB-regulated antiapoptotic (Bcl-2 and XIAP) and proliferative (c-Myc) gene products was decreased. Importantly, PRIMA-1 did not show any significant apoptotic effect in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

Although considerable advances have been made in platelet transfusion therapy since the mid-1970s, some areas continue to provoke debate especially concerning the use of prophylactic platelet transfusions for the prevention of thrombocytopenic bleeding. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether agents that can be used as alternatives, or adjuncts, to platelet transfusions for people with haematological malignancies undergoing intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation are safe and effective at preventing bleeding. SEARCH METHODS: We searched 11 bibliographic databases and four ongoing trials databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE (OvidSP, 1946 to 19 May 2016), Embase (OvidSP, 1974 to 19 May 2016), PubMed (e-publications only: searched 19 May 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP and the ISRCTN Register (searched 19 May 2016). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials in people with haematological malignancies undergoing intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation who were allocated to either an alternative to platelet transfusion (artificial platelet substitutes, platelet-poor plasma, fibrinogen concentrate, recombinant activated factor VII, desmopressin (DDAVP), or thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics) or a comparator (placebo, standard care or platelet transfusion). We excluded studies of antifibrinolytic drugs, as they were the focus of another review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors screened all electronically derived citations and abstracts of papers identified by the review search strategy. Two review authors assessed risk of bias in the included studies and extracted data independently. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 16 eligible trials. Four trials are ongoing and two have been completed but the results have not yet been published (trial completion dates: April 2012 to February 2017). Therefore, the review included 10 trials in eight references with 554 participants. Six trials (336 participants) only included participants with acute myeloid leukaemia undergoing intensive chemotherapy, two trials (38 participants) included participants with lymphoma undergoing intensive chemotherapy and two trials (180 participants) reported participants undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Men and women were equally well represented in the trials. The age range of participants included in the trials was from 16 years to 81 years. All trials took place in high-income countries. The manufacturers of the agent sponsored eight trials that were under investigation, and two trials did not report their source of funding.No trials assessed artificial platelet substitutes, fibrinogen concentrate, recombinant activated factor VII or desmopressin.Nine trials compared a TPO mimetic to placebo or standard care; seven of these used pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and differentiation factor (PEG-rHuMGDF) and two used recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO).One trial compared platelet-poor plasma to platelet transfusion.We considered that all the trials included in this review were at high risk of bias and meta-analysis was not possible in seven trials due to problems with the way data were reported.We are very uncertain whether TPO mimetics reduce the number of participants with any bleeding episode (odds ratio (OR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 1.62, one trial, 120 participants, very low quality evidence). We are very uncertain whether TPO mimetics reduce the risk of a life-threatening bleed after 30 days (OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.06 to 33.14, three trials, 209 participants, very low quality evidence); or after 90 days (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 16.37, one trial, 120 participants, very low quality evidence). We are very uncertain whether TPO mimetics reduce platelet transfusion requirements after 30 days (mean difference -3.00 units, 95% CI -5.39 to -0.61, one trial, 120 participants, very low quality evidence). No deaths occurred in either group after 30 days (one trial, 120 participants, very low quality evidence). We are very uncertain whether TPO mimetics reduce all-cause mortality at 90 days (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.24 to 4.20, one trial, 120 participants, very low quality evidence). No thromboembolic events occurred for participants treated with TPO mimetics or control at 30 days (two trials, 209 participants, very low quality evidence). We found no trials that looked at: number of days on which bleeding occurred, time from randomisation to first bleed or quality of life.One trial with 18 participants compared platelet-poor plasma transfusion with platelet transfusion. We are very uncertain whether platelet-poor plasma reduces the number of participants with any bleeding episode (OR 16.00, 95% CI 1.32 to 194.62, one trial, 18 participants, very low quality evidence). We are very uncertain whether platelet-poor plasma reduces the number of participants with severe or life-threatening bleeding (OR 4.00, 95% CI 0.56 to 28.40, one trial, 18 participants, very low quality evidence). We found no trials that looked at: number of days on which bleeding occurred, time from randomisation to first bleed, number of platelet transfusions, all-cause mortality, thromboembolic events or quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to determine if platelet-poor plasma or TPO mimetics reduce bleeding for participants with haematological malignancies undergoing intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. To detect a decrease in the proportion of participants with clinically significant bleeding from 12 in 100 to 6 in 100 would require a trial containing at least 708 participants (80% power, 5% significance). The six ongoing trials will provide additional information about the TPO mimetic comparison (424 participants) but this will still be underpowered to demonstrate this level of reduction in bleeding. None of the included or ongoing trials include children. There are no completed or ongoing trials assessing artificial platelet substitutes, fibrinogen concentrate, recombinant activated factor VII or desmopressin in people undergoing intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation for haematological malignancies.","['Desborough, Michael', 'Estcourt, Lise J', 'Doree, Carolyn', 'Trivella, Marialena', 'Hopewell, Sally', 'Stanworth, Simon J', 'Murphy, Michael F']","['Desborough M', 'Estcourt LJ', 'Doree C', 'Trivella M', 'Hopewell S', 'Stanworth SJ', 'Murphy MF']","['Haematology/Transfusion Medicine, NHS Blood and Transplant, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20160822,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (polyethylene glycol-recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development', 'factor)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Hemorrhage/etiology/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Plasma', '*Platelet Transfusion/statistics & numerical data', 'Polyethylene Glycols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/*therapy', 'Thrombopoietin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",,,2016/08/23 06:00,2016/10/21 06:00,['2016/08/23 06:00'],"['2016/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD010982.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2016 Aug 22;(8):CD010982. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD010982.pub2.,10.1002/14651858.CD010982.pub2 [doi],,,,,PMC5019360,"['Declarations of Interest MD: none declared.

However, ingenol mebutate undergoes acyl migration which affects its bioactivity. Compound 3-O-angeloyl-20-O-acetyl ingenol (AAI, also known as 20-O-acetyl-ingenol-3-angelate or PEP008) is a synthetic derivative of ingenol mebutate. In this work, we report the AAI synthesis details and demonstrate AAI has higher cytotoxicity than ingenol mebutate in a chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cell line. Our data indicate that the increased activity of AAI originates from the improved intracellular stability of AAI rather than the increased binding affinity between AAI and the target protein protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta). AAI inhibits cell proliferation, induces G2/M phase arrest, disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential, and stimulates apoptosis, as well as necrosis in K562 cells. Similar to ingenol mebutate, AAI activates PKCdelta and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), and inactivates protein kinase B (AKT). Furthermore, AAI also inhibits JAK/STAT3 pathway.

For both HSCs and LSCs, specific gene expression programs endowed by their epigenome functionally distinguish them from their differentiated progenies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), as a class of small non-coding RNAs, act to control post-transcriptional gene expression. Research in the past decade has yielded exciting findings elucidating the roles of miRNAs in control of multiple facets of HSC and LSC biology. Here we review recent progresses on the functions of miRNAs in HSC emergence during development, HSC switch from a fetal/neonatal program to an adult program, HSC self-renewal and quiescence, HSC aging, HSC niche, and malignant stem cells. While multiple different miRNAs regulate a diverse array of targets, two common themes emerge in HSC and LSC biology: miRNA mediated regulation of epigenetic machinery and cell signaling pathways. In addition, we propose that miRNAs themselves behave like epigenetic regulators, as they possess key biochemical and biological properties that can provide both stability and alterability to the epigenetic program. Overall, the studies of miRNAs in stem cells in the hematologic contexts not only provide key understandings to post-transcriptional gene regulation mechanisms in HSCs and LSCs, but also will lend key insights for other stem cell fields.","['Roden, Christine', 'Lu, Jun']","['Roden C', 'Lu J']","['Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510, USA; Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, Connecticut, 06520, USA; Graduate Program in Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06510, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510, USA; Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, Connecticut, 06520, USA; Yale Center for RNA Science and Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, 06520, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160701,Switzerland,Curr Stem Cell Rep,Current stem cell reports,101650643,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['epigenetic machinery', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'leukemia stem cells', 'miRNAs']",2016/08/23 06:00,2016/08/23 06:01,['2016/08/23 06:00'],"['2016/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40778-016-0057-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Stem Cell Rep. 2016 Sep;2(3):183-196. doi: 10.1007/s40778-016-0057-1.

A Report from the Children's Oncology Group.,139,"Regression analysis is commonly used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to test genotype-phenotype associations but restricts the phenotype to a single observation for each individual. There is an increasing need for analytic methods for longitudinally collected phenotype data. Several methods have been proposed to perform longitudinal GWAS for family-based studies but few methods are described for unrelated populations. We compared the performance of three statistical approaches for longitudinal GWAS in unrelated subjectes: (1) principal component-based generalized estimating equations (PC-GEE); (2) principal component-based linear mixed effects model (PC-LMEM); (3) kinship coefficient matrix-based linear mixed effects model (KIN-LMEM), in a study of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the duration of 4 courses of chemotherapy in 624 unrelated children with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) genotyped on the Illumina 2.5 M OmniQuad from the COG studies AAML0531 and AAML1031. In this study we observed an exaggerated type I error with PC-GEE in SNPs with minor allele frequencies < 0.05, wheras KIN-LMEM produces more than expected type II errors. PC-MEM showed balanced type I and type II errors for the observed vs. expected P-values in comparison to competing approaches. In general, a strong concordance was observed between the P-values with the different approaches, in particular among P < 0.01 where the between-method AUCs exceed 99%. PC-LMEM accounts for genetic relatedness and correlations among repeated phenotype measures, shows minimal genome-wide inflation of type I errors, and yields high power. We therefore recommend PC-LMEM as a robust analytic approach for GWAS of longitudinal data in unrelated populations.","['Vujkovic, Marijana', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Li, Yimei']","['Vujkovic M', 'Aplenc R', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gamis AS', 'Li Y']","[""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Division of Hematology, Oncology Bone Marrow Transplantation, Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics Kansas City, MO, USA."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Philadelphia, PA, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160805,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['generalized estimating equations', 'genome wide association analysis', 'linear mixed effects model', 'longitudinal analysis', 'unrelated population']",2016/08/23 06:00,2016/08/23 06:01,['2016/08/23 06:00'],"['2016/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2016.00139 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2016 Aug 5;7:139. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2016.00139. eCollection 2016.,10.3389/fgene.2016.00139 [doi],,,,,PMC4974249,,"['F30 CA192831/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most commonly used drug for the treatment of ALL is methotrexate (MTX), an anti-folate agent. Previous studies suggest that folate transporters play a role in ALL prognosis and that genetic polymorphism of genes encoding folate transporters may increase the risk of ALL. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to determine the associations among six genetic polymorphisms in four genes related with the folate transporter pathway to determine a relationship with the occurrence of ALL in Mexican children. A case-control study was performed in 73 ALL children and 133 healthy children from Northern and Northwestern Mexico. COL18A1 (rs2274808), SLC19A1 (rs2838956), ABCB1 (rs1045642 and rs1128503), and ABCC5 (rs9838667 and rs3792585). Polymorphisms were assayed through qPCR. Our results showed an increased ALL risk in children carrying CT genotype (OR = 2.55, CI 95% 1.11-5.83, p = 0.0001) and TT genotype (OR = 21.05, CI 95% 5.62-78.87, p < 0.0001) of COL18A1 rs2274808; in SLC19A1 rs2838956 AG carriers (OR = 44.69, CI 95% 10.42-191.63, p = 0.0001); in ABCB1 rs1045642 TT carriers (OR = 13.76, CI 95% 5.94-31.88, p = 0.0001); in ABCC5 rs9838667 AC carriers (OR = 2.61, CI 95% 1.05-6.48, p < 0.05); and in ABCC5 rs3792585 CC carriers (OR = 9.99, CI 95% 3.19-31.28, p = 0.004).

Immunophenotyping is used for this purpose, and various guidelines have been proposed regarding a minimal screening antibody panel. Most of them have been found inefficient. METHODS: Eighty-two cases of consecutive acute leukemias reporting to this hospital over a period of two years were included in the study. Peripheral blood smear, bone marrow aspirate, and bone marrow biopsy were studied using morphology, cytochemical stains, and relevant immunohistochemical stains on selected biopsy specimens. Flowcytometry analysis was carried out using Indian consensus screening panel and our proposed minimal screening panel (PMSP) for comparison. RESULT: Immunophenotyping using PMSP resulted in 95.12% accurate diagnosis versus Indian consensus minimal screening panel (ICMSP) with an accuracy of 92.68%. This result was statistically significant as per Chi Square tests. CONCLUSION: PMSP can be used as a substitute for ICMSP, since it includes lineage-specific cytoplasmic antibodies, as well as lesser number of monoclonal antibodies, and enables us to diagnose mixed lineage leukemia. Fewer markers can be linked to a lower cost as well, which is relevant in a developing economy.","['Gupta, Srishti', 'Chatterjee, Tathagata', 'Sharma, Sanjeevan', 'Sharma, Ajay', 'Ganguly, Prosenjit', 'Singh, Jasjit', 'Das, Satyaranjan']","['Gupta S', 'Chatterjee T', 'Sharma S', 'Sharma A', 'Ganguly P', 'Singh J', 'Das S']","['Resident (Pathology), Army Hospital (R&R), New Delhi 110010, India.', 'Commandant, 166 Military Hospital, C/o 56 APO, India.', 'Senior Adviser (Med & Hematology), Command Hospital (Southern Command), Pune 411040, India.', 'Consultant & Head (Hematology), Army Hospital (R&R), New Delhi 110010, India.', 'Senior Adviser (Pathology), Command Hospital (Eastern Command), Kolkata, India.', 'Senior Adviser (Med & Hematology), Army Hospital (R&R), New Delhi 110010, India.', 'Senior Adviser (Paediatrics & Hematology), INHS Asvini, Colaba, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160329,India,Med J Armed Forces India,"Medical journal, Armed Forces India",7602492,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemias', 'Flowcytometry', 'Indian Consensus screening panel', 'MPAL', 'Proposed minimal screening panel']",2016/08/23 06:00,2016/08/23 06:01,['2016/08/23 06:00'],"['2015/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.mjafi.2016.01.002 [doi]', 'S0377-1237(16)00003-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Med J Armed Forces India. 2016 Jul;72(3):220-30. doi: 10.1016/j.mjafi.2016.01.002.

Different studies based on big hospital series have manifested a higher risk in subjects with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis to progress to a chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The behavior of this hematologic entity is unknown therefore its frequency in sporadic chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient relatives was determined. METHODS: Transversal descriptive study, 8 color flow cytometry was performed using two of the tubes of the Euro Flow recommended panel, with modifications, for the diagnose of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders of B lymphocytes; besides, a fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed. univariate and bivariate analyses of the information were performed. RESULTS: Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis frequency found in 51 analyzed relatives was 2%, it was a female participant, 59 years old, with a total leukocyte count of 7.7x10(9)/L and a B lymphocyte count of 0.124x10(9)/L; from these, 0.04x10(9)/L were clonal cells with restrictions of the kappa light chain. Rearrangements of the IGH gene (14q32) were found. CONCLUSION: Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis was detected in one relative of a patient with sporadic chronic lymphocytic leukemia in a frequency similar to the one reported in general population.","['Villegas Gracia, Rossana', 'Franco Alzate, Catalina', 'Rendon Henao, Javier', 'Torres Hernandez, Jose Domingo', 'Jaramillo Arbelaez, Patricia Elena']","['Villegas Gracia R', 'Franco Alzate C', 'Rendon Henao J', 'Torres Hernandez JD', 'Jaramillo Arbelaez PE']","['Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud.

Analysis of data of a 33-year period].",1357-60,"INTRODUCTION: In their previous work, the authors reported findings from 30 years on the incidence of hematological malignancies in Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county, Hungary. Until now there are no other studies on this topic available in Hungary. AIM: Detailed analysis of epidemiologic features of patients with myeloma. METHOD: During a 33-year period (between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 2015) 4521 adult patients with hematologic malignancies were recorded in the leukaemia/lymphoma registry of Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county. Among them 440 patients with myeloma (9.73%) were registered (397 multiple myeloma, 38 solitary, bone/soft tissue plasmocytoma, 5 primary plasma cell leukaemia). RESULTS: The incidence of myeloma in Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county showed an increasing tendency, with an overall incidence rate of 2.33/100 000 inhabitants/year. The male:female ratio was 45.9%:54.1%, the average age of patients was 65.1 (28-90) years, and 59.4% of the patients with multiple myeloma had IgG-type monoclonal immunoglobulin. There was no town or village in this county where the occurrence of patients with myeloma in one thousand inhabitants was significantly higher, than the average (0.78). CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiologic features of myeloma in Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county - except a moderate female dominance - is essentially similar to data published in the literature. Orv.

Cells were treated with PhoA concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 100.0mug/mL, and the results show that this molecule did not exhibit cytotoxicity, genotoxicity or mutagenicity in lymphocytes at any tested concentration. Furthermore, PhoA was highly cytotoxic, genotoxic and mutagenic to HL60 cells, establishing a differential response of this natural product in normal and cancer cells. PhoA was highly selective towards HL60 compared to lymphocytes, causing no damage in the latter cell line, suggesting that this compound could be a promising compound in antitumoral drug development.","['Pavao, Gabriel Brolio', 'Venancio, Vinicius Paula', 'de Oliveira, Ana Ligia Leandrini', 'Hernandes, Livia Cristina', 'Almeida, Mara Ribeiro', 'Antunes, Lusania Maria Greggi', 'Debonsi, Hosana Maria']","['Pavao GB', 'Venancio VP', 'de Oliveira AL', 'Hernandes LC', 'Almeida MR', 'Antunes LM', 'Debonsi HM']","['Department of Physics and Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Science, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Physics and Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Science, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Science, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Science, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Physics and Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.

Recent studies, utilizing next-generation sequencing (NGS), observed haematopoietic clones in 10% of 70-year olds and rarely in younger individuals. However, these studies could only detect common haematopoietic clones->0.02 variant allele fraction (VAF)-due to the error rate of NGS. To identify and characterize clonal mutations below this threshold, here we develop methods for targeted error-corrected sequencing, which enable the accurate detection of clonal mutations as rare as 0.0003 VAF. We apply these methods to study serially banked peripheral blood samples from healthy 50-60-year-old participants in the Nurses' Health Study. We observe clonal haematopoiesis, frequently harbouring mutations in DNMT3A and TET2, in 95% of individuals studied. These clonal mutations are often stable longitudinally and present in multiple haematopoietic compartments, suggesting a long-lived haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell of origin.","['Young, Andrew L', 'Challen, Grant A', 'Birmann, Brenda M', 'Druley, Todd E']","['Young AL', 'Challen GA', 'Birmann BM', 'Druley TE']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri 63108, USA.', 'Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri 63108, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri 63108, USA.', ""Department of Medicine, Channing Division of Network Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri 63108, USA.', 'Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri 63108, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160822,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', '*Genetic Variation', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics']",,,2016/08/23 06:00,2018/09/25 06:00,['2016/08/23 06:00'],"['2016/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms12484 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms12484 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2016 Aug 22;7:12484. doi: 10.1038/ncomms12484.,10.1038/ncomms12484 [doi],,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3245-7561'],,,PMC4996934,,"['R01 CA049449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149445/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK102428/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1 CA186107/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the risk of secondary malignancies has increased, thought to be due to a combination of environmental and disease-related factors, as well as treatment. In the present review, we evaluate the risk of secondary malignancies in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), multiple myeloma (MM) and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM). Patients with MGUS appear to have a higher risk of developing myeloid malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In patients with MM, the risk of AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and some solid tumors appears increased. Finally, in WM patients, there seems to be increased risk of AML, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, thyroid cancer and melanoma.","['Castillo, Jorge J', 'Gertz, Morie A']","['Castillo JJ', 'Gertz MA']","['a Bing Center for Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA , USA.', 'b Division of Hematology , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",20160822,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Humans', 'Incidence', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*epidemiology/therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['*MGUS', '*Myeloma', '*Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia', '*secondary malignancies']",2016/08/23 06:00,2017/12/23 06:00,['2016/08/23 06:00'],"['2016/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2016.1217527 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2017 Apr;58(4):773-780. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2016.1217527.

In this paper, we will review the differences in pharmacokinetics and toxicities, when asparaginase is administered intravenously versus intramuscularly in pediatric patients with ALL.

Health-promoting behaviour, such as consuming a healthy diet, could lessen the impact of these chronic issues, yet the prevalence rate of health-protecting behaviour amongst survivors of childhood cancer is similar to that of the general population. Targeted nutritional interventions may prevent or reduce the incidence of these chronic diseases. OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this review was to assess the efficacy of a range of nutritional interventions designed to improve the nutritional intake of childhood cancer survivors, as compared to a control group of childhood cancer survivors who did not receive the intervention. Secondary objectives were to assess metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, measures of weight and body fat distribution, behavioural change, changes in knowledge regarding disease risk and nutritional intake, participants' views of the intervention, measures of health status and quality of life, measures of harm associated with the process or outcomes of the intervention, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention SEARCH METHODS: We searched the electronic databases of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2013, Issue 3), MEDLINE/PubMed (from 1945 to April 2013), and Embase/Ovid (from 1980 to April 2013). We ran the search again in August 2015; we have not yet fully assessed these results, but we have identified one ongoing trial. We conducted additional searching of ongoing trial registers - the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number register and the National Institutes of Health register (both screened in the first half of 2013) - reference lists of relevant articles and reviews, and conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology and the International Conference on Long-Term Complications of Treatment of Children and Adolescents for Cancer (both 2008 to 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of a nutritional intervention with a control group which did not receive the intervention in this review. Participants were childhood cancer survivors of any age, diagnosed with any type of cancer when less than 18 years of age. Participating childhood cancer survivors had completed their treatment with curative intent prior to the intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected and extracted data from each identified study, using a standardised form. We assessed the validity of each identified study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We used the GRADE criteria to assess the quality of each trial. MAIN RESULTS: Three RCTs were eligible for review. A total of 616 participants were included in the analysis. One study included participants who had been treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (275 participants). Two studies included participants who had all forms of paediatric malignancies (266 and 75 participants). All participants were less than 21 years of age at study entry. The follow-up ranged from one month to 36 months from the initial assessment. All intended outcomes were not evaluated by each included study. All studies looked at different interventions, and so we were unable to pool results. We could not rule out the presence of bias in any of the studies.There was no clear evidence of a difference in calcium intake at one month between those who received the single, half-day, group-based education that focused on bone health, and those who received standard care (mean difference (MD) 111.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) -258.97 to 482.17; P = 0.56, low quality evidence). A regression analysis, adjusting for baseline calcium intake and changes in knowledge and self-efficacy, showed a significantly greater calcium intake for the intervention as compared with the control group at the one-month follow-up (beta coefficient 4.92, 95% CI 0.33 to 9.52; P = 0.04). There was statistically significant higher, self-reported milk consumption (MD 0.43, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.79; P = 0.02, low quality evidence), number of days on calcium supplementation (MD 11.42, 95% CI 7.11 to 15.73; P < 0.00001, low quality evidence), and use of any calcium supplementation (risk ratio (RR) 3.35, 95% CI 1.86 to 6.04; P < 0.0001, low quality evidence), with those who received this single, face-to-face, group-based, health behaviour session.There was no clear evidence of a difference in bone density Z-scores measured with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan at 36 months follow-up (MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.16; P = 0.64, moderate quality evidence) between those who received calcium and vitamin D supplementation combined with nutrition education and those who received nutrition education alone. There was also no clear evidence of a difference in bone mineral density between the intervention and the control group at the 12-month (median difference -0.17, P = 0.99) and 24-month follow-up (median difference -0.04, P = 0.54).A single multi-component health behaviour change intervention, focusing on general healthy eating principles, with two telephone follow-ups brought about a 0.17 lower score on the four-point Likert scale of self-reported junk food intake compared with the control group (MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.01; P = 0.04, low quality evidence); this result was statistically significant. There was no clear evidence of a difference between the groups in the self-reported use of nutrition as a health protective behaviour (MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.14; P = 0.60, low quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Due to a paucity of studies, and the heterogeneity of the studies included in this review, we are unable to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of nutritional interventions for use with childhood cancer survivors. Although there is low quality evidence for the improvement in health behaviours using health behaviour change interventions, there remains no evidence as to whether this translates into an improvement in dietary intake. There was also no evidence that the studies reduced the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in childhood cancer survivors, although no evidence of effect is not the same as evidence of no effect. This review highlights the need for further well designed trials to be implemented in this population.","['Cohen, Jennifer E', 'Wakefield, Claire E', 'Cohn, Richard J']","['Cohen JE', 'Wakefield CE', 'Cohn RJ']","[""Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20160822,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Calcium, Dietary)', '0 (Vitamins)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Bone Density', 'Calcium, Dietary/*administration & dosage', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Endocrine System Diseases/prevention & control', 'Fast Foods', '*Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Intention to Treat Analysis', 'Metabolic Syndrome/prevention & control', 'Milk', '*Neoplasms/therapy', 'Nutrition Therapy/*methods', 'Osteoporosis/prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', '*Survivors', 'Vitamin D/*administration & dosage', 'Vitamins/*administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/08/23 06:00,2016/10/21 06:00,['2016/08/23 06:00'],"['2016/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD009678.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2016 Aug 22;(8):CD009678. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD009678.pub2.,10.1002/14651858.CD009678.pub2 [doi],,,,,PMC6486279,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GATA2 haploinsufficiency is implicated in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and GATA2 overexpression portends a poor prognosis for AML. However, the constituents of the GATA-2-dependent genetic network mediating pathogenesis are unknown. We described a p38-dependent mechanism that phosphorylates GATA-2 and increases GATA-2 target gene activation. We demonstrate that this mechanism establishes a growth-promoting chemokine/cytokine circuit in AML cells. p38/ERK-dependent GATA-2 phosphorylation facilitated positive autoregulation of GATA2 transcription and expression of target genes, including IL1B and CXCL2. IL-1beta and CXCL2 enhanced GATA-2 phosphorylation, which increased GATA-2-mediated transcriptional activation. p38/ERK-GATA-2 stimulated AML cell proliferation via CXCL2 induction.

Drugs were irradiated at doses of 10 and 25 kGy. Data from EPR studies proved that the highest concentration of free radicals was found in DOX and that the number of stable free radicals is always greater after irradiation. In in vitro studies, a higher cytotoxic activity of irradiated DOX and EPI in multidrug-resistant CCRF-VCR1000 cells was observed. This tendency was maintained during the storage at 4 degrees C for 90 days. Changes in CCRF-CEM cells' viability were not dependent on the irradiation status and its dose and were only drug-concentration dependent in all measurement time points. It was proved that increased potency of 25 kGy e-beam irradiated drugs results from their enhanced proapoptotic activity. Apoptotic cell death observed in CCRF-VCR1000 cells treated with irradiated drugs was caspase-8, -9, and -3 dependent and related to the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. No significant differences in the effects of irradiated and non-irradiated drugs on p53 and NFkappaB transcription factor level and their translocation to the nucleus were noted. Increased activity of the irradiated drugs was not dependent on ABCB1 level.","['Paszel-Jaworska, A', 'Toton, E', 'Dettlaff, K', 'Kaczmarek, A', 'Bednarski, W', 'Oszczapowicz, I', 'Jelinska, A', 'Rybczynska, M']","['Paszel-Jaworska A', 'Toton E', 'Dettlaff K', 'Kaczmarek A', 'Bednarski W', 'Oszczapowicz I', 'Jelinska A', 'Rybczynska M']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Przybyszewskiego Str. 49, 60-355, Poznan, Poland.

However, a highly expressed BLV micro-RNA cluster has been reported, suggesting that the BLV silencing is not complete. Here, we demonstrate the in vivo recruitment of RNA polymerase III to the BLV miRNA cluster both in BLV-latently infected cell lines and in ovine BLV-infected primary cells, through a canonical type 2 RNAPIII promoter. Moreover, by RPC6-knockdown, we showed a direct functional link between RNAPIII transcription and BLV miRNAs expression. Furthermore, both the tumor- and the quiescent-related isoforms of RPC7 subunits were recruited to the miRNA cluster. We showed that the BLV miRNA cluster was enriched in positive epigenetic marks. Interestingly, we demonstrated the in vivo recruitment of RNAPII at the 3'LTR/host genomic junction, associated with positive epigenetic marks. Functionally, we showed that the BLV LTR exhibited a strong antisense promoter activity and identified cis-acting elements of an RNAPII-dependent promoter. Finally, we provided evidence for an in vivo collision between RNAPIII and RNAPII convergent transcriptions. Our results provide new insights into alternative ways used by BLV to counteract silencing of the viral 5'LTR promoter.","['Van Driessche, Benoit', 'Rodari, Anthony', 'Delacourt, Nadege', 'Fauquenoy, Sylvain', 'Vanhulle, Caroline', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Rohr, Olivier', 'Van Lint, Carine']","['Van Driessche B', 'Rodari A', 'Delacourt N', 'Fauquenoy S', 'Vanhulle C', 'Burny A', 'Rohr O', 'Van Lint C']","['Service of Molecular Virology, Department of Molecular Biology (DBM), Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, B-6041, Belgium.', 'Service of Molecular Virology, Department of Molecular Biology (DBM), Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, B-6041, Belgium.', 'Service of Molecular Virology, Department of Molecular Biology (DBM), Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, B-6041, Belgium.', 'Service of Molecular Virology, Department of Molecular Biology (DBM), Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, B-6041, Belgium.', 'Service of Molecular Virology, Department of Molecular Biology (DBM), Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, B-6041, Belgium.', 'Service of Molecular Virology, Department of Molecular Biology (DBM), Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, B-6041, Belgium.', 'Institut Universitaire de Technologie Louis Pasteur de Schiltigheim, University of Strasbourg, Schiltigheim, F-67300, France.', 'Institut de Parasitologie et de Pathologie Tropicale, Laboratory of Dynamic of Host-Pathogen Interactions (DHPI), EA7292, University of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, F-67000, France.', 'Service of Molecular Virology, Department of Molecular Biology (DBM), Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, B-6041, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160822,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (RNA Polymerase III)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', '*Genome, Viral', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*enzymology/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Subunits', 'RNA Polymerase II/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase III/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Sheep', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,,2016/08/23 06:00,2018/04/25 06:00,['2016/08/23 06:00'],"['2016/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['srep31125 [pii]', '10.1038/srep31125 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Aug 22;6:31125. doi: 10.1038/srep31125.,10.1038/srep31125 [doi],,,,,PMC4992882,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering potential implications for therapy, we aimed to determine the cell fraction where miR-21 exerts its pathological activity. We developed a viral vector-based strategy for gene targeting of nonmyocyte cardiac cells in vivo and compared global to cardiac myocyte-specific and nonmyocyte-specific deletion of miR-21 in chronic left ventricular pressure overload. Murine moloney virus and serotype 9 of adeno-associated virus were engineered to encode improved Cre recombinase for genetic deletion in miR-21(fl/fl) mice. Pericardial injection of murine moloney virus-improved Cre recombinase to neonates achieved highly selective genetic ablation of miR-21 in nonmyocyte cardiac cells, identified as cardiac fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Upon left ventricular pressure overload, cardiac function was only preserved in mice with miR-21 deficiency in nonmyocyte cardiac cells, but not in mice with global or cardiac myocyte-specific ablation. Our data demonstrate that miR-21 exerts its pathologic activity directly in cardiac nonmyocytes and encourage further development of antimiR-21 therapy toward cellular tropism.","['Ramanujam, Deepak', 'Sassi, Yassine', 'Laggerbauer, Bernhard', 'Engelhardt, Stefan']","['Ramanujam D', 'Sassi Y', 'Laggerbauer B', 'Engelhardt S']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Technische Universitat Munchen (TUM), Munich, Germany.', 'Institut fur Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Technische Universitat Munchen (TUM), Munich, Germany.', 'Institut fur Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Technische Universitat Munchen (TUM), Munich, Germany.', 'Institut fur Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Technische Universitat Munchen (TUM), Munich, Germany; DZHK (German Centre for Cardiovascular Research), partner site Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany.

Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA), an active ingredient derived from the plant Boswellia serrata, has been found to inhibit the growth of a wide variety of tumor cells, including glioma, colorectal cancer, leukemia, human melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and prostate cancer cells. However, the actions of AKBA in multidrug-resistant cancer cells have not been fully elucidated. The current study examined the reversal of MDR by AKBA in a human ileocecal adenocarcinoma cell line with vincristine-induced resistance, HCT-8/VCR. A 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay indicated that cytotoxicity increased drastically and the IC50 of VCR in HCT-8/VCR cells decreased in the presence of AKBA. AKBA had a maximum ""fold reversal"" of MDR (FR) of 9.19-fold. In addition, HCT-8/VCR cells treated with AKBA and VCR exhibited a higher percentage of apoptotic tumor cells according to flow cytometry. The reversal of MDR by AKBA was evident in an intracellular increase in Rhodamine (Rh123), indicating that the activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was blocked. Furthermore, AKBA inhibited the expression of P-gp and decreased levels of expression of multidrug resistance gene 1 in HCT-8/VCR cells. The current results indicated that AKBA might be a potential agent to reverse MDR in human ileocecal adenocarcinoma.","['Xue, Xia', 'Chen, Fang', 'Liu, Anxin', 'Sun, Deqing', 'Wu, Jing', 'Kong, Feng', 'Luan, Yun', 'Qu, Xianjun', 'Wang, Rongmei']","['Xue X', 'Chen F', 'Liu A', 'Sun D', 'Wu J', 'Kong F', 'Luan Y', 'Qu X', 'Wang R']","['Department of Pharmacy, the Second Hospital of Shandong University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160819,Japan,Biosci Trends,Bioscience trends,101502754,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (acetyl-11-ketoboswellic acid)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology']",,,2016/08/23 06:00,2017/01/31 06:00,['2016/08/23 06:00'],"['2016/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.5582/bst.2016.01115 [doi]'],ppublish,Biosci Trends. 2016 Nov 15;10(5):392-399. doi: 10.5582/bst.2016.01115.

Since PPAR ligands are potentially interesting in different hematologic malignancies, this article will review the potential of PPAR ligands for use in CML treatment.","['Yousefi, B', 'Shafiei-Irannejad, V', 'Azimi, A', 'Samadi, N', 'Zarghami, N']","['Yousefi B', 'Shafiei-Irannejad V', 'Azimi A', 'Samadi N', 'Zarghami N']","['Tabriz University of Medical Sciences Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Tabriz Iran.', 'Tabriz University of Medical Sciences Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Tabriz Iran.', 'Maragheh University of Medical Sciences Departmant of Basic Sciences Maragheh Iran.', 'Tabriz University of Medical Sciences Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Tabriz Iran nsamadi@ualberta.ca.', 'Tabriz University of Medical Sciences Immunology Research Center Tabriz Iran zarghamin@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160731,France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,"['0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'PPAR gamma/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",,,2016/08/23 06:00,2017/01/24 06:00,['2016/08/23 06:00'],"['2006/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 2016 Jul 31;62(8):52-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2015, secukinumab was the first IL-17A inhibitor approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. AREAS COVERED: This review evaluates the safety profile of secukinumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis and its role in the clinical landscape. A literature search was performed for articles published through February 2016; additional data from a pooled safety analysis of 10 Phase II and III secukinumab studies were reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Collectively, these studies show that secukinumab demonstrates a highly favorable safety profile, especially compared with commonly used psoriasis treatments such as methotrexate and TNF-alpha blockers. More specifically, secukinumab carries no increased risks for end-organ toxicities, serious infection, multiple sclerosis, reactivation of latent tuberculosis or hepatitis B, leukemia/lymphoma, and nonmelanoma skin cancer. Mucocutaneous candidiasis is a common side effect and occurs at a rate of 3.55/100 subject-years with secukinumab 300 mg, yet these infections usually do not interfere with maintenance of secukinumab therapy. The combination of proven efficacy and safety make secukinumab an excellent new treatment choice for individuals with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.","['Blauvelt, Andrew']",['Blauvelt A'],"['a Oregon Medical Research Center , Portland , OR , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160822,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Dermatologic Agents)', '0 (IL17A protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', 'DLG4EML025 (secukinumab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Dermatologic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-17/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Psoriasis/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Severity of Illness Index']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Interleukin-17A', '*psoriasis', '*safety', '*secukinumab']",2016/08/23 06:00,2017/02/28 06:00,['2016/08/23 06:00'],"['2016/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/14740338.2016.1221923 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2016 Oct;15(10):1413-20. doi: 10.1080/14740338.2016.1221923.

In 40% of the cases, the karyotype is normal and must be associated with molecular biology studies that can refine the prognosis. The usefulness of the karyotype is more limited during the follow-up of the patient due to its limited sensitivity, but it is still useful in the clinical management of relapse.

The biology of this disease remains elusive. In the present times, targeted molecular therapy defines the treatment. This has made understanding the elusive biology and molecular mechanisms of the disease more relevant. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-encoding RNAs that play important gene-regulatory roles in neoplastic processes. As in silico studies list nearly hundreds and more target genes for each miRNA, it is of interest to see if there are genes that have already been implicated in this disease. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify genes regulated by miRNAs that are independently implicated in the pathogenesis of CLL in previously published literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight miRNAs were selected. Genes implicated in the biology of CLL in association studies and massively parallel sequence studies were selected. TargetScanHuman 6.2, a computational program that predicts target genes of miRNAs on the basis of sequence analysis, was used to link the miRNAs to genes of interest. RESULTS: The genes targeted by miR-15a, miR-223, miR-29a, and miR181a included IL10RA, BCL2, BCL6, DDX3X, and FBXW7. The most significant link observed was that several gene members of the TNF/TNFR superfamily were targets of miR-15a, miR-29a, and miR-181a. CONCLUSION: MiRNAs implicated in the pathogenesis of CLL regulate genes that have independently been shown to play a role in CLL. The link between miRNAs and the TNF/TNFR superfamily is especially exciting. Understanding the molecular basis of these links in future studies may pave the way for using these miRNAs as therapeutic targets in CLL.","['Srivastava, Swati', 'Tsongalis, Gregory J', 'Kaur, Prabhjot']","['Srivastava S', 'Tsongalis GJ', 'Kaur P']","['Department of Pathology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, USA; Department of Pathology, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, USA; Department of Pathology, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, USA; Department of Pathology, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA.

The exact cause is not known in most cases, but past epidemiological research has suggested a number of potential risk factors. This study evaluated associations between environmental and parental factors and the risk for ALL in Egyptian children to gain insight into risk factors in this developing country. METHODS: We conducted a case-control design from May 2009 to February 2012. Cases were recruited from Children's Cancer Hospital, Egypt (CCHE). Healthy controls were randomly selected from the general population to frequency-match the cumulative group of cases by sex, age groups (<1; 1 - 5; >5 - 10; >10 years) and region of residence (Cairo metropolitan region, Nile Delta region (North), and Upper Egypt (South)). Mothers provided answers to an administered questionnaire about their environmental exposures and health history including those of the father. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic regression with adjustment for covariates. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety nine ALL cases and 351 population-based controls frequency-matched for age group, gender and location were recruited. The risk of ALL was increased with the mother's use of medications for ovulation induction (ORadj = 2.5, 95 % CI =1.2 -5.1) and to a lesser extend with her age (ORadj = 1.8, 95 % CI = 1.1 - 2.8, for mothers >/= 30 years old). Delivering the child by Cesarean section, was also associated with increased risk (ORadj = 2.01, 95 % CI =1.24-2.81). CONCLUSIONS: In Egypt, the risk for childhood ALL appears to be associated with older maternal age, and certain maternal reproductive factors.","['Ezzat, Sameera', 'Rashed, Wafaa M', 'Salem, Sherin', 'Dorak, M Tevfik', 'El-Daly, Mai', 'Abdel-Hamid, Mohamed', 'Sidhom, Iman', 'El-Hadad, Alaa', 'Loffredo, Christopher']","['Ezzat S', 'Rashed WM', 'Salem S', 'Dorak MT', 'El-Daly M', 'Abdel-Hamid M', 'Sidhom I', 'El-Hadad A', 'Loffredo C']","['National Liver Institute, Menoufia University, Shibin El Kom, Egypt. sameera.ezzat@gmail.com.', ""Children's Cancer Hospital 57357, El Sayeda Zeinab, Cairo, 11441, Egypt."", ""Children's Cancer Hospital 57357, El Sayeda Zeinab, Cairo, 11441, Egypt."", 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'School of Health Sciences, Liverpool Hope University, Liverpool, UK.', 'National Liver Institute, Menoufia University, Shibin El Kom, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Minia University, Minia, Egypt.', ""Children's Cancer Hospital 57357, El Sayeda Zeinab, Cairo, 11441, Egypt."", 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', ""Children's Cancer Hospital 57357, El Sayeda Zeinab, Cairo, 11441, Egypt."", 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160820,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Egypt/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Maternal Age', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', '*Cesarean Section', '*Egypt', '*Ovulation induction']",2016/08/22 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2016/08/22 06:00'],"['2016/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-016-2689-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-016-2689-z [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2016 Aug 20;16:662. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2689-z.,10.1186/s12885-016-2689-z [doi],,,,,PMC4992254,,['R03 CA133960/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy-two adult patients who underwent transplantation between 2004 and 2013 at a single academic medical center (University of California San Francisco) were eligible for this retrospective study based on availability of cryopreserved granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF)-mobilized autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) leukapheresis specimens (""autografts""). Autograft MRD was assessed by molecular methods (real-time quantitative PCR [RQ-PCR] for Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) alone or a multigene panel) and by multiparameter flow cytometry (MPFC). WT1 RQ-PCR testing of the autograft had low sensitivity for relapse prediction (14%) and a negative predictive value of 51%. MPFC failed to identify MRD in any of 34 autografts tested. Combinations of molecular MRD assays, however, improved prediction of post-auto-HCT relapse. In multivariate analysis of clinical variables, including age, gender, race, cytogenetic risk category, and CD34(+) cell dose, only autograft multigene MRD as assessed by RQ-PCR was statistically significantly associated with relapse. One year after transplantation, only 28% patients with detectable autograft MRD were relapse free, compared with 67% in the MRD-negative cohort. Multigene MRD, while an improvement on other methods tested, was however suboptimal for relapse prediction in unselected patients, with specificity of 83% and sensitivity of 46%. In patients with known chromosomal abnormalities or mutations, however, better predictive value was observed with no relapses observed in MRD-negative patients in the first year after auto-HCT compared with 83% incidence of relapse in the MRD-positive patients (hazard ratio, 12.45; P = .0016). In summary, increased personalization of MRD monitoring by use of a multigene panel improved the ability to risk stratify patients for post-auto-HCT relapse. WT1 RQ-PCR and flow cytometric assessment for AML MRD in autograft samples had limited value for predicting relapse after auto-HCT.

METHODS: MK-8242 was dosed p.o. QD (30-250mg) or BID (120-250mg) for 7on/7off in 28-day cycle. Dosing was modified to 7on/14off, in 21-day cycle (210 or 300mg BID). RESULTS: 26 subjects enrolled (24 evaluable for response); 5/26 discontinued due to AEs. There were 7 deaths; 1 (fungal pneumonia due to marrow aplasia) possibly drug-related. With the 7on/7off regimen, 2 subjects had DLTs in the 250mg BID group (both bone marrow failure and prolonged cytopenia). With the 7on/14off, no DLTs were observed in 210mg BID or 300mg BID (doses>300mg not tested). Best responses were: 1/24 PR (11 weeks;120mg QD, 7on/7off); 1/24 CRi (2 weeks;210mg BID, 7on/14off); 1/24 morphologic leukemia-free state (4 weeks; 250mg BID, 7on/7off).

The geographic variation of indoor gamma radiation dose-rates in Great Britain is explored using various geo-statistical methods. A multi-resolution Gaussian-process model using radial basis functions with 2, 4, or 8 components, is fitted via maximum likelihood, and a non-spatial model is also used, fitted by ordinary least squares. Because of the dataset size (N = 10,199), four other parametric spatial models are fitted by variogram-fitting. A randomly selected 70:30 split is used for fitting:validation. The models are evaluated based on their predictive performance as measured by Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, as well as Pearson correlation and rank-correlation between predicted and actual dose-rates. Each of the four parametric models (Matern, Gaussian, Bessel, Spherical) fitted the empirical variogram well, and yielded similar predictions at >50 km separation, although with more substantial differences in predicted variograms at <50 km. The multi-resolution Gaussian-process model with 8 components had the best predictive accuracy among the models considered. The Spherical, Bessel, Matern, Gaussian and ordinary least squares models had progressively worse predictive performance, the ordinary least squares model being particularly poor in this respect.","['Chernyavskiy, P', 'Kendall, G M', 'Wakeford, R', 'Little, M P']","['Chernyavskiy P', 'Kendall GM', 'Wakeford R', 'Little MP']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, DHHS, NIH, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Bethesda, MD 20892-9778, USA.

To provide an overview of what is currently known about the effects of cancer treatment on balance in pediatric ALL patients and survivors, and of the predictors of poor balance, a review of the literature was conducted. METHODS: Five databases were searched for English-language original research articles on balance during or after treatment for pediatric ALL. RESULTS: From a total of nine studies, six identified significant balance problems in children with ALL during or after treatment. The percentage of patients or survivors with impaired balance varied between 27% and 69% during treatment, 7% and 65% a few years after completion of treatment, and 14% and 17% many years after the completion of treatment. Factors associated with impaired balance were higher body mass index; higher intrathecal methotrexate dose; cranial radiation; knee extensor weakness; and impaired cognition. CONCLUSION: Although heterogeneity between the studies regarding patient age; age at diagnosis; time since completion of treatment; and methods of quantifying balance make it difficult to reach a single conclusion, the evidence suggests that survivors may experience short- and/or long-term balance difficulties. While there is a need for additional studies to better understand the effects of impaired balance in survivors, clinicians treating both child and adult survivors of ALL need to be aware of these potential risks.","['Varedi, Mitra', 'McKenna, Raymond', 'Lamberg, Eric M']","['Varedi M', 'McKenna R', 'Lamberg EM']","['Rehabilitation Research and Movement Performance Laboratory, Stony Brook University, New York, USA.', 'Rehabilitation Research and Movement Performance Laboratory, Stony Brook University, New York, USA.', 'Department of Physical Therapy, School of Health Technology and Management, Stony Brook University, New York, USA.', 'Rehabilitation Research and Movement Performance Laboratory, Stony Brook University, New York, USA.', 'Department of Physical Therapy, School of Health Technology and Management, Stony Brook University, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20161110,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Postural Balance/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'balance', 'children', 'vincristine']",2016/08/21 06:00,2017/10/05 06:00,['2016/08/21 06:00'],"['2016/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ped.13141 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2017 Mar;59(3):293-302. doi: 10.1111/ped.13141.

This study aimed to identify the patterns of co-occurrence of multiple community-level SES indicators and to explore associations between various patterns of these indicators and pediatric AML mortality risk. A nationally representative US sample of 3651 pediatric AML patients, aged 0-19 years at diagnosis was drawn from 17 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database registries created between 1973 and 2012. Factor analysis, cluster analysis, stratified univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used. Four SES factors accounting for 87% of the variance in SES indicators were identified: F1) economic/educational disadvantage, less immigration; F2) immigration-related features (foreign-born, language-isolation, crowding), less mobility; F3) housing instability; and, F4) absence of moving. F1 and F3 showed elevated risk of mortality, adjusted hazards ratios (aHR) (95% CI): 1.07(1.02-1.12) and 1.05(1.00-1.10), respectively. Seven SES-defined cluster groups were identified. Cluster 1 (low economic/educational disadvantage, few immigration-related features, and residential-stability) showed the minimum risk of mortality. Compared to Cluster 1, Cluster 3 (high economic/educational disadvantage, high-mobility) and Cluster 6 (moderately-high economic/educational disadvantages, housing-instability and immigration-related features) exhibited substantially greater risk of mortality, aHR(95% CI)=1.19(1.0-1.4) and 1.23 (1.1-1.5), respectively. Factors of correlated SES-indicators and their pattern-based groups demonstrated differential risks in the pediatric AML mortality indicating the need of special public-health attention in areas with economic-educational disadvantages, housing-instability and immigration-related features.","['Knoble, Naomi B', 'Alderfer, Melissa A', 'Hossain, Md Jobayer']","['Knoble NB', 'Alderfer MA', 'Hossain MJ']","['Center for Healthcare Delivery Science, Nemours Biomedical Research, A I duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE 19803, United States.', 'Center for Healthcare Delivery Science, Nemours Biomedical Research, A I duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE 19803, United States; Department of Pediatrics, Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107.', 'Biostatistics Core, Nemours Biomedical Research, A I duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE 19803, United States; Department of Applied Economics and Statistics, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, United States.

To determine if it were possible to analyze PD-L1 with PCR-based methods, we assessed the expression of PD-L1 in primary samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia, in healthy donors, and in a panel of cell lines, by means of flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. Although the surface density of the protein was not correlated with the amount of expressed full-length mRNA, we found a statistically significant positive correlation between PD-L1 surface density and the ratio of two transcript variants (variant 1/variant 2). Our PCR-based method allows for retrospective examination of PD-L1 surface expression from frozen cDNA samples, without the need for a reference gene. Our results also suggest that variant 2, which is produced by alternative splicing, negatively regulates PD-L1 protein expression on the cell surface. In addition, PD-L1 exposition on the cell surface is clearly associated with a shift of electrophoretic mobility, observed on Western blots.

There are disagreements over the guidelines for postcancer immunization strategy. METHODS: Our study was an observational, cross-sectional retrospective review of data collected on children who were seen in the outpatient clinic at King Abdullah Medical City, Oncology Center, Jeddah, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Our aim was to evaluate the seropositive status to vaccine-preventable diseases: measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, and Haemophilus influenzae type B (HIB) in childhood cancer survivors at our center in order to plan future vaccination for these children and establish a simple revaccination schedule. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (21 boys and 26 girls) were included in the study. Age at the time of cancer diagnosis (mean+/-standard deviation) was 5.68+/-3.79 years and age at test sampling was 10.68+/-3.79 years. Acute leukemia was the most common cancer (49% of patients), followed by lymphoma (28%), brain tumors (13%), and solid tumors (10%). Treatment intensities (according to the Treatment Intensity Rating Scale, version 3.0; ITR-3) were 2, 3, and 4 for 26 patients (55%), 20 patients (43%), and one patient (2.1%), respectively. We found that 93% of our patients were considered seronegative (unprotected) for at least one vaccine-preventable disease. The seronegative rates for measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, and HIB were 46.8%, 36.2%, 36.2%, 46.8%, 61.7%, 17.1%, and 42.6%, respectively. Criteria including age at diagnosis, age at sampling, type of malignancy, and treatment intensity were not significantly different between seropositive and seronegative patients. CONCLUSION: Seronegative rates for vaccine-preventable diseases were very high in childhood cancer survivors, which represented a subpopulation of high-risk patients who could benefit from revaccination. We suggest a universal revaccination approach for all childhood cancer survivors, which is easily applicable and of low cost.","['Fayea, Najwa Yahya', 'Fouda, Ashraf Elsayed', 'Kandil, Shaimaa Mohamed']","['Fayea NY', 'Fouda AE', 'Kandil SM']","['Oncology Center Jeddah, King Abdullah Medical City, Makkah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Pediatric Department, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University Children Hospital, Mansoura University, Al-Mansoura, Egypt.

Here we report that stable chimeric animals generated with these protocols are strongly resistant to donor leukocyte infusion (DLI)-mediated GVH effects. Of 33 total DLIs in tolerant chimeras at clinical doses, 21 failed to induce conversion to full donor hematopoietic chimerism or cause GVHD. We attempted to overcome this resistance to conversion through several mechanisms, including using sensitized donor lymphocytes, increasing the DLI dose, removing chimeric host peripheral blood cells through extensive recipient leukapheresis before DLI, and using fully mismatched lymphocytes. Despite our attempts, the resistance to conversion in our model was robust, and when conversion was achieved, it was associated with GVHD in most animals. Our studies suggest that delivery of unmodified hematopoietic stem cell doses under reduced-intensity conditioning can induce a potent, GVHD-free, immune tolerant state that is strongly resistant to DLI.","['Duran-Struuck, Raimon', 'Matar, Abraham J', 'Crepeau, Rebecca L', 'Teague, Alexander G S', 'Horner, Benjamin M', 'Pathiraja, Vimukthi', 'Spitzer, Thomas R', 'Fishman, Jay A', 'Bronson, Roderick T', 'Sachs, David H', 'Huang, Christene A']","['Duran-Struuck R', 'Matar AJ', 'Crepeau RL', 'Teague AGS', 'Horner BM', 'Pathiraja V', 'Spitzer TR', 'Fishman JA', 'Bronson RT', 'Sachs DH', 'Huang CA']","['Department of Pathobiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Massachusetts General Hospital, Transplantation Biology Research Center, Boston, Massachusetts.

Activation of the BCR in lymphoid organs has been associated with CLL cell proliferation and survival, leading to progressive disease. While these responses are mediated predominantly by IgM, the role of IgD is less clear. Seeking to uncover downstream consequences of individual and combined stimulation of the two BCR isotypes, we found an amplification of IgD expression and IgD-mediated calcium signalling by previous stimulation of IgM in CLL. Furthermore, no heterologous downmodulation of the isotypes, as observed in healthy donors, was present. Only marginal downregulation of the expression of various chemokine receptors by alpha-IgM and alpha-IgD stimulation was found as compared to normal B cells. Consistently, calcium responses of CLL cells to different chemokines were only weakly affected by preceding BCR activation. In contrast, migration towards the two homeostatic chemokines CXCL12 and CCL21 was differentially regulated by IgM and IgD. While IgM activation reduced migration of CLL cells towards CXCL12, but not CCL21, IgD activation predominantly impacted on CCL21 but not CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis. This indicates that the preference for one chemokine over the other may depend on the functional presence of the two isotypes in CLL. Inhibitors against the kinases Syk, Lyn, and Btk antagonised both BCR- and chemokine-induced calcium signals.","['Haerzschel, Andrea', 'Catusse, Julie', 'Hutterer, Evelyn', 'Paunovic, Manuela', 'Zirlik, Katja', 'Eibel, Hermann', 'Krenn, Peter W', 'Hartmann, Tanja N', 'Burger, Meike']","['Haerzschel A', 'Catusse J', 'Hutterer E', 'Paunovic M', 'Zirlik K', 'Eibel H', 'Krenn PW', 'Hartmann TN', 'Burger M']","['Freiburg University Medical Center, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Breisgau, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Third Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Freiburg University Medical Center, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Breisgau, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Third Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Third Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Freiburg University Medical Center, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Breisgau, Germany.', 'Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency (CCI), University Medical Center and University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Third Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Third Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria. t.hartmann@salk.at.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Salzburg, Austria. t.hartmann@salk.at.', 'Freiburg University Medical Center, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Breisgau, Germany.', 'Faculty Medical and Life Sciences, Campus Villingen-Schwenningen, University Furtwangen, Schwarzwald, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160820,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (CCL21 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL21)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (anti-IgD)', '0 (anti-IgM)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*pharmacology', 'Chemokine CCL21/agonists/*metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL12/agonists/*metabolism', 'Chemokines/agonists/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/agonists/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR signalling', 'CLL', 'Chemokines', 'IgD', 'IgM']",2016/11/04 06:00,2017/01/28 06:00,['2016/08/21 06:00'],"['2016/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2788-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2788-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Dec;95(12):1979-1988. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2788-6.

The purpose of this study was to assess serum albumin's relationship with MTX pharmacokinetics by comparing MTX clearance and toxicities between patients with normal serum albumin to those with hypoalbuminemia. This single-center retrospective study included adult patients with leukemia or lymphoma who received their first MTX at a dose >/=1 g/m(2). Hypoalbuminemia was defined as serum albumin </=3.4 g/dL. MTX clearance was defined as the first documented time the MTX level </=0.05 muM. Fisher's exact tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to examine differences in toxicities, and Cox proportional hazard regression was used to assess relationship with time to clearance. Of 523 patients identified, 167 patients were evaluable. One hundred thirty-five patients had normal serum albumin and 32 had hypoalbuminemia. Hypoalbuminemia was associated with a higher proportion of patients experiencing edema, ascites or pleural effusions (34 vs. 12 %, p = 0.006), and the concomitant use of nephrotoxic agents (41 vs. 20 %, p = 0.021). Hypoalbuminemia was associated with a significantly longer time to MTX clearance (median 96 vs. 72 h, p = 0.004). In addition, patients with hypoalbuminemia had a higher proportion of hyperbilirubinemia and significantly longer hospitalization (median 14 vs. 5 days, p < 0.001). In conclusion, hypoalbuminemia was associated with increased time to MTX clearance and increased length of hospitalization. High dose MTX is safe to administer in patients with low albumin levels, with appropriate leucovorin rescue, and good supportive care.","['Reiss, Samantha N', 'Buie, Larry W', 'Adel, Nelly', 'Goldman, Debra A', 'Devlin, Sean M', 'Douer, Dan']","['Reiss SN', 'Buie LW', 'Adel N', 'Goldman DA', 'Devlin SM', 'Douer D']","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY, 10065, USA. reisss@mskcc.org.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 485 Lexington Avenue 2nd Floor, New York, NY, 10017, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 485 Lexington Avenue 2nd Floor, New York, NY, 10017, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY, 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20160820,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/trends', 'Humans', 'Hypoalbuminemia/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukemia/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects/*physiology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Serum Albumin/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Albumin', 'Clearance', 'High dose methotrexate', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Methotrexate', 'Pharmacokinetics', 'Toxicity']",2016/11/04 06:00,2017/01/28 06:00,['2016/08/21 06:00'],"['2016/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2795-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2795-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Dec;95(12):2009-2015. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2795-7.

Concomitant severe thrombocytopenia makes anticoagulation for catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) in patients with acute leukemia (AL) a challenge. Incidence of CRT has been reported to be increased in those with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) vs. those with centrally inserted ones (CICC). Our objective is to compare the incidence rate of CRT in leukemia inpatients who received either a PICC vs. CICC. We retrospectively reviewed adult inpatients admitted to hematology wards with a new diagnosis of AL and who received either a PICC or a CICC. Baseline patient and catheter characteristics were recorded. Our primary outcome was the incidence rate of CRT in each group. The secondary outcomes included rates of infectious and mechanical complications. Six hundred sixty-three patients received at least one PICC (338) or CICC (325) insertion. A total of 1331 insertions were recorded, with 82 (11.7 %) and 41 (6.5 %) CRT in the PICC and CICC groups, respectively. The incidence rates were 1.89 and 0.52 per 1000 catheter day in the PICC and CICC groups, respectively. A PICC, when compared to CICC, was a significant risk factor for CRT (sHR 2.5, p < 0.0001). The prevalence and incidence rates of CRT in our AL patients were higher than predicted for a general cancer patient population. These rates were higher in the PICC group compared to the CICC group. We recommend careful consideration of thrombotic and bleeding risks of AL inpatients when choosing a central venous catheter.","['Refaei, Mohammad', 'Fernandes, Bruna', 'Brandwein, Joseph', 'Goodyear, Marilyn Dawn', 'Pokhrel, Arun', 'Wu, Cynthia']","['Refaei M', 'Fernandes B', 'Brandwein J', 'Goodyear MD', 'Pokhrel A', 'Wu C']","['Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Nursing, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, 4-112 Clinical Sciences Building, University of Alberta Hospital, 11350-83 Ave, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G2G3, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', ""Women and Children's Health Research Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."", 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, 4-112 Clinical Sciences Building, University of Alberta Hospital, 11350-83 Ave, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G2G3, Canada. cwu@ualberta.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20160820,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Catheterization, Peripheral/*adverse effects', 'Central Venous Catheters/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Catheter-related thrombosis', 'Central venous catheter', 'Leukemia', 'Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis', 'Venous thromboembolism']",2016/11/04 06:00,2017/01/28 06:00,['2016/08/21 06:00'],"['2016/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2798-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2798-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Dec;95(12):2057-2064. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2798-4.

The corresponding HRs (>/=0.2 vs. <0.2) for death, cancer-related death, and development of distant metastasis were 2.56 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.42-4.63], 3.32 (95% CI, 1.66-6.61), and 4.03 (95% CI, 1.77-9.18), respectively. Five-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of distant metastasis-free survival were 43% (MAGE-A >/= 0.2) versus 87% (MAGE-A < 0.2).Conclusions: MAGE-A expression in blood or bone marrow at tumor surgery is an independent predictor of survival in resected NSCLC. The reliable prediction of distant metastasis in individual patients with a statistically proven impact on overall survival may help to refine patient selection for adjuvant therapy urgently needed, especially in the clinical management of elderly patients.

This study aimed to describe molecular features, functional assessments and potential immune responses of Prx6 identified from the big-belly seahorse, Hippocampus abdominalis (HaPrx6). The complete ORF (666 bp) of HaPrx6 encodes a polypeptide (24 kDa) of 222 amino acids, and harbors a prominent peroxiredoxin super-family domain, a peroxidatic catalytic center, and a peroxidatic cysteine. The deduced amino acid sequence of HaPrx6 shares a relatively high amino acid sequence similarity and close evolutionary relationship with Oplegnathus fasciatus Prx6. The purified recombinant HaPrx6 protein (rHaPrx6) was shown to protect plasmid DNA in the Metal Catalyzed Oxidation (MCO) assay and, together with 1,4-Dithiothreitol (DTT), protected human leukemia THP-1 cells from extracellular H2O2-mediated cell death. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR revealed that HaPrx6 mRNA was constitutively expressed in 14 different tissues, with the highest expression observed in liver tissue. Inductive transcriptional responses were observed in liver and kidney tissues of fish after treating them with bacterial stimuli, including LPS, Edwardsiella tarda, and Streptococcus iniae. These results suggest that HaPrx6 may play an important role in the immune response of the big-belly seahorse against microbial infection. Collectively, these findings provide structural and functional insights into HaPrx6.","['Godahewa, G I', 'Perera, N C N', 'Elvitigala, Don Anushka Sandaruwan', 'Jayasooriya, R G P T', 'Kim, Gi-Young', 'Lee, Jehee']","['Godahewa GI', 'Perera NCN', 'Elvitigala DAS', 'Jayasooriya RGPT', 'Kim GY', 'Lee J']","['Department of Marine Life Sciences, Jeju National University, Jeju Self-Governing Province, 63243, Republic of Korea; Fish Vaccine Research Center, Jeju National University, Jeju Self-Governing Province, 63243, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Marine Life Sciences, Jeju National University, Jeju Self-Governing Province, 63243, Republic of Korea; Fish Vaccine Research Center, Jeju National University, Jeju Self-Governing Province, 63243, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Marine Life Sciences, Jeju National University, Jeju Self-Governing Province, 63243, Republic of Korea; Fish Vaccine Research Center, Jeju National University, Jeju Self-Governing Province, 63243, Republic of Korea; Department of Zoology, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Gangodawila, Nugegoda, 10250, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Marine Life Sciences, Jeju National University, Jeju Self-Governing Province, 63243, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Marine Life Sciences, Jeju National University, Jeju Self-Governing Province, 63243, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Marine Life Sciences, Jeju National University, Jeju Self-Governing Province, 63243, Republic of Korea; Fish Vaccine Research Center, Jeju National University, Jeju Self-Governing Province, 63243, Republic of Korea.

The fact that two of these mutations, R665W and L845F, imparted upon PLCgamma2 an approximately 2-3-fold ibrutinib-insensitive increase in the concentration of cytosolic Ca(2+) following ligation of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) led to the assumption that the two mutants exhibit constitutively enhanced intrinsic activity. Here, we show that the two PLCgamma2 mutants are strikingly hypersensitive to activation by Rac2 such that even wild-type Rac2 suffices to activate the mutant enzymes upon its introduction into intact cells. Enhanced ""basal"" activity of PLCgamma2 in intact cells is shown using the pharmacologic Rac inhibitor EHT 1864 and the PLCgamma2(F897Q) mutation mediating Rac resistance to be caused by Rac-stimulated rather than by constitutively enhanced PLCgamma2 activity. We suggest that R665W and L845F be referred to as allomorphic rather than hypermorphic mutations of PLCG2 Rerouting of the transmembrane signals emanating from BCR and converging on PLCgamma2 through Rac in ibrutinib-resistant CLL cells may provide novel drug treatment strategies to overcome ibrutinib resistance mediated by PLCG2 mutations or to prevent its development in ibrutinib-treated CLL patients.","['Walliser, Claudia', 'Hermkes, Elisabeth', 'Schade, Anja', 'Wiese, Sebastian', 'Deinzer, Julia', 'Zapatka, Marc', 'Desire, Laurent', 'Mertens, Daniel', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Gierschik, Peter']","['Walliser C', 'Hermkes E', 'Schade A', 'Wiese S', 'Deinzer J', 'Zapatka M', 'Desire L', 'Mertens D', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Gierschik P']","['From the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology and.', 'From the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology and.', 'From the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology and.', 'the Core Unit Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics, Medical Faculty, Ulm University, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'From the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology and.', 'the Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69121 Heidelberg, Germany, and.', 'the Diaxonhit, 63-65 Boulevard Massena, 75013 Paris, France.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University Medical Center, 89070 Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University Medical Center, 89070 Ulm, Germany.', 'From the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology and peter.gierschik@uni-ulm.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160819,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (EHT 1864)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (rac2 GTP-binding protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', '*Mutation, Missense', '*Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Phospholipase C gamma/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrones/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', '*rac GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Rac (Rac GTPase)', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*ibrutinib resistance', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma', '*phosphatidylinositol signaling', '*phospholipase C']",2016/08/21 06:00,2017/05/23 06:00,['2016/08/21 06:00'],"['2016/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)35795-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.746842 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Oct 14;291(42):22136-22148. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.746842.

We here undertook a multi-modality (DNA, mRNA, miRNA) array-based analysis of human CCRF-CEM leukemia cells and BTZ-resistant subclones to determine whether or not complementary mechanisms contribute to BTZ resistance. These studies revealed signatures of markedly reduced expression of proteolytic stress related genes in drug resistant cells over a broad range of BTZ concentrations along with a high upregulation of myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) gene expression. MARCKS upregulation was confirmed on protein level and also observed in other BTZ-resistant tumor cell lines as well as in leukemia cells with acquired resistance to other proteasome inhibitors. Moreover, when MARCKS protein expression was demonstrated in specimens derived from therapy-refractory pediatric leukemia patients (n = 44), higher MARCKS protein expression trended (p = 0.073) towards a dismal response to BTZ-containing chemotherapy. Mechanistically, we show a BTZ concentration-dependent association of MARCKS protein levels with the emergence of ubiquitin-containing vesicles in BTZ-resistant CEM cells. These vesicles were found to be extruded and taken up in co-cultures with proteasome-proficient acceptor cells. Consistent with these observations, MARCKS protein associated with ubiquitin-containing vesicles was also more prominent in clinical leukemic specimen with ex vivo BTZ resistance compared to BTZ-sensitive leukemia cells. Collectively, we propose a role for MARCKS in a novel mechanism of BTZ resistance via exocytosis of ubiquitinated proteins in BTZ-resistant cells leading to quenching of proteolytic stress.","['Franke, Niels E', 'Kaspers, Gertjan L', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G', 'van Meerloo, Johan', 'Niewerth, Denise', 'Kessler, Floortje L', 'Poddighe, Pino J', 'Kole, Jeroen', 'Smeets, Serge J', 'Ylstra, Bauke', 'Bi, Chonglei', 'Chng, Wee Joo', 'Horton, Terzah M', 'Menezes, Rene X', 'Musters, Renee J P', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Cloos, Jacqueline']","['Franke NE', 'Kaspers GL', 'Assaraf YG', 'van Meerloo J', 'Niewerth D', 'Kessler FL', 'Poddighe PJ', 'Kole J', 'Smeets SJ', 'Ylstra B', 'Bi C', 'Chng WJ', 'Horton TM', 'Menezes RX', 'Musters RJ', 'Zweegman S', 'Jansen G', 'Cloos J']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'The Fred Wyszkowski Cancer Research Laboratory, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Physiology, VU University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Current address: BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Physiology, VU University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Amsterdam Rheumatology and immunology Center, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '125267-21-2 (Myristoylated Alanine-Rich C Kinase Substrate)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Exocytosis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/mortality/therapy', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Myristoylated Alanine-Rich C Kinase Substrate/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['MARCKS', 'bortezomib', 'leukemia', 'proteasome', 'resistance']",2016/08/20 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2015/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['11340 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11340 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 15;7(46):74779-74796. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11340.,10.18632/oncotarget.11340 [doi],,,,,PMC5342701,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrate that DMAMCL significantly prolongs the lifespan of a mouse model of human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Mechanistic investigations further revealed that MCL exerted its cytotoxic effects via inhibition of NF-kappaB expression and activity, and by generating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation theoretically are at increased risk of experiencing complications, infection, and poorer implant survivorship owing to the high prevalence of comorbid conditions, immunosuppressive therapy regimens including corticosteroids, and often low circulating hematopoietic cell lines; however, there is a paucity of studies elucidating these risks. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked: (1) What is the overall mortality of patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation who have undergone THA? (2) What is the complication rate for these patients? (3) What are the revision and reoperation rates and implant survivorship for these patients? PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1999 and 2013, we performed 42 THAs in 36 patients who underwent stem-cell transplants. Other than those who died, all were available for followup at a minimum of 2 years; of the patients whose procedures were done more than 10 years ago and who are not known to have died, two (5%) had not been seen in the last 5 years and so are considered lost to followup. All patients underwent thorough evaluation by the transplant team before arthroplasty; general contraindications included active medical comorbidities or evidence of unstable end-organ damage, active rejection, and critically low circulating hematopoietic cell lines. Underlying primary diseases leading to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation included lymphoma (14/42; 33%), plasma cell disorders (10/42; 24%), leukemia (9/42; 21%), and amyloidosis (3/42; 7%). Complications, reoperations, revisions, and implant and patient survivorship, were recorded from chart review and data from the institutional total joint registry. Mean followup was 5 years (range, 2-15 years). RESULTS: Patient survivorship free of mortality was 91% (95% CI, 81%-100%) and 82% (95% CI, 68%-96%) at 2 and 5 years, respectively. Complications occurred in four of 42 THAs (10%); these complications included an intraoperative fracture and a venous thromboembolism. Revisions occurred in two of 42 (5%) THAs; there were no reoperations. Implant survivorship free of component revision for any reason or implant removal accounting for death as a competing risk was 93% (95% CI, 83%-100%) at 5 years. CONCLUSION: With appropriate medical evaluation and comanagement by transplant specialists, carefully selected patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplants may undergo elective primary THA, although complications do occur in this relatively fragile patient population.

Studies have demonstrated that altered expression of PLZF affected its biological functions associated with tumorigenesis, such as proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis. However, information regarding its regulation and possible function in the central nervous system diseases is still limited. In this study, we performed a neuroinflammatory model by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) lateral ventricle injection in adult rats and detected increased expression of PLZF in the brain cortex. Immunofluorescence assay indicated that PLZF was significantly increased in neurons 3 day after LPS injection, but not in astrocytes and microglia. Moreover, there was a concomitant upregulation of active caspase-3, cyclin D1, and CDK4 in vivo and vitro studies. In addition, the expression of these proteins in cortical primary neurons was inhibited after knocking down PLZF by siRNA. Collectively, all these results suggested that the upregulation of PLZF might be involved in neuronal apoptotic-like injury in neuroinflammation after LPS injection.","['He, Mingqing', 'Liu, Yonghua', 'Shen, Jiabing', 'Duan, Chengwei', 'Lu, Xiang']","['He M', 'Liu Y', 'Shen J', 'Duan C', 'Lu X']","['Department of Geriatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210011, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Geriatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, 226001, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Pathogen Biology Medical College, Nantong University, Nantong, 226001, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Neurology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, 226001, Jiangsu, China.', ""The second people's hospital of Nantong, Nantong, 226002, Jiangsu, China."", 'Department of Geriatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210011, Jiangsu, China. luxiang66@njmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160819,United States,Neurochem Res,Neurochemical research,7613461,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (ZBTB16 protein, rat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Inflammation/*chemically induced', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Transcriptional Activation/physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Lipopolysaccharide', '*Neuroinflammation', '*Neuronal apoptosis', '*PLZF', '*Rats']",2016/11/04 06:00,2017/04/06 06:00,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2016/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11064-016-2027-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s11064-016-2027-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Neurochem Res. 2016 Nov;41(11):3063-3073. doi: 10.1007/s11064-016-2027-5.

DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive study.. SETTING: A large urban hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana.. SAMPLE: 103 patients with AML and a subset of 41 patients aged 65 years or older. . METHODS: Demographics and medical information were extracted from electronic health records. Serum-fasting blood glucose was used to assess glycemic status. The association of hyperglycemia with the health outcomes was analyzed. A subset of patients aged 65 years or older was also analyzed.. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Hyperglycemia, age, and health outcomes in patients with AML.. FINDINGS: Forty patients experienced hyperglycemia during initial induction for AML. In the larger sample, no associations were noted between hyperglycemia and health outcomes. A significant relationship (p = 0.022) was noted between hyperglycemia and infection in patients aged 65 years or older. Patients aged 65 years or older had 5.6 times the risk of developing infection as those aged younger than 65 years. Although not statistically significant, patients aged 65 years or older with hyperglycemia had 2.5 more days of neutropenia and 1.5 days longer hospital length of stay. . CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that hyperglycemia is prevalent during initial induction for AML and may have harmful consequences, particularly for patients aged 65 years or older. More research is needed to determine clinically significant levels of hyperglycemia and their impact on health outcomes.. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Oncology nurses can assess and proactively collaborate with members of the healthcare team to implement strategies to prevent or mitigate the harmful consequences of hyperglycemia.","['Storey, Susan', 'Von Ah, Diane']","['Storey S', 'Von Ah D']","['Indiana University in Indianapolis.', 'Indiana University in Indianapolis.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*health outcomes', '*hospital length of stay', '*hyperglycemia', '*infection', '*neutropenic days']",2016/08/20 06:00,2017/12/05 06:00,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1188/16.ONF.595-601 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 2016 Sep 1;43(5):595-601. doi: 10.1188/16.ONF.595-601.,10.1188/16.ONF.595-601 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Menin has been reported to be a required cofactor for the leukemogenic activity of MLL fusion proteins. Thus, the disruption of the protein-protein interactions between menin and MLL represents a very promising strategy for curing MLL leukemia. Making use of menin-MLL inhibitors with a shape-based scaffold hopping approach, we have discovered that the antidiarrheal loperamide displays previously unreported mild inhibition for the menin-MLL interaction (IC50 = 69 +/- 3 muM). In an effort to repurpose this drug, a series of chemical modification analyses was performed, and three of the loperamide-based analogues, DC_YM21, DC_YM25 and DC_YM26 displayed better activities with IC50 values of 0.83 +/- 0.13 muM, 0.69 +/- 0.07 muM and 0.66 +/- 0.05 muM, respectively. Further treatment with DC_YM21 demonstrated potent and selective blockage of proliferation and induction of both cell cycle arrest and differentiation of leukemia cells harboring MLL translocations, which confirmed the specific mechanism of action. In conclusion, molecules of a novel scaffold targeting menin-MLL interactions were reported and they may serve as new potential therapeutic agents for MLL leukemia.","['Yue, Liyan', 'Du, Juanjuan', 'Ye, Fei', 'Chen, Zhifeng', 'Li, Lianchun', 'Lian, Fulin', 'Zhang, Bidong', 'Zhang, Yuanyuan', 'Jiang, Hualiang', 'Chen, Kaixian', 'Li, Yuanchao', 'Zhou, Bing', 'Zhang, Naixia', 'Yang, Yaxi', 'Luo, Cheng']","['Yue L', 'Du J', 'Ye F', 'Chen Z', 'Li L', 'Lian F', 'Zhang B', 'Zhang Y', 'Jiang H', 'Chen K', 'Li Y', 'Zhou B', 'Zhang N', 'Yang Y', 'Luo C']","['State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China. nxzhang@mail.shcnc.ac.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160819,England,Org Biomol Chem,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,101154995,"['0 (Antidiarrheals)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '6X9OC3H4II (Loperamide)']",IM,"['Antidiarrheals/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Loperamide/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Small Molecule Libraries/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,2016/08/20 06:00,2018/02/01 06:00,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c6ob01248e [doi]'],ppublish,Org Biomol Chem. 2016 Sep 28;14(36):8503-19. doi: 10.1039/c6ob01248e.

Potential side-effects regarding growth failure and bone metabolism have been reported but data are still scarce in pediatric CML. METHODS: Six chronic-phase CML children on IM treatment with a median age of 9.87 years (range, 5.33-12.67 years) were enrolled in the study. Growth, bone mineral density (BMD), bone parameters, 25(OH)-vitamin D3 (25-OHD3) and blood tests including parathyroid hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), IGF binding protein 3, thyroid function test and sex hormones were assessed. RESULTS: Median duration of IM treatment was 78.5 months. Height velocity was suppressed during the first 30 months of treatment and improved gradually afterwards. Two patients (33.3%) had decreased lumbar spine BMD z-scores (<1.5 SD). Patients with decreased BMD had higher mean IM exposure time than those with normal BMD. The majority of patients (n = 5) had low 25-OHD3 (<30 ng/mL), but there was no correlation between BMD and 25-OHD3 status. Other blood tests were normal. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports and confirms the need for monitoring the side-effects of IM treatment on growth, bone density and vitamin D status in pediatric CML. Prolonged IM treatment was associated with low BMD without disturbing bone parameters. There was high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency. Therefore, the beneficial effect of vitamin D supplement should be explored with regard to the effects on height velocity and BMD in CML patients with vitamin D insufficiency.","['Choeyprasert, Worawut', 'Yansomdet, Thitinun', 'Natesirinilkul, Rungrote', 'Wejaphikul, Karn', 'Charoenkwan, Pimlak']","['Choeyprasert W', 'Yansomdet T', 'Natesirinilkul R', 'Wejaphikul K', 'Charoenkwan P']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161121,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['adverse effect', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia']",2016/08/20 06:00,2017/10/05 06:00,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2016/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ped.13136 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2017 Mar;59(3):286-292. doi: 10.1111/ped.13136.

The anti-proliferative effects of lectins from varied sources have been extensively studied and in some cases, the underlying mechanism has been explored. Except for peanut agglutinin (PNA), the mitogenic effects of no other lectins have been studied in detail. In the present study, we have shown that jacalin, lectin purified from jackfruit (Artocarpus integrifolia) seeds act as a mitogen for K562, the Bcr-Abl expressing erythroleukemia cell line (K562) and the effect was found to be dose dependent. K562 cells remained in the proliferative state for a longer period even after the withdrawal of jacalin stimulation, thus jacalin was found to induce sustained mitogenic effect on K562 cells. Further, conditioned media from K562 cells treated with jacalin were observed to have the similar mitogenic effect even in the presence of galactose. Importantly, galactose which is a known ligand for jacalin will interact with functionally active jacalin present in the conditioned media and neutralise its effect. In addition, jacalin treatment also resulted in increased mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1beta, IL-6 and IFN-gamma. Our results indicate that jacalin induces secretion of soluble molecules, which maybe responsible for this observed increased proliferation of K562 cells.","['Lavanya, V', 'Ahmed, Neesar', 'Khan, Md Khurshid Alam', 'Jamal, Shazia']","['Lavanya V', 'Ahmed N', 'Khan MK', 'Jamal S']","['School of Life Sciences, B.

Ribosomal 6 kinase (RSK4) is a factor downstream of the MAPK/ERK pathway and an important tumor suppressor which inhibits ERK trafficking. Decrease in RSK4 expression has been reported in some malignancies, which leads to an increase in growth and proliferation and eventually poor prognosis. In this study we measured RSK4 expression rate in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was undertaken in 2013-2014 at Ghaem Hospital in Mashhad, Iran, on 40 AML patients and 10 non-AML patients as the control group. The expression rate was measured by real-time polymerase change reaction (PCR) and employing the DeltaDeltaCT method. Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney and Spearman tests using SPSS (version 11.5). RESULTS: Expression rate of RSK4 was significantly decreased in the AML group in comparison with the non-AML group (P<0.001). There was also a significant decrease in RSK4 expression in AML with t(15;17) in comparison to other translocations (P=0.004). CONCLUSION: We detected a down-regulation of RSK4 in AML patients. This may lead to an increase in the activity of the ERK/MPAK pathway and exacerbate leukemogenesis or the prognosis of the patients.","['Rafiee, Mohammad', 'Keramati, Mohammad Reza', 'Ayatollahi, Hosein', 'Sadeghian, Mohammad Hadi', 'Barzegar, Mohieddin', 'Asgharzadeh, Ali', 'Alinejad, Mohsen']","['Rafiee M', 'Keramati MR', 'Ayatollahi H', 'Sadeghian MH', 'Barzegar M', 'Asgharzadeh A', 'Alinejad M']","['Hematology Lab, Imam Reza Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Ghaem Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Ghaem Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Ghaem Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology Lab, Imam Reza Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology Lab, Imam Reza Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology Lab, Imam Reza Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160530,Iran,Cell J,Cell journal,101566618,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase', 'Gene Expression', 'Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase']",2016/08/20 06:00,2016/08/20 06:01,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2015/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22074/cellj.2016.4310 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell J. 2016 Jul-Sep;18(2):159-64. doi: 10.22074/cellj.2016.4310.

In this study, we investigated the correlation of S100A8 at the transcription level with clinical parameters in 91 de novo AML patients and explored its mechanisms of chemoresistance to etoposide in vitro. The transcription level of S100A8 was significantly lower at initial and relapse stages of AML samples than at complete remission (P<0.001) and than in the control group (P=0.0078), while no significant difference could be found between initial and relapse stages (P=0.257). Patients with high transcription levels of S100A8 exhibited a shorter overall survival (P=0.0012). HL-60 cells transfected with S100A8 showed resistance to etoposide with a higher level IC50 value and lower apoptosis rate compared with HL-60 cells transfected with empty vector. Thirty-six genes were significantly downregulated and 12 genes were significantly upregulated in S100A8 overexpression group compared with control group in which 360 genes involved in apoptotic genes array were performed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Among them, the caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax were verified by Western blot analysis which indicated that the role of S100A8 in resistance to chemotherapy was closely related with antiapoptosis. In conclusion, critical S100A8 provided useful clinical information in predicting the outcome of AML. The main mechanism of S100A8 which promoted chemoresistance was antiapoptosis.","['Yang, Xiao-Yan', 'Zhang, Ming-Ying', 'Zhou, Qi', 'Wu, Shui-Yan', 'Zhao, Ye', 'Gu, Wei-Ying', 'Pan, Jian', 'Cen, Jian-Nong', 'Chen, Zi-Xing', 'Guo, Wen-Ge', 'Chen, Chien-Shing', 'Yan, Wen-Hua', 'Hu, Shao-Yan']","['Yang XY', 'Zhang MY', 'Zhou Q', 'Wu SY', 'Zhao Y', 'Gu WY', 'Pan J', 'Cen JN', 'Chen ZX', 'Guo WG', 'Chen CS', 'Yan WH', 'Hu SY']","[""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University."", ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University."", ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University."", ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University."", 'Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou.', ""Department of Haematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University."", 'Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou.', 'Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou.', 'Department of Mathematical Sciences, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology and Biospecimen Laboratory, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', ""Department of Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160808,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'HL-60 cell', 'S100A8', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'antiapoptosis', 'drug resistance', 'overall survival', 'prognostic factor']",2016/08/20 06:00,2016/08/20 06:01,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S101594 [doi]', 'ott-9-4887 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2016 Aug 8;9:4887-99. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S101594. eCollection 2016.,10.2147/OTT.S101594 [doi],,,,,PMC4982505,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are known to occur with their use. This systematic review aimed to identify the most common and serious ADRs and to determine their relative risk levels. METHODS: A literature search of several databases; Embase, Medline, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and PubMed was performed to identify all studies where corticosteroids had been administered to paediatric patients ranging from 28 days to 18 years of age for at least 15 days of treatment. Each database was searched from their earliest dates to March 2014. All types of studies that provided clear information on ADRs were included. RESULTS: 91 relevant studies were found from 27 countries. These studies represented a total of 6653 children and contained reports of 4124 ADRs, the majority in patients with leukaemia, haemangioma and asthma. Oral prednisolone was the most commonly prescribed corticosteroid (74% of patients). The three most frequent ADRs were weight gain, Cushingoid features and growth retardation. The incidence rates of patients with these three ADRs were 22.4%, 20.6% and 18.9%, respectively. Increased susceptibility to infection was the most serious ADR. 24 children died from infections, ten from varicella zoster and the others from different microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: Weight gain, Cushingoid features and growth retardation were the most frequent ADRs seen when long-course oral corticosteroids were given to children. In addition, increased susceptibility to infection was the most common cause of mortality.","['Aljebab, Fahad', 'Choonara, Imti', 'Conroy, Sharon']","['Aljebab F', 'Choonara I', 'Conroy S']","['University of Nottingham.', 'University of Nottingham.', 'University of Nottingham.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Abstract', '*Oral']",2016/08/20 06:00,2016/08/20 06:01,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/20 06:01 [medline]']","['archdischild-2016-311535.57 [pii]', '10.1136/archdischild-2016-311535.57 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 2016 Sep;101(9):e2. doi: 10.1136/archdischild-2016-311535.57.,10.1136/archdischild-2016-311535.57 [doi],"['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

In children, there is no established treatment to prevent or delay progression to leukemia prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Azacitidine is a hypomethylating agent, which was shown to slow progression to leukemia in adults with myelodysplastic syndrome. There is little data on the efficacy of azacitidine in children. We reviewed 22 pediatric patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome from a single center, diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2015. Of those, eight patients received off-label azacitidine before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A total of 31 cycles were administered and modification or delay occurred in four of them due to cytopenias, infection, nausea/vomiting, and transient renal impairment. Bone marrow blast percentages in azacitidine-treated patients decreased significantly from a median of 15% (range 9-31%) at the start of treatment to 5.5% (0-12%, P=0.02) before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Following azacitidine treatment, four patients (50%) achieved marrow remission, and none progressed. In contrast, three untreated patients (21.4%) had progressive disease characterized by >50% increase in blast counts or progression to leukemia. Azacitidine-treated patients had significantly increased 4-year event-free survival (P=0.04); predicted 4-year overall survival was 100% versus 69.3% in untreated patients (P=0.1). In summary, azacitidine treatment prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was well tolerated in pediatric patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome, led to partial or complete bone marrow response in seven of eight patients (87.5%), and correlated with superior event-free survival in this cohort.","['Waespe, Nicolas', 'Van Den Akker, Machiel', 'Klaassen, Robert J', 'Lieberman, Lani', 'Irwin, Meredith S', 'Ali, Salah S', 'Abdelhaleem, Mohamed', 'Zlateska, Bozana', 'Liebman, Mira', 'Cada, Michaela', 'Schechter, Tal', 'Dror, Yigal']","['Waespe N', 'Van Den Akker M', 'Klaassen RJ', 'Lieberman L', 'Irwin MS', 'Ali SS', 'Abdelhaleem M', 'Zlateska B', 'Liebman M', 'Cada M', 'Schechter T', 'Dror Y']","['Marrow Failure and Myelodysplasia Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Genetics and Genome Biology Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Marrow Failure and Myelodysplasia Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, UZ Brussel, Jette, Belgium.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Canada."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatric Laboratory Medicine, Division of Hematopathology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Marrow Failure and Myelodysplasia Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Genetics and Genome Biology Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Marrow Failure and Myelodysplasia Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Marrow Failure and Myelodysplasia Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Marrow Failure and Myelodysplasia Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada yigal.dror@sickkids.ca.', 'Genetics and Genome Biology Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160818,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Preoperative Care', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/08/20 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2016/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.145821 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.145821 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Dec;101(12):1508-1515. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.145821.

Patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission in whom minimal residual disease was assessed at transplantation were included and categorized according to the European LeukemiaNet classification. The primary outcome was 1-year relapse incidence after transplantation. Of 152 patients eligible, 48 had minimal residual disease at the time of their transplant. Minimal residual disease-positive patients were older, required more therapy to achieve first remission, were more likely to have incomplete recovery of blood counts and had more adverse risk features by cytogenetics. Relapse incidence at 1 year was higher in patients with minimal residual disease (32.6% versus 14.4%, P=0.002). Leukemia-free survival (43.6% versus 64%, P=0.007) and overall survival (48.8% versus 66.9%, P=0.008) rates were also inferior in patients with minimal residual disease. In multivariable analysis, minimal residual disease status at transplantation independently predicted 1-year relapse incidence, identifying a subgroup of intermediate-risk patients, according to the European LeukemiaNet classification, with a particularly poor outcome. Assessment of minimal residual disease at transplantation in combination with cytogenetic and molecular findings provides powerful independent prognostic information in acute myeloid leukemia, lending support to the incorporation of minimal residual disease detection to refine risk stratification and develop a more individualized approach during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Oran, Betul', 'Jorgensen, Jeff L', 'Marin, David', 'Wang, Sa', 'Ahmed, Sairah', 'Alousi, Amin M', 'Andersson, Borje S', 'Bashir, Qaiser', 'Bassett, Roland', 'Lyons, Genevieve', 'Chen, Julianne', 'Rezvani, Katy', 'Popat, Uday', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Patel, Keyur', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Champlin, Richard E']","['Oran B', 'Jorgensen JL', 'Marin D', 'Wang S', 'Ahmed S', 'Alousi AM', 'Andersson BS', 'Bashir Q', 'Bassett R', 'Lyons G', 'Chen J', 'Rezvani K', 'Popat U', 'Kebriaei P', 'Patel K', 'Rondon G', 'Shpall EJ', 'Champlin RE']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA boran@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department Biostatistics, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department Biostatistics, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160818,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/08/20 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2016/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.144253 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.144253 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Jan;102(1):110-117. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.144253.

A frequent concomitant event is the loss of the residual ETV6 allele suggesting a critical role for the ETV6 transcriptional repressor in the etiology of this cancer. However, the precise mechanism through which loss of functional ETV6 contributes to disease pathogenesis is still unclear. To investigate the impact of ETV6 loss on the transcriptional network and to identify new transcriptional targets of ETV6, we used whole transcriptome analysis of both pre-B leukemic cell lines and patients combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation. Using this integrative approach, we identified 4 novel direct ETV6 target genes: CLIC5, BIRC7, ANGPTL2 and WBP1L To further evaluate the role of chloride intracellular channel protein CLIC5 in leukemogenesis, we generated cell lines overexpressing CLIC5 and demonstrated an increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. We further described the implications of CLIC5's ion channel activity in lysosomal-mediated cell death, possibly by modulating the function of the transferrin receptor with which it colocalizes intracellularly. For the first time, we showed that loss of ETV6 leads to significant overexpression of CLIC5, which in turn leads to decreased lysosome-mediated apoptosis. Our data suggest that heightened CLIC5 activity could promote a permissive environment for oxidative stress-induced DNA damage accumulation, and thereby contribute to leukemogenesis.","['Neveu, Benjamin', 'Spinella, Jean-Francois', 'Richer, Chantal', 'Lagace, Karine', 'Cassart, Pauline', 'Lajoie, Mathieu', 'Jananji, Silvana', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Healy, Jasmine', 'Hickson, Gilles R X', 'Sinnett, Daniel']","['Neveu B', 'Spinella JF', 'Richer C', 'Lagace K', 'Cassart P', 'Lajoie M', 'Jananji S', 'Drouin S', 'Healy J', 'Hickson GR', 'Sinnett D']","['CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Molecular biology program, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Canada daniel.sinnett@umontreal.ca.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160818,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CLIC5 protein, human)', '0 (Chloride Channels)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chloride Channels/*genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Microfilament Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2016/08/20 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2016/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.149740 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.149740 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Dec;101(12):1534-1543. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.149740.

These included failure to achieve complete remission after one cycle of induction chemotherapy (RES), less than a 50% reduction in blast numbers with >15% residual blasts after one cycle of induction chemotherapy (REF1) and failure to achieve complete remission after two courses of induction chemotherapy (REF2). 5-year overall survival was decreased in patients fulfilling any criteria for refractory disease, compared with patients achieving a complete remission after one cycle of induction chemotherapy: 9% and 8% in patients with REF1 and REF2 versus 40% (P<0.0001).

Here, we reveal that pro-cell death lipid ceramide generation is suppressed by FLT3-ITD signaling. Molecular or pharmacologic inhibition of FLT3-ITD reactivated ceramide synthesis, selectively inducing mitophagy and AML cell death. Mechanistically, FLT3-ITD targeting induced ceramide accumulation on the outer mitochondrial membrane, which then directly bound autophagy-inducing light chain 3 (LC3), involving its I35 and F52 residues, to recruit autophagosomes for execution of lethal mitophagy. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of LC3 prevented AML cell death in response to FLT3-ITD inhibition by crenolanib, which was restored by wild-type (WT)-LC3, but not mutants of LC3 with altered ceramide binding (I35A-LC3 or F52A-LC3). Mitochondrial ceramide accumulation and lethal mitophagy induction in response to FLT3-ITD targeting was mediated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) activation via inhibition of protein kinase A-regulated S637 phosphorylation, resulting in mitochondrial fission. Inhibition of Drp1 prevented ceramide-dependent lethal mitophagy, and reconstitution of WT-Drp1 or phospho-null S637A-Drp1 but not its inactive phospho-mimic mutant (S637D-Drp1), restored mitochondrial fission and mitophagy in response to crenolanib in FLT3-ITD(+) AML cells expressing stable shRNA against endogenous Drp1. Moreover, activating FLT3-ITD signaling in crenolanib-resistant AML cells suppressed ceramide-dependent mitophagy and prevented cell death. FLT3-ITD(+) AML drug resistance is attenuated by LCL-461, a mitochondria-targeted ceramide analog drug, in vivo, which also induced lethal mitophagy in human AML blasts with clinically relevant FLT3 mutations. Thus, these data reveal a novel mechanism which regulates AML cell death by ceramide-dependent mitophagy in response to FLT3-ITD targeting.","['Dany, Mohammed', 'Gencer, Salih', 'Nganga, Rose', 'Thomas, Raquela J', 'Oleinik, Natalia', 'Baron, Kyla D', 'Szulc, Zdzislaw M', 'Ruvolo, Peter', 'Kornblau, Steven', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Ogretmen, Besim']","['Dany M', 'Gencer S', 'Nganga R', 'Thomas RJ', 'Oleinik N', 'Baron KD', 'Szulc ZM', 'Ruvolo P', 'Kornblau S', 'Andreeff M', 'Ogretmen B']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC; and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC; and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC; and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC; and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC; and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC; and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC; and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160818,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.5.5 (DNM1L protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.5 (Dynamins)', 'LQF7I567TQ (crenolanib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', '*Ceramides/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Dynamins', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Mitophagy/drug effects/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', '*fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/08/20 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2016/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)34053-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-04-708750 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Oct 13;128(15):1944-1958. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-04-708750.

These early-responding, pro-inflammatory macrophages play an essential role in the amplification of inflammation. However, macrophage pro-inflammatory gene expression should be tightly regulated to avert host tissue damage. In this study, we identify the Kruppel-like transcription factor 6 (KLF6)-B cell leukemia/lymphoma 6 (BCL6) signaling axis as a novel regulator of macrophage inflammatory gene expression and function. Utilizing complementary gain- and loss-of-function studies, we observed that KLF6 is essential for macrophage motility under ex vivo and in vivo conditions. Concordant with these observations, myeloid-specific deficiency of KLF6 significantly attenuates macrophage pro-inflammatory gene expression, recruitment, and progression of inflammation. At the molecular level, KLF6 suppresses BCL6 mRNA and protein expression by elevating PR domain-containing 1 with ZNF domain (PRDM1) levels in macrophages. Interestingly, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of BCL6 in KLF6-deficient macrophages completely abrogated the attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression and cellular motility. Collectively, our observations reveal that KLF6 repress BCL6 to enhance macrophage inflammatory gene expression and function.","['Kim, Gun-Dong', 'Das, Riku', 'Goduni, Lediana', 'McClellan, Sharon', 'Hazlett, Linda D', 'Mahabeleshwar, Ganapati H']","['Kim GD', 'Das R', 'Goduni L', 'McClellan S', 'Hazlett LD', 'Mahabeleshwar GH']","['From the Departments of Medicine.', 'the Department of Molecular Cardiology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, and.', 'From the Departments of Medicine.', 'the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201.', 'the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201.', 'From the Departments of Medicine, Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, ghm4@case.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160818,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Bcl6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Klf6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 6)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Prdm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Inflammation/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 6', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Kruppel-like factor (KLF)', '*host defense', '*inflammation', '*macrophage', '*vascular biology']",2016/08/20 06:00,2017/05/20 06:00,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2016/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)35901-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.738617 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Sep 30;291(40):21271-21282. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.738617.

Human OSM (hOSM) and murine LIF (mLIF) act in mouse cells via a LIF receptor (LIFR)-glycoprotein 130 (gp130) heterodimer. In contrast, murine OSM (mOSM) signals mainly via an OSM receptor (OSMR)-gp130 heterodimer and binds with only very low affinity to mLIFR. hOSM and mLIF stimulate bone remodeling by both reducing osteocytic sclerostin and up-regulating the pro-osteoclastic factor receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) in osteoblasts. In the absence of OSMR, mOSM still strongly suppressed sclerostin and stimulated bone formation but did not induce RANKL, suggesting that intracellular signaling activated by the low affinity interaction of mOSM with mLIFR is different from the downstream effects when mLIF or hOSM interacts with the same receptor. Both STAT1 and STAT3 were activated by mOSM in wild type cells or by mLIF/hOSM in wild type and Osmr(-/-) cells. In contrast, in Osmr(-/-) primary osteocyte-like cells stimulated with mOSM (therefore acting through mLIFR), microarray expression profiling and Western blotting analysis identified preferential phosphorylation of STAT3 and induction of its target genes but not of STAT1 and its target genes; this correlated with reduced phosphorylation of both gp130 and LIFR. In a mouse model of spontaneous osteopenia caused by hyperactivation of STAT1/3 signaling downstream of gp130 (gp130(Y757F/Y757F)), STAT1 deletion rescued the osteopenic phenotype, indicating a beneficial effect of promoting STAT3 signaling over STAT1 downstream of gp130 in this low bone mass condition, and this may have therapeutic value.","['Walker, Emma C', 'Johnson, Rachelle W', 'Hu, Yifang', 'Brennan, Holly J', 'Poulton, Ingrid J', 'Zhang, Jian-Guo', 'Jenkins, Brendan J', 'Smyth, Gordon K', 'Nicola, Nicos A', 'Sims, Natalie A']","['Walker EC', 'Johnson RW', 'Hu Y', 'Brennan HJ', 'Poulton IJ', 'Zhang JG', 'Jenkins BJ', 'Smyth GK', 'Nicola NA', 'Sims NA']","[""From the St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, Fitzroy, Victoria 3065, Australia."", ""From the St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, Fitzroy, Victoria 3065, Australia."", 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.', ""From the St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, Fitzroy, Victoria 3065, Australia."", ""From the St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, Fitzroy, Victoria 3065, Australia."", 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.', 'Medical Biology, and.', 'Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, Victoria 3168, Australia.', 'Department of Molecular Translational Science, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University, Clayton 3168, Victoria, Australia, and.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.', 'Departments of Mathematics and Statistics.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.', 'Medical Biology, and.', ""From the St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, Fitzroy, Victoria 3065, Australia, nsims@svi.edu.au."", ""Medicine at St. Vincent's Hospital, The University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160818,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncostatin M Receptor beta Subunit)', '0 (Osmr protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Bone and Bones/metabolism/pathology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncostatin M Receptor beta Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Organ Size', 'Osteocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/genetics', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*STAT3', '*cytokine', '*glycoprotein 130', '*leukemia inhibitory factor', '*oncostatin M', '*osteoblast', '*osteocyte', '*signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1)']",2016/08/20 06:00,2017/05/20 06:00,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2016/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)35850-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.748483 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Oct 7;291(41):21703-21716. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.748483.

Finally, based on the gill rot morbidity, ACP activity and PC content, the optimal levels of dietary protein for grass carp were estimated to be 286.65 g kg(-1) diet (253.73 g digestible protein kg(-1) diet), 290.46 g kg(-1) diet (257.76 g digestible protein kg(-1) diet) and 296.25 g kg(-1) diet (260.69 g digestible protein kg(-1) diet), respectively.","['Xu, Jing', 'Feng, Lin', 'Jiang, Wei-Dan', 'Wu, Pei', 'Liu, Yang', 'Jiang, Jun', 'Kuang, Sheng-Yao', 'Tang, Ling', 'Tang, Wu-Neng', 'Zhang, Yong-An', 'Zhou, Xiao-Qiu']","['Xu J', 'Feng L', 'Jiang WD', 'Wu P', 'Liu Y', 'Jiang J', 'Kuang SY', 'Tang L', 'Tang WN', 'Zhang YA', 'Zhou XQ']","['Animal Nutrition Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China.', 'Animal Nutrition Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China; Fish Nutrition and Safety Production University Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China; Key Laboratory for Animal Disease-Resistance Nutrition of China Ministry of Education, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China.', 'Animal Nutrition Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China; Fish Nutrition and Safety Production University Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China; Key Laboratory for Animal Disease-Resistance Nutrition of China Ministry of Education, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China.', 'Animal Nutrition Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China; Fish Nutrition and Safety Production University Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China; Key Laboratory for Animal Disease-Resistance Nutrition of China Ministry of Education, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China.', 'Animal Nutrition Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China; Fish Nutrition and Safety Production University Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China; Key Laboratory for Animal Disease-Resistance Nutrition of China Ministry of Education, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China.', 'Animal Nutrition Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China; Fish Nutrition and Safety Production University Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China; Key Laboratory for Animal Disease-Resistance Nutrition of China Ministry of Education, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China.', 'Animal Nutrition Institute, Sichuan Academy of Animal Science, Chengdu 610066, China.', 'Animal Nutrition Institute, Sichuan Academy of Animal Science, Chengdu 610066, China.', 'Animal Nutrition Institute, Sichuan Academy of Animal Science, Chengdu 610066, China.', 'Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China.', 'Animal Nutrition Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China; Fish Nutrition and Safety Production University Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China; Key Laboratory for Animal Disease-Resistance Nutrition of China Ministry of Education, Sichuan Agricultural University, Sichuan, Chengdu 611130, China.

We compared the outcome of a cladribine- versus a fludarabine-based regimen as induction chemotherapy for R/R-AML. We included patients with R/R-AML who were treated with a cladribine- or fludarabine-based chemotherapy between 2006 and 2015. We analysed 120 patients, 65 treated with cladribine and 55 treated with fludarabine. The CR rates were 62.7 and 61.4 % for the cladribine group and fludarabine group, respectively (p = 0.890). Poor prognostic factors included older age, secondary AML, poor cytogenetic risk group, prior induction failure, and short first CR duration. No significant overall survival (OS) or relapse-free survival (RFS) differences were found between the groups (OS, p = 0.213; RFS, p = 0.143). However, in a certain subset, survival outcomes were better with cladribine than with fludarabine, including de novo AML, CR at first induction therapy, and not-poor cytogenetic risk group inclusion without overt chemotherapy-refractoriness. By contrast, secondary AML patients had improved survival outcomes when treated with the fludarabine regimen. After CR, better outcomes were observed when allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) was given as consolidation. In R/R-AML, cladribine- and fludarabine-based combination induction chemotherapy had differential survival outcomes according to disease characteristics. Allogeneic SCT after CR with a purine analogue-based regimen improved long-term outcome in these patients.","['Park, Hyunkyung', 'Youk, Jeonghwan', 'Kim, Inho', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Park, Seonyang', 'Lee, Jeong-Ok', 'Bang, Soo-Mee', 'Koh, Youngil']","['Park H', 'Youk J', 'Kim I', 'Yoon SS', 'Park S', 'Lee JO', 'Bang SM', 'Koh Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, 101 Daehag-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 110-744, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, 101 Daehag-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 110-744, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, 101 Daehag-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 110-744, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, College of Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, 101 Daehag-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 110-744, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, College of Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, 101 Daehag-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 110-744, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, College of Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, 101 Daehag-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 110-744, Republic of Korea. go01@snu.ac.kr.', 'Cancer Research Institute, College of Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea. go01@snu.ac.kr.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea. go01@snu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20160819,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'CLAG protocol', 'FLAG protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allografts', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukaemia', 'Cladribine', 'Fludarabine', 'Refractory', 'Relapsed']",2016/08/20 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2015/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2774-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2774-z [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Oct;95(11):1777-86. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2774-z.

Burden from physical symptoms has been associated with depression, anxiety, and stress in cancer patients. Additionally, patient factors, i.e., individual differences, have been associated with worse psychological outcomes. There are few psychological studies of CLL, with no examination of individual differences. A cross-sectional design studied the covariation of symptom burden with depressive and anxiety symptoms and cancer-specific stress, and tested patients' individual differences as predictors and as moderators. CLL patients (N = 112) receiving active surveillance participated. They were Caucasian (100 %) and predominately male (55 %) with a mean age of 61; most (62.5 %) had stage 0 disease. A composite measure of physical symptom burden (CLL symptoms, fatigue, pain, impaired functional status) was tested as a predictor of psychological responses. Individual differences in psychiatric history and social support were tested as moderators. Using multiple linear regression, greater symptom burden covaried with higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms and cancer stress (ps < .05). Those with a psychiatric history, low social support, and low relationship satisfaction with one's partner reported greater symptom burden and more psychological symptoms and stress (ps < .05). Findings suggest that CLL patients in surveillance with a psychiatric history and/or low social support are at risk for greater distress when coping with high symptom burden. These new data clarify the experience of CLL surveillance and identify characteristics of patients with heightened risk for symptom burden, stress, and anxiety or depressive symptoms.","['Morrison, Eleshia J', 'Flynn, Joseph M', 'Jones, Jeffrey', 'Byrd, John C', 'Andersen, Barbara L']","['Morrison EJ', 'Flynn JM', 'Jones J', 'Byrd JC', 'Andersen BL']","['Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA. morrison.eleshia@mayo.edu.', 'Norton Cancer Institute, 234 E Gray St, Louisville, KY, 40202, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Starling Loving Hall, 320 W 10th Avenue, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Starling Loving Hall, 320 W 10th Avenue, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, The Ohio State University, 1835 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160819,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Cost of Illness', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Individuality', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stress, Psychological/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*psychology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Active surveillance', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Individual differences', 'Physical symptom burden', 'Psychological responses']",2016/11/04 06:00,2017/01/28 06:00,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2016/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2790-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2790-z [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Dec;95(12):1989-1997. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2790-z.

Couzin-Frankel in Science 342:1432-1433, 2013). It is less well recognized and appreciated that individualized T cell immunotherapy of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is approaching clinical application for preventing CMV organ manifestations, interstitial CMV pneumonia in particular. This coincident medical development is particularly interesting as reactivated CMV infection is a major viral complication in the state of transient immunodeficiency after the therapy of hematopoietic malignancies by hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). It may thus be attractive to combine T cell immunotherapy of 'minimal residual disease/leukemia (MRD)' and CMV-specific T cell immunotherapy to combat both risks in HCT recipients simultaneously, and ideally with T cells derived from the respective HLA-matched HCT donor. Although clinical trials of human CMV-specific T cell immunotherapy were promising in that the incidence of virus reactivation and disease was found to be reduced with statistical significance, animal models are still instrumental for providing 'proof of concept' by directly documenting the prevention of viral multiple-organ histopathology and organ failure under controlled conditions of the absence versus presence of the therapy, which obviously is not feasible in an individual human patient. Further, animal models can make predictions regarding parameters that determine the efficacy of T cell immunotherapy for improved study design in clinical investigations, and they allow for manipulating host and virus genetics. The latter is of particular value as it opens the possibility for epitope specificity controls that are inherently missing in clinical trials. Here, we review a recently developed new mouse model that is more approximated to human CMV-specific T cell immunotherapy by 'humanizing' antigen presentation using antigenically chimeric CMV and HLA-transgenic mice to allow for an in vivo testing of the antiviral function of human CMV-specific T cells. As an important new message, this model predicts that T cell immunotherapy is most efficient if CD4 T cells are equipped with a transduced TCR directed against an epitope presented by MHC/HLA class-I for local delivery of 'cognate' help to CD8 effector T cells at infected MHC/HLA class-II-negative host tissue cells.","['Lemmermann, Niels A W', 'Reddehase, Matthias J']","['Lemmermann NA', 'Reddehase MJ']","['Institute for Virology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, Obere Zahlbacher Strasse 67, Hochhaus am Augustusplatz, 55131, Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology and Research Center for Immunotherapy, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, Obere Zahlbacher Strasse 67, Hochhaus am Augustusplatz, 55131, Mainz, Germany.

Moreover, the primitive stem cell clone that originates the indolent CML chronic phase (CP) remains almost invariant as the disease evolves to a fatal blast crisis (BC). Compared to their healthy counterpart, the most dormant BCR-ABL+ CICs show the tendency to remain in a somewhat unusual 'proliferative quiescence', i.e. a prolonged low-energy viable state that restrains the frequency of symmetrical (self-renewing) cell divisions while enforcing cell cycle entry and myeloid commitment under cytokine support. Over the past few years, we and others have proposed the nutrient-sensing protein serine/threonine kinase GSK3beta. (glycogen synthase kinase 3beta) as an attractive target to eradicate leukemia-initiating cells while sparing normal haematopoiesis. Beyond its natural negative effects on self-renewal, through the inhibitory phosphorylation of beta-Catenin (Wnt signalling) and c-MYC (Hedgehog signalling), hyperactive GSK3beta is reportedly crucial to link energy metabolism and nutrient availability to stem cell homeostasis processes. This review will integrate current evidence pertaining to the biological relevance of GSK3beta in normal and malignant haematopoiesis, with particular emphasis on its role(s) at the CML CP stage and BC transformation. Preclinical evidence earmarking the use of novel small-molecule inhibitors of GSK3beta as promsing anti-leukemia agents are also discussed.","['Saponaro, Concetta', 'Maffia, Michele', 'Di Renzo, Nicola', 'Coluccia, Addolorata Maria Luce']","['Saponaro C', 'Maffia M', 'Di Renzo N', 'Coluccia AM']","['Clinical Proteomics Laboratory, Polo Oncologico ""Giovanni Paolo II"", Ospedale ""Vito Fazzi"" ASL (LE) - University of Salento, Lecce, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,"['0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Self Renewal/drug effects', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCRABL', '*Chronic myelogenous leukemia', '*GSK3beta', '*hematopoietic stem cells', '*leukemia-initiating cells', '*self-renewal', '*therapy resistance.']",2016/08/20 06:00,2017/09/15 06:00,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2015/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.2174/1389450117666160817151723 [doi]', 'CDT-EPUB-77847 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2017;18(4):396-404. doi: 10.2174/1389450117666160817151723.,10.2174/1389450117666160817151723 [doi],"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Malignant growth of KSHV-infected B cells requires the activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, which controls maintenance of viral latency and suppression of the viral lytic program. Here we show that the KSHV proteins K13 and K15 promote NF-kappaB activation via the protease mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein-1 (MALT1), a key driver of NF-kappaB activation in lymphocytes. Inhibition of the MALT1 protease activity induced a switch from the latent to the lytic stage of viral infection, and led to reduced growth and survival of PEL cell lines in vitro and in a xenograft model. These results demonstrate a key role for the proteolytic activity of MALT1 in PEL, and provide a rationale for the pharmacological targeting of MALT1 in PEL therapy.","['Bonsignore, L', 'Passelli, K', 'Pelzer, C', 'Perroud, M', 'Konrad, A', 'Thurau, M', 'Sturzl, M', 'Dai, L', 'Trillo-Tinoco, J', 'Del Valle, L', 'Qin, Z', 'Thome, M']","['Bonsignore L', 'Passelli K', 'Pelzer C', 'Perroud M', 'Konrad A', 'Thurau M', 'Sturzl M', 'Dai L', 'Trillo-Tinoco J', 'Del Valle L', 'Qin Z', 'Thome M']","['Department of Biochemistry, Center of Immunity and Infection, University of Lausanne, Epalinges, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Center of Immunity and Infection, University of Lausanne, Epalinges, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Center of Immunity and Infection, University of Lausanne, Epalinges, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Center of Immunity and Infection, University of Lausanne, Epalinges, Switzerland.', 'Division of Molecular and Experimental Surgery, University Medical Center Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Translational Research Center, CIIL Biomedical Research Center, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular and Experimental Surgery, University Medical Center Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Translational Research Center, CIIL Biomedical Research Center, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular and Experimental Surgery, University Medical Center Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Translational Research Center, CIIL Biomedical Research Center, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology & Parasitology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Louisiana Cancer Research Center, New Orleans, LA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Research Center for Translational Medicine and Key Laboratory of Arrhythmias, East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Louisiana Cancer Research Center, New Orleans, LA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Louisiana Cancer Research Center, New Orleans, LA, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology & Parasitology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Louisiana Cancer Research Center, New Orleans, LA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Research Center for Translational Medicine and Key Laboratory of Arrhythmias, East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Center of Immunity and Infection, University of Lausanne, Epalinges, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160819,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (MALT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Caspases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Silencing', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*complications/*virology', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/*physiology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Primary Effusion/*etiology/*pathology', 'Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Activation', '*Virus Latency', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2016/08/20 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2016/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016239 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.239 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Mar;31(3):614-624. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.239.

This includes constitutive high-level activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), activator protein-1 (AP-1) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) transcription factors (TFs) that are physiologically only transiently activated. Here, we demonstrate that inactivation of the putative ubiquitin E3-ligase PDLIM2 contributes to this TF activation. PDLIM2 expression is lost at the mRNA and protein levels in the majority of cHL cell lines and Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of nearly all cHL primary samples. This loss is associated with PDLIM2 genomic alterations, promoter methylation and altered splicing. Reconstitution of PDLIM2 in HRS cell lines inhibits proliferation, blocks NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and contributes to cHL-specific gene expression. In non-Hodgkin B-cell lines, small interfering RNA-mediated PDLIM2 knockdown results in superactivation of TFs NF-kappaB and AP-1 following phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation. Furthermore, expression of PDLIM2 is lost in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) that shares key biological aspects with cHL. We conclude that inactivation of PDLIM2 is a recurrent finding in cHL and ALCL, promotes activation of inflammatory signaling pathways and thereby contributes to their pathogenesis.","['Wurster, K D', 'Hummel, F', 'Richter, J', 'Giefing, M', 'Hartmann, S', 'Hansmann, M-L', 'Kreher, S', 'Kochert, K', 'Krappmann, D', 'Klapper, W', 'Hummel, M', 'Wenzel, S-S', 'Lenz, G', 'Janz, M', 'Dorken, B', 'Siebert, R', 'Mathas, S']","['Wurster KD', 'Hummel F', 'Richter J', 'Giefing M', 'Hartmann S', 'Hansmann ML', 'Kreher S', 'Kochert K', 'Krappmann D', 'Klapper W', 'Hummel M', 'Wenzel SS', 'Lenz G', 'Janz M', 'Dorken B', 'Siebert R', 'Mathas S']","['Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Dr Senckenberg Institute of Pathology, University of Frankfurt, Medical School, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Dr Senckenberg Institute of Pathology, University of Frankfurt, Medical School, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Research Unit Cellular Signal Integration, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen fur Gesundheit und Umwelt, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Haematopathology Section and Lymph Node Registry, Christian-Albrechts University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Charite-Universitatsmedzin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Division of Translational Oncology, Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Munster, and Cluster of Excellence EXC 1003, Cells in Motion, Munster, Germany.', 'Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160819,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (PDLIM2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA Splice Sites)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Loci', 'Hodgkin Disease/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Microfilament Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteolysis', 'RNA Splice Sites', 'Transcription Factors', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",,,2016/08/20 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2016/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016238 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.238 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Mar;31(3):602-613. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.238.

We found that oxytocin receptor (OTR) was expressed in colonic mast cells in humans and rats, as well as in human mast cell line-1 (HMC-1), rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-2H3) and mouse mastocytoma cell line (P815). OT decreased 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced visceral hypersensitivity, colonic mast cell degranulation and histamine release after mast cell degranulation in rats. Also, OT attenuated the compound 48/80 (C48/80)-evoked histamine release in P815 cells and inward currents, responsible for the mast cell degranulation, in HMC-1, RBL-2H3 and P815 cells. Moreover, these protective effects of OT against visceral hypersensitivity and mast cell degranulation were eliminated by coadministration of OTR antagonist atosiban or a nonselective inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), NG-Methyl-L-arginine acetate salt (L-NMMA). Notably, OT evoked a concentration-dependent increase of intracellular Ca(2+) in HMC-1, RBL-2H3 and P815 cells, which was responsible for the activation of neuronal NOS (NOS1) and endothelial NOS (NOS3). Our findings strongly suggest that OT might exert the antinociception on colonic hypersensitivity through inhibition of mast cell degranulation via Ca(2+)-NOS pathway.","['Gong, Liping', 'Li, Jing', 'Tang, Yan', 'Han, Ting', 'Wei, Chuanfei', 'Yu, Xiao', 'Li, Jingxin', 'Wang, Rong', 'Ma, Xuelian', 'Liu, Kejing', 'Geng, Lingyun', 'Liu, Shaozhuang', 'Yan, Bing', 'Liu, Chuanyong']","['Gong L', 'Li J', 'Tang Y', 'Han T', 'Wei C', 'Yu X', 'Li J', 'Wang R', 'Ma X', 'Liu K', 'Geng L', 'Liu S', 'Yan B', 'Liu C']","['Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Shandong University, China.', 'Central Hospital of Zibo, Zibo, China.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Shandong University, China.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Shandong University, China.', ""Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, China."", 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Shandong University, China.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Shandong University, China.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Shandong University, China.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Shandong University, China.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Shandong University, China.', 'Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Shandong University, China.', 'Provincial Key Lab of Mental Disorder, School of Medicine, Shandong University, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160819,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Analgesics)', '0 (Receptors, Oxytocin)', '081D12SI0Z (atosiban)', '27JT06E6GR (omega-N-Methylarginine)', '50-56-6 (Oxytocin)', '8T3HQG2ZC4 (Trinitrobenzenesulfonic Acid)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'W6S6URY8OF (Vasotocin)']",IM,"['Analgesics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Colitis/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Colon/cytology/pathology', 'Evoked Potentials/drug effects', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Oxytocin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, Oxytocin/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Trinitrobenzenesulfonic Acid/toxicity', 'Vasotocin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'omega-N-Methylarginine/pharmacology']",,,2016/08/20 06:00,2018/05/15 06:00,['2016/08/20 06:00'],"['2016/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['srep31452 [pii]', '10.1038/srep31452 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Aug 19;6:31452. doi: 10.1038/srep31452.,10.1038/srep31452 [doi],,,,,PMC4990927,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some patients with unexplained persistent cytopenias may not meet minimal diagnostic criteria for MDS but an alternate diagnosis is not apparent; the term idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS) has been used to describe this state. MDS and AML occur primarily in older patients who are often treated outside the clinical trial setting. Consequently, our understanding of the patterns of diagnostic evaluation, management, and outcomes of these patients is limited. Furthermore, there are few natural history studies of ICUS. To better understand how patients who have MDS, ICUS, or AML are managed in the routine clinical setting, the Connect MDS/AML Disease Registry, a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study of patients newly diagnosed with these conditions has been initiated. METHODS/DESIGN: The Connect MDS/AML Disease Registry will capture diagnosis, risk assessment, treatment, and outcomes data for approximately 1500 newly diagnosed patients from approximately 150 community and academic sites in the United States in 4 cohorts: (1) lower-risk MDS (International Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS] low and intermediate-1 risk), with and without del(5q); (2) higher-risk MDS (IPSS intermediate-2 and high risk); (3) ICUS; and (4) AML in patients aged >/= 55 years (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia). Diagnosis will be confirmed by central review. Baseline patient characteristics, diagnostic patterns, treatment patterns, clinical outcomes, health economics outcomes, and patient-reported health-related quality of life will be entered into an electronic data capture system at enrollment and quarterly for 8 years. A tissue substudy to explore the relationship between karyotypes, molecular markers, and clinical outcomes will be conducted, and is optional for patients. DISCUSSION: The Connect MDS/AML Disease Registry will be the first prospective, observational, non-interventional study in the United States to collect clinical information, patient-reported outcomes, and tissue samples from patients with MDS, ICUS, or AML receiving multiple therapies. Results from this registry may provide new insights into the relationship between diagnostic practices, treatment regimens, and outcomes in patients with these diseases and identify areas for future investigation.

Cellular morphologic features such as cytoplasmic membrane blebs, a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, and nuclear indentations and irregularities and large nucleoli, as well as immunocytochemistry for CD3 and CD79, myeloperoxidase cytochemistry, and clonality testing were not conclusive for myeloid or lymphoid origin. Marked alkaline hyperphosphatasemia was present at the first visit (2783.0 U/L; RI 6-80.0 U/L), followed by a 5-fold increase (14,000 U/L) a week later, identified as being mostly contributed by the bone-ALP isoform (11,062 U/L; RI 0-30 U/L). In addition, the atypical leukocytes were strongly positive for cytoplasmic ALP activity. In vitro lysis of a heparin blood sample resulted in a 1.7-fold increase of ALP activity, supporting the origin of the hyperphosphatasemia at least in part from the leukemic cell population. To the authors' knowledge, this is a unique case of alkaline hyperphosphatasemia, due at least to a leukemic cell population producing a bone-ALP isoform, regardless of the exact nature of the leukemia.","['Froment, Remi', 'Bedard, Christian']","['Froment R', 'Bedard C']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, Faculte de Medecine Veterinaire, Universite de Montreal, Saint Hyacinth, QC, Canada. fromentremi@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, Faculte de Medecine Veterinaire, Universite de Montreal, Saint Hyacinth, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20160818,United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,['EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/*blood', 'Animals', 'Dog Diseases/*blood', 'Dogs', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*veterinary', 'Leukocytes/*enzymology', 'Male']",['NOTNLM'],"['ALP', 'Acute leukemia', 'canine', 'immunocytochemistry', 'lymphoproliferative', 'myeloproliferative']",2016/08/19 06:00,2018/03/08 06:00,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/vcp.12389 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2016 Sep;45(3):459-65. doi: 10.1111/vcp.12389.

At the beginning of our study, Estonia was a part of the Eastern bloc with planned economy, but since 1991 it is a member of the European Union and transforming into a market economy. Survival rates have steadily increased in both countries. However, a gap between their survival curves remains. Based on our data, it is difficult to explain the big difference in the 5-year relative survival in favor of western Sweden (55 vs. 22%). In Germany, there was a big difference in overall cancer survival between East and West Germany after the fall of the iron curtain, but today no difference is seen. Differences in survival are probably due to a higher proportion of intense chemotherapy regimens and a higher rate of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations in Sweden. Other important factors might be better supportive care and diagnostics as well as better adjuvant therapy. Better staff training and conditions in wards are also factors that might play an essential role.","['Hulegardh, Erik', 'Punab, Mari', 'Holmberg, Erik', 'Palk, Katrin', 'Laane, Edward', 'Everaus, Hele', 'Wennstrom, Lovisa', 'Stockelberg, Dick']","['Hulegardh E', 'Punab M', 'Holmberg E', 'Palk K', 'Laane E', 'Everaus H', 'Wennstrom L', 'Stockelberg D']","['Department of Internal Medicine/Hematology, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20160819,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Estonia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",,,2016/08/19 06:00,2016/12/23 06:00,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['000446525 [pii]', '10.1159/000446525 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2016;136(3):167-73. doi: 10.1159/000446525.

We applied fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of the BCR-ABL fusion gene to peripheral blood and/or bone marrow smears to determine whether the fusion was restricted to mononuclear cell nuclei or if segmented cell nuclei representing mature neutrophils also carried the fusion (Seg-FISH). Among 20 patients with Ph+ ALL without a prior diagnosis of CML, 9 were Seg-FISH+ and 11 were Seg-FISH-. Seg-FISH+ cases were characterized by a higher rate of p210-type BCR-ABL transcripts, higher white cell and blast counts, and a higher rate of myeloid and T-lymphoid antigen expression than Seg-FISH- cases, in addition to 'major route' cytogenetic abnormalities associated with CML-BC. Eighteen patients were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) either alone or in combination with multiagent chemotherapy, and 7 underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Progression-free and overall survivals were greater in the Seg-FISH+ group than in the Seg-FISH- group. These results suggest that the Seg-FISH+ group represents lymphoid CML-BC that occurs de novo, while the Seg-FISH- represents Ph+ ALL in the strict sense, and the two groups are associated with survival when treated with TKIs or TKI-combined therapy.","['Kamoda, Yoshimasa', 'Izumi, Kiyotaka', 'Iioka, Futoshi', 'Akasaka, Takashi', 'Nakamura, Fumihiko', 'Kishimori, Chiyuki', 'Tsuda, Katsuyo', 'Fukutsuka, Katsuhiro', 'Okumura, Atsuko', 'Hayashida, Masahiko', 'Ohno, Hitoshi']","['Kamoda Y', 'Izumi K', 'Iioka F', 'Akasaka T', 'Nakamura F', 'Kishimori C', 'Tsuda K', 'Fukutsuka K', 'Okumura A', 'Hayashida M', 'Ohno H']","['Department of Hematology, Tenri Hospital, Tenri, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",20160819,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics']",,,2016/08/19 06:00,2016/12/23 06:00,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['000445972 [pii]', '10.1159/000445972 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2016;136(3):157-66. doi: 10.1159/000445972.

Here we demonstrate that T315 decreases cell viability of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines (HL-60 and THP-1) and primary leukemia cells from AML patients in a dose-responsive manner. Normal human bone marrow cells are less sensitive than leukemia cells to T315. T315 down regulates protein kinase B (Akt) and p-Akt and induces caspase activation, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, apoptosis and autophagy through an ILK-independent manner. Interestingly, pretreatment with autophagy inhibitors rescues cells from apoptosis and concomitant PARP cleavage, which implicates a key role of autophagic cell death in T315-mediated cytotoxicity. T315 also demonstrates efficacy in vivo, suppressing the growth of THP-1 xenograft tumors in athymic nude mice when administered intraperitoneally. This study shows that autophagic cell death and apoptosis cooperatively contribute to the anticancer activity of T315 in AML cells. In conclusion, the complementary roles of apoptotic and autophagic cell death should be considered in the future assessment of the translational value of T315 in AML therapy.","['Chiu, Chang-Fang', 'Weng, Jing-Ru', 'Jadhav, Appaso', 'Wu, Chia-Yung', 'Sargeant, Aaron M', 'Bai, Li-Yuan']","['Chiu CF', 'Weng JR', 'Jadhav A', 'Wu CY', 'Sargeant AM', 'Bai LY']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40447, Taiwan. d5686@mail.cmuh.org.tw.', 'Cancer Center, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40447, Taiwan. d5686@mail.cmuh.org.tw.', 'College of Medicine, School of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan. d5686@mail.cmuh.org.tw.', 'Department of Marine Biotechnology and Resources, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan. columnster@gmail.com.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan. columnster@gmail.com.', 'Division of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. appaso06@gmail.com.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan. kelen0523@yahoo.com.tw.', 'Charles River Laboratories, Preclinical Services, Spencerville, OH 45887, USA. aaron.Sargeant@crl.com.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40447, Taiwan. lybai6@gmail.com.', 'College of Medicine, School of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan. lybai6@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160815,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (integrin-linked kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['T315', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'autophagic cell death', 'autophagy']",2016/08/19 06:00,2017/04/18 06:00,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms17081337 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms17081337 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2016 Aug 15;17(8). pii: ijms17081337. doi: 10.3390/ijms17081337.,10.3390/ijms17081337 [doi] E1337 [pii],,,,,PMC5000734,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How the recognition of viruses leads to apoptosis of the infected cell and which host cell factors regulate this cell death is incompletely understood. In this study, we focussed on two major anti-apoptotic proteins of the host cell, whose abundance and activity are important for cell survival, the Bcl-2-like proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL. During infection of epithelial cells and fibroblasts with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), Mcl-1 protein levels dropped but the MVA Bcl-2-like protein F1L could replace Mcl-1 functionally; a similar activity was found in vaccinia virus (VACV)-infected cells. During infection with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), Mcl-1-levels were not reduced but a viral Mcl-1-like activity was also generated. Infection of mouse macrophages with any of these viruses, on the other hand, induced apoptosis. Virus-induced macrophage apoptosis was unaltered in the absence of Mcl-1. However, apoptosis was substantially increased in infected Bcl-XL-deficient macrophages or macrophages treated with the Bcl-2/Bcl-XL-inhibitor ABT-737. Genetic loss of Bcl-XL or treatment of macrophages with ABT-737 reduced the generation of infectious VACV. These data show that Mcl-1 is dispensable for the regulation of apoptosis during infection with different large DNA viruses, either because the viruses replace its function (in fibroblasts and epithelial cells) or because the pro-apoptotic activity generated by the infection appears not to be blocked by it (in macrophages). Bcl-XL, on the other hand, can be important to maintain survival of virus-infected cells, and its activity can determine outcome of the infection.","['Ohmer, Michaela', 'Weber, Arnim', 'Sutter, Gerd', 'Ehrhardt, Katrin', 'Zimmermann, Albert', 'Hacker, Georg']","['Ohmer M', 'Weber A', 'Sutter G', 'Ehrhardt K', 'Zimmermann A', 'Hacker G']","['Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Virology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160818,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Cytoprotection/drug effects', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/virology', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/virology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/drug effects/virology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols', 'Piperazines', 'Sulfonamides', 'Vaccinia virus/*physiology', 'Virion/drug effects/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",,,2016/08/19 06:00,2017/09/30 06:00,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2016242 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2016.242 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2016 Aug 18;7(8):e2340. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2016.242.,10.1038/cddis.2016.242 [doi],,,,,PMC5108327,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objectives of this study were to assess concordance between parent-, teacher-, and self-report ratings on a measure of attention (Conners Rating Scales, 3rd ed.; Conners, 2008) in adolescent survivors of childhood cancer and to examine associations with a performance-based task. The Conners 3 was completed by 80 survivors of pediatric cancer (39 brain tumor, 41 acute lymphoblastic leukemia; ages 12-17; at least 1 year posttreatment; 51.3% male) as well as their parents and 1 teacher. In addition, survivors completed a continuous performance test. Parents and teachers demonstrated moderate agreement on most subscales; however, agreement was weaker than would be expected based on the normative sample. Agreement between self- and proxy ratings was more variable. The strongest associations for all raters were observed on the Learning Problems subscale. There were significant mean differences between parent and teacher ratings, with parents reporting more problems across subscales. Only self-ratings of Inattention were significantly associated with the continuous performance test (omission errors). Agreement across raters in assessment of attentional functioning in adolescent survivors of childhood cancer is modest. Findings support the need to obtain multiple ratings of behavior, including both proxy- and self-report, when assessing youth with cancer, particularly adolescents.","['Willard, Victoria W', 'Conklin, Heather M', 'Huang, Lu', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Kahalley, Lisa S']","['Willard VW', 'Conklin HM', 'Huang L', 'Zhang H', 'Kahalley LS']","[""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Psychology, Baylor College of Medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Psychol Assess,Psychological assessment,8915253,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Observer Variation', 'Parents', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology', '*Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'School Teachers', 'Self Report', '*Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology']",,,2016/08/19 06:00,2017/07/20 06:00,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['2016-40116-008 [pii]', '10.1037/pas0000265 [doi]']",ppublish,Psychol Assess. 2016 Sep;28(9):1110-8. doi: 10.1037/pas0000265.,10.1037/pas0000265 [doi],"['PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved']",,,,PMC4991558,['NONE (all authors)'],"['F32 DA024503/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'K07 CA157923/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['NIHMS749468'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most often considered appropriate as an approach to treatment for low-risk prostate cancer, it is also found in the literature in breast cancer surveillance, urinary lithiasis, lymphocytic leukemia, depression and small renal tumors. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review sought to:Identify and synthesize the best available international evidence on the experience of adults who choose watchful waiting or active surveillance as an approach to medical treatment. To this end the questions addressed in this review were:1. How do patients who have chosen watchful waiting or active surveillance describe the process of coming to the decision?2. What were the factors that influenced their decision to choose?3. How do patients who have chosen watchful waiting or active surveillance describe the experience? INCLUSION CRITERIA: Male or female patients, 18 years or older, who experience the phenomenon of choosing or not choosing watchful waiting or active surveillance as a treatment approach.The phenomena of interest were accounts of the experiences of adult patients who choose watchful waiting or active surveillance as an approach to medical treatment.This review considered studies that focused on qualitative data including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and critical theory. Mixed method studies with narrative description and patient voice were also considered. Grey literature such as research reports and dissertations were also included. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished studies through electronic databases, reference lists, and the World Wide Web. Extensive searches were undertaken of relevant databases to include CINAHL, PubMed, SCOPUS and PsycINFO. A three-step search strategy was used in each component of the review. Studies were limited to English language papers. The search considered papers from the year 2000 to January 2015. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Qualitative papers selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using the standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI). Any disagreements that arose between the reviewers were resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. DATA EXTRACTION: Qualitative data were extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from. The data extracted included specific details about the phenomena of interest that described the experiences pertinent to the review questions DATA SYNTHESIS: The data were synthesized using the Joanna Briggs Institute approach to meta-synthesis by meta-aggregation using the JBI-QARI software and methods. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies, critically appraised by two independent reviewers and deemed to be of high quality, were included in the final review. One study was excluded after appraisal. One hundred and fifty-five findings from the 16 studies were extracted into 10 categories and then into three synthesized findings. The synthesized findings explicated: CONCLUSIONS: The synthesized findings of the review conclude that the process of making the decision to choose watchful waiting is complex. Through the process patients and their significant others experience an array of emotions that often lead to uncertainty and anxiety. Once the decision is made patients must cope with the knowledge that they have a troubling diagnosis and make the necessary adjustments. An empathic, reassuring relationship with a healthcare practitioner eases the burden of this process.Healthcare providers need to recognize that not all patients are ""at peace"" with the decision of choosing watchful waiting. Uncertainty and fear may intensify during this time as well as feelings of stress and anxiety. Patients and their significant others often attempt to adapt in the best way they know how but the effectiveness of their coping strategies needs to be assessed. In addition, healthcare providers need to also be aware that with the increased anxiety and stress associated with watchful waiting, patients' understanding of healthcare information and the ability to ask questions may be diminished. Both providers and patients benefit from open discussions related to the many aspects of uncertainty and fear related to making and living with the decision. Employing a shared decision making model with regard to the management of the array of issues that comes from both making the decision and living with it is recommended. It appears that patients are very sensitive to recognizing when the care they are receiving lacks empathy. Communication that is open, empathic, and non-judgmental is essential. A willingness to discuss sensitive issues such as sexual function needs to be conveyed. Lastly, providers and their staff need to remain attentive to the importance of articulating aspects of the situation that are hopeful and optimistic as many patients, during their visits, take their cues regarding their health status from non-verbal and verbal interactions.Future studies should investigate.","['Rittenmeyer, Leslie', 'Huffman, Dolores', 'Alagna, Michael', 'Moore, Ellen']","['Rittenmeyer L', 'Huffman D', 'Alagna M', 'Moore E']","['1.

More recently, resistance to the second generation TKIs, nilotinib and dasatinib, has also been observed albeit at a lower incidence. ABCB1 has previously been implicated in TKI export and its overexpression linked to TKI resistance. In this study the dynamics of nilotinib resistance was studied in CML cell lines with particular focus on ABCB1 expression levels during development of resistance. Results revealed ABCB1 overexpression is likely an important initiator of nilotinib resistance in vitro. ABCB1 overexpression was also observed in cell lines as an intermediate step during development of resistance to imatinib and dasatinib in vitro. We conclude that ABCB1 overexpression may provide an initial platform to facilitate development of additional mechanisms for resistance to TKIs. This provides a rationale for investigating this phenomenon in patients undergoing TKI therapy.","['Eadie, Laura N', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'White, Deborah L']","['Eadie LN', 'Hughes TP', 'White DL']","['Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, South Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, South Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia.', 'Division of Haematology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, Adelaide, South Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, South Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160818,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/metabolism/physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Dasatinib/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2016/08/19 06:00,2017/07/28 06:00,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0161470 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-15975 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Aug 18;11(8):e0161470. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0161470. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0161470 [doi],,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1912-7602'],,,PMC4990177,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alternative treatments with herbal extracts offer insights into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy. Parthenolide (PTL), an extract from feverfew, induces apoptosis in primary human leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and bulk leukemic cell populations. Osteopontin (OPN) preserves cell viability in response to anticancer agents and its receptors could be utilized for therapeutic targeting of cancer cells. METHODS: U937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with concentrations of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 microM PTL for 20-24 hours for MTT assays. Apoptosis assays were performed with Annexin V-Alexa Fluor-488/PI as Annexin V+/PI- and Annexin V+/PI+ to measure early and late apoptosis, respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure OPN gene expression using the 2(-DeltaDeltaCt) method. The PTL-treated cells were stained with FITC-CD38 antibody for flow cytometry analyses. Data were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) by SPSS 19. RESULTS: Parthenolide inhibited growth of U937 cells with IC25 and IC50 values of 4 and 5.8 microM, respectively. Death induction with PTL was apoptotic. Flow cytometry showed a significant decrease in the percentage of CD38+ U937 cells in response to PTL. Osteopontin gene expression decreased in response to PTL.

We assessed the safety and efficacy of prophylaxis using low-dose low molecular weight heparin in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in complete remission treated with an asparaginase-based post-remission chemotherapy regimen. METHODS: As part of the intensification phase of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute 91-01 regimen, asparaginase was administered weekly to 41 consecutive patients for 21-30 weeks; these patients also received prophylaxis with enoxaparin 40 mg daily (60 mg for patients >/=80 kg). Outcomes were assessed against outcomes in a comparable cohort of 99 patients who received the same chemotherapy regimen without anticoagulation prophylaxis. RESULTS: The overall rate of symptomatic venous thrombosis was not significantly different in the prophylaxis and non-prophylaxis cohorts (18.92% and 21.74% respectively). Among patients receiving prophylaxis, vte occurred in higher proportion in those who weighed at least 80 kg (42.86% vs. 4.35%, p = 0.0070). No major bleeding complications occurred in the prophylaxis group (minor bleeding: 8.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Prophylaxis with low-dose enoxaparin during the intensification phase was safe, but was not associated with a lower overall proportion of vte.","['Sibai, H', 'Seki, J T', 'Wang, T Q', 'Sakurai, N', 'Atenafu, E G', 'Yee, K W L', 'Schuh, A C', 'Gupta, V', 'Minden, M D', 'Schimmer, A D', 'Brandwein, J M']","['Sibai H', 'Seki JT', 'Wang TQ', 'Sakurai N', 'Atenafu EG', 'Yee KW', 'Schuh AC', 'Gupta V', 'Minden MD', 'Schimmer AD', 'Brandwein JM']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network; Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network; Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON;', 'Department of Biostatistics, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON;', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160812,Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anticoagulants', 'asparaginase', 'leukemia', 'prophylaxis', 'venous thromboembolism']",2016/08/19 06:00,2016/08/19 06:01,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3747/co.23.3077 [doi]', 'conc-23-e355 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol. 2016 Aug;23(4):e355-61. doi: 10.3747/co.23.3077.

Currently, this medicinal mushroom is also used as a dietary supplement in numerous Western and Eastern countries. Armillarikin was isolated from A. mellea, and we previously discovered that it induced cytotoxicity in human leukemia cells. In this study, we further investigated the cytotoxicity of armillarikin against liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer cells. Armillarikin was cytotoxic against human hepatocellular carcinoma Huh7, HA22T, and HepG2 cells based on the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetr azolium and alamarBlue((R)) assays. Armillarikin treatment also induced the collapse of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential of these cells. Furthermore, armillarikin-induced apoptotic cell death was demonstrated by sub-G1 chromosomal DNA formation by using flow cytometry. In addition, the apoptosis was inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk. Immunoblotting also revealed the armillarikin-induced activation of procaspase-3, -8, and -9 and upregulation of the apoptosis- and cell cycle arrest-related phospho-histones 2 and 3, respectively. Moreover, reactive oxygen species scavengers also inhibited the armillarikin-induced apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting that reactive oxygen species formation played an important role in the armillarikin-induced apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma. In conclusion, our study indicates the potential of armillarikin as an effective agent for hepatoma or leukemia therapies.","['Chen, Yu-Jen', 'Chen, Chien-Chih', 'Huang, Huey-Lan']","['Chen YJ', 'Chen CC', 'Huang HL']","['Department of Medical Research; Department of Radiation Oncology, Mackay Memorial Hospital; Institute of Traditional Medicine, School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University; Institute of Pharmacology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei.', 'Department of Biotechnology, HungKuang University, Taichung.', 'Department of Bioscience Technology, College of Health Science, Chang Jung Christian University, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160801,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Armillaria mellea (A. mellea)', 'apoptosis', 'armillarikin', 'hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)', 'reactive oxygen species (ROS)']",2016/08/19 06:00,2016/08/19 06:01,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S103940 [doi]', 'ott-9-4773 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2016 Aug 1;9:4773-83. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S103940. eCollection 2016.,10.2147/OTT.S103940 [doi],,,,,PMC4975141,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The function of c-Kit has led to the concept that inhibiting c-Kit kinase activity can be a target for cancer therapy. The promising results of inhibition of c-Kit for treatment of cancers have been observed in some cancers such as gastrointestinal stromal tumor, acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma, and other tumors, and these results have encouraged attempts toward improvement of using c-Kit as a capable target for cancer therapy. This paper presents the findings of previous studies regarding c-Kit as a receptor tyrosine kinase and an oncogene, as well as its gene targets and signaling pathways in normal and cancer cells. The c-Kit gene location, protein structure, and the role of c-Kit in normal cell have been discussed. Comprehending the molecular mechanism underlying c-Kit-mediated tumorogenesis is consequently essential and may lead to the identification of future novel drug targets. The potential mechanisms by which c-Kit induces cellular transformation have been described. This study aims to elucidate the function of c-Kit for future cancer therapy. In addition, it has c-Kit inhibitor drug properties and their functions have been listed in tables and demonstrated in schematic pictures. This review also has collected previous studies that targeted c-Kit as a novel strategy for cancer therapy. This paper further emphasizes the advantages of this approach, as well as the limitations that must be addressed in the future. Finally, although c-Kit is an attractive target for cancer therapy, based on the outcomes of treatment of patients with c-Kit inhibitors, it is unlikely that Kit inhibitors alone can lead to cure. It seems that c-Kit mutations alone are not sufficient for tumorogenesis, but do play a crucial role in cancer occurrence.","['Abbaspour Babaei, Maryam', 'Kamalidehghan, Behnam', 'Saleem, Mohammad', 'Huri, Hasniza Zaman', 'Ahmadipour, Fatemeh']","['Abbaspour Babaei M', 'Kamalidehghan B', 'Saleem M', 'Huri HZ', 'Ahmadipour F']","['Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (NIGEB), Shahrak-e Pajoohesh; Medical Genetics Department, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Urology; Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota; Section of Molecular Therapeutics & Cancer Health Disparity, The Hormel Institute, Austin, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Clinical Investigation Centre, University Malaya Medical Centre, Lembah Pantai, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160801,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['c-Kit', 'cancer', 'cancer therapy', 'oncogene']",2016/08/19 06:00,2017/03/17 06:00,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S89114 [doi]', 'dddt-10-2443 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2016 Aug 1;10:2443-59. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S89114. eCollection 2016.,10.2147/DDDT.S89114 [doi],,,,,PMC4975146,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the treatment is associated with prolonged ""on-target off-tumor"" toxicities due to the targeted elimination of healthy B cells demanding more selectivity in targeting CLL cells. We identified the immunoglobulin M Fc receptor (FcmuR), also known as the Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule-3 or TOSO, as a target for a more selective treatment of CLL by CAR T cells. FcmuR is highly and consistently expressed by CLL cells; only minor levels are detected on healthy B cells or other hematopoietic cells. T cells with a CAR specific for FcmuR efficiently responded toward CLL cells, released a panel of proinflammatory cytokines and lytic factors, like soluble FasL and granzyme B, and eliminated the leukemic cells. In contrast to CD19 CAR T cells, anti-FcmuR CAR T cells did not attack healthy B cells. T cells with anti-FcmuR CAR delayed outgrowth of Mec-1-induced leukemia in a xenograft mouse model. T cells from CLL patients in various stages of the disease, modified by the anti-FcmuR CAR, purged their autologous CLL cells in vitro without reducing the number of healthy B cells, which is the case with anti-CD19 CAR T cells. Compared with the currently used therapies, the data strongly imply a superior therapeutic index of anti-FcmuR CAR T cells for the treatment of CLL.","['Faitschuk, Elena', 'Hombach, Andreas A', 'Frenzel, Lukas P', 'Wendtner, Clemens-Martin', 'Abken, Hinrich']","['Faitschuk E', 'Hombach AA', 'Frenzel LP', 'Wendtner CM', 'Abken H']","['Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Department I Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany;', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Department I Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany;', 'Department I Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; and.', 'Department I Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Klinikum Schwabing, Munich, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Department I Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160817,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (immunoglobulin M receptor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Engineering', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Engineering', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Fc/*antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2016/08/19 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34095-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-01-692046 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Sep 29;128(13):1711-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-01-692046.

Mechanistically, ibrutinib interferes with B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling as well as multiple CLL cell-to-microenvironment interactions. Given the importance of ibrutinib in the management of CLL, a deeper understanding of factors governing sensitivity and resistance is warranted.Experimental Design: We studied 48 longitudinally sampled paired CLL samples, 42 of which were procured before and after standard CLL chemotherapies, and characterized them for well-studied CLL molecular traits as well as by whole-exome sequencing and SNP 6.0 array profiling. We exposed these samples to 0.25 to 5 mumol/L of ibrutinib ex vivo and measured apoptosis fractions as well as BCR signaling by immunoblotting. We disrupted TP53 in HG3, PGA1, and PG-EBV cell lines and measured BCR signaling and ibrutinib responses.Results: CLL samples demonstrated a surprisingly wide range of ex vivo sensitivities to ibrutinib, with IC50 values ranging from 0.4 to 9.7 mumol/L. Unmutated IGVH status, elevated ZAP70 expression, and trisomy 12 were associated with heightened sensitivity to ibrutinib treatment. Five CLL samples were substantially more resistant to ibrutinib following relapse from chemotherapy; of these, three had acquired a del17p/TP53-mutated status. A validation sample of 15 CLL carrying TP53 mutations, of which 13 carried both del17p and a TP53 mutation, confirmed substantially less sensitivity to ibrutinib-induced apoptosis.Conclusions: This study identifies that CLL harboring del17p/TP53-mutated cells are substantially less sensitive to ibrutinib-induced apoptosis than del17p/TP53 wild-type cells.

Hence, BCL2 inhibitors have been developed as direct inducers of apoptosis. ABT-199 (venetoclax) received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA due to its apparent efficacy in CLL and AML. However, resistance to ABT-199 is mediated by other BCL2 proteins including BCLXL and MCL1. Considerable effort has been expended seeking novel ""BH3 mimetics"" that inhibit all of these BCL2 proteins. While many BH3 mimetics inhibit BCL2 proteins in vitro, they fail to directly inhibit them in intact cells. Many BH3 mimetics induce the unfolded protein response culminating in induction of the proapoptotic protein NOXA, which in turn inhibits MCL1. We propose simple experiments to validate BH3 mimetics in cells. A true BCL2 inhibitor will rapidly induce apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells ex vivo A BCLXL inhibitor will rapidly induce apoptosis in platelets. Finally, a BH3 mimetic targeting MCL1 will inhibit its degradation thereby inducing rapid MCL1 accumulation. Compounds that fail these tests should no longer be called BH3 mimetics. We now have a toolbox of selective inhibitors for most of the BCL2 proteins, and we hope these new tools will lead to effective treatment options for many cancers. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(9); 2011-7.

Unlike radium-223 ((223)Ra), the parent radionuclide thorium-227 ((227)Th) is able to form highly stable chelator complexes and is therefore amenable to targeted radioimmunotherapy. We describe the preparation and use of a CD33-targeted thorium-227 conjugate (CD33-TTC), which binds to the sialic acid receptor CD33 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A chelator was conjugated to the CD33-targeting antibody lintuzumab via amide bonds, enabling radiolabeling with the alpha-emitter (227)Th. The CD33-TTC induced in vitro cytotoxicity on CD33-positive cells, independent of multiple drug resistance (MDR) phenotype. After exposure to CD33-TTC, cells accumulated DNA double-strand breaks and were arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. In vivo, the CD33-TTC demonstrated antitumor activity in a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model using HL-60 cells at a single dose regimen. Dose-dependent significant survival benefit was further demonstrated in a disseminated mouse tumor model after single dose injection or administered as a fractionated dose. The data presented support the further development of the CD33-TTC as a novel alpha pharmaceutical for the treatment of AML. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(10); 2422-31.

METHODS: The microarray data of B-ALL were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and Qlucore Omics Explorer software was used to screen differentially expressed miRNA. Based on the differentially expressed miRNAs, we predicted the target genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) and transcription factors (TFs). Then we constructed the miRNAs-centered comprehensive regulatory network. In addition, we performed functional enrichment analysis to analyze the functions of target genes. RESULTS: Of all the 15 differentially expressed miRNAs, 7 miRNAs were of overexpression, 8 miRNAs underexpressed. From the miRNAs comprehensive regulatory network, we found that hsa-miR-486-3p and hsa-miR-126 regulated a large number of target genes, hsa-miR-126 including target genes MYC. The hsa-miR-29a, hsa-miR-130a and hsa-miR-181c regu- lated a lot of lncRNAs containing X-inactive-specific transcript (XIST). The hsa-miR-181a-2, hsa-miR- 181b-2 and hsa-miR-663 were regulated by a host of TFs including caudal- related homeobox transcription fact2 (CDX2). Additionally, the target genes of has-miR-126 were enriched in Wnt pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of hsa-miR-29a , hsa-miR-126 and has-miR-181 family were significantly different in B-ALL. Target gene of MYC, TFs of CDX2 and lncRNA of XIST may play important roles in the development of B-ALL, serving as a potential therapeutic target.","['Zeng, M N', 'Ma, W L', 'Zheng, W L']","['Zeng MN', 'Ma WL', 'Zheng WL']","['Institute of Genetic Engineering, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (MIRN126 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN486 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN663 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Computational Biology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",,,2016/08/19 06:00,2017/01/31 06:00,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.07.009 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Jul;37(7):585-90. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.07.009.,10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.07.009 [doi],,,,,PMC7365002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From May to November in 2014, anonymous questionnaires were distributed to adult CML patients who were receiving TKI treatment all over China. RESULTS: 1 038 questionnaires were collected, 949 questionnaires were evaluable. Of the 949 evaluable respondents, 549 (58%) were male with the median age of 41 years (range, 18 to 88 years). 623 (66%) respondents lived in an urban area and 449 (47%) had an education level >/= a bachelor degree. 888 (94%) respondents were in the chronic phase at diagnosis, and 690 (78%) of them started TKI treatment within one year after diagnosis. 794 (84%) respondents were on imatinib, 768 (81%) on the branded. With a median TKI treatment duration of 3 years (range, <1 to 13 years), 708 of 834 (85%) evaluable respondents achieved Ph- negative (i.e. complete cytogenetic response, CCyR), and 497 of 859 (46% ) BCR- ABL negative (i.e. complete molecular response, CMR). Multivariate analyses showed that female (OR=1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.8,P=0.019 andOR=1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.0,P=0.015), TKI treatment duration >3 years (OR=4.1, 95% CI 2.6- 6.5,P<0.001 andOR=3.7, 95% CI 2.7- 5.1,P< 0.001) and imatinib taken (OR=2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.7,P=0.007 andOR=3.3, 95% CI 2.1-5.1,P<0.001) were factors affecting achieving both CCyR and CMR. In addition, higher education level (OR=2.0, 95% CI 1.3- 3.1,P=0.003), starting TKI treatment <1 year (OR=2.4, 95% CI 1.5- 3.8,P<0.001) and branded drugs received (OR=2.4, 95% CI 1.4- 4.0,P=0.001) were factors affecting achieving a CCyR. In 884 respondents, 534 (62%) reported "" heavy financial burden"" as the biggest treatment impediment, only 152 (17%) reported "" poor quality of life related to adverse effects of TKI"". CONCLUSIONS: The survey showed that majority of the Chinese CML patients received imatinib as a TKI therapy, and most of the patients achieved satisfied responses by TKI. Financial burden became the major obstacle during TKI treatment.","['Jiang, Q', 'Liu, Z C', 'Zhang, S X']","['Jiang Q', 'Liu ZC', 'Zhang SX']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'China', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/08/19 06:00,2017/01/31 06:00,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.07.004 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Jul;37(7):559-64. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.07.004.,10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.07.004 [doi],,,,,PMC7365001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From May to November in 2014, anonymous questionnaires were distributed to adult CML patients who were receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) treatment in China. The impact of TKI related side effects on daily life were assessed by the score of 1 (no impact) to 5 (high impact) from patient self- report. RESULTS: Data from 548 respondents in the CP on Glivec were collected. 303(55%) cases were male with the median age of 40 years (range, 18 to 88 years). 437 (80% ) cases started Glivec treatment within one year after diagnosis with a median treatment duration of 3 years (range, <1 to 13 years), 442 (81%) respondents achieved complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and 261 (48% ) complete molecular response (CMR). The most common Glivec related adverse effects were edema (n=278, 51% ), fatigue (n=218, 40% ), gastrointestinal disorders (n=190, 35%), muscle cramps (n=118, 22%), skin color changes (n=118, 22%), weight gain (n=71, 13%), rash (n=60, 11%), hepatic function abnormality (n=55, 10%), and cytopenia (n=38, 7%). Among the 548 respondents, the mean score of Glivec-related side effects on daily life was 2.4+/-1.2. There was no negative impact of Glivec related side effects on daily life in 161(29%) respondents. 295 (54% ) and 92 (17% ) respondents reported slightly or moderately (2- 3 score) and significantly decreased (4-5 score) daily life, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that Glivec treatment duration < 4 years (OR=1.9, 95% CI 1.3- 2.6;P<0.001) and Glivec related side effects including fatigue (OR=2.9, 95% CI 2.1-4.1;P<0.001), edema (OR=2.2, 95% CI 1.6-3.1;P<0.001), gastrointestinal disorders (OR= 2.6, 95% CI 1.9- 3.7;P<0.001), rash (OR=2.1, 95% CI 1.2- 3.4; P=0.0051) and hepatic function abnormality (OR=2.3, 95% CI 1.4-3.9;P=0.0013) were factors associated with serious negative effect on daily life. CONCLUSIONS: Daily life was impaired seriously in a minority of Chinese CML patients who received Glivec, especially in the first 4 years of treatment. Fatigue, edema, gastrointestinal disorders, rash and hepatic function abnormality were side effects associated with negative impact on patients' daily life.","['Yu, L', 'Wang, H B', 'Huang, X J', 'Jiang, Q']","['Yu L', 'Wang HB', 'Huang XJ', 'Jiang Q']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,['8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asians', 'China', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/08/19 06:00,2017/01/31 06:00,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.07.003 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Jul;37(7):554-8. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.07.003.,10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.07.003 [doi],,,,,PMC7365006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous prospective single-center studies have demonstrated better survival after HBMT versus haploidentical rhG-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (HPBSCT) for acute leukemia (AL) not in remission (NR) or in more than the second complete remission (>CR2). To test the hypothesis that HBMT is still superior to HPBSCT for patients with AL, multiple myeloma (MM), or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in CR1/CR2 and for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the first and second chronic phase lacking a matched donor, we designed a propensity score method-based multicenter study. Hematopoietic recovery, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and chronic GVHD were comparable between the HBMT group (n=168) and the HPBSCT group (n=42). No significant differences were found in non-relapse mortality rate (20.17%+/-3.58% and 27.24%+/-7.16%, P=0.18) or relapse rate (19.96%+/-3.72% and 28.49%+/-8.25%, P=0.32) between the HBMT group and the HPBSCT group.

We conducted a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) to determine the relative efficacy of commercially available interventions for the first-line treatment of unfit CLL patients. METHODS: For inclusion in the NMA, studies had to be linked via common treatment comparators, report progression-free survival (PFS), and/or overall survival (OS), and meet at least one of the five inclusion criteria: median cumulative illness score >6, median creatinine clearance </=70 mL/min, existing co-morbidities, median age >/=70 years, and no full-dose F in the comparator arm. A manual review, validated by external experts, of all studies that met at least one of these criteria was also performed to confirm that they evaluated first-line therapeutic options for unfit patients with CLL. RESULTS: In unfit patients, the main NMA (five studies for PFS and four for OS) demonstrated clear preference in terms of PFS for obinutuzumab + chlorambucil (G-Clb) versus rituximab + chlorambucil (R-Clb), ofatumumab + chlorambucil (O-Clb), fludarabine and chlorambucil (median hazard ratios [HRs] 0.43, 0.33, 0.20, and 0.19, respectively), and a trend for better efficacy versus rituximab + bendamustine (R-Benda) and RFC-Lite (median HR 0.81 and 0.88, respectively). OS results were generally consistent with PFS data, (median HR 0.48, 0.53, and 0.81, respectively) for G-Clb versus Clb, O-Clb, and R-Clb 0.35 and 0.81 versus F and R-Benda, respectively); however, the OS findings were associated with higher uncertainty. Treatment ranking reflected improved PFS and OS with G-Clb over other treatment strategies (median rank of one for both endpoints). CONCLUSION: G-Clb is likely to show superior efficacy to other treatment options selected in our NMA for unfit treatment-naive patients with CLL. FUNDING: F.

A paradigmatic cancer to study cell-cell interactions is classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) owing to its complex microenvironment. The role of the interplay between cHL and ECs remains poorly understood. Here we identify canonical WNT pathway activity as important for the mutual interactions between cHL cells and ECs. We demonstrate that local canonical WNT signaling activates cHL cell chemotaxis toward ECs, adhesion to EC layers and cell invasion using not only the Wnt-inhibitor Dickkopf, tankyrases and casein kinase 1 inhibitors but also knockdown of the lymphocyte enhancer binding-factor 1 (LEF-1) and beta-catenin in cHL cells. Furthermore, LEF-1- and beta-catenin-regulated cHL secretome promoted EC migration, sprouting and vascular tube formation involving vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Importantly, high VEGFA expression is associated with a worse overall survival of cHL patients. These findings strongly support the concept that WNTs might function as a regulator of lymphoma dissemination by affecting cHL cell chemotaxis and promoting EC behavior and thus angiogenesis through paracrine interactions.","['Linke, F', 'Harenberg, M', 'Nietert, M M', 'Zaunig, S', 'von Bonin, F', 'Arlt, A', 'Szczepanowski, M', 'Weich, H A', 'Lutz, S', 'Dullin, C', 'Janovska, P', 'Krafcikova, M', 'Trantirek, L', 'Ovesna, P', 'Klapper, W', 'Beissbarth, T', 'Alves, F', 'Bryja, V', 'Trumper, L', 'Wilting, J', 'Kube, D']","['Linke F', 'Harenberg M', 'Nietert MM', 'Zaunig S', 'von Bonin F', 'Arlt A', 'Szczepanowski M', 'Weich HA', 'Lutz S', 'Dullin C', 'Janovska P', 'Krafcikova M', 'Trantirek L', 'Ovesna P', 'Klapper W', 'Beissbarth T', 'Alves F', 'Bryja V', 'Trumper L', 'Wilting J', 'Kube D']","['Clinic of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medical Centre of the Georg-August University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Clinic of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medical Centre of the Georg-August University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Statistics, University Medical Centre of the Georg-August University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Clinic of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medical Centre of the Georg-August University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Clinic of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medical Centre of the Georg-August University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Clinic of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medical Centre of the Georg-August University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Section Hematopathology, UKSH Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Chemical Biology, Helmholtz-Centre for Infection Research HZI, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology, University Medical Centre of the Georg-August University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Medical Centre of the Georg-August University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Faculty of Science, Institute of Experimental Biology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Analyses, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Section Hematopathology, UKSH Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Statistics, University Medical Centre of the Georg-August University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Clinic of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medical Centre of the Georg-August University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Medical Centre of the Georg-August University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biology of Neuronal Signals, Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Faculty of Science, Institute of Experimental Biology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of Czech Republic, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Clinic of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medical Centre of the Georg-August University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University Medical Centre of the Georg-August University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Clinic of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medical Centre of the Georg-August University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160818,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Chemokine CCL19)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/genetics', '*Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Chemokine CCL19/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis/genetics/immunology', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', '*Tumor Microenvironment/genetics/immunology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'beta Catenin/genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/08/19 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016232 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.232 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Feb;31(2):361-372. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.232.

Aberrant HOX expression is found in nearly all AMLs that harbor a mutation in the Nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene, and FLT3 is concomitantly mutated in approximately 60% of these cases. Little is known about how mutant NPM1 (NPM1(mut)) cells maintain aberrant gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that the histone modifiers MLL1 and DOT1L control HOX and FLT3 expression and differentiation in NPM1(mut) AML. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing domain screen, we show NPM1(mut) AML to be exceptionally dependent on the menin binding site in MLL1. Pharmacologic small-molecule inhibition of the menin-MLL1 protein interaction had profound antileukemic activity in human and murine models of NPM1(mut) AML. Combined pharmacologic inhibition of menin-MLL1 and DOT1L resulted in dramatic suppression of HOX and FLT3 expression, induction of differentiation, and superior activity against NPM1(mut) leukemia. SIGNIFICANCE: MLL1 and DOT1L are chromatin regulators that control HOX, MEIS1, and FLT3 expression and are therapeutic targets in NPM1(mut) AML. Combinatorial small-molecule inhibition has synergistic on-target activity and constitutes a novel therapeutic concept for this common AML subtype. Cancer Discov; 6(10); 1166-81.

For example, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) immediate early (IE) protein ICP0 overcomes the restrictive effects of PML-NB components PML, Sp100, hDaxx, and ATRX while human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IE protein IE1 targets PML and Sp100, and its tegument protein pp71 targets hDaxx and ATRX. The functions of these viral regulatory proteins are in part interchangeable; thus, both IE1 and pp71 stimulate the replication of ICP0-null mutant HSV-1, while ICP0 increases plaque formation by pp71-deficient HCMV. Here, we extend these studies by examining proteins that are expressed by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We report that EBV tegument protein BNRF1, discovered by other investigators to target the hDaxx/ATRX complex, increases the replication of both ICP0-null mutant HSV-1 and pp71-deficient HCMV. In addition, EBV protein EBNA-LP, which targets Sp100, also augments ICP0-null mutant HSV-1 replication. The combination of these two EBV regulatory proteins had a greater effect than each one individually. These findings reinforce the concept that disruption of the functions of PML-NB proteins is important for efficient herpesvirus infections. IMPORTANCE: Whether a herpesvirus initiates a lytic infection in a host cell or establishes quiescence or latency is influenced by events that occur soon after the viral genome has entered the host cell nucleus. Certain cellular proteins respond in a restrictive manner to the invading pathogen's DNA, while viral functions are expressed that counteract the cell-mediated repression. One aspect of cellular restriction of herpesvirus infections is mediated by components of nuclear structures known as PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs), or ND10. Members of the alpha-, beta-, and gammaherpesvirus families all express proteins that interact with, degrade, or otherwise counteract the inhibitory effects of various PML NB components. Previous work has shown that there is the potential for a functional interchange between the viral proteins expressed by alpha- and betaherpesviruses, despite a lack of obvious sequence similarity. Here, this concept is extended to include a member of the gammaherpesviruses.","['Lu, Yongxu', 'Orr, Anne', 'Everett, Roger D']","['Lu Y', 'Orr A', 'Everett RD']","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom roger.everett@glasgow.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161014,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (EBNA-LP protein, Human herpesvirus 4)', '0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (P140 protein, Epstein-barr virus)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (gene 63 protein, Equine herpesvirus 1)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (ATRX protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (X-linked Nuclear Protein)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'Antigens, Nuclear/genetics', 'Autoantigens/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cytomegalovirus/*genetics', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/genetics', 'DNA Helicases/genetics', 'DNA Replication/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/genetics', 'Herpes Simplex/genetics', 'Herpesviridae Infections/genetics', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*genetics', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics', 'Virus Replication/*genetics', 'X-linked Nuclear Protein']",,,2016/08/19 06:00,2017/05/06 06:00,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01224-16 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01224-16 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2016 Oct 14;90(21):9664-9673. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01224-16.

We find that not only DNMT3A mutations, but also TET2, ASXL1 mutations, core-binding factor and MLL translocations, as well as del(20q) mostly fulfil these criteria. When not eradicated by AML treatments, pre-leukaemic cells with these lesions can re-initiate the leukaemic process at various stages until relapse, with a time-dependent increase in clonal variegation.

In BLV infection, the proviral load in the blood reflects disease progression. Although the BLV genome is highly conserved among retroviruses, genetic variation has been reported. However, the relationship between proviral load and genetic variation is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the changes in proviral load in BLV-infected cattle in Japan and then identified and analysed a BLV strain pvAF967 that had a static proviral load. First, examining the proviral load in the aleukaemic cattle in 2014 and 2015, cow AF967 showed a static proviral load, while the other cows showed significant increases in proviral load. Sequencing the provirus in cow AF967 showed a deletion of 12 nt located in the G4 gene. An in vitro assay system using BLV molecular clone was set up to evaluate viral replication and production. In this in vitro assay, the deletion mutation in the G4 gene resulted in a significant decrease in viral replication and production. In addition, we showed that the deletion mutation did not affect the viral transcriptional activity of Tax protein, which is also important for virus replication. The emergence of strain pvAF967 that showed a static proviral load, combined with other retrovirus evolutionary traits, suggests that some BLV strains may have evolved to be symbiotic with cattle.","['Murakami, Hironobu', 'Uchiyama, Jumpei', 'Nikaido, Sae', 'Sato, Reiichiro', 'Sakaguchi, Masahiro', 'Tsukamoto, Kenji']","['Murakami H', 'Uchiyama J', 'Nikaido S', 'Sato R', 'Sakaguchi M', 'Tsukamoto K']","['Laboratory of Animal Health II, School of Veterinary Medicine, Azabu University, 1-17-71 Fuchinobe, Chuo-ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 252-5201, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Microbiology I, School of Veterinary Medicine, Azabu University, 1-17-71 Fuchinobe, Chuo-ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 252-5201, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Animal Health II, School of Veterinary Medicine, Azabu University, 1-17-71 Fuchinobe, Chuo-ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 252-5201, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Internal Medicine III, School of Veterinary Medicine, Azabu University, 1-17-71 Fuchinobe, Chuo-ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 252-5201, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Microbiology I, School of Veterinary Medicine, Azabu University, 1-17-71 Fuchinobe, Chuo-ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 252-5201, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Animal Health II, School of Veterinary Medicine, Azabu University, 1-17-71 Fuchinobe, Chuo-ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 252-5201, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160816,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (g4 protein, Bovine leukemia virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*genetics/metabolism', '*Sequence Deletion', '*Virus Replication']",,,2016/08/19 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/jgv.0.000583 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2016 Oct;97(10):2753-2762. doi: 10.1099/jgv.0.000583.

Most CLL cells express BCRs of IgM and IgD isotypes, but the contribution of these isotypes to functional responses remains incompletely defined. We therefore investigated differences between IgM and IgD signaling in freshly isolated peripheral blood CLL cells and in CLL cells cultured with nurselike cells, a model that mimics the lymph node microenvironment. IgM signaling induced prolonged activation of ERK kinases and promoted CLL cell survival, CCL3 and CCL4 chemokine secretion, and downregulation of BCL6, the transcriptional repressor of CCL3 In contrast, IgD signaling induced activation of the cytoskeletal protein HS1, along with F-actin polymerization, which resulted in rapid receptor internalization and failure to support downstream responses, including CLL cell survival and chemokine secretion. IgM and IgD receptor downmodulation, HS1 and ERK activation, chemokine secretion, and BCL6 downregulation were also observed when CLL cells were cocultured with nurselike cells. The Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib effectively inhibited both IgM and IgD isotype signaling. In conclusion, through a variety of functional readouts, we demonstrate very distinct outcomes of IgM and IgD isotype activation in CLL cells, providing novel insight into the regulation of BCR signaling in CLL.","['Ten Hacken, Elisa', 'Sivina, Mariela', 'Kim, Ekaterina', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Wierda, William G', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Oellerich, Thomas', 'Scielzo, Cristina', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico', 'Burger, Jan A']","['Ten Hacken E', 'Sivina M', 'Kim E', ""O'Brien S"", 'Wierda WG', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Estrov Z', 'Keating MJ', 'Oellerich T', 'Scielzo C', 'Ghia P', 'Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Burger JA']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230;', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230;', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230;', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230;', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230;', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230;', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230;', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230;', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany; and.', 'Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Ospedale San Raffaele and Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, 20132 Milan, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Ospedale San Raffaele and Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, 20132 Milan, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Ospedale San Raffaele and Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, 20132 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230; jaburger@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160817,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (CCL3 protein, human)', '0 (CCL4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (HCLS1 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Blood Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Microenvironment/immunology', 'Chemokine CCL3/immunology/metabolism', 'Chemokine CCL4/immunology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin D/immunology/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology/immunology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",,,2016/08/19 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1600915 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1600915 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2016 Sep 15;197(6):2522-31. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1600915.

However, a considerable group of CML patients do not respond well to the TKI therapy. Challenging to overcome this problem, we tried to discover molecular signatures in gene expression profiles to discriminate the responders and non-responders of TKI therapy. METHODS: We collected three microarray datasets of CML patients having total 73 responders and 38 non-responders. Statistical analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as gene signature candidates from integrated microarray datasets. The classification performance of these genes and further selected discriminator gene sets was tested by using random forest and iterative backward variable selection methods. RESULTS: We identified a set of genes including CTBP2, NADK, AZU1, CTSH, FSTL1, and HDLBP showing the highest accuracy more than 69.44 % to classify TKI response in CML patients. Interestingly, four genes of them are on the signaling pathway of cell proliferation. This set of genes showed much higher performance than the average performance of other genes in downstream signaling of TKI target, BCR-ABL. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we could find a set of potential companion diagnostic markers for TKI treatment and, at the same time, the potential of gene expression analysis to enhance the coverage of companion diagnostics.","['Cha, Kihoon', 'Li, Yi', 'Yi, Gwan-Su']","['Cha K', 'Li Y', 'Yi GS']","['Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, 34141, South Korea.', 'Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, 34141, South Korea.', 'Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, 34141, South Korea. gsyi@kaist.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160812,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Drug Discovery', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Treatment Failure']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', '*Gene expression signature', '*Meta-analysis', '*Random forest', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)']",2016/08/19 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2016/08/19 06:00'],"['2016/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12920-016-0194-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12920-016-0194-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2016 Aug 12;9 Suppl 1:29. doi: 10.1186/s12920-016-0194-5.,10.1186/s12920-016-0194-5 [doi],,,,,PMC4989900,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the majority of patients continue to present with minimal residual disease occurred in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. One of the key factors that contribute to leukemia cell drug resistance is chemokine CXCL12. In the current study, co-culturing CML cell K562 and KU812 with BM stromal cell M2-10B4 attenuated IM-induced apoptosis. CXCL12/CXCR7 pathway was activated in co-culture models, which was further proved to be related to drug resistance by silencing CXCR7. ERK phosphorylation and downstream apoptosis related proteins' activation were also observed in co-culture group after the activation of CXCR7. Moreover, oroxylin A, a bioactive flavonoid isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, was found to be effective in reversing BM stroma induced CML resistance to IM. After cells were treated with weakly toxic concentration of oroxylin A, cell apoptosis induced by IM in co-culture model was enhanced. And the activated CXCL12/CXCR7 pathway, the expression of p-ERK and downstream apoptosis related proteins were suppressed. The in vivo study also showed that oroxylin A increased apoptosis of CML cells with low systemic toxicity, and the mechanism was consistent with the in vitro study. In conclusion, oroxylin A improved sensitivity of CML cells to IM treatment in BM microenvironment through regulating CXCL12/CXCR7 pathway.

Here we investigate the effects of this microRNA on early steps of B cell development and the capacity of miR-15a-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and B1 progenitor cells (B1P) to reproduce CLL-like phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that both miR-15a deficient HSC and B1P cells are capable of repopulating irradiated recipients and produce higher numbers of B1 cells than sources with normal miR-15a/16 levels. Furthermore, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived for the first time from NZB mice, provided insights into the B cell differentiation roadblock inherent in this strain. In addition, exogenously delivered miR-15a into the NZB derived B cell line provided valuable clues into novel targets such as Mmp10 and Mt2. Our data supports the hypothesis that miR-15a/16 deficient stem cells and B1Ps experience a maturation blockage, which contributes to B1 cells bias in development. This work will help understand the role of miR-15a in early events of CLL and points to B1P cells as potential cells of origin for this incurable disease.","['Underbayev, Chingiz', 'Kasar, Siddha', 'Ruezinsky, William', 'Degheidy, Heba', 'Schneider, Joel Solomon', 'Marti, Gerald', 'Bauer, Steven R', 'Fraidenraich, Diego', 'Lightfoote, Marilyn M', 'Parashar, Vijay', 'Raveche, Elizabeth', 'Batish, Mona']","['Underbayev C', 'Kasar S', 'Ruezinsky W', 'Degheidy H', 'Schneider JS', 'Marti G', 'Bauer SR', 'Fraidenraich D', 'Lightfoote MM', 'Parashar V', 'Raveche E', 'Batish M']","['New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ, USA.', 'NHLBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ, USA.', 'New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ, USA.', 'CBER/FDA, Silver Spring, MD, USA.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Solid Biosciences LLC, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'OSEL/CDRH/FDA, Silver Spring, MD, USA.', 'CBER/FDA, Silver Spring, MD, USA.', 'New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ, USA.', 'CBER/FDA, Silver Spring, MD, USA.', 'Rutgers School of Dental Medicine, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ, USA.', 'New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ, USA.', 'New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn15 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Mirn16 microRNA, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['B1 progenitors', 'cancer stem cells', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'induced pluripotent stem cells', 'microRNAs']",2016/08/18 06:00,2018/03/20 06:00,['2016/08/18 06:00'],"['2016/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['11290 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11290 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 20;7(38):60986-60999. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11290.,10.18632/oncotarget.11290 [doi],,,,,PMC5308631,['The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],['DP5 OD012160/OD/NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a clinical observation of TKIs cessation in Chinese CML patients and a probable connection between CML leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and relapse. In all, 22 of 1057 patients consented to participate in this observation. The average time of complete molecular response was 12.73 months after TKI withdrawal. LSCs could be flow cytometrically detected in most of the patients. However, the number of LSCs did not differ between the relapsers and non-relapsers. We evaluated the leukemogenetic ability of the LSCs by transplanting bone marrow into irradiated NOD/SCID mice. The results indicated that part of the bone marrow from the relapsers lead to leukemogensis in the mice. Besides, we found that LSCs-derived microvesicles might serve as a novel factor for the stratification of undetectable minimal residual disease and an early warning sign of relapse. In summary, post-TKI cessation relapse seems to show none association with the number of LSCs. A mouse xenograft model would provide a novel and useful method of analyzing LSCs function and predicting relapse. Microvesicles may provide important information about optimal molecular monitoring schedules in TKI discontinuation strategies.","['Li, Qing', 'Zhong, Zhaodong', 'Zeng, Chen', 'Meng, Li', 'Li, Chunrui', 'Luo, Yi', 'Wang, Hongxiang', 'Li, Weiming', 'Wang, Jue', 'Cheng, Fanjun', 'Guo, Anyuan', 'Liu, Songya', 'Jin, Caibao', 'Zhu, Xiaojian', 'You, Yong', 'Zou, Ping']","['Li Q', 'Zhong Z', 'Zeng C', 'Meng L', 'Li C', 'Luo Y', 'Wang H', 'Li W', 'Wang J', 'Cheng F', 'Guo A', 'Liu S', 'Jin C', 'Zhu X', 'You Y', 'Zou P']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, P.

Due to the importance of the transport P-glycoprotein and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase in the metabolism of chemotherapeutic agents, we analyzed the MDR1 rs1045642 and MTHFR rs1801133 polymorphisms and their associations with clinical outcomes in Mexican childhood ALL patients. METHODS: A total of 109 patients participated in this study. The clinical evaluation consisted of a physical examination and a laboratory test. Genotyping of MDR1 rs1045642 (3435 C>T) and MTHFR rs1801133 (677 C>T) was performed by polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 14.0. The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by logistic regression. RESULTS: Individuals who were CC homozygotes at MDR1 rs1045642 had lower risk of having methotrexate plasma concentrations >1 muM and leukopenia grade I (odds ratio [OR] = 0.30; 95% CI = 0.13-0.72 and OR = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.14-0.72, respectively). Patients who were CC homozygotes at MTHFR rs1801133 had a higher risk of developing mucositis (OR = 3.61; 95% CI = 1.42-9.14). CONCLUSION: MDR1 rs1045642 and MTHFR rs1801133 should be considered as diagnostic candidates for the identification of pediatric patients with a high risk of suffering adverse events during ALL treatment.","['Ramirez-Pacheco, Arturo', 'Moreno-Guerrero, Selene', 'Alamillo, Ilse', 'Medina-Sanson, Aurora', 'Lopez, Briseida', 'Moreno-Galvan, Monica']","['Ramirez-Pacheco A', 'Moreno-Guerrero S', 'Alamillo I', 'Medina-Sanson A', 'Lopez B', 'Moreno-Galvan M']","['1 Departamento de Hemato-Oncologia, Hospital Infantil de Mexico , Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico .', '1 Departamento de Hemato-Oncologia, Hospital Infantil de Mexico , Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico .', '2 Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas , IPN, Mexico City, Mexico .', '1 Departamento de Hemato-Oncologia, Hospital Infantil de Mexico , Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico .', '3 Banco Central, Hospital Infantil de Mexico , Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico .', '1 Departamento de Hemato-Oncologia, Hospital Infantil de Mexico , Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico .', '4 Sociedad Mexicana de Salud Publica, CENAPRECE , SSA, Mexico City, Mexico .']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20160817,United States,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,101494210,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (MTHFR protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Homozygote', 'Humans', '*Leukopenia/blood/chemically induced/genetics', 'Male', '*Methotrexate/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Mexico', '*Mucositis/blood/chemically induced/genetics', 'Pilot Projects', '*Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/genetics', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*MDR1 polymorphisms', '*MTHFR polymorphisms', '*Mexican leukemia', '*childhood leukemia']",2016/10/18 06:00,2017/03/07 06:00,['2016/08/18 06:00'],"['2016/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/gtmb.2015.0287 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2016 Oct;20(10):597-602. doi: 10.1089/gtmb.2015.0287.

We investigated the roles and mechanisms of NDRG2 in human cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) progression. In the present study, expression of NDRG2, microRNA (miR)-181c and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in human CCA and adjacent nontumor tissues were examined. The effects of NDRG2 on CCA tumor growth and metastasis were determined both in vivo and in vitro. The role of the NDRG2/LIF/miR-181c signaling pathway in cholangiocarcinogenesis and metastasis were investigated both in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that human CCA tissues exhibited decreased levels of NDRG2 and increased levels of miR-181c and LIF compared with nontumor tissues. NDRG2 could inhibit CCA cell proliferation, chemoresistance, and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. We found that NDRG2 is a target gene of miR-181c, and the down-regulation of NDRG2 was attributed to miR-181c overexpression in CCA. Furthermore, miR-181c can be activated by LIF treatment, whereas NDRG2 could inhibit LIF transcription through disrupting the binding between Smad, small mothers against decapentaplegic complex and LIF promoter. Down-regulation of NDRG2 and overexpression of miR-181c or LIF are significantly associated with a poorer overall survival (OS) in CCA patients. Finally, we found that a combination of NDRG2, miR-181c, and LIF expression is a strong predictor of prognosis in CCA patients. CONCLUSION: These results establish the counteraction between NDRG2 and LIF/miR-181c as a key mechanism that regulates cholangiocarcinogenesis and metastasis. Our results elucidated a novel pathway in NDRG2-mediated inhibition of cholangiocarcinogenesis and metastasis and suggest new therapeutic targets, including NDRG2, LIF, miR-181c, and transforming growth factor beta, in CCA prevention and treatment.

Much work has gone into development of IGF1R inhibitors; however, candidate agents including small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and blocking antibodies have yet to fulfill their promise clinically. Understanding cellular features that define sensitivity versus resistance are important for effective patient selection and anticipation of outgrowth of a resistant clone. We previously identified an important role for IGF signaling in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) relying primarily upon genetically defined mouse models. We present here an assessment of IGF1R dependence in human T-ALL using a broad panel of 27 established cell lines that capture a spectrum of the genetic variation that might be encountered in clinical practice. We observed that a subset of cell lines are sensitive to IGF1R inhibition and are characterized by high levels of surface IGF1R expression and PTEN positivity. Interestingly, lentiviral expression or knock-down of PTEN in PTEN-negative/positive cell lines, respectively, had limited effects on their response to IGF1R inhibition, suggesting that PTEN contributes to, but does not define IGF dependence. Additionally, we characterize downstream PI3K/AKT signaling as dominant over RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK in mediating growth and/or survival in this context. Finally, we demonstrate that IGF and interleukin-7 (IL-7) fulfill non-overlapping roles in supporting T-ALL growth. These findings are significant in that they reveal cellular features and downstream mechanisms that may determine the response of an individual patient's tumor to IGF1R inhibitor therapy.","['Gusscott, Samuel', 'Jenkins, Catherine E', 'Lam, Sonya H', 'Giambra, Vincenzo', 'Pollak, Michael', 'Weng, Andrew P']","['Gusscott S', 'Jenkins CE', 'Lam SH', 'Giambra V', 'Pollak M', 'Weng AP']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1L3, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160817,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (5-(2,2-difluorobenzo(1,3)dioxol-5-ylmethylene)thiazolidine-2,4-dione)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (BMS 754807)', '0 (Dioxoles)', '0 (IL7 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (Triazines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'VE267FC2UB (figitumumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Dioxoles/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thiazolidinediones/pharmacology', 'Triazines/pharmacology']",,,2016/08/18 06:00,2017/08/09 06:00,['2016/08/18 06:00'],"['2015/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0161158 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-32788 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Aug 17;11(8):e0161158. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0161158. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0161158 [doi],,,,,PMC4988785,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B55alpha-Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been shown to dephosphorylate AKT at Thr-308 rendering it inactive. In fact, low expression of the PP2A regulatory subunit B55alpha was associated with activated phospho-AKT and correlated with inferior outcomes in AML. Despite this fact, no studies have specifically demonstrated a mechanism whereby B55alpha expression is regulated in AML. In this study, we demonstrate novel loss of function mutations in the PPP2R2A gene identified in leukemic blasts from three AML patients. These mutations eliminate B55alpha protein expression thereby allowing constitutive AKT activation. In addition, leukemic blasts with PPP2R2A gene mutation were more sensitive to treatment with the AKT inhibitor MK2206, but less responsive to the PP2A activator FTY720. Using leukemia cell lines, we further demonstrate that B55alpha expression correlates with AKT Thr-308 phosphorylation and predicts responsiveness to AKT inhibition and PP2A activation. Together our data illustrate the importance of the B55alpha-PP2A-AKT pathway in leukemogenesis. Screening for disruptions in this pathway at initial AML diagnosis may predict response to targeted therapies against AKT and PP2A.","['Shouse, Geoffrey', 'de Necochea-Campion, Rosalia', 'Mirshahidi, Saied', 'Liu, Xuan', 'Chen, Chien-Shing']","['Shouse G', 'de Necochea-Campion R', 'Mirshahidi S', 'Liu X', 'Chen CS']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University Cancer Center, Biospecimen Laboratory, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University Cancer Center, Biospecimen Laboratory, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of California, Riverside, Riverside, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University Cancer Center, Biospecimen Laboratory, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (MK 2206)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP2CA protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Codon', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'B55alpha', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'protein kinase B', 'protein phosphatase 2A']",2016/08/18 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2016/08/18 06:00'],"['2016/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['11209 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11209 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 20;7(38):61081-61092. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11209.,10.18632/oncotarget.11209 [doi],,,,,PMC5308637,['The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis of transplantation-related index, a single center retrospective study of clinical data of 202 cases of leukemia received allo-HSCT from March 2004 to October 2014 had been conducted to screen the risk factors for recurrence after transplantation. RESULTS: In the leukemia patients received allo-HSCT, 68 cases relapsed. The relapse rate was 33.6%. The median time of relapse was 4(1.5-26 ) months. Univariate analysis indicated that there were 5 risk factors related with the disease relapse(P<0.05), including the type of disease, extramedullary disease prior to transplant, the course of induced remission, the status of disease at HSCT and chronic graft versus host disease(cGVHD). Multivariate analysis showed that extramedullary disease prior to transplant(RR=2.622, 95%CI 1.139-6.037), the course of induced remission(RR=1.156, 95%CI 0.682-1.957), cGVHD (RR=1.728,95%CI 0.999-2.991) were independent risk factors for relapse of the patients received transplantation. Treatment strategies for the relapsed patients included withdraw immunosuppressant, donor lymphocyte infusion, systemic chemotherapy and local radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and second transplantation.

The correlation of ADAMTS13 with von Willebrand factor (vWF), thrombospondin 1 (TSP1), C-reactive protein etc, and blood pressure was simultaneously analyzed METHODS: The activity of ADAMTS13 in patient groups (atherosclerosis, diabetes, acute promyelocytic leukemia, cancer and sepsis, a total of 260 cases) and in control group 50 cases were evaluated by residue collagen binding assayR-CBA, the protein levels of TSP1 and vWF were measured by ELISA kits the correlation of ADAMTS13 activity with CRP, creatinine, and blood pressure was analyzed with statistical soft ware. RESULTS: The activity of plasma ADAMTS13 in patient group was significantly lower than that in normal control group(P<0.05). And the protein levels of TSP1 and vWF in the patients with prothrombotic status were higher than those in the normal controls(P<0.05). Analysis of the correlation showed that the ADAMTS13 activity correlated negatively with the levels of TSP1 protein, blood sugar, blood pressure, D-dimer, creatinine,and CRP levels (P<0.05), however, the ADAMTS13 activity did not significantly correlate with the levels of serum lipids, blood type, platelet number and hemoglobin level(P>0.05).

METHODS: The clinical data including clinical features, laboratorial results, survival and prognostic factors from 30 patients with T-LBL were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Median age of 30 cases was 24.5 years, 25 (83.3%) patients were at high-intermediate and high risk by IPI, extranodal disease was present in 73.3% of the patients, 17(56.7%) patients had bone marrow involvement and 19(63.3%) had mediastinal masses. The overall response rate(ORR) for the whole group was 80.0%, the complete response rate was 36.7%, the 3-5-year overall survival rate was 37.1% and 26.0%, respectively. Compared with NHL-like regimens, ALL-like chemotherapy could improve the survival of patients, the 3-year overall survival rate was 59.1% vs 27.3%. For adult patients, the median overall survival time was 35 months vs 13 months in HSCT group and chemotherapy group, there was a statistically significant difference(P=0.019).

METHODS: A total of 227 cases (exduding M3) were detected by flow cytometry for immune phenotype. The CD7(-)CD56(-)CD19(-) AML served as control. The clinical features, treatment response and prognosis of CD7(+) group, CD56(+) group and CD19(+) group were compared. RESULTS: The detection rate of CD56(+),CD7(+) and CD19(+) in AML was 15.9%, 25.1% and 11.0%, respectively. There were no differences between CD56(+) AML, CD7(+) AML, CD19(+) AML, and CD56(-)CD7(-)CD19(-) AML in the proportion of blast cells, white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, platelet count and MDS transformed AML rate. The CR after the first course chemotherapy and cumulative CR in CD56(+) AML patients were lower than those in the control group (20.0% vs 58.1%, P=0.0099; 73.3% vs 87.5%, P=0.04). The median time of CR in CD56(+) AML was longer than that in the control group (118 days vs 46 days, P=0.04). The PFS time and OS time of CD56(+) AML were shorter than those in the control group (245 days vs 580 days, P=0.037; 494 days vs 809 days, P=0.04). The CR after the first course chemotherapy and cumulative CR in CD19(+) AML patients were higher than those in the control group(75.0% vs 58.1%, P=0.46; 100% vs 87.5%, P=0.02). The median time of CR in CD19(+) AML was shorter than that in the control group (28 days vs 46 days, P=0.02). The PFS time and OS time of CD19(+) AML tended to be longer than those in the control group (P=0.13, P=0.07, respectively). The median PFS and OS were not reached at the time of last follow-up. The CR after the first course chemotherapy, cumulative CR and median time to CR in CD7(+) AML patients were not different from those in the control group (53.1% vs 58.1%, P=0.67; 87.1% vs 87.5%, P=0.44; 50 days vs 46 days, P=0.44). No differences of PFS and OS were observed between CD7(+) AML and the control. CONCLUSION: CD56(+) AML patients respond poorly to treatment, frequently relapse after complete remission and have a low survival rate. These patients need more intensive chemotherapy or in combination with other treatments. The interval of MRD detection should be shortened to find out relapse earlier. CD19(+) AML patients have a good treatment outcome and often accompanies with AML1/ETO fusion gene, which is known to be a good prognostic marker. Aberrant expression of CD7 on AML cells is not a poor prognostic factor in this study.","['Fang, Fang', 'Zhu, Ping', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Lu, Xu-Zhen', 'Dong, Yu-Jun', 'Sun, Yu-Hua', 'Wang, Li-Hong', 'Bu, Ding-Fang', 'Cen, Xi-Nan', 'Wang, Mang-Ju']","['Fang F', 'Zhu P', 'Zhang Y', 'Lu XZ', 'Dong YJ', 'Sun YH', 'Wang LH', 'Bu DF', 'Cen XN', 'Wang MJ']","['Department of Hematology,Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology,Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.

RESULTS: (1)At protein level, Btk and NFkappaB were expressed in all newly diagnosed 51 ALL patients, among them 38 patients had higher expression level of Btk, 34 patients had high NFkappaB expression level. The expression of Btk and NFkappaB was higher in the cells from newly diagnosed ALL patients than that in the cells from patients in CR(P<0.05), and the expression of Btk and NFkappaB was higher in relapsed ALL patients. (2)The expression of Btk and NFkappaB in the ALL patients was followed-up higher expression of Btk: among the 38 newly diagnosed B-ALL cases, 27 experienced CR (71%) and 12 of which achieved CR after one course chemotherapy (one course CR) (31%). Moreover, 16 out of the 27 CR patients relapsed after a short period (less than 6 months) (59%).

Recombinant lentivirus was generated by co-transfection of three-plasmids into 293FT cells using lipofectamine 2000. Then Q-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the expression of PTPN11 in the lentivirus infected HEL and U937 cells. The CCK-8 and Annexin V/7-AAD assays were performed to evaluate effects of PTPN11 on proliferation, apoptosis of HEL and U937 cells. RESULTS: All 5 AML cell lines expressed the PTPN11 gene, restriction analysis and gene sequencing confirmed that recombinant lentiviral vector was successfully constructed. After transfection of cells with the lentivirus, the recombinant plasmid could stably up-regulate the expression of PTPN11. Analysis of the proliferation and apoptosis of transfected AML cells indicated that as compared with the control group, the OD values of over-expression group were significantly higher and the apoptotic rates were significantly lower (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: PTPN11 is expressed in all the 5 AML cell lines. The lentiviral expression vector carrying human PTPN11 and the engineered HEL and U937 cell lines stably up-regulating PTPN11 gene expression are successfully obtained. Over-expression of PTPN11 promotes the proliferation of AML cell lines and inhibit then apoptosis.","['Yue, Jun-Shuai', 'Wu, Qing-Yun', 'Zenge, Ling-Yu', 'Xu, Kai-Lin']","['Yue JS', 'Wu QY', 'Zenge LY', 'Xu KL']","['Institute of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical College, Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical College, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical College, Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical College, Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.

CBU predominance is still incompletely understood. We recently showed that blood CD4(+) T-cell numbers rapidly increase after dUCBT, and early CD4(+) T-cell chimerism predicts for graft predominance. Given the frequent HLA class II allele mismatches between CBUs in dUCBT, we hypothesized that alloreactive HLA class II-specific CD4(+) T cells from the ""winning"" CBU may contribute to rejection of the ""loser"" CBU. We evaluated whether CD4(+) T cells originating from the predominant (PD)-CBU would recognize HLA class II allele mismatches, expressed by the nonengrafting (NE)-CBU. Alloreactive effector CD4(+) T cells toward 1 or more mismatched HLA class II alleles of the NE-CBU were detected in 11 of 11 patients, with reactivity toward 29 of 33 (88%) tested mismatches, and the strongest reactivity toward DR and DQ alleles early after dUCBT. Mismatched HLA class II allele-specific CD4(+) T cells recognized primary leukemic cells when the mismatched HLA class II allele was shared between NE-CBU and patient. Our results suggest that cytotoxicity exerted by CD4(+) T cells from the PD-CBU drives the rapid rejection of the NE-CBU, whose alloreactive effect might also contribute to graft-versus-leukemia.","['Lamers, Cor H J', 'Wijers, Rebecca', 'van Bergen, Cornelis A M', 'Somers, Judith A E', 'Braakman, Eric', 'Gratama, Jan Willem', 'Debets, Reno', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Cornelissen, Jan J']","['Lamers CH', 'Wijers R', 'van Bergen CA', 'Somers JA', 'Braakman E', 'Gratama JW', 'Debets R', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Cornelissen JJ']","['Laboratory of Tumor Immunology, Department of Medical Oncology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Immunology, Department of Medical Oncology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and Department of Transfusion Medicine, Sanquin Blood Supply, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Immunology, Department of Medical Oncology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Immunology, Department of Medical Oncology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160816,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Allografts/*immunology', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Chimerism', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,,2016/10/30 06:00,2017/07/29 06:00,['2016/08/18 06:00'],"['2016/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)31761-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-06-718619 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Oct 27;128(17):2165-2174. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-06-718619.

Apart from increased bleeding tendency, the pathophysiological consequences of hyperfibrinolysis remain largely unknown. Our aim was to develop an experimental model of hyperfibrinolysis and to study its effects on the homeostasis of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We induced a sustained hyperfibrinolytic state in mice by hydrodynamic transfection of a plasmid encoding for tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). As revealed by near-infrared fluorescence imaging, hyperfibrinolytic mice presented a significant increase in BBB permeability. Using a set of deletion variants of tPA and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrated that this effect was independent of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, low-density lipoprotein-related protein, protease-activated receptor-1, or matrix metalloproteinases. In contrast, we provide evidence that hyperfibrinolysis-induced BBB leakage is dependent on plasmin-mediated generation of bradykinin and subsequent activation of bradykinin B2 receptors. Accordingly, this effect was prevented by icatibant, a clinically available B2 receptor antagonist. In agreement with these preclinical data, bradykinin generation was also observed in humans in a context of acute pharmacological hyperfibrinolysis. Altogether, these results suggest that B2 receptor blockade may be a promising strategy to prevent the deleterious effects of hyperfibrinolysis on the homeostasis of the BBB.","['Marcos-Contreras, Oscar A', 'Martinez de Lizarrondo, Sara', 'Bardou, Isabelle', 'Orset, Cyrille', 'Pruvost, Mathilde', 'Anfray, Antoine', 'Frigout, Yvann', 'Hommet, Yannick', 'Lebouvier, Laurent', 'Montaner, Joan', 'Vivien, Denis', 'Gauberti, Maxime']","['Marcos-Contreras OA', 'Martinez de Lizarrondo S', 'Bardou I', 'Orset C', 'Pruvost M', 'Anfray A', 'Frigout Y', 'Hommet Y', 'Lebouvier L', 'Montaner J', 'Vivien D', 'Gauberti M']","['INSERM Unite 919, Serine Proteases and Pathophysiology of the Neurovascular Unit, Cyceron, Universite de Caen Normandy (UNICAEN) Caen, France.', 'INSERM Unite 919, Serine Proteases and Pathophysiology of the Neurovascular Unit, Cyceron, Universite de Caen Normandy (UNICAEN) Caen, France.', 'INSERM Unite 919, Serine Proteases and Pathophysiology of the Neurovascular Unit, Cyceron, Universite de Caen Normandy (UNICAEN) Caen, France.', 'INSERM Unite 919, Serine Proteases and Pathophysiology of the Neurovascular Unit, Cyceron, Universite de Caen Normandy (UNICAEN) Caen, France.', 'INSERM Unite 919, Serine Proteases and Pathophysiology of the Neurovascular Unit, Cyceron, Universite de Caen Normandy (UNICAEN) Caen, France.', 'INSERM Unite 919, Serine Proteases and Pathophysiology of the Neurovascular Unit, Cyceron, Universite de Caen Normandy (UNICAEN) Caen, France.', 'INSERM Unite 919, Serine Proteases and Pathophysiology of the Neurovascular Unit, Cyceron, Universite de Caen Normandy (UNICAEN) Caen, France.', 'INSERM Unite 919, Serine Proteases and Pathophysiology of the Neurovascular Unit, Cyceron, Universite de Caen Normandy (UNICAEN) Caen, France.', 'INSERM Unite 919, Serine Proteases and Pathophysiology of the Neurovascular Unit, Cyceron, Universite de Caen Normandy (UNICAEN) Caen, France.', ""Neurovascular Research Laboratory, Vall d'Hebron Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain."", 'INSERM Unite 919, Serine Proteases and Pathophysiology of the Neurovascular Unit, Cyceron, Universite de Caen Normandy (UNICAEN) Caen, France.', 'Department of Cell Biology, and.', 'INSERM Unite 919, Serine Proteases and Pathophysiology of the Neurovascular Unit, Cyceron, Universite de Caen Normandy (UNICAEN) Caen, France.', 'Department of Diagnostic Imaging and Interventional Radiology, Medical Center, Caen University Hospital, Caen, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160816,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Bradykinin B2 Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Receptor, Bradykinin B2)', 'EC 3.4.21.68 (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.21.7 (Fibrinolysin)', 'S8TIM42R2W (Bradykinin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bradykinin/metabolism/*physiology', 'Bradykinin B2 Receptor Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Brain/drug effects/metabolism', 'Capillary Permeability/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Fibrinolysin/metabolism/*physiology', 'Fibrinolysis/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Hydrodynamics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Receptor, Bradykinin B2/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Tissue Plasminogen Activator/genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/08/18 06:00,2017/08/03 06:00,['2016/08/18 06:00'],"['2016/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33972-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-03-705384 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Nov 17;128(20):2423-2434. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-03-705384.

Using a computational strategy to identify compounds opposing the gene expression signature of STAT3, we discovered atovaquone (Mepron), an antimicrobial approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, to be a potent STAT3 inhibitor. We show that, at drug concentrations routinely achieved clinically in human plasma, atovaquone inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation, the expression of STAT3 target genes, and the viability of STAT3-dependent hematological cancer cells. These effects were also observed with atovaquone treatment of primary blasts isolated from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or acute lymphocytic leukemia. Atovaquone is not a kinase inhibitor but instead rapidly and specifically downregulates cell-surface expression of glycoprotein 130, which is required for STAT3 activation in multiple contexts. The administration of oral atovaquone to mice inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival in a murine model of multiple myeloma. Finally, in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, extended use of atovaquone for Pneumocystis prophylaxis was associated with improved relapse-free survival. These findings establish atovaquone as a novel, clinically accessible STAT3 inhibitor with evidence of anticancer efficacy in both animal models and humans.","['Xiang, Michael', 'Kim, Haesook', 'Ho, Vincent T', 'Walker, Sarah R', 'Bar-Natan, Michal', 'Anahtar, Melodi', 'Liu, Suhu', 'Toniolo, Patricia A', 'Kroll, Yasmin', 'Jones, Nichole', 'Giaccone, Zachary T', 'Heppler, Lisa N', 'Ye, Darwin Q', 'Marineau, Jason J', 'Shaw, Daniel', 'Bradner, James E', 'Blonquist, Traci', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Hetz, Claudio', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Frank, David A']","['Xiang M', 'Kim H', 'Ho VT', 'Walker SR', 'Bar-Natan M', 'Anahtar M', 'Liu S', 'Toniolo PA', 'Kroll Y', 'Jones N', 'Giaccone ZT', 'Heppler LN', 'Ye DQ', 'Marineau JJ', 'Shaw D', 'Bradner JE', 'Blonquist T', 'Neuberg D', 'Hetz C', 'Stone RM', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Frank DA']","['Department of Medical Oncology and.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; and."", 'Department of Medical Oncology and.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; and."", 'Department of Medical Oncology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Geroscience Center for Brain Health and Metabolism and.', 'Biomedical Neuroscience Institute, Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; and."", 'Department of Medical Oncology and.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; and."", 'Department of Medical Oncology and.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; and.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160816,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'Y883P1Z2LT (Atovaquone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Atovaquone/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', '*Drug Discovery', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/08/18 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2016/08/18 06:00'],"['2015/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)34075-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-07-660506 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Oct 6;128(14):1845-1853. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-07-660506.

Skin rash is a common adverse reaction following treatment with alemtuzumab. However, the clinicopathologic features and immunologic basis for the reaction have not been previously reported. METHODS: Our hospital's electronic pathology database was searched for cases with documentation of 'alemtuzumab' or 'anti-CD52' in the clinical history provided by either the ordering physician or the pathologist. Clinical and histopathologic review of the cases was performed. RESULTS: Five patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were treated with alemtuzumab, and developed pruritic, erythematous papules and plaques. Histopathology of the skin lesions revealed subacute spongiotic dermatitis with multifocal parakeratosis, endothelial activation and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Eosinophils were not a prominent feature. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the clinicopathologic features of a novel hypersensitivity reaction to alemtuzumb, and hypothesize it may be due to an immunologic response precipitated by the persistence of resident memory T-cells (TRM ) in the skin. Our findings raise awareness for a novel reaction pattern and guide the histopathologic interpretation of lesions which may clinically mimic residual or recurrent cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Clark, Stacie L', 'Tse, Julie Y', 'Fisher, David C', 'LeBeouf, Nicole R', 'Murphy, George F', 'Kupper, Thomas S', 'Clark, Rachael A', 'Lian, Christine G']","['Clark SL', 'Tse JY', 'Fisher DC', 'LeBeouf NR', 'Murphy GF', 'Kupper TS', 'Clark RA', 'Lian CG']","[""Program in Dermatopathology, Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Tufts Medical Center, Tufts School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Dermatology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Program in Dermatopathology, Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Dermatology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Dermatology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Program in Dermatopathology, Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. cglian@partners.org.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160909,United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Dermatitis/*etiology/pathology', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/drug therapy', 'Male']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD52', 'CLL', 'CTCL', 'alemtuzumab', 'hypersensitivity']",2016/10/21 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/08/18 06:00'],"['2015/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cup.12800 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2016 Nov;43(11):989-993. doi: 10.1111/cup.12800.

We set out to provide reliable data regarding the benefit of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for AML patients, using mortality as the main outcome measure. We also characterized the herbal prescriptions of patients. METHODS: Using the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database, we performed a nationwide population-based cohort study among AML patients from 1997 to 2010. The Cox regression model was used to adjust for comorbidities and other variables, and the hazard ratios (HRs) of CHM users and non-CHM users were compared. RESULTS: After 1:1 matching, 498 patients were included into the study. The HR of the CHM group was 0.41 (95% CI = 0.26-0.65; P = .0001) compared with the non-CHM group. This decrease in HR was also shown to be dose dependent ( P < .001). The 3 single-herbs most commonly prescribed were Salvia miltiorrhiza (Dan Shen), Astragalus membranaceus (Huang Qi), and Spatholobus suberectus (Ji Xue Teng). The 3 mutli-herb products most commonly prescribed were Jia Wei Xiao Yao San, Gui Pi Tang, and Qi Ju Di Huang Wan. CONCLUSION: Prospective controlled clinical data is still needed, however, this study provides real-world data regarding the benefit AML patients may have from CHM. This study suggests that all AML patients, regardless of age or other prognostic factors, may achieve longer survival times when receiving CHM in addition to standard therapy.","['Fleischer, Tom', 'Chang, Tung-Ti', 'Chiang, Jen-Huai', 'Sun, Mao-Feng', 'Yen, Hung-Rong']","['Fleischer T', 'Chang TT', 'Chiang JH', 'Sun MF', 'Yen HR']","['1 Graduate Institute of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', '1 Graduate Institute of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', '2 Department of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', '3 Health Data Management Office, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', '1 Graduate Institute of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', '2 Department of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', '1 Graduate Institute of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', '2 Department of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160816,United States,Integr Cancer Ther,Integrative cancer therapies,101128834,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '1693AM5SBN (dan-shen root extract)', '922OP8YUPF (Huang Qi)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Astragalus propinquus', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complementary Therapies/methods', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Salvia miltiorrhiza', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chinese medicine', '*NHIRD', '*Taiwan', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*leukemia']",2016/08/18 06:00,2018/03/07 06:00,['2016/08/18 06:00'],"['2016/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['1534735416664171 [pii]', '10.1177/1534735416664171 [doi]']",ppublish,Integr Cancer Ther. 2017 Jun;16(2):156-164. doi: 10.1177/1534735416664171.

METHODS: NT1 cells were transfected with PBS and liposome complex (vehicle group), scrambled siRNA and liposome complex (negative control, NC group), and GFI-1 siRNA and liposome complex (GFI-1 siRNA group), respectively. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were performed to examine the expression levels of GFI-1 mRNA and protein, respectively. The proliferation abilities of NT1 cells of the three groups were evaluated by MTT assay. The cell cycle in cells of the three groups was analyzed by flow cytometry. Moreover, nude mouse xenograft model was used to detect the tumor formation ability in the three group cells. RESULTS: Quantitative real-time PCR data showed that the expression level of GFI-1 mRNA in GFI-1 siRNA group was significantly lower than those of NC group and vehicle group [(0.367+/-0.017) vs. (0.918+/-0.006) and (1.010+/-0.005), respectively, (P<0.05)]. Western blot results showed that the GFI-1 protein expression level in the GFI-1 siRNA group was also significantly reduced, compared with those of the NC group and vehicle group (P<0.05 for both). From MTT assay data, the absorbance value of NT1 cells in the GFI-1 siRNA group (0.667+/-0.059) was significantly lower than those of the NC group (1.096+/-0.049) and vehicle group (1.193+/-0.064, P=0.023). Flow cytometry data showed that sub-G1 and G0/G1 phase proportions of the GFI-1 siRNA group were significantly higher than those of the NC and vehicle groups [sub-G1: (8.2+/-2.5)% vs. (1.9+/-1.3)% and (2.0+/-3.6)%, respectively, (P<0.05); G0/G1: (66.7+/-3.8)% vs. (53.3+/-4.5)% and (48.6+/-3.2)%, respectively, (P<0.05)].

While cytokine stimulation can induce ex vivo hematopoietic cell proliferation, attempts have been made to use epigenetic-modifying agents to facilitate stem cell expansion through the modulation of cellular epigenetic status. However, the potential global effect of these modifying agents on epigenome raises concerns about the functional normality of the expanded cells. We studied the ex vivo expansion of cord blood hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, trichostatin A and valproic acid. Treatment with HDAC inhibitors resulted in mild expansion of the total hematopoietic cell number when compared with cytokine stimulated sample. Nevertheless, we observed 20-30-fold expansion of the CD34(+) CD38(-) HSPC population. Strikingly, cord blood cells cultured with HDAC inhibitors exhibited aberrant expression of leukemia-associated genes, including CDKN1C, CEBPalpha, HOXA9, MN1, and DLK1. Our results thus suggest that the expansion of HSPCs by this approach may provoke a pre-leukemic cell state. We propose that the alteration of epigenome by HDAC inhibitors readily expands cord blood HSPC population through the re-activation of the leukemia gene transcription. The present study provides an assessment of the leukemogenic potential of HSCs expanded ex vivo using HDAC inhibitors for clinical applications.","['Lam, Yuk Man', 'Chan, Yuen Fan', 'Chan, Li Chong', 'Ng, Ray Kit']","['Lam YM', 'Chan YF', 'Chan LC', 'Ng RK']","['School of Biomedical Sciences, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Centre for Reproduction, Development and Growth, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR, China. raykitng@hku.hk.', 'Centre for Reproduction, Development and Growth, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR, China. raykitng@hku.hk.', 'Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Consortium, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR, China. raykitng@hku.hk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160816,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Valproic Acid/*adverse effects/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cord blood', '*Ex vivo expansion', '*Hematopoietic stem cell', '*Histone deacetylase inhibitor']",2016/08/18 06:00,2017/04/15 06:00,['2016/08/18 06:00'],"['2016/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-016-2075-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-016-2075-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Jan;105(1):37-43. doi: 10.1007/s12185-016-2075-2.

Long hospitalization periods, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and immunosuppression are major risks for VRE colonization. We aimed to evaluate patients' characteristics and factors that may contribute to VRE colonization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of 66 patients with colonization and 112 patients without colonization who were hospitalized in the hematology clinic were collected. Hematological malignancies, preexisting gastrointestinal complaints, the presence of hypogammaglobulinemia at the time of diagnosis, complications like neutropenic enterocolitis (NEC), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and Karnofsky performance statuses were recorded. RESULTS: Ages of the patients ranged between 19 and 95 years (mean: 55.99). Karnofsky and ECOG scores were statistically related to VRE colonization (p<0.000 and p<0.000), though only the Karnofsky score was significant based on logistic regression analysis. Almost all patients with acute leukemia (45 patients) had been on antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, and meropenem), while no patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloma, or benign diseases and 2 patients with lymphoma and 1 with chronic myeloid leukemia were on antibiotics. Median time for colonization regardless of antibiotic use and diagnosis was 4.5 days (range: 3-11 days). In the VRE-colonized group, 40.9% of patients had NEC development, while in the non-colonized group, only 1.7% had NEC development. In the VRE-colonized group 46 patients (69.7%) and in the non-colonized group 27 patients (24.1%) had hypogammaglobulinemia at diagnosis; among these patients, 23 patients in the VRE-colonized group (50%) had a B-cell malignancy (lymphoma, myeloma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia). CONCLUSION: Besides already anticipated diseases like leukemia, B-cell malignancies are also at high risk for colonization. This proclivity may be attributed to lack of gastrointestinal IgA due to hypogammaglobulinemia.

Methods A cross-sectional study of families with at least one child who stored umbilical cord blood in the largest private cord blood bank in the United States was performed. Respondent families completed a questionnaire to determine whether children with stored cord blood or a first-degree relative had one or more of 16 conditions amenable primarily to allogeneic stem cell transplant (""transplant indications"") or 16 conditions under investigation for autologous stem cell infusion (""regenerative indications""), regardless of whether they received a transplant or infusion. Results 94,803 families responded, representing 33.3 % of those surveyed. Of respondent families, 16.01 % indicated at least one specified condition. 1.64 % reported at least one first-degree member with a transplant indication potentially treatable with an allogeneic stem cell transplant. The most common transplant indications reported among first-degree family members were Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (0.33 %), Hodgkin's Lymphoma (0.30 %), and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (0.28 %). 4.23 % reported at least one child with a regenerative indication potentially treatable with an autologous stem cell infusion. The most common regenerative indications among children with stored umbilical cord blood were Autism/Autism Spectrum Disorder/Apraxia (1.93 %), Other Developmental Delay (1.36 %), and Congenital Heart Defect (0.87 %). Discussion Among families storing umbilical cord blood in private cord blood banks, conditions for which stem cell transplant or infusion may be indicated, or are under investigation, appear to be prevalent, especially for regenerative medicine indications.","['Mazonson, Peter', 'Kane, Mark', 'Colberg, Kelin', 'Harris, Heather', 'Brown, Heather', 'Mohr, Andrew', 'Ziman, Alyssa', 'Santas, Chris']","['Mazonson P', 'Kane M', 'Colberg K', 'Harris H', 'Brown H', 'Mohr A', 'Ziman A', 'Santas C']","['Mazonson & Santas, Inc., 15 Hillcrest Avenue, Larkspur, CA, 94939, USA.', 'Mazonson & Santas, Inc., 15 Hillcrest Avenue, Larkspur, CA, 94939, USA. mkane@clearcosthealth.com.', 'Mazonson & Santas, Inc., 15 Hillcrest Avenue, Larkspur, CA, 94939, USA.', 'Scientific and Medical Affairs, CBR Systems, Inc., 1200 Bayhill Drive, 3rd Floor, San Bruno, CA, 94066, USA.', 'Scientific and Medical Affairs, CBR Systems, Inc., 1200 Bayhill Drive, 3rd Floor, San Bruno, CA, 94066, USA.', 'Mazonson & Santas, Inc., 15 Hillcrest Avenue, Larkspur, CA, 94939, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, 10833 Le Conte Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.', 'Mazonson & Santas, Inc., 15 Hillcrest Avenue, Larkspur, CA, 94939, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Matern Child Health J,Maternal and child health journal,9715672,,IM,"['Anemia/genetics/therapy', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/therapy', 'Lymphoma/genetics/therapy', 'Materials Management, Hospital/methods/statistics & numerical data', '*Prevalence', 'Regenerative Medicine/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Sarcoma/genetics/therapy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Blood bank', '*Cord blood stem cell transplantation', '*Hematopoietic stem cells', '*Regenerative medicine', '*Stem cell transplant', '*Umbilical cord blood']",2016/08/18 06:00,2018/04/11 06:00,['2016/08/18 06:00'],"['2016/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10995-016-2110-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s10995-016-2110-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Matern Child Health J. 2017 Jan;21(1):208-214. doi: 10.1007/s10995-016-2110-1.,10.1007/s10995-016-2110-1 [doi],,,,,PMC5226972,"['HH and HB are both employees of CBR Systems, Inc.

Fifty-one patients (age range, 19 years to 67 years) with refractory acute leukemia underwent HLA-haploidentical HCT and underwent DNKI on days 6, 9, 13, and 20 of HCT. Median DNKI doses were .5, .5, 1.0, and 2.0 x 10(8)/kg cells, respectively.

The leukemia complete remission rate was 57% at 1 month after HCT and 3-year cumulative incidence of leukemia progression was 75%. When analyzed together with our historical cohort of 40 patients with refractory acute leukemia who underwent haploidentical HCT and DNKI on days 14 and 21 only, higher expression of NKp30 (>90%) on donor NK cells was an independent predictor of higher complete remission (hazard ratio, 5.59) and less leukemia progression (hazard ratio, .57).

However, the underlying mechanism of AML development remains largely unknown. Here in this study, we report the function of IRF3, a member of the interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) family, in human AML. We first show that IRF3 mRNA and protein levels are significantly up-regulated in human AML compared with healthy donors. IRF3 knockdown inhibits cellular proliferation and colony formation in OCI/AML-2 and OCI/AML-3 cells. In addition, IRF3 knockdown induces apoptosis of OCI/AML-2 and OCI/AML-3 cells, whereas IRF3 overexpression promotes cell survival. Further mechanism study shows that IRF3 is positively correlated with miR-155, which is considered as an oncogenic microRNA in AML. We show that IRF3 binds to the promoter of miR-155 and promotes the expression of miR-155 in OCI/AML-2 and OCI/AML-3 cells. In conclusion, our evidence show that IRF3 overexpression in AML promotes cell growth and survival, and miR-155 is involved, indicating that IRF3 may be a potential new biomarker and therapeutic target for AML.","['Tian, Wen-Liang', 'Jiang, Zhong-Xing', 'Wang, Fang', 'Guo, Rong', 'Tang, Ping', 'Huang, Yu-Min', 'Sun, Ling']","['Tian WL', 'Jiang ZX', 'Wang F', 'Guo R', 'Tang P', 'Huang YM', 'Sun L']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, 450052, China.

We carried out a systematic review of occupational cohort studies that reported results on incidence or mortality from Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), leukemia or multiple myeloma (MM) among workers exposed to PAH. We computed meta-analytic estimates using a random effect model. Meta-relative risk (meta-RR) was computed separately by each type of neoplasm, job or industry. We identified 41 studies (12 in iron and steel foundries, 11 in aluminum plant, 6 in cokeries, 6 in carbon electrode manufacturing, 2 on asphalt workers, 2 on creosote-exposed workers, 1 on tar distillery workers and 1 evaluating both tar distillery workers and roofers). No significant excess risk of any lymphatic and hematopoietic neoplasms was found among workers employed in jobs or industries entailing high PAH exposure. Among 18 meta-analytic estimates by job or industry and type of neoplasm, 16 were close to unit, i.e., between 0.72 and 1.27, whereas the meta-RR was 1.38 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.95-2.01] for HL in foundry workers and 2.01 (95 % CI 0.96-4.22) for NHL in workers exposed to creosote.

The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was 25,900 kDa and pI 4.1, as determined by 1D and 2D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence (1FSPRYIELVVVADHGMFKKYNSNLNTIR28; 1TASLANLEVWSK12; 1DLLPR6) of the purified nasulysin-1, shows close structural homology with other snake venom metalloproteinases isolated from different snake venoms. The purified nasulysin-1 showed specific apoptosis-inducing activity in Jurkat and K562 cells, a T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (AML) cell model, respectively, without affecting the viability of human lymphocyte cells. After 48 h treatment, nasulysin-1 (20 mug/mL) induced loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), activated the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), activated the protease caspase-3, and induced chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, all hallmarks of apoptosis. These results strongly suggest that nasulysin-1 selectively induces apoptosis to eliminate leukemia cells. Thus, these data warrant further investigation into the use of the metalloproteinase protein, nasulysin-1 as a potential therapeutic agent for treating leukemia.","['Bonilla-Porras, Angelica Rocio', 'Vargas, Leidy Johana', 'Jimenez-Del-Rio, Marlene', 'Nunez, Vitelbina', 'Velez-Pardo, Carlos']","['Bonilla-Porras AR', 'Vargas LJ', 'Jimenez-Del-Rio M', 'Nunez V', 'Velez-Pardo C']","['Neuroscience Research Group, Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, University of Antioquia, Calle 70 N degrees 52-21, and Calle 62 #52-59, Building 1, Room 412, SIU, P.O.

The breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2, also known as the Fanconi anemia (FA) complementation group D1 (FANCD1)) is a potent tumor suppressor that has been extensively studied in DNA double-stranded break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR). However, BRCA2 participates in numerous other processes central to maintaining genome stability, including DNA replication, telomere homeostasis and cell cycle progression. Consequently, inherited mutations in BRCA2 are associated with an increased risk of breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers. Furthermore, bi-allelic mutations in BRCA2 are linked to FA, a rare chromosome instability syndrome characterized by aplastic anemia in children as well as susceptibility to leukemia and cancer. Here, we discuss the recent developments underlying the functions of BRCA2 in the maintenance of genomic integrity. The current model places BRCA2 as a central regulator of genome stability by repairing DSBs and limiting replication stress. These findings have direct implications for the development of novel anticancer therapeutic approaches.","['Fradet-Turcotte, Amelie', 'Sitz, Justine', 'Grapton, Damien', 'Orthwein, Alexandre']","['Fradet-Turcotte A', 'Sitz J', 'Grapton D', 'Orthwein A']","['Laval University Cancer Research CenterCHU de Quebec Research Center - Universite Laval, Hotel-Dieu de Quebec, Oncology Axis, Quebec City, Canada alexandre.orthwein@mcgill.ca Amelie.Fradet-Turcotte@crchudequebec.ulaval.ca.', 'Laval University Cancer Research CenterCHU de Quebec Research Center - Universite Laval, Hotel-Dieu de Quebec, Oncology Axis, Quebec City, Canada.', 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical ResearchSegal Cancer Centre, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada.', 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical ResearchSegal Cancer Centre, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada Department of OncologyMcGill University, Montreal, Canada alexandre.orthwein@mcgill.ca Amelie.Fradet-Turcotte@crchudequebec.ulaval.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160816,England,Endocr Relat Cancer,Endocrine-related cancer,9436481,"['0 (BRCA2 Protein)', '0 (BRCA2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'BRCA2 Protein/*physiology', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'DNA Replication/*genetics', 'Genomic Instability/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Replication Origin/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BRCA2', '*DNA double-stranded break repair', '*DNA replication', '*Fanconi anemia', '*cancer therapy', '*genomic stability', '*homologous recombination', '*replication stress']",2016/08/18 06:00,2017/12/30 06:00,['2016/08/18 06:00'],"['2016/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['ERC-16-0297 [pii]', '10.1530/ERC-16-0297 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocr Relat Cancer. 2016 Oct;23(10):T1-T17. doi: 10.1530/ERC-16-0297.

Recently, the nucleoside diphosphate hydrolase NUDT15 has received attention on the basis of its ability to hydrolyze the thiopurine effector metabolites 6-thio-deoxyGTP (6-thio-dGTP) and 6-thio-GTP, thereby limiting the efficacy of thiopurines. In particular, increasing evidence suggests an association between the NUDT15 missense variant, R139C, and thiopurine sensitivity. In this study, we elucidated the role of NUDT15 and NUDT15 R139C in thiopurine metabolism. In vitro and cellular results argued that 6-thio-dGTP and 6-thio-GTP are favored substrates for NUDT15, a finding supported by a crystallographic determination of NUDT15 in complex with 6-thio-GMP. We found that NUDT15 R139C mutation did not affect enzymatic activity but instead negatively influenced protein stability, likely due to a loss of supportive intramolecular bonds that caused rapid proteasomal degradation in cells. Mechanistic investigations in cells indicated that NUDT15 ablation potentiated induction of the DNA damage checkpoint and cancer cell death by 6-thioguanine. Taken together, our results defined how NUDT15 limits thiopurine efficacy and how genetic ablation via the R139C missense mutation confers sensitivity to thiopurine treatment in patients.

Genome-wide association studies of childhood ALL to date have focused on inherited genetic effects; however, maternal genetic effects (the role of the maternal genotype on phenotype development in the offspring) also may play a role in ALL susceptibility. METHODS: The authors conducted a family-based exome-wide association study of maternal genetic effects among Hispanics with childhood B-cell ALL using the Illumina Infinium HumanExome BeadChip. A discovery cohort of 312 Guatemalan and Hispanic American families and an independent replication cohort of 152 Hispanic American families were used. RESULTS: Three maternal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) approached the study threshold for significance after correction for multiple testing (P<1.0 x 10(-6) ): MTL5 rs12365708 (testis expressed metallothionein-like protein [tesmin]) (relative risk [RR], 2.62; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.61-4.27 [P = 1.8 x 10(-5) ]); ALKBH1 rs6494 (AlkB homolog 1, histone H2A dioxygenase) (RR, 3.77; 95% CI, 1.84-7.74 [P = 3.7 x 10(-5) ]); and NEUROG3 rs4536103 (neurogenin 3) (RR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.30-2.37 [P = 1.2 x 10(-4) ]). Although effect sizes were similar, these SNPs were not nominally significant in the replication cohort in the current study. In a meta-analysis comprised of the discovery cohort and the replication cohort, these SNPs were still not found to be statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons (rs12365708: pooled RR, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.48-3.50], P = 1.99 x 10(-4) ; rs6494: pooled RR, 2.31 [95% CI, 1.38-3.85], P = .001; and rs4536103: pooled RR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.29-2.16] P = 9.23 x 10(-5) ). CONCLUSIONS: In what to the authors' knowledge is the first family-based based exome-wide association study to investigate maternal genotype effects associated with childhood ALL, the results did not implicate a strong role of maternal genotype on disease risk among Hispanics; however, 3 maternal SNPs were identified that may play a modest role in susceptibility.

Among the beneficial role of neutrophils in host defence, excessive priming and activation of neutrophils after major trauma lead to an overwhelming inflammatory response and secondary host tissue injury due to the release of toxic metabolites and enzymes. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy has been proposed to possess antiinflammatory effects and might represent an appropriate therapeutic option to lower inflammation in a broad range of patients. Here, we studied the effects of HBO on the activity of neutrophils isolated from severely injured patients (days 1-2 after trauma), in fact on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). We found exposure to HBO therapy to significantly diminish phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced ROS production in neutrophils isolated from patients and healthy volunteers. At the same time, marked decrease in NETs release was found in control cells and a less pronounced reduction in patient neutrophils. Impaired ability to produce ROS following exposure to HBO was demonstrated to be linked to a strong downregulation of the activity of p38 MAPK. Only slight suppression of ERK activity could be found. In addition, HBO did not influence neutrophil chemotaxis or apoptosis, respectively. Collectively, this study shows for the first time that HBO therapy suppresses ROS production in inflammatory human neutrophils, and thus might impair ROS-dependent pathways, e.g. kinases activation and NETs release. Thus, HBO might represent a feasible therapy for patients suffering from systemic inflammation, including those with multiple trauma.","['Grimberg-Peters, Deborah', 'Buren, Carina', 'Windolf, Joachim', 'Wahlers, Thorsten', 'Paunel-Gorgulu, Adnana']","['Grimberg-Peters D', 'Buren C', 'Windolf J', 'Wahlers T', 'Paunel-Gorgulu A']","['University Hospital Dusseldorf, Department of Trauma and Hand Surgery, Moorenstrasse 5, 40225, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'University Hospital Dusseldorf, Department of Trauma and Hand Surgery, Moorenstrasse 5, 40225, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'University Hospital Dusseldorf, Department of Trauma and Hand Surgery, Moorenstrasse 5, 40225, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Heart Center of the University of Cologne, Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Kerpener Str. 62, 50937, Cologne, Germany.', 'Heart Center of the University of Cologne, Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Kerpener Str. 62, 50937, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160816,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '20839-06-9 (phorbol-12-myristate)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Critical Illness/therapy', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Extracellular Traps/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Hyperbaric Oxygenation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/drug effects', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Wounds and Injuries/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",,,2016/08/17 06:00,2017/08/03 06:00,['2016/08/17 06:00'],"['2016/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0161343 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-17339 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Aug 16;11(8):e0161343. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0161343. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0161343 [doi],,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6467-3544'],,,PMC4986935,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This study analyzed the relation between age and genetics from birth to 100 years in 5564 patients with de novo AML diagnosed from 1998 to 2012 (1192 patients from nationwide pediatric studies [AML Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster studies 98 and 2004] and 4372 adults registered with the Munich Leukemia Laboratory). RESULTS: The frequencies of cytogenetic subgroups were age-dependent. Favorable subtypes (t(8;21), inv(16)/t(16;16), and t(15;17)) decreased in general from the pediatric age group (2 to < 18 years; 33%) to the oldest groups (<5% for > 70 years; P < .0001). Unfavorable cytogenetics (-7/del(7), -5/del(5q) or 5p, inv(3)/t(3;3), t(6;9), complex karyotype, 12p, 17p, and 11q23/mixed-lineage leukemia aberrations, excluding t(9;11)) were frequent (42%) in infants (<2 years), had a low frequency in children and young adults (<22%), and increased in frequency up to 36% in patients older than 85 years (P = .01). This was even more significant for complex karyotypes (P </= .0001), which also showed a strong increase in the absolute age-specific incidence with age. Interestingly, the frequency of 11q23 abnormalities decreased from infants to older patients. The proportion of clinically relevant molecular aberrations of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha, nucleophosmin (NPM1), and NPM1/fms-related tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication increased with age. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, with the exclusion of infants, a significant decrease in the proportion of favorable cytogenetic subtypes and an increase in unfavorable cytogenetics were observed with increasing age.

We performed whole-exome sequencing of 66 CLL families, identifying 4 families where loss-of-function mutations in protection of telomeres 1 (POT1) co-segregated with CLL. The p.Tyr36Cys mutation is predicted to disrupt the interaction between POT1 and the telomeric overhang. The c.1164-1G>A splice-site, p.Gln358SerfsTer13 frameshift, and p.Gln376Arg missense mutations are likely to impact the interaction between POT1 and adrenocortical dysplasia homolog (ACD), which is a part of the telomere-capping shelterin complex. We also identified mutations in ACD (c.752-2A>C) and another shelterin component, telomeric repeat binding factor 2, interacting protein (p.Ala104Pro and p.Arg133Gln), in 3 CLL families. In a complementary analysis of 1083 cases and 5854 controls, the POT1 p.Gln376Arg variant, which has a global minor allele frequency of 0.0005, conferred a 3.61-fold increased risk of CLL (P = .009).

By combined approaches of immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry and peptide library profiling, we identified the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) as a MELK-interacting protein during mitosis and a bona fide substrate of MELK. MELK phosphorylates eIF4B at Ser406, a modification found to be most robust in the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. We further show that the MELK-eIF4B signaling axis regulates protein synthesis during mitosis. Specifically, synthesis of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1), an antiapoptotic protein known to play a role in cancer cell survival during cell division, depends on the function of MELK-elF4B. Inactivation of MELK or eIF4B results in reduced protein synthesis of MCL1, which, in turn, induces apoptotic cell death of cancer cells. Our study thus defines a MELK-eIF4B signaling axis that regulates protein synthesis during mitosis, and consequently influences cancer cell survival.","['Wang, Yubao', 'Begley, Michael', 'Li, Qing', 'Huang, Hai-Tsang', 'Lako, Ana', 'Eck, Michael J', 'Gray, Nathanael S', 'Mitchison, Timothy J', 'Cantley, Lewis C', 'Zhao, Jean J']","['Wang Y', 'Begley M', 'Li Q', 'Huang HT', 'Lako A', 'Eck MJ', 'Gray NS', 'Mitchison TJ', 'Cantley LC', 'Zhao JJ']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115;', 'Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215; Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115;', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115;', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115;', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115;', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115;', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115;', 'Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115;', 'Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215; Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115; Meyer Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065 cantley@med.cornell.edu jean_zhao@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115; cantley@med.cornell.edu jean_zhao@dfci.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160815,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factors)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (eIF-4B)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MELK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', '*Mitosis', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Peptide Library', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['*MCL1', '*MELK', '*eIF4B', '*mitosis', '*protein synthesis']",2016/08/17 06:00,2018/01/26 06:00,['2016/08/17 06:00'],"['2017/02/28 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2016/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1606862113 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1606862113 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Aug 30;113(35):9810-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1606862113.

In this study, we investigated the effect of YM155 to enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in human renal carcinoma cells. We found that YM155 alone had no effect on apoptosis, however, combined treatment with YM155 and TRAIL markedly induced apoptosis in human renal carcinoma cells (Caki, ACHN, and A498), breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231), and glioma cells (U251MG), but not normal cells [mesangial cell (MC) and human skin fibroblast (HSF)]. YM155 induced down-regulation of Mcl-1 expression at the post-translational levels, and the overexpression of Mcl-1 markedly inhibited YM155 plus TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, YM155 induced down-regulation of c-FLIP mRNA expression through inhibition of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. Ectopic expression of c-FLIP markedly blocked YM155-induced TRAIL sensitization. Taken together, our results suggested that YM155 sensitizes TRAIL-mediated apoptosis via down-regulation of Mcl-1 and c-FLIP expression in renal carcinoma Caki cells.","['Woo, Seon Min', 'Min, Kyoung-Jin', 'Seo, Bo Ram', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu']","['Woo SM', 'Min KJ', 'Seo BR', 'Kwon TK']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (YM 155)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.22.27 (cathepsin S)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*drug therapy', 'Cathepsins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survivin', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Mcl-1', 'TRAIL', 'YM155', 'c-FLIP', 'lysosome']",2016/08/17 06:00,2018/01/31 06:00,['2016/08/17 06:00'],"['2016/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['11137 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11137 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 20;7(38):61520-61532. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11137.,10.18632/oncotarget.11137 [doi],,,,,PMC5308669,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PDXs can be serially passaged in vivo for years, and shared across laboratories. As a consequence, the potential for mis-identification and cross-contamination is possible, yet authentication of PDXs appears limited. We present a PDX Authentication System (PAS), by combining a commercially available OpenArray assay of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with in-house R studio programs, to validate PDXs established in individual mice from acute lymphoblastic leukemia biopsies. The PAS is sufficiently robust to identify contamination at levels as low as 3%, similar to the gold standard of short tandem repeat (STR) profiling. We have surveyed a panel of PDXs established from 73 individual leukemia patients, and found that the PAS provided sufficient discriminatory power to identify each xenograft. The identified SNP-discrepant PDXs demonstrated distinct gene expression profiles, indicating a risk of contamination for PDXs at high passage number. The PAS also allows for the authentication of tumor cells with complex karyotypes from solid tumors including prostate cancer and Ewing's sarcoma. This study highlights the demands of authenticating PDXs for cancer research, and evaluates a reliable authentication platform that utilizes a commercially available and cost-effective system.","['El-Hoss, Jad', 'Jing, Duohui', 'Evans, Kathryn', 'Toscan, Cara', 'Xie, Jinhan', 'Lee, Hyunjoo', 'Taylor, Renea A', 'Lawrence, Mitchell G', 'Risbridger, Gail P', 'MacKenzie, Karen L', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Lock, Richard B']","['El-Hoss J', 'Jing D', 'Evans K', 'Toscan C', 'Xie J', 'Lee H', 'Taylor RA', 'Lawrence MG', 'Risbridger GP', 'MacKenzie KL', 'Sutton R', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, Sydney, UNSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, Sydney, UNSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, Sydney, UNSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, Sydney, UNSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, Sydney, UNSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, Sydney, UNSW, Australia."", 'Prostate Research Group, Department of Physiology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash Partners Comprehensive Cancer Consortium, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'Prostate Research Group, Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash Partners Comprehensive Cancer Consortium, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'Prostate Research Group, Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash Partners Comprehensive Cancer Consortium, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, Sydney, UNSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, Sydney, UNSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, Sydney, UNSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chimerism', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', '*Genotype', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*genetics', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['OpenArray', 'R studio', 'SNP genotyping', 'authentication', 'patient derived xenografts']",2016/08/17 06:00,2018/01/31 06:00,['2016/08/17 06:00'],"['2015/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['11125 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11125 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 13;7(37):60475-60490. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11125.,10.18632/oncotarget.11125 [doi],,,,,PMC5312397,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. The objective of the current cross-sectional retrospective study is to address a potential correlation between Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) treatment and CV events. One hundred and 10 chronic phase CML patients in complete cytogenetic response during nilotinib or imatinib, were screened for CV events and evaluated for: traditional CV risk factors, pro/anti-inflammatory biochemical parameters and detrimental ORL1 gene polymorphisms (encoding for altered oxidized LDL receptor-1). Multivariate analysis of the whole cohort showed that the cluster of co-existing nilotinib treatment, dyslipidaemia and G allele of LOX-1 polymorphism was the only significant finding associated with CV events. Furthermore, multivariate analysis according to TKI treatment confirmed IVS4-14 G/G LOX-1 polymorphism as the strongest predictive factor for a higher incidence of CV events in nilotinib patients. Biochemical assessment showed an unbalanced pro-inflammatory cytokines network in nilotinib vs imatinib patients. Surprisingly, pre-existing traditional CV risk factors were not always predictive of CV events. We believe that in nilotinib patients an induced ""inflammatory/oxidative status"", together with a genetic pro-atherothrombotic predisposition, may favour the increased incidence of CV events. Prospective studies focused on this issue are ongoing.","['Bocchia, Monica', 'Galimberti, Sara', 'Aprile, Lara', 'Sicuranza, Anna', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Santilli, Francesca', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Barate, Claudia', 'Scappini, Barbara', 'Fontanelli, Giulia', 'Trawinska, Monika Malgorzata', 'Defina, Marzia', 'Gozzetti, Alessandro', 'Bosi, Alberto', 'Petrini, Mario', 'Puccetti, Luca']","['Bocchia M', 'Galimberti S', 'Aprile L', 'Sicuranza A', 'Gozzini A', 'Santilli F', 'Abruzzese E', 'Barate C', 'Scappini B', 'Fontanelli G', 'Trawinska MM', 'Defina M', 'Gozzetti A', 'Bosi A', 'Petrini M', 'Puccetti L']","['Department of Hematology, University of Siena, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, U.O.

Increased expression of ST8SIA4 has been reported in diverse carcinomas and highly correlates with leukemia multidrug resistance (MDR). MicroRNAs (miRNA) are widely recognized as key players in cancer progression and drug resistance. Here, to explore whether miRNA modulates the sensitivity of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) to chemotherapeutic agents and regulates ST8SIA4 expression, we analyzed the complete miRNA expression profile and found a subset of miRNAs specifically dysregulated in adriamycin-resistant CML cell line K562/ADR and its parent cell line K562. Compared with three pairs of CML cell lines and 38 clinical samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of CML patients, miR-181c expression was down-regulated in drug-resistant cell lines and CML/MDR samples. Altered expression levels of miR-181c influenced the MDR phenotypes of K562 and K562/ADR. Reporter-gene assay showed that miR-181c directly targeted and inhibited the ST8SIA4 expression, as well as miR-181c was inversely correlated with the levels of ST8SIA4 expression in CML cell lines and samples. Moreover, ST8SIA4 could reverse the effect of miR-181c on drug resistance in K562 and K562/ADR cells in vitro. Upregulation of miR-181c sensitized K562/ADR cells to adriamycin in vivo through directly suppressing ST8SIA4 expression. Further investigation showed that miR-181c mediated the activity of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT signal pathway, and inhibition of PI3K/Akt in K562 cells counteracted miR-181c-mediated MDR phenotype. These data revealed an important role for miR-181c in the regulation of chemoresistance in CML, and suggested the potential application of miR-181c in drug resistance treatment.","['Zhao, Lifen', 'Li, Yan', 'Song, Xiaobo', 'Zhou, Huimin', 'Li, Nana', 'Miao, Yuan', 'Jia, Li']","['Zhao L', 'Li Y', 'Song X', 'Zhou H', 'Li N', 'Miao Y', 'Jia L']","['College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Tromso, Tromso, Norway.', 'Department of Microbiology, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (ST8SIA4 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Sialyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects/genetics', '*Up-Regulation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['PI3K/AKT', 'ST8SIA4', 'chemoresistance', 'chronic myelocytic leukemia', 'miR-181c']",2016/08/17 06:00,2018/02/06 06:00,['2016/08/17 06:00'],"['2016/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['11054 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11054 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 13;7(37):60074-60086. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11054.,10.18632/oncotarget.11054 [doi],,,,,PMC5312369,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, 369 MDS patients diagnosed according to the WHO 2008 criteria were recruited. h-MDS patients had lower PB white blood cell and blast counts, and lower BM blast percentages, than those with NH-MDS. h-MDS was closely associated with lower-risk MDS, defined by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and revised IPSS (IPSS-R). IPSS-R could properly predict the prognosis in h-MDS (P<0.001) as in NH-MDS patients. The h-MDS patients had lower incidences of RUNX1, ASXL1, DNMT3A, EZH2 and TP53 mutations than NH-MDS patients. The cumulated incidence of acute leukemic transformation at 5 years was 19.3% for h-MDS and 40.4% for NH-MDS patients (P= 0.001). Further, the patients with h-MDS had longer overall survival (OS) than those with NH-MDS (P= 0.001), and BM hypocellularity remains an independent favorable prognostic factor for OS irrespective of age, IPSS-R, and gene mutations. Our findings provide evidence that h-MDS indeed represent a distinct clinico-biological subgroup of MDS and can predict better leukemia-free survival and OS.","['Yao, Chi-Yuan', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Lin, Tzung-Yi', 'Lin, Chien-Chin', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Tseng, Mei-Hsuan', 'Chiang, Ying-Chieh', 'Liu, Ming-Chih', 'Liu, Chia-Wen', 'Kuo, Yuan-Yeh', 'Wu, Shang-Ju', 'Liao, Xiu-Wen', 'Lin, Chien-Ting', 'Ko, Bor-Shen', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Hsu, Szu-Chun', 'Li, Chi-Cheng', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Yao, Ming', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Liu, Chieh-Yu', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Yao CY', 'Hou HA', 'Lin TY', 'Lin CC', 'Chou WC', 'Tseng MH', 'Chiang YC', 'Liu MC', 'Liu CW', 'Kuo YY', 'Wu SJ', 'Liao XW', 'Lin CT', 'Ko BS', 'Chen CY', 'Hsu SC', 'Li CC', 'Huang SY', 'Yao M', 'Tang JL', 'Tsay W', 'Liu CY', 'Tien HF']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Oncology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Tai-Cheng Stem Cell Therapy Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Tai-Cheng Stem Cell Therapy Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Tai-Cheng Stem Cell Therapy Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Tai-Cheng Stem Cell Therapy Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Biostatistics Consulting Laboratory, Department of Nursing, National Taipei College of Nursing, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', '*DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Taiwan', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['bone marrow hypocellularity', 'gene mutation', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'prognosis', 'revised international prognostic scoring system']",2016/08/17 06:00,2018/04/19 06:00,['2016/08/17 06:00'],"['2016/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['11050 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11050 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 27;7(39):63177-63188. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11050.,10.18632/oncotarget.11050 [doi],,,,,PMC5325355,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The unstable nature of the drug, however, offers a major obstacle in its effective formulation development. The present study was aimed to achieve improved stability and efficacy of bendamustine via co-polymeric PEG-PLGA nanoparticulate approach. PEG-PLGA co-polymeric conjugate was synthesized and characterized by FT-IR and (1)H NMR spectroscopy. Bendamustine loaded nanoparticles (PLGA and PEG-PLGA) were prepared, optimized and characterized for size, zeta and electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). The average size, pdi (polydispersity index), zeta potential and entrapment efficiency for bendamustine loaded PEG-PLGA nanoparticles (PPBNP 15) was 297.3+/-2.055nm, 0.256+/-0.012, -6.62+/-0.081mV and 52.30+/-3.66%, respectively. The in vitro release studies displayed sustained release nature of bendamustine. The Krosmeyer-Peppas model was the best fit model as a result of kinetic modelling for in vitro release. The ex vivo hemolytic toxicity of the PPBNP 15 was significantly less (approx. 11%; 4 folds) compared to pure drug (p<0.05). The cytotoxicity study showed significantly higher anticancer activity against MCF-7, T47D and PC-3 cells (p<0.05) compared to naive bendamustine. The developed biodegradable nanoparticles improved the stability of bendamustine and were equally stable, less toxic and highly effective against different cancerous cells.","['Khan, Iliyas', 'Gothwal, Avinash', 'Sharma, Ashok Kumar', 'Qayum, Arem', 'Singh, Shashank K', 'Gupta, Umesh']","['Khan I', 'Gothwal A', 'Sharma AK', 'Qayum A', 'Singh SK', 'Gupta U']","['Department of Pharmacy, School of Chemical Sciences and Pharmacy, Central University of Rajasthan, Bandarsindri, Ajmer, Rajasthan-305817, India.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School of Chemical Sciences and Pharmacy, Central University of Rajasthan, Bandarsindri, Ajmer, Rajasthan-305817, India.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School of Chemical Sciences and Pharmacy, Central University of Rajasthan, Bandarsindri, Ajmer, Rajasthan-305817, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu-180001, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu-180001, India.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School of Chemical Sciences and Pharmacy, Central University of Rajasthan, Bandarsindri, Ajmer, Rajasthan-305817, India.

We report 2 cases of leg ulcers in cancer patients treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, sunitinib and nilotinib, and we discuss the role of these treatments in the pathogenesis of leg ulcers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case 1. A 62-year-old patient on sunitinib for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma developed a lesion on her right foot. The vascular evaluation was negative. After progressive worsening, sunitinib was stopped and healing was observed within a few months. Case 2. A 83-year-old patient had been treated for chronic myeloid leukemia since 2005. Nilotinib was introduced in 2009. Peripheral arterial revascularization was required in May 2013. A few months later, worsening was noted with the onset of ulceration and necrosis of the third toe. Further revascularisation surgery was performed, and nilotinib was suspended and antiplatelets introduced. Healing occurred a few months later. DISCUSSION: Many skin reactions have been described in patients on nilotinib and sunitinib, but few publications report the development of de novo ulcers in patients without risk factors. The pathophysiology of the development of ulcers in patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors is not clear, and probably involves several mechanisms of action. The increasing use of this type of treatment could lead to an upsurge in the incidence of vascular complications. CONCLUSION: We report two cases of leg ulcers developing in patients on tyrosine kinase inhibitors and raise the question of causal implication of these treatments in the pathogenesis of ulcers.","['Roger, A', 'Sigal, M-L', 'Bagan, P', 'Sin, C', 'Bilan, P', 'Dakhil, B', 'Fargeas, C', 'Couffinhal, J-C', 'Mahe, E']","['Roger A', 'Sigal ML', 'Bagan P', 'Sin C', 'Bilan P', 'Dakhil B', 'Fargeas C', 'Couffinhal JC', 'Mahe E']","[""Service de dermatologie et medecine vasculaire, centre hospitalier Victor-Dupouy, 69, rue du Lieutenant-Colonel-Prud'hon, 95107 Argenteuil cedex, France."", ""Service de dermatologie et medecine vasculaire, centre hospitalier Victor-Dupouy, 69, rue du Lieutenant-Colonel-Prud'hon, 95107 Argenteuil cedex, France."", ""Service de chirurgie thoracique et vasculaire, centre hospitalier Victor-Dupouy, 69, rue du Lieutenant-Colonel-Prud'hon, 95107 Argenteuil cedex, France."", ""Service de dermatologie et medecine vasculaire, centre hospitalier Victor-Dupouy, 69, rue du Lieutenant-Colonel-Prud'hon, 95107 Argenteuil cedex, France."", ""Service de dermatologie et medecine vasculaire, centre hospitalier Victor-Dupouy, 69, rue du Lieutenant-Colonel-Prud'hon, 95107 Argenteuil cedex, France."", ""Service de chirurgie thoracique et vasculaire, centre hospitalier Victor-Dupouy, 69, rue du Lieutenant-Colonel-Prud'hon, 95107 Argenteuil cedex, France."", ""Service de dermatologie et medecine vasculaire, centre hospitalier Victor-Dupouy, 69, rue du Lieutenant-Colonel-Prud'hon, 95107 Argenteuil cedex, France."", ""Service de chirurgie thoracique et vasculaire, centre hospitalier Victor-Dupouy, 69, rue du Lieutenant-Colonel-Prud'hon, 95107 Argenteuil cedex, France."", ""Service de dermatologie et medecine vasculaire, centre hospitalier Victor-Dupouy, 69, rue du Lieutenant-Colonel-Prud'hon, 95107 Argenteuil cedex, France.

The aim of this study was to explore the caspase dependent apoptotic pathway and autophagy inducing ability of gold nanoparticles tagged snake venom protein toxin NKCT1 (GNP-NKCT1) in human leukemic U937 and K562 cell line. METHODS: GNP-NKCT1 induced apoptosis in U937 and K562 cell line were assessed through mitochondrial membrane potential assay, ROS generation assay, caspase 3 pathways and western blotting. GNP-NKCT1 induced autophagic pathway was detected through Akt, mTOR and PI3K expression by western blotting. Autophagic cell death also checked after addition of caspase 3 inhibitor and which also reconfirmed by western blotting of autophagic marker protein, lysosomal staining. RESULTS: Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was occurred in both the leukemic cell line after induction by GNP-NKCT1 and treatment of which also exhibited high ROS generation. Caspase 3 expression of cell was also increased. With caspase 3 inhibitor, GNP-NKCT1 downregulated PI3K/Akt and mTOR expression and thus undergoing autophagic cell death. Lysosomal staining confirmed lysosomal enzyme involvement in the autophagic response. Up regulation of Atg 3, Atg12, Beclin 1, LC3-II protein and BIF-1 and down regulation of Atg4B were also showed by blotting. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that conjugation of Gold nanoparticles with NKCT1 could induce an alternate cell death pathway other than apoptosis in the form of autophagy in leukemic cell. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study might provide the understanding area of chemotherapeutic drug development from natural resources like snake venoms.","['Bhowmik, Tanmoy', 'Gomes, Antony']","['Bhowmik T', 'Gomes A']","['Lab of Toxinology and Exp.

All children and adolescent acute leukemia patients will undergo chemotherapy as part of their treatment regimen. Fortunately, survival rates for most pediatric cancers have improved at a remarkable pace over the past three decades, and the overall survival rate is greater than 90 % today. However, significant differences in survival rate have been found in different age groups (94 % in 1-9.99 years, 82 % in >/=10 years and 76 % in >/=15 years). ALL accounts for about three out of four cases of childhood leukemia. Intensive chemotherapy treatment coupled with prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotic use could potentially have a long-term effect on the resident gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome. The composition of GI microbiome and its changes upon chemotherapy in pediatric and adolescent leukemia patients is poorly understood. In this study, using 16S rRNA marker gene sequences we profile the GI microbial communities of pediatric and adolescent acute leukemia patients before and after chemotherapy treatment and compare with the microbiota of their healthy siblings. RESULTS: Our study cohort consisted of 51 participants, made up of matched pediatric and adolescent patients with ALL and a healthy sibling. We elucidated and compared the GI microbiota profiles of patients and their healthy sibling controls via analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. We assessed the GI microbiota composition in pediatric and adolescent patients with ALL during the course of chemotherapy by comparing stool samples taken before chemotherapy with stool samples collected at varying time points during the chemotherapeutic treatment. The microbiota profiles of both patients and control sibling groups are dominated by members of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Faecalibacterium. At the genus level, both groups share many taxa in common, but the microbiota diversity of the patient group is significantly lower than that of the control group. It was possible to distinguish between the patient and control groups based on their microbiota profiles. The top taxa include Anaerostipes, Coprococcus, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus2 with relatively higher abundance in the control group. The observed microbiota changes are likely the result of several factors including a direct influence of therapeutic compounds on the gut flora and an indirect effect of chemotherapy on the immune system, which, in turn, affects the microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides significant information on GI microbiota populations in immunocompromised children and opens up the potential for developing novel diagnostics based on stool tests and therapies to improve the dysbiotic condition of the microbiota at the time of diagnosis and in the earliest stages of chemotherapy.","['Rajagopala, Seesandra V', 'Yooseph, Shibu', 'Harkins, Derek M', 'Moncera, Kelvin J', 'Zabokrtsky, Keri B', 'Torralba, Manolito G', 'Tovchigrechko, Andrey', 'Highlander, Sarah K', 'Pieper, Rembert', 'Sender, Leonard', 'Nelson, Karen E']","['Rajagopala SV', 'Yooseph S', 'Harkins DM', 'Moncera KJ', 'Zabokrtsky KB', 'Torralba MG', 'Tovchigrechko A', 'Highlander SK', 'Pieper R', 'Sender L', 'Nelson KE']","['J.

We showed that PML deficiency leads to an increased number of DNA lesions, which was accompanied by changes in histone signature. In PML wt cells, we observed two mobile fractions of 53BP1 protein with distinct diffusion in spontaneous lesions. These protein fractions were not detected in PML-deficient cells, characterized by slow-diffusion of 53BP1. Single particle tracking analysis revealed limited local motion of 53BP1 foci in PML double null cells and local motion 53BP1 foci was even more reduced after gamma-irradiation. However, radiation did not change co-localization between 53BP1 nuclear bodies and interchromatin granule-associated zones (IGAZs), nuclear speckles, or chromocenters. This newly observed interaction pattern imply that 53BP1 protein could be a part of not only DNA repair, but also process mediated via components accumulated in IGAZs, nuclear speckles, or paraspeckles. Together, PML deficiency affected local motion of 53BP1 nuclear bodies and changed composition and a number of irradiation-induced foci. J. Cell. Biochem. 117: 2583-2596, 2016.

The main aim of this study was to investigate whether peripheral blood (PB) MRD measurement at day 8 (D8) could predict the risk stratification category determined by bone marrow (BM) MRD at day 15 (D15). The study was performed prospectively, in a cohort of 40 children with B-lineage ALL, adopting the protocol of the Brazilian Cooperative Group of the Treatment Childhood Leukemia (GBTLI-2009). MRD was detected by flow cytometry (FC) using a simplifed panel that can reliably identify MRD at early phases of induction therapy. Upon diagnosis, the proportion of low and high-risk patients, was 24:16 (60%:40%). The main result of our study demonstrated the potential of D8 MRD in anticipating of week the risk stratification of high-risk patients as determined by D15 BM MRD. In these patients D8 MRD level of 1% was able to segregate high risk fast responders from high risk slow responders (p = 0.0097). This result could represent an opportunity for early treatment intensification, as already performed in some protocols.","['Salina, Thais Ditolvo da Costa', 'Ferreira, Yvelise Antunes', 'Alves, Eliana Brasil', 'Ferreira, Cristina Motta', 'De Paula, Erich Vinicius', 'Mira, Marcelo Tavora', 'Passos, Leny da Mota']","['Salina TD', 'Ferreira YA', 'Alves EB', 'Ferreira CM', 'De Paula EV', 'Mira MT', 'Passos Lda M']","['Hematology and Hemotherapy Foundation of Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Foundation of Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Foundation of Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Foundation of Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Foundation of Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, University of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Foundation of Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brazil.', 'Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Foundation of Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160816,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",,,2016/08/17 06:00,2018/05/03 06:00,['2016/08/17 06:00'],"['2016/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['srep31179 [pii]', '10.1038/srep31179 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Aug 16;6:31179. doi: 10.1038/srep31179.,10.1038/srep31179 [doi],,,,,PMC4985643,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current clinical study protocols rely on the ex vivo expansion of donor T reg cells and their infusion in high numbers. In this study, we present a novel strategy for inhibiting GvHD that is based on the in vivo expansion of recipient T reg cells before allo-HCT, exploiting the crucial role of tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) in T reg cell biology. Expanding radiation-resistant host T reg cells in recipient mice using a mouse TNFR2-selective agonist before allo-HCT significantly prolonged survival and reduced GvHD severity in a TNFR2- and T reg cell-dependent manner. The beneficial effects of transplanted T cells against leukemia cells and infectious pathogens remained unaffected. A corresponding human TNFR2-specific agonist expanded human T reg cells in vitro. These observations indicate the potential of our strategy to protect allo-HCT patients from acute GvHD by expanding T reg cells via selective TNFR2 activation in vivo.","['Chopra, Martin', 'Biehl,

However, the etiological nature of neurologic complications remains a conundrum. In our study, the evidence of blood-brain barrier (BBB)-penetrating CAR T cells as a culprit was revealed. A patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia developed sustained pyrexia with tremors about 6 h after CART19 infusion, followed by a grade 2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurological symptoms in the next 3 days. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance showed signs of intracranial edema. Lumbar puncture on day 5 showed an over 400-mmH2O cerebrospinal pressure. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contained 20 WBCs/muL with predominant CD3+ T cells. qPCR analysis for CAR constructs showed 3,032,265 copies/mug DNA in CSF and 988,747 copies/mug DNA in blood. Cytokine levels including IFN-gamma and IL-6 in CSF were extremely higher than those in the serum. Methyprednisone was administrated and the symptoms relieved gradually. The predominance of CART19 in CSF and the huge discrepancies in cytokine distributions indicated the development of a cerebral CRS, presumably featured as CSF cytokines largely in situ produced by BBB-penetrating CAR T cells. For the first time, we reported the development of cerebral CRS triggered by BBB-penetrating CAR T cells.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chromatin accessibility uncovers unique regulatory evolution in cancer cells with a progressively increasing mutation burden. Single AML cells exhibit distinctive mixed regulome profiles corresponding to disparate developmental stages.

PT-Cy has also been used in matched related (MRD) and unrelated (MUD) settings. It is not known whether outcomes are similar between haplo-HCT and MRD/MUD HCT when PT-Cy is used. We performed a retrospective analysis of 83 patients with AML who underwent HCT (using PT-Cy-based GvHD prophylaxis) from MRD, MUD or haploidentical donors. The groups were similar in baseline characteristics with the exception of older age in the MRD/MUD group (P=0.012). In multivariate analysis, the effect of donor type (MRD/MUD vs haploidentical) on transplant outcomes was not significant in any of the models except for faster neutrophil recovery after MRD/MUD transplants (hazard ratio: 2.21; 95% confidence interval: 1.31-3.72, P=0.002). In conclusion, we showed similar outcomes in MRD/MUD vs haploidentical HCT (except slower count recovery following haplo-HCT) when PT-Cy is used for GvHD prophylaxis. Although slower count recovery following haplo-HCT (compared with MRD/MUD transplants without PT-Cy) has been attributed to using PT-Cy, our results suggest that HLA disparity is the primary cause of this difference.

However, NPMc(+) alone displays low leukemogenic activity and cooperating events appear crucial for AML to develop. Dysregulation of homeobox genes, such as HOXA9 and MEIS1, is a common transcriptional signature of NPMc(+) AML. Furthermore, the pathogenic role for NPMc(+) in AML remains incompletely understood. AIM: To elucidate if NPMc(+) collaborates with Meis1 or Hoxa9 in the evolvement of AML. METHODS: Murine bone marrow cells were genetically engineered to express mutated NPM1 variant A in combination with overexpression of Meis1 or Hoxa9. The capacity of the transduced cells to transform in vitro and to cause leukemia in vivo was then assessed. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION: There was no synergy between NPMc(+) and Meis1 or Hoxa9 in causing leukemogenic transformation of murine bone marrow cells, or in inducing AML in a transplantation model. Hence, overexpression of Meis1 or Hoxa9 in combination with NPMc(+) expression was not sufficient to generate an NPMc(+) AML mouse model.","['Wiktorin, Hanna Grauers', 'Nilsson, Tina', 'Jansson, Ann', 'Palmqvist, Lars', 'Martner, Anna']","['Wiktorin HG', 'Nilsson T', 'Jansson A', 'Palmqvist L', 'Martner A']","['Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Bruna Straket 16, 413 45 Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Bruna Straket 16, 413 45 Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Bruna Straket 16, 413 45 Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160811,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Hoxa9', 'Meis1', 'NPM1']",2015/01/01 00:00,2015/01/01 00:01,['2016/08/16 06:00'],"['2016/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-016-0053-2 [doi]', '53 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2016 Aug 11;5:25. doi: 10.1186/s40164-016-0053-2. eCollection 2015.,10.1186/s40164-016-0053-2 [doi],,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9274-360X'],,,PMC4982317,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous study using acute promyelocytic leukemia cells uncovered its effect on the downregulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) which is often overexpressed in cancer cells resulting in the repression of tumor suppressors via hypermethylation. Herein, we explored the effects of THL in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that also demonstrate elevated DNMT1. The results show that THL dose-dependently downregulated DNMT1 accompanied by the induction of tumor suppressors such as p21 and p15. THL arrested cell cycle in G2/M phase and decreased the protein levels of cyclin A, cyclin B1, phospho-pRb, and AKT. DNMT1 inhibition was previously reported to exert a radiosensitizing effect in cancer cells through the repression of DNA repair. We found that THL enhanced radiation-induced clonogenic cell death in MCF-7 cells and decreased the level of DNA double-strand break repair protein, Rad51. Our observations may be the result of DNMT1 downregulation. Due to the fact that DNMT1 inhibition is now a mainstream strategy for anticancer therapy, further clinical trials of THL to confirm its clinical efficacy are warranted.","['Yao, Chih-Jung', 'Chow, Jyh-Ming', 'Yang, Chia-Ming', 'Kuo, Hui-Ching', 'Chang, Chia-Lun', 'Lee, Hsin-Lun', 'Lai, I-Chun', 'Chuang, Shuang-En', 'Lai, Gi-Ming']","['Yao CJ', 'Chow JM', 'Yang CM', 'Kuo HC', 'Chang CL', 'Lee HL', 'Lai IC', 'Chuang SE', 'Lai GM']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan; Cancer Center, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11696, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan; Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11696, Taiwan.', 'Formosa Cancer Foundation, Taipei 10597, Taiwan.', 'Cancer Center, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11696, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11696, Taiwan.', 'The Ph.D. Program for Translational Medicine, Taipei Medical University-Academia Sinica, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.', 'Division of Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei 11217, Taiwan.', 'National Institute of Cancer Research, National Health Research Institutes, Miaoli County 35053, Taiwan.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan; Cancer Center, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11696, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan; Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11696, Taiwan; National Institute of Cancer Research, National Health Research Institutes, Miaoli County 35053, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160720,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,,,2016/08/16 06:00,2016/08/16 06:01,['2016/08/16 06:00'],"['2016/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2016/3251046 [doi]'],ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2016;2016:3251046. doi: 10.1155/2016/3251046.

SNP rs539846 C>A, the most highly associated variant (p = 1.42 x 10(-13), odds ratio = 1.35), localizes to a super-enhancer defined by extensive histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation in intron 3 of B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2)-modifying factor (BMF). The rs539846-A risk allele alters a conserved RELA-binding motif, disrupts RELA binding, and is associated with decreased BMF expression in CLL.

METHODS: The prospective descriptive observational study was conducted at the National Institute of Child Health, Karachi, June 2005 to May 2007, and comprised newly-diagnosed cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Bone marrow aspiration was done on reappearance of blast cells in peripheral smear and cerebrospinal fluid. Detailed report was done each time when intra-thecal chemotherapy was given or there were signs and symptoms suggestive of central nervous system relapse. SPSS 12 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients enrolled, 4(6.6%) expired and 1(1.7%) was lost to follow-up. Of the 55(91.6%) who comprised the study sample, 35(58%) were males and 25(42%) females. Mean age of relapse was 6.8+/-3.27 years. Mean time to relapse from diagnosis was 1.3+/-0.54 years; 12(20%) patients suffered relapse, and of them 5(14%) were boys.

Mutations in SF3B1, a component of the U2 splicing complex, are the most common. SF3B1 mutations are associated with aberrant pre-mRNA splicing using cryptic 3' splice sites (3'SSs), but the mechanism of their selection is not clear. To understand how cryptic 3'SSs are selected, we performed comprehensive analysis of transcriptome-wide changes to splicing and gene expression associated with SF3B1 mutations in patient samples as well as an experimental model of inducible expression. Hundreds of cryptic 3'SS were detectable across the genome in cells expressing mutant SF3B1. These 3'SS are typically sequestered within RNA secondary structures and poorly accessible compared with their corresponding canonical 3'SS. We hypothesized that these cryptic 3'SS are inaccessible during normal splicing catalysis and that this constraint is overcome in spliceosomes containing mutant SF3B1. This model of secondary structure-dependent selection of cryptic 3'SS was found across multiple clonal processes associated with SF3B1 mutations (myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic lymphocytic leukemia). We validated our model predictions in mini-gene splicing assays. Additionally, we found deregulated expression of proteins with relevant functions in splicing factor-related diseases both in association with aberrant splicing and without corresponding splicing changes. Our results show that SF3B1 mutations are associated with a distinct splicing program shared across multiple clonal processes and define a biochemical mechanism for altered 3'SS choice.","['Kesarwani, A K', 'Ramirez, O', 'Gupta, A K', 'Yang, X', 'Murthy, T', 'Minella, A C', 'Pillai, M M']","['Kesarwani AK', 'Ramirez O', 'Gupta AK', 'Yang X', 'Murthy T', 'Minella AC', 'Pillai MM']","['Section of Hematology, Yale Cancer Center and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Yale Cancer Center and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Yale Cancer Center and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Yale Cancer Center and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Driskill Graduate Program, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Blood Research Institute, BloodCenter of Wisconsin, Milwaukee WI, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Yale Cancer Center and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160815,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Splice Sites)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'RNA Splice Sites/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing Factors/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*chemistry/genetics', 'Spliceosomes', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2016/08/16 06:00,2017/09/14 06:00,['2016/08/16 06:00'],"['2016/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016279 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.279 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Feb 23;36(8):1123-1133. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.279.

In this study, a high MDM2 transcription level was observed (41.17%) regardless of p53 expression in patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Therefore, we performed genome-scale functional screening of the human genes modulating MDM2 expression in a p53-independent manner. We searched co-expression profiles of genes showing a positive or negative pattern with MDM2 expression in a DNA microarray database, selected1089 links, and composed a screening library of 368 genes. Using MDM2 P1 and P2 promoter-reporter systems, we screened clones regulating MDM2 transcriptions in a p53-independent manner by overexpression. Nine clones from the screening library showed enhanced MDM2 promoter activity and MDM2 expression in p53-deficient HCT116 cells. Among them, six clones, including NTRK2, GNA15, SFRS2, EIF5A, ELAVL1, and YWHAB mediated MAPK signaling for expressing MDM2. These results indicate that p53-independent upregulation of MDM2 by increasing selected clones may lead to oncogenesis in AML and that MDM2-modulating genes are novel potential targets for AML treatment.","['Kim, Dong Min', 'Choi, Seung-Hyun', 'Yeom, Young Il', 'Min, Sang-Hyun', 'Kim, Il-Chul']","['Kim DM', 'Choi SH', 'Yeom YI', 'Min SH', 'Kim IC']","['Center for Applied Life Science, Hanbat National University, Taejon, 305-719, Republic of Korea.', 'Genome Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, 519-763, Republic of Korea.', 'Medical Genomics Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, 125 Gwahangno, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 305-806, Republic of Korea.', 'New Drug Development Center, Daegu-Gyeongbuk Medical Innovation Foundation, Daegu, 41061, Republic of Korea.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data from 245 patients with newly diagnosed de novo non-M3 subtypes of AML at the Tongji Hospital from January 2010 to December 2014. RESULTS: The comparison results indicated that the D-dimer values were higher in patients with AML with the following characteristics: WBC count >/= 20 x 10(9)/L (2.20 versus 6.00, P = 0.001), percentage of bone marrow (BM) blasts >/= 60% (2.06 versus 5.69, P = 0.003), and poor-risk stratification (P < 0.001). Cox univariate regression analysis showed that overall survival was negatively affected by the following factors: age > 60 years, poor-risk stratification, BM blast cell count >/=60%, and D-dimer >/=1mug/mL. Multivariate analysis showed that only age > 60 years (P < 0.001), BM blast cell counts >/=60% (P = 0.001) and D-dimer values >/=1mug/mL (P = 0.014) were independent adverse prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: D-dimer >/=1mug/mL is related to high tumor burden and can be considered as an independent prognostic factor in patients with de novo non-M3 AML.","['Geng, Yudi', 'Jian, Cui', 'Yang, Shijia', 'Wu, Sijing', 'Zhou, Jianfeng', 'Li, Dengju']","['Geng Y', 'Jian C', 'Yang S', 'Wu S', 'Zhou J', 'Li D']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Clinical laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.

Bakkenolide A (Bak), extracted from Petasites tricholobus, has been suggested to against cancer and display protective effects on inflammatory cytokines formation. And increasing evidences suggest that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) plays vital roles in cancer formation and persistence via cell death, apoptosis and inflammation. But the function of Bakkenolide A in regulating leukemia is not understood yet, particularly via HDAC3. Here, we found that HDAC3 is up-regulated in clinical samples of leukemia compared with adjacent normal tissues. Then the expression of HDAC3 was knocked down via RNA interference in K562 cells. And inhibition of HDAC3 expression is able to improve leukemia invasion, migration and proliferation. Further, we also found HDAC3 bound to IkappaBalpha, affecting subsequent inflammation response. Moreover, Bakkenolide A was found to inhibit inflammation, induce apoptosis and cell death in leukemia cells via PI3K-regulated signaling pathway, down-regulating IKKs expression and suppressing in proinflammatory cytokines of IL-1beta, IL-18 and TNF-alpha. Up-regulation of Caspase3/7 was observed in cells of HDAC3-knockdown and Bakkenolide A treatment, inducing leukemia cell apoptosis.

We included 314 patients who underwent transplantation from 1997 to 2012 and were enrolled in the multicenter French Leucemie de l'Enfant et de L'Adolescent (""Leukemia in Children and Adolescents"") cohort. More than one-third of the patients were adults at last visit; mean follow-up duration was 6.2 years. At least 1 late effect was observed in 284 of 314 patients (90.4%). The average number of adverse late effects was 2.1 +/- .1, 2.4 +/- .2, and 2.4 +/- .2 after SD, MUD, and UCB transplantation, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, considering the SD group as the reference, we did not detect an impact of donor type for most sequelae, with the exception of increased risk of major growth failure after MUD transplantation (odds ratio [OR], 2.42) and elevated risk of osteonecrosis after UCB transplantation (OR, 4.15). The adults and children's parents reported comparable QoL among the 3 groups. Adult patient QoL scores were lower than age- and sex-matched French reference scores for almost all dimensions.

We assessed cancer incidence for all cancers combined and 27 major types according to national human development levels. Using GLOBOCAN data for 184 countries, age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) were assessed by four levels (low, medium, high, very high) of the Human Development Index (HDI), a composite index of life expectancy, education, and gross national income. A strong positive relationship between overall cancer incidence and HDI level was observed. When comparing the ASR in very high HDI regions with that in low HDI regions, we observed a positive association ranging from 2 to 14 and 2 to 11 times higher in males and females, respectively, depending on the cancer type. Positive dose-response relationships between the ASR and HDI level were observed in both sexes for the following cancer types: lung, pancreas, leukemia, gallbladder, colorectum, brain/nervous system, kidney, multiple myeloma, and thyroid. Positive associations were also observed for testicular, bladder, lip/oral cavity, and other pharyngeal cancers, Hodgkin lymphoma, and melanoma of the skin in males, and corpus uteri, breast, and ovarian cancers and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in females. A negative dose-response relationship was observed for cervical and other pharyngeal cancers and Kaposi sarcoma in females. Although the relationship between incidence and the HDI remained when assessed at the country-specific level, variations in risk within HDI levels were also observed. We highlight positive and negative associations between incidence and human development for most cancers, which will aid the planning of cancer control priorities among countries undergoing human development transitions.","['Fidler, Miranda M', 'Soerjomataram, Isabelle', 'Bray, Freddie']","['Fidler MM', 'Soerjomataram I', 'Bray F']","['Section of Cancer Surveillance, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Cedex 08, Lyon, France. fidlerm@fellows.iarc.fr.', 'Section of Cancer Surveillance, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Cedex 08, Lyon, France.', 'Section of Cancer Surveillance, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Cedex 08, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160830,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Developed Countries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Developing Countries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Global Health', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/economics/*epidemiology', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*human development', '*incidence', '*international', '*socioeconomic']",2016/08/16 06:00,2017/05/13 06:00,['2016/08/14 06:00'],"['2016/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.30382 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2016 Dec 1;139(11):2436-46. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30382.

A key prognostic factor of glioma is radiosensitivity. It has also been known that microRNAs (miR) significantly contribute to the development of glioma. miR-132 has been previously reported to inhibit tumor growth in some cancers, but not well studied in glioma. It is necessary to understand the association between miR-132 and glioma, including miR-132 expression in glioma, effects of miR-132 on cancer metastasis and radiosensitivity, and the involved molecular mechanism. We first explored the expression levels of miR-132 in human normal and glioma tissues, then correlated the expression levels with different stages of glioma. Utilizing human glioma U87 cells, lentiviral transduction technique, luciferase reporter assay, wound healing assay, transwell invasion assay and clonogenic assay, we investigated the effects of hepatic leukemia factor (HLF), miR-132 and TTK protein kinase (TTK) on cancer cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion and radiosensitivity. The expression of miR-132 was low in human glioma tissues, and the downregulated expression was associated with advanced glioma grades. HLF directly bound to the BS1 site of miR-132 promoter to enhance the expression of miR-132. HLF-mediated miR-132 was able to directly target and inhibit a downstream factor TTK, which had an oncogenic role. Overexpression of TTK could reverse the inhibitory effects of either miR-132 or HLF on cancer cell proliferation, metastasis and radioresistance. TTK acts as an oncogene in glioma. HLF-mediated miR-132 directly suppresses TTK expression, thus exerting inhibitory effects on cancer cell proliferation, metastasis and radioresistance.","['Chen, Shu', 'Wang, Yang', 'Ni, Chunxia', 'Meng, Ge', 'Sheng, Xiaofang']","['Chen S', 'Wang Y', 'Ni C', 'Meng G', 'Sheng X']","['Shanghai Gamma Hospital, 518 Wuzhong Rd (E), Shanghai 200235, China.', 'Shanghai Gamma Hospital, 518 Wuzhong Rd (E), Shanghai 200235, China.', 'Shanghai Gamma Hospital, 518 Wuzhong Rd (E), Shanghai 200235, China.', 'Shanghai Gamma Hospital, 518 Wuzhong Rd (E), Shanghai 200235, China.', 'Shanghai Gamma Hospital, 518 Wuzhong Rd (E), Shanghai 200235, China.

DESIGN: Single-center, retrospective, observational, cohort study. SETTING: Large, tertiary care academic medical center. PATIENTS: A total of 225 patients >/= 18 years admitted between December 2010 and 2013 with newly diagnosed AML were assessed for inclusion. Patients were identified through the use of ICD-9 codes and chemotherapy ordered via the computerized physician order entry system. Sixty-eight patients met inclusion criteria and were grouped into two arms based on antimicrobial treatment: LZD group (linezolid plus gram-negative antimicrobial, n=21) or control group (vancomycin or daptomycin plus gram-negative antimicrobial, n=47). INTERVENTIONS: The LZD group received linezolid >/= 72 hours. The control group received vancomycin or daptomycin >/= 72 hours. If patients switched extended gram-positive therapy, they were included in the LZD group as long as they had received >/= 72 hours of linezolid. MEASUREMENTS/RESULTS: The primary end point of time to neutrophil recovery was not statistically different (28 days for LZD group vs 26 days for control group; p=0.675). The preplanned subgroup analysis of patients who received >/= 14 days of linezolid demonstrated statistically similar median times to neutrophil recovery (29 days for LZD group vs 26 days for control group; p=0.487). Total duration of extended gram-positive antimicrobial therapy was significantly longer in the LZD group (27 days vs 16 days; p<0.001). Secondary end points not found to be statistically significant included platelet count at time of neutrophil recovery, duration of neutropenia, and length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in hematologic outcomes in newly diagnosed AML patients who received linezolid for extended gram-positive antimicrobial coverage following induction chemotherapy. This study provides new insight with a primary focus on the effects of hematologic outcomes when using linezolid in a well-defined acute leukemia population. Further study is warranted with larger populations to assess the potential adverse effects linezolid may have in patients with acute leukemia.","['Nedved, Adrienne N', 'DeFrates, Sean R', 'Hladnik, Lindsay M', 'Stockerl-Goldstein, Keith E']","['Nedved AN', 'DeFrates SR', 'Hladnik LM', 'Stockerl-Goldstein KE']","['Department of Pharmacy, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. nedved.adrienne@mayo.edu.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20160920,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)', 'ISQ9I6J12J (Linezolid)', 'NWQ5N31VKK (Daptomycin)']",IM,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Daptomycin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*adverse effects/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Linezolid/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Vancomycin/administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*febrile neutropenia', '*hematologic recovery', '*linezolid', '*myelosuppression', '*neutrophil']",2016/08/16 06:00,2017/08/23 06:00,['2016/08/14 06:00'],"['2016/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/phar.1824 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2016 Oct;36(10):1087-1094. doi: 10.1002/phar.1824.

In the present study, we evaluated the in vitro efficacy of arsenic trioxide (ATO) in RMS, a FDA-approved drug used in pediatric leukemia. Here, we report that ATO exerts antitumor activity against RMS cells both as single agent and in combination with microtubule-targeting drugs. Monotherapy with ATO reduces cell viability, triggers apoptosis and suppresses clonogenic survival of RMS cells, at least in part, by transcriptional induction of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Noxa. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Noxa significantly rescues ATO-mediated cell death, demonstrating that Noxa is required for cell death. Also, ATO suppresses endogenous Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, as it significantly reduces Gli1 transcriptional activity and expression levels of several Hh target genes. Furthermore, we identify synergistic induction of apoptosis by ATO together with several antimicrotubule agents including vincristine (VCR), vinblastine and eribulin. The addition of the broad-range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk or overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 significantly reduce ATO/VCR-induced cell death, indicating that the ATO/VCR combination triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. In summary, ATO exerts antitumor activity against RMS, especially in combination with antimicrotubule drugs. These findings have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for RMS.","['Meister, Michael Torsten', 'Boedicker, Cathinka', 'Graab, Ulrike', 'Hugle, Manuela', 'Hahn, Heidi', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Meister MT', 'Boedicker C', 'Graab U', 'Hugle M', 'Hahn H', 'Klingebiel T', 'Fulda S']","['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstr. 3a, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstr. 3a, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstr. 3a, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstr. 3a, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, University Medical Center Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstr. 3a, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.

We identified a significant increase in percentage of TBA in postdasatinib BM (P = .022). This suggests that dasatinib therapy can increase TBA without significant changes in bone and mineral metabolism. Interferences with bone homeostasis and mineral metabolism have been described in patients receiving imatinib for CML or gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Dasatinib is a potent second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed to inhibit ABL and SRC kinases while also interfering with the c-Kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and STAT5 pathways. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used a multiparameter approach to examine the off-target effects of dasatinib in 30 patients with CML treated between 2009 and 2012. We recorded serum Ca and PO4 levels, analyzed markers of bone formation (bone alkaline phosphatase/bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [BAP]) and bone resorption (NTx), measured OPG levels, and digitally analyzed changes in TBA in paired BM biopsy specimens before and after treatment. We correlated all findings with each other and with the results of conventional cytogenetic and molecular analyses. RESULTS: We identified a significant increase in the percentage of TBA in postdasatinib BM biopsy specimens (P = .022) and noted a decrease in serum OPG levels in 75% of patients. Ca, PO4, BAP, and NTx levels remained steady, without significant changes. There was no correlation between biomarker levels, percentage of TBA, and/or cytogenetic or molecular response. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that dasatinib therapy (within the therapeutic range) can increase trabecular bone, without causing significant changes in bone and mineral metabolism. Nonetheless, monitoring of bone health and skeletal integrity should be included into the long-term management of patients treated with dasatinib to further enhance our understanding of its safety profile and its potential role as a treatment modality for other bone diseases.","['Hoehn, Daniela', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Hidalgo, Juliana E', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E']","['Hoehn D', 'Cortes JE', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Hidalgo JE', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Bueso-Ramos CE']","['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

Intolerance to TKIs has been described in approximately 20% of patients receiving treatment. We studied the incidence of imatinib intolerance in patients with CML Ph(+) and their outcome in our CML reference site, as there is no information about the evolution of patients intolerant to TKIs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A group of 86 patients with CML Ph(+) receiving imatinib monotherapy who abandoned treatment were the basis for this study. We present the trends of their disease evolution. RESULTS: The median of age at diagnosis was 42 years. Within a year, 19 (22%) of 86 patients developed imatinib intolerance, all of them with grade III or IV disease that required imatinib dose reduction or discontinuation. Of these patients, 16 (84%) of 19 developed transformation to blastic phase. The cumulative incidences of blastic phase development were 47% in the nonintolerant group and 84% in the intolerant group. There was a relative risk for those with imatinib intolerance to develop blastic phase of 1.78 (95% confidence interval, 1.28 to 2.42) (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Most imatinib-intolerant patients develop blastic phase transformation, with a poor survival of 3 to 6 months; no effective rescue treatment is available. Future research should to determine whether the origin of this evolution is really due to the intolerance itself or whether it is due to a more aggressive form of the disease, perhaps related to genetic transformation.","['Angeles-Velazquez, Jorge Luis', 'Hurtado-Monroy, Rafael', 'Vargas-Viveros, Pablo', 'Carrillo-Munoz, Silvia', 'Candelaria-Hernandez, Myrna']","['Angeles-Velazquez JL', 'Hurtado-Monroy R', 'Vargas-Viveros P', 'Carrillo-Munoz S', 'Candelaria-Hernandez M']","['Resident of Internal Medicine, Mexican Faculty of Medicine, La Salle University, Hospital Angeles del Pedregal, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Head of the Department of Hematology, Hospital Angeles del Pedregal, Mexico City, Mexico.

Treatment with chemo(immuno)therapy, immunomodulators, or the anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab produces transient, unsatisfactory responses. Reduced-intensity-conditioning allotransplantation produces sustained progression-free survival and overall survival (40%-60% at 5 years), equivalent to the cure of the disease, even in cases with adverse biomarkers. Unfortunately, despite improvements in this procedure, the non-relapse mortality continues to be high (15%-30%), and only highly selected patients (young, physically fit, with treatment-sensitive disease, not heavily pretreated, and with a fully matched donor) may benefit from the intervention without incurring unacceptable treatment-related risks. The advent of non-cytotoxic agents, such as the inhibitors of the B-cell-antigen receptor signaling (BCRi; ibrutinib, idelasilib) and anti-BCL2 proteins (venetoclax), is rapidly changing the treatment landscape in CLL, including its high-risk forms. These agents are satisfactorily safe. Moreover, they are effective across all genetic subgroups, albeit results in del(17p)/TP53 mutated cases are inferior to those with no adverse genetics. Importantly, progression-free and overall survival decline over time. These agents are tolerated much better and are more effective than conventional therapies used in high-risk CLL, and treatment results are close to those obtained with allotransplantation. As there is no proof as to which treatment (BCRi vs. allotransplantation) is preferable, treatment recommendations should be individualized, weighing the pros and cons of each of these interventions. In most patients, however, initial therapy with BCRi (ideally in combination with monoclonal antibodies and/or other small molecules) is a reasonable approach, and allotransplantation should be considered in selected patients refractory to BCRi-based treatment and/or extremely high-risk disease.","['Montserrat, Emili', 'Dreger, Peter']","['Montserrat E', 'Dreger P']","['Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; European Research Initiative on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Barcelona, Spain.

PATIENTS (OR MATERIALS) AND METHODS: We evaluated the expression of each isoform of PDE4 (A, B, C, and D) using transcriptomic profiling and examined the potential impact on the outcome of patients with MDS in terms of survival and response to hypomethylating agents. Total RNA was extracted from CD34(+) bone marrow hematopoietic cells from healthy individuals (n = 10) and patients with MDS (n = 24) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n = 19). RESULTS: The study cohort had a median follow-up period of 21.2 months (range, 0.2-68 months) and a median overall survival of 17.6 months (95% confidence interval, 9.6-25.6). The main finding of the present study was that PDE4 mean expression was generally higher in patients with MDS than in healthy individuals. Also, upregulated PDE4 expression seemed to have a possible negative effect on survival (P > .05). Moreover, lower, compared with higher, mean PDE4A and PDE4C expression is indicative of a response to a hypomethylating agent (0.09 and 0.03 vs. 0.54 and 0.49, respectively; P > .05). CONCLUSION: These results should be confirmed in a larger patient cohort. PDE4 expression could be an effective potential prognostic factor and therapeutic target for patients with MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The role of PDE4 inhibitors should be explored in vitro against MDS cell lines and in preclinical mouse models of MDS.","['Chamseddine, Ali N', 'Cabrero, Monica', 'Wei, Yue', 'Ganan-Gomez, Irene', 'Colla, Simona', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Yang, Hui', 'Bohannan, Zachary S', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Chamseddine AN', 'Cabrero M', 'Wei Y', 'Ganan-Gomez I', 'Colla S', 'Takahashi K', 'Yang H', 'Bohannan ZS', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report our experience treating patients with CMML enrolled in a sequential 2-stage dose escalation study with eltrombopag in patients with MDS after hypomethylating agent failure. Patients with CMML were compared with patients with MDS in respect to response and adverse events. RESULTS: Among 33 patients in the study, we treated 7 patients with CMML. Hematological improvement or better (by International Working Group 2006 criteria) was observed in 6 (23%) of 26 MDS patients and 1 (14%) of 7 patients with CMML. The responding patient with CMML had bilineage response. Two patients with CMML became platelet transfusion-independent. Five (71%) patients with CMML developed leukocytosis compared with 3 (12%) patients with MDS. Four (57%) patients with CMML showed peripheral myeloblasts after treatment compared with 11 (42%) in the MDS group. One (14%) patient with CMML developed grade 3 fibrosis from grade 0 to 1 at baseline compared with 3 (12%) patients with MDS. The rate of acute myeloid leukemia transformation was 39% and 29%, respectively, in patients with MDS and CMML.

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is mainly a disease of the elderly. The characteristics, outcomes, and response to treatment are not well described in the AYA population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients from the Moffitt Cancer Center MDS database. We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes of the AYA population to older patients. We identified 51 AYA and 1897 older MDS patients. More female subjects and Hispanics were noted in AYA group. RESULTS: The AYA patients had higher risk disease, more circulating myeloblasts, and more hypoplastic MDS. Autoimmune disorders were more prevalent in older patients. The median overall survival (OS) was 47 months in the AYA group versus 40 months in the older group (P = .26). The median OS was 47 versus 56 months in lower risk AYA group and older group, respectively (P = .46). In the higher risk group, median OS was 82 months in the AYA group compared to 17 months in the older group (P = .001). Thirty individuals (59%) underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation in the AYA group versus 241 (13%) in the older group. The median OS for transplanted patients was 55 months in the AYA group and 46 months in the older group (P = .4). In the nontransplanted patients, median survival was 31 months for the AYA group and 39 months for the older group (P = .9). The rate of acute myeloid leukemia transformation was 37% versus 28% in the AYA and older groups, respectively (P = .17). No differences in use or response to hypomethylating agents were observed. Lenalidomide therapy was seldom used in AYA, as none presented with del5q. In AYA, poor karyotype was the only variable strongly associated with worse outcome. Fifteen patients had poor risk karyotypes (29%). The median OS was 47 months, not reached, and 29 months among patients with good, intermediate, and poor risk cytogenetics, respectively (P = .035). CONCLUSION: MDS is rare and tends to be more aggressive in the AYA population. Karyotype was the most important prognostic factor. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation offered younger patients the best outcomes.","['Grabska, Joanna', 'Shah, Bijal', 'Reed, Damon', 'Al Ali, Najla', 'Padron, Eric', 'Ramadan, Hanadi', 'Lancet, Jeffrey', 'List, Alan', 'Komrokji, Rami']","['Grabska J', 'Shah B', 'Reed D', 'Al Ali N', 'Padron E', 'Ramadan H', 'Lancet J', 'List A', 'Komrokji R']","['Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL.

We report our experience using antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine A (CSA) to explore clinical predictive response factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients treated with IST identified in the Moffitt Cancer Center MDS database were analyzed using baseline data, IST details, and response rates. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients treated with IST were identified. The median age was 61 years; the majority were at low risk and had a good karyotype. The median time to start IST was 1 year. All patients received ATG, 60% rabbit (r-ATG), 32% equine ATG (e-ATG), and 60% received CSA. Overall hematologic improvement was 42% with a trend favoring e-ATG over r-ATG (52% vs. 39%; P = .09). Erythroid improvement was evaluated in 30 patients, and 60% responded; neutrophil improvement was evaluated in 15, and 39% responded; platelet improvement was evaluated in 18, and 57% responded. Six of 18 pancytopenic patients experienced trilineage response. Mean time from ATG to next therapy was 12 months. None of the patients with very high risk or high risk revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) responded. Poor karyotype had a lower response rate, 25%, compared to 41% for intermediate and 44% for good karyotype. No difference in predicting response was found based on the National Institutes of Health Response Model; 38% with low and 45% with high probability responded. A trend favored treatment within 2 years from diagnosis, with 46% responding compared to 33% treated after 2 years. First-line ATG or after lenalidomide responded better than after azacitidine or third-line therapy. CSA provided an advantage: the disease of 51% responded compared to 27% with ATG alone (P = .05). Ten patients experienced transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, 7% with disease that responded to therapy and 24% with disease that did not respond to therapy (P = .08). Overall survival was 67.2 months without difference between those with and without response. Adverse events were reported in 55 patients. Infusion reactions occurred in 85% but was similar between ATG types. Infection rate was 25% and higher with e-ATG. Serum sickness was reported in 18% and significantly higher with r-ATG. CONCLUSION: IST has a hematologic improvement response rate in the range of other therapies approved for lower risk MDS. High risk IPSS-R, poor karyotype, and treatment after 2 years from diagnosis have unfavorable response trend. ATG with CSA has higher response than ATG alone. First-line ATG or after lenalidomide had better response trend compared to third-line therapy or azacitidine therapy.","['Haider, Mintallah', 'Al Ali, Najla', 'Padron, Eric', 'Epling-Burnette, Pearlie', 'Lancet, Jeffrey', 'List, Alan', 'Komrokji, Rami']","['Haider M', 'Al Ali N', 'Padron E', 'Epling-Burnette P', 'Lancet J', 'List A', 'Komrokji R']","['H.

However, despite some progress in this area, it appears that we might be reaching the limit of cytotoxic chemotherapy for the treatment of AML, especially in older patients and in those with poor-risk features whose disease tends to be relatively chemoresistant. Recent advances in the molecular classification of AML have identified pathogenic pathways that can be exploited with targeted agents and rational drug combinations. Novel nontransplant immunotherapies also show promise in the treatment of AML, especially when a targetable molecular aberration cannot be identified. Sensitive methods for detecting minimal residual disease in AML have not only improved prognostication of these patients but also provide the framework for risk-adapted strategies in this heterogeneous disease.","['Short, Nicholas J', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Short NJ', 'Ravandi F']","['Division of Cancer Medicine, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

Blinatumomab is a first-in-class bispecific T-cell engager that links T cells to tumor cells leading to T-cell activation and tumor cell lysis. In December 2014, the Food and Drug Administration approved blinatumomab for treatment of relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome-negative precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In a phase II trial, blinatumomab produced response rates of 43%, and 40% of patients achieving a complete remission proceeded to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Early use of blinatumomab was complicated with adverse effects, including cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity.

Molecular and cytogenetic abnormalities are the most important prognostic factors. Minimal residual disease (MRD) is also an important predictor of relapse in ALL. However, the correlation of both prognostic variables has not been thoroughly studied. METHODS: We investigated the correlation between defined cytogenetic abnormalities and selected new MRD markers (CD79b, CD123, and CD200) in 56 newly diagnosed Egyptian pediatric B-cell ALL patients. RESULTS: CD123 found to be expressed in 45% of patients, CD200 in 80.3%, and CD79b in 67.9%. MRD analysis during treatment showed stable expression patterns of CD200. There was significant association of CD123 expression with the hyperdiploid ALL group (P = .017). Another association (P = .029) was found between CD79b negativity and the t(12;21) group. CD200 was widely expressed in all groups. CONCLUSION: There is a significant correlation between some markers, and certain ALL recurrent cytogenetic subgroups (CD123 and hyperdiploidy, CD79b negativity, and ETV-RUNX1 group) have good prognostic value. CD200 can be used as MRD markers in ALL patients and can also can serve as therapy targets.","['Adnan Awad, Shady', 'Kamel, Mahmoud M', 'Ayoub, Mahmoud A', 'Kamel, Ahmed M', 'Elnoshokaty, Essam H', 'El Hifnawi, Niveen']","['Adnan Awad S', 'Kamel MM', 'Ayoub MA', 'Kamel AM', 'Elnoshokaty EH', 'El Hifnawi N']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.

The mutational landscape of MPN-BP is distinct from de novo acute myeloid leukemia and offers insight into molecular mechanisms contributing to clonal evolution providing potential novel drug targets. A number of retrospective studies have identified patient- and disease-specific variables associated with increased risk of leukemic transformation (LT) of an underlying MPN. Several prognostic models have been developed to identify those MPN patients at highest risk for LT that may warrant early aggressive therapeutic intervention. Acute myeloid leukemia-type induction chemotherapy does not offer a significant survival benefit for MPN-BP unless followed by hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Unfortunately, most patients with MPN-BP are not candidates for hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation as a result of advanced age, competing comorbid conditions, or lack of an acceptable donor graft option. JAK2 inhibitor monotherapy is effective in reducing splenomegaly and symptom burden in the majority of treated patients with myelofibrosis, but LT can still occur. High-dose JAK2 inhibitor monotherapy appears tolerable but only modestly active in the treatment of MPN-BP. Current JAK2 inhibitor-based combination therapy approaches are supported by preclinical investigation and are currently being tested in multicenter clinical trials.","['Mascarenhas, John']",['Mascarenhas J'],"['Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.

Accordingly, risk stratification is the basis for deciding when to treat a patient with cytoreductive therapy. The European LeukemiaNet has developed a series of management recommendations for front-line and second-line therapy to provide the optimal treatment for the individual patient. There is still controversy about the efficacy and safety of several modalities of cytoreductive treatment in the long-term for both diseases and in the use of antiplatelet therapy in ET. The presence of JAK2V617F and CALR mutations in patients with ET has been related to different thrombotic risks, and this will probably lead to different therapeutic approaches in the near future. On the other hand, the near normal life expectancy of these patients makes a careful analysis of the benefits and risks associated with treatment essential.

Although the JAK2 V617F mutation was discovered a decade ago and MPL mutations shortly thereafter, it was the recent discovery of CALR mutations in the vast majority of JAK2/MPL-unmutated patients and recognition of the powerful impact of CALR mutations and triple-negative (JAK2/MPL/CALR-negative) status on outcome that set the stage for revision of traditional prognostic models to include molecular information. Additionally, the advent of next-generation sequencing has identified a host of previously unrecognized somatic mutations across hematologic malignancies. As in the myelodysplastic syndromes, the majority of common and prognostically informative mutations in PMF affect epigenetic regulation and mRNA splicing. Thus, a need has arisen to incorporate mutational information on genes such as ASXL1 and SRSF2 into risk stratification systems. Mutations in yet other genes appear to be important players in leukemic transformation, and new insights into disease pathogenesis are emerging. Finally, the number of prognostically detrimental mutations may affect both survival and response to ruxolitinib, which has significant implications for clinical decision making. In this review, we briefly summarize the prognostic models in use today and discuss in detail the somatic mutations commonly encountered in patients with PMF, along with their prognostic implications and role in leukemic transformation. Emerging prognostic models that incorporate new molecular information into existing systems or exclude clinical variables are also presented.","['Bose, Prithviraj', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Bose P', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

Here we show that niclosamide, a FDA-approved anthelmintic drug, enhances the sensitivity of BP-CML cells to dasatinib (2nd generation of BCR-ABL TKI) through inhibiting Erk/Mnk1/eIF4E signaling pathway. Niclosamide dose-dependently inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a panel of CML cell lines. It also selectively targets BP-CML CD34 stem/progenitor cells through inducing apoptosis, inhibiting colony formation and self-renewal capacity while sparing normal bone marrow (NBM) counterparts. In addition, combination of niclosamide and dasatinib is synergistic in CML cell lines and BP-CML CD34 cells. Importantly, niclosamide inhibits phosphorylation of Erk, Mnk1 and eIF4E in CML cells. Overexpression of phosphomimetic but not nonphosphorylatable form of eIF4E reverses the inhibitory effects of niclosamide, suggesting that eIF4E inhibition is required for the action of niclosamide in CML. Compared to NBM, the increased levels of eIF4E and its activity in CML CD34 cells might explain the selective toxicity of niclosamide in CML versus NBM. We further show that dasatinib time-dependently induces eIF4E phosphorylation. The combination of eIF4E depletion and dasatinib results in similar effects as the combination of niclosamide and dasatinib, suggesting that niclosamide enhances dasatinib through targeting eIF4E. Our work is the first to demonstrate that niclosamide is a potential drug to overcome resistance to BCR-ABL TKI treatment in BP-CML.

Responses were evaluated following revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria. The overall response rate was 19%; an additional 19% of patients demonstrated antileukemic activity not meeting IWG criteria (partial bone marrow response and incomplete hematologic recovery). Twelve (38%) patients had isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 mutations, of whom 4 (33%) achieved complete response or complete response with incomplete blood count recovery. Six (19%) patients had BCL2-sensitive protein index at screening, which correlated with time on study. BH3 profiling was consistent with on-target BCL2 inhibition and identified potential resistance mechanisms. Common adverse events included nausea, diarrhea and vomiting (all grades), and febrile neutropenia and hypokalemia (grade 3/4). Venetoclax demonstrated activity and acceptable tolerability in patients with AML and adverse features. SIGNIFICANCE: Venetoclax monotherapy demonstrated clinical activity in patients with AML (relapsed/refractory or unfit for intensive chemotherapy) with a tolerable safety profile in this phase II study. Predictive markers of response consistent with BCL2 dependence were identified. Clinical and preclinical findings provide a compelling rationale to evaluate venetoclax combined with other agents in AML. Cancer Discov; 6(10); 1106-17.

Each of these agents is known to be able to prime HL-60 cells and accelerate subsequently induced myeloid or monocytic differentiation and G0 cell cycle arrest, suggesting that they have equal or identical cellular targets relevent to the early stages of inducing cell differentiation and G0 arrest. As a test of this possibility, a survey of protein expression changes induced by RA, BrdU, or Delta205 transfection was performed. Retinoic acid induced numerous changes within h. Bromodeoxyuridine caused larger numbers of changes, whereas Delta205 caused a more limited number. Among the hundreds of affected proteins detected, there were comparable numbers of up- or downregulated proteins. A small number changed between undetectable and detectable expression. The affected proteins were not restricted to a single functional class and included transcription factors, receptors, signaling molecules, cytoskeletal molecules, and effectors of various cellular processes such as deoxyribonucleic acid replication, transcription, and translation. The intersect of the sets of proteins affected by RA, BrdU, and Delta205 was identified to determine if these agents regulated a common subset of proteins. This ensemble contained the commonly upregulated proteins AF6, ABP-280, ENC-1, ESE 1, MAP2B, NTF2, casein kinase, IRF1, SRPK2, Rb2, RhoGDI, P47phox, CD45, PKR, and SIIIp15. The commonly downregulated proteins were SHC, katanin, flotillin-2/ESA, EB 1, p43/EMAPIIprecursor, Jabl, FNK. The composition of the ensemble suggested three apparent themes for cellular processes that were affected early. The themes reflected the ultimate fate of the treated precursor cells as a mature myeloid cell, namely a cell whose hallmarks are (1) motility to migrate to a target and phagocytize it, (2) inducible oxidative metabolism to reduce the target with superoxide from a respiratory burst, and (3) biosynthetic slow down consistent with conversion from cell proliferation to quiescence. Interestingly, RA appears to induce aspects of an interferon-like response of potential significance as part of a biosynthetic slow down leading to cell cycle arrest. In conclusion, three biologically disparate ways to prime cells to differentiate were used to filter out a small ensemble of commonly regulated proteins that group as either microtubule associated, oxidative metabolism machinery, or effectors of cellular responses to interferon.","['Yen, Andrew', 'Lin, David M', 'Lamikin, Thomas J', 'Varvayanis, Susi']","['Yen A', 'Lin DM', 'Lamikin TJ', 'Varvayanis S']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, 14853, Ithaca, New York.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, 14853, Ithaca, New York.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, 14853, Ithaca, New York.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, 14853, Ithaca, New York.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

Revisiting George Minot to re-interpret megakaryocytic maturation.,28-32,"Circulating megakaryocytic cells abound in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) seen in India and uniquely provide a setting for observing megakaryocytic maturation in the peripheral blood, a milieu not native to megakaryocytes. Peripheral blood megakaryocytic cells were studied in 324 cases of CML (235 chronic, 65 accelerated and 24 blastic phases). Two maturation themes were evident. Megakaryocytic blasts, especially in some cases of blast crisis, precociously make a foray into platelet formation and end up producing huge agranular or poorly granular cytoplasmic lobulated masses, that break off and come to lie in the circulation. This evidence of unsuccessful effort may exist, in a considerably attenuated form in chronic phase, alongside of the second major theme of megakaryocytic maturation centered around the familiar micromegakaryocyte, characteristic of the chronic phase. This cell is regarded as dysplastic, but produces morphologically normal platelets. The possibility that this occurs via a hitherto unstudied alternative path of platelet maturation that plays out in the peripheral blood, and the contrasting disorderly premature attempt of blasts to form platelets, represent exciting maturation processes that need further study. Our observations fortuitously constitute a revisit of the insightful exposition on the subject by George Minot nearly a century ago.","['Anand, Mona', 'Hazarika, Biswadip', 'Kumar, Lalit', 'Kumar, Rajive', 'Chopra, Anita']","['Anand M', 'Hazarika B', 'Kumar L', 'Kumar R', 'Chopra A']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Gulf Medical University, Ajman, UAE.', 'Medical Oncology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Laboratory Oncology, IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.

Though renal infiltration is usually detected at post-mortem, it does not often interfere with kidney function [1]. Though immunoglobulin (Ig) levels in most CLL patients are subnormal, small monoclonal Ig peaks are occasionally detected in serum. They were present in a number of reported CLL nephropathy patients, and not all were cryoglobulins; serum and glomerular staining were concordant for Ig type [2,3,4]. Myeloma, which secretes monoclonal light chains, causes nephropathy in 25% of patients. But the little presumably secreted by small plasma cell clones, without myeloma, may also be nephrotoxic. The same is true of the low secretory CLL cells, which may occasionally be associated with cryoglobulins and other nephrotoxic Igs [5]. We report a patient with early stage CLL (Rai stage 0) with cryoglobulins, which led to membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and death. We located reports of 51 patients with CLL-associated nephrotic syndrome or nephropathy, mostly from MPGN related to local Ig deposits. In those patients screened for cryoglobulins, about half tested positive. Many were early stage cases, where MPGN developed long after CLL presentation, and responded to its treatment. As early diagnosis and treatment CLL-related nephropathy may be curative, we propose a prospective study to determine the incidence of hyperalbuminuria development after presentation.","['Arora, Swaty', 'Levitan, Daniel', 'Regmi, Narottam', 'Sidhu, Gurinder', 'Gupta, Raavi', 'Nicastri, Anthony D', 'Saggi, Subodh J', 'Braverman, Albert']","['Arora S', 'Levitan D', 'Regmi N', 'Sidhu G', 'Gupta R', 'Nicastri AD', 'Saggi SJ', 'Braverman A']","['Department of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Medicine, State University New York, Downstate, USA.

A consequence of the glycolytic phenotype is the accumulation of metabolic acid; hence, tumour cells experience considerable intracellular acid stress. To compensate, tumour cells upregulate acid pumps, which expel the metabolic acid into the surrounding tumour environment, resulting in alkalization of intracellular pH and acidification of the tumour microenvironment. Nevertheless, we have only a limited understanding of the consequences of altered intracellular pH on cell physiology, or of the genes and pathways that respond to metabolic acid stress. We have used yeast as a genetic model for metabolic acid stress with the rationale that the metabolic changes that occur in cancer that lead to intracellular acid stress are likely fundamental. Using a quantitative systems biology approach we identified 129 genes required for optimal growth under conditions of metabolic acid stress. We identified six highly conserved protein complexes with functions related to oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III and IV), mitochondrial tRNA biosynthesis [glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase complex], histone methylation (Set1C-COMPASS), lysosome biogenesis (AP-3 adapter complex), and mRNA processing and P-body formation (PAN complex). We tested roles for two of these, AP-3 adapter complex and PAN deadenylase complex, in resistance to acid stress using a myeloid leukaemia-derived human cell line that we determined to be acid stress resistant. Loss of either complex inhibited growth of Hap1 cells at neutral pH and caused sensitivity to acid stress, indicating that AP-3 and PAN complexes are promising new targets in the treatment of cancer. Additionally, our data suggests that tumours may be genetically sensitized to acid stress and hence susceptible to acid stress-directed therapies, as many tumours accumulate mutations in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes required for their proliferation.","['Shin, John J', 'Aftab, Qurratulain', 'Austin, Pamela', 'McQueen, Jennifer A', 'Poon, Tak', 'Li, Shu Chen', 'Young, Barry P', 'Roskelley, Calvin D', 'Loewen, Christopher J R']","['Shin JJ', 'Aftab Q', 'Austin P', 'McQueen JA', 'Poon T', 'Li SC', 'Young BP', 'Roskelley CD', 'Loewen CJ']","['Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, Life Sciences Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z3.', 'Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, Life Sciences Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z3.', 'Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, Life Sciences Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z3.', 'Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, Life Sciences Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z3.', 'Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, Life Sciences Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z3.', 'Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, Life Sciences Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z3.', 'Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, Life Sciences Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z3.', 'Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, Life Sciences Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z3 roskelly@mail.ubc.ca cloewen@mail.ubc.ca.', 'Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, Life Sciences Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z3 roskelly@mail.ubc.ca cloewen@mail.ubc.ca.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160812,England,Dis Model Mech,Disease models & mechanisms,101483332,"['0 (Protein Subunits)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', '*Genes, Fungal', 'Genetic Testing', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*therapy', 'Protein Subunits/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological/*genetics', 'Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AP-3 complex', '*Hap1 cells', '*Intracellular acid stress', '*Metabolism', '*Mitochondria', '*PAN complex']",2016/08/16 06:00,2017/12/05 06:00,['2016/08/14 06:00'],"['2015/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [medline]']","['dmm.023374 [pii]', '10.1242/dmm.023374 [doi]']",ppublish,Dis Model Mech. 2016 Sep 1;9(9):1039-49. doi: 10.1242/dmm.023374.

Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of a fatal malignancy known as adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and an inflammatory disease named tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM).

The maternal Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is necessary for the H3K4me3 deposition at organizer genes in early Xenopus embryos. However, it remains unknown whether any component of SET/MLL methylase complex is required for Wnt signaling to establish H3K4me3 at its targets during the organizer induction. Here, we provide evidence that Wdr5 is required for dorsal axis development and organizer gene activation in Xenopus. Depletion of maternal Wdr5 resulted in ventralized development, phenocopying depletion of maternal beta-catenin. Depletion of maternal Wdr5 also drastically reduced the ability of beta-catenin to activate organizer genes. Siamois, a direct target of maternal Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, was able to reinitiate dorsal axis formation when Wdr5 was depleted. Importantly, we demonstrate that Wdr5 is required for H3K4me3 establishment at the promoter region of siamois. Moreover, we found evidence that Setd1b, a maternally provided methyltransferase, is required for organizer gene expression. Our findings indicate that Wdr5-mediated H3K4 trimethylation plays a part in the organizer formation and dorsal axis development that are controlled by the maternal Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.","['Lin, Hao', 'Min, Zheying', 'Tao, Qinghua']","['Lin H', 'Min Z', 'Tao Q']","['MOE Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, Tsinghua University School of Life Sciences, Beijing 100084, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, Tsinghua University School of Life Sciences, Beijing 100084, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, Tsinghua University School of Life Sciences, Beijing 100084, China.

HTLV-1 is a human retrovirus associated with acute T-cell leukemia and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HTLV-1 originated from ancient zoonotic transmission from nonhuman primates, although cases of zoonotic infections continue to occur. Similar to HTLV-1, the simian counterpart, STLV-1, causes chronic infection and leukemia and lymphoma in naturally infected monkeys, and combined are called primate T-lymphotropic viruses (PTLV-1). However, other clinical syndromes typically seen in humans such as a chronic progressive myelopathy have not been observed in nonhuman primates. Little is known about the development of neurologic and inflammatory diseases in human populations infected with STLV-1-like viruses following nonhuman primate exposure. RESULTS: We performed detailed laboratory analyses on an HTLV-1 seropositive patient with typical HAM/TSP who was born in Liberia and now resides in the United States. Using a novel droplet digital PCR for the detection of the HTLV-1 tax gene, the proviral load in PBMC and cerebrospinal fluid cells was 12.98 and 51.68 %, respectively; however, we observed a distinct difference in fluorescence amplitude of the positive droplet population suggesting possible mutations in proviral DNA. A complete PTLV-1 proviral genome was amplified from the patient's PBMC DNA using an overlapping PCR strategy. Phylogenetic analysis of the envelope and LTR sequences showed the virus was highly related to PTLV-1 from sooty mangabey monkeys (smm) and humans exposed via nonhuman primates in West Africa. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the patient is infected with a simian variant of PTLV-1, suggesting for the first time that PTLV-1smm infection in humans may be associated with a chronic progressive neurologic disease.","['Enose-Akahata, Yoshimi', 'Caruso, Breanna', 'Haner, Benjamin', 'Charlip, Emily', 'Nair, Govind', 'Massoud, Raya', 'Billioux, Bridgette J', 'Ohayon, Joan', 'Switzer, William M', 'Jacobson, Steven']","['Enose-Akahata Y', 'Caruso B', 'Haner B', 'Charlip E', 'Nair G', 'Massoud R', 'Billioux BJ', 'Ohayon J', 'Switzer WM', 'Jacobson S']","['Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Building 10 Room 5C-103, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Building 10 Room 5C-103, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Building 10 Room 5C-103, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Building 10 Room 5C-103, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Translational Neuroradiology Unit, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Building 10 Room 5C-103, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Building 10 Room 5C-103, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Building 10 Room 5C-103, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Laboratory Branch, Division of HIV/AIDS, National Center for HIV, Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, 30329, USA.', 'Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Building 10 Room 5C-103, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA. jacobsons@ninds.nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160812,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,,IM,"['Africa, Western', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*complications/transmission/*virology', 'Genes, pX', 'Haplorhini/virology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Male', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*virology', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Primate T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Proviruses/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HAM/TSP', '*HTLV', '*PTLV', '*STLV']",2016/08/16 06:00,2017/05/13 06:00,['2016/08/14 06:00'],"['2016/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-016-0290-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-016-0290-9 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2016 Aug 12;13(1):56. doi: 10.1186/s12977-016-0290-9.,10.1186/s12977-016-0290-9 [doi],,,,,PMC4982997,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Three-Year Follow-Up of Procedure Efficiency.,2056-2064,"HLA-haploidentical family donors represent a valuable option for children requiring allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Because graft-versus-host diseases (GVHD) is a major complication of HLA-haploidentical HSCT because of alloreactive T cells in the graft, different methods have been used for ex vivo T cell depletion. Removal of donor alphabeta T cells, the subset responsible for GVHD, and of B cells, responsible for post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders, have been recently developed for HLA-haploidentical HSCT. This manipulation preserves, in addition to CD34(+) progenitors, natural killer, gammadelta T, and monocytes/dendritic cells, contributing to anti-leukemia activity and protection against infections. We analyzed depletion efficiency and cell yield in 200 procedures performed in the last 3 years at our center. Donors underwent CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) peripheral blood mobilization with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Poor CD34(+) cell mobilizers (48 of 189, 25%) received plerixafor in addition to G-CSF. Aphereses containing a median of 52.5 x 10(9) nucleated cells and 494 x 10(6) CD34(+) HSC were manipulated using the CliniMACS device. In comparison to the initial product, alphabeta T cell depletion produced a median 4.1-log reduction (range, 3.1 to 5.5) and B cell depletion led to a median 3.4-log reduction (range, 2.0 to 4.7). Graft products contained a median of 18.5 x 10(6) CD34(+) HSC/kg recipient body weight, with median values of residual alphabeta T cells and B cells of 29 x 10(3)/kg and 33 x 10(3)/kg, respectively. Depletion efficiency monitored at 6-month intervals demonstrated steady performance, while improved recovery of CD34(+) cells was observed after the first year (P = .0005).

Because such cysts and craniopharyngiomas share a common histogenesis, we raised the question of whether LIF is also expressed in craniopharyngioma.Fourteen histologically verified craniopharyngiomas of adamantinomatous type were examined for LIF immunoreactivity using the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method.

However, they also show the limitations of this fascinating technology: CAR T cells can lead to even life-threatening off-tumor, on-target side effects if CAR T cells crossreact with healthy tissues. Here, we describe a novel modular universal CAR platform technology termed UniCAR that reduces the risk of on-target side effects by a rapid and reversible control of CAR T-cell reactivity. The UniCAR system consists of two components: (1) a CAR for an inert manipulation of T cells and (2) specific targeting modules (TMs) for redirecting UniCAR T cells in an individualized time- and target-dependent manner. UniCAR T cells can be armed against different tumor targets simply by replacement of the respective TM for (1) targeting more than one antigen simultaneously or subsequently to enhance efficacy and (2) reducing the risk for development of antigen-loss tumor variants under treatment. Here we provide 'proof of concept' for retargeting of UniCAR T cells to CD33- and/or CD123-positive acute myeloid leukemia blasts in vitro and in vivo.","['Cartellieri, M', 'Feldmann, A', 'Koristka, S', 'Arndt, C', 'Loff, S', 'Ehninger, A', 'von Bonin, M', 'Bejestani, E P', 'Ehninger, G', 'Bachmann, M P']","['Cartellieri M', 'Feldmann A', 'Koristka S', 'Arndt C', 'Loff S', 'Ehninger A', 'von Bonin M', 'Bejestani EP', 'Ehninger G', 'Bachmann MP']","['University Cancer Center (UCC), Carl Gustav Carus University Hospital TU-Dresden, Tumorimmunology, Dresden, Germany.', 'Cellex Patient Treatment GmbH, Dresden, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center (UCC), Carl Gustav Carus University Hospital TU-Dresden, Tumorimmunology, Dresden, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Institute of Radiopharmaceutical Cancer Research, Dresden, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center (UCC), Carl Gustav Carus University Hospital TU-Dresden, Tumorimmunology, Dresden, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Institute of Radiopharmaceutical Cancer Research, Dresden, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center (UCC), Carl Gustav Carus University Hospital TU-Dresden, Tumorimmunology, Dresden, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Institute of Radiopharmaceutical Cancer Research, Dresden, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center (UCC), Carl Gustav Carus University Hospital TU-Dresden, Tumorimmunology, Dresden, Germany.', 'GEMoaB Monoclonals GmbH, Dresden, Germany.', 'GEMoaB Monoclonals GmbH, Dresden, Germany.', 'University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, Dresden, Germany.', 'University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, Dresden, Germany.', 'University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, Dresden, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center (UCC), Carl Gustav Carus University Hospital TU-Dresden, Tumorimmunology, Dresden, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Institute of Radiopharmaceutical Cancer Research, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160812,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Burden']",,,2016/08/16 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/08/13 06:00'],"['2016/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201661 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2016.61 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2016 Aug 12;6(8):e458. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2016.61.,10.1038/bcj.2016.61 [doi],,,,,PMC5022178,"['MPB, AE and GE have filed patents and patent applications related to mAbs', 'directed to CD33, La and the UniCAR platform technology.

METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of children receiving intensive chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies who developed invasive mold infections from 2004 to 2011. Characteristics and outcomes were compared before and after implementation of the screening protocol in November 2006. The screen includes direct nasal endoscopy performed at the bedside by an otorhinolaryngologist, noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the chest, and abdominal ultrasound in patients with neutropenia and prolonged or recurrent fever. RESULTS: Fifty patients had proven, probable, or possible invasive mold infections. Before routine use of direct nasal endoscopy, invasive nasosinal disease was detected in 5 of 19 patients (26 %) and all had a compatible clinical presentation. Thirteen of 31 patients (42 %) in the post-screen group had nasosinal disease, and fever was the only sign for 8 patients (62 %). Twenty-four patients with nasosinal disease had a sinus CT, and radiologic findings of bony erosion or peri-sinus invasion were never detected. Eight of 19 patients in the pre-screen group died from mold infection (42.1 %) versus 4 of 31 (12.9 %) in the post-screen group (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: A screening protocol including direct nasal endoscopy, noncontrast chest CT, and abdominal ultrasound was effective in detecting invasive mold infections in at-risk patients. Nasosinal involvement often occurs before specific symptoms develop, and sinus CTs are insensitive and nonspecific. Bedside nasal endoscopy precludes radiation exposure associated with sinus CT and was associated with decrease in mold-related mortality, likely due to earlier diagnosis and initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy.","['Cohn, Shannon M', 'Pokala, Hanumantha R', 'Siegel, Jane D', 'McClay, John E', 'Leonard, David', 'Kwon, Jeannie', 'Timmons, Charles F', 'Winick, Naomi J']","['Cohn SM', 'Pokala HR', 'Siegel JD', 'McClay JE', 'Leonard D', 'Kwon J', 'Timmons CF', 'Winick NJ']","['University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA. shannonmitch@gmail.com.', ""Children's Blood and Cancer Center, Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas, 1301 Barbara Jordan Blvd, Suite 401, Austin, TX, 78723, USA. shannonmitch@gmail.com."", 'University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.', 'University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', ""Children's Medical Center of Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA."", ""Children's Medical Center of Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA."", 'University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160812,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Febrile Neutropenia/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Mycoses/complications/*diagnosis', 'Reference Standards', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Febrile neutropenia', '*Invasive fungal infections', '*Pediatric leukemia']",2016/10/28 06:00,2017/08/17 06:00,['2016/08/13 06:00'],"['2015/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-016-3367-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-016-3367-z [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2016 Dec;24(12):5025-5033. doi: 10.1007/s00520-016-3367-z.

Lower miR-181a expression is associated with worse outcomes, but the exact mechanisms by which miR-181a mediates this effect remain elusive. Aberrant activation of the RAS pathway contributes to myeloid leukemogenesis. Here, we report that miR-181a directly binds to 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs); downregulates KRAS, NRAS and MAPK1; and decreases AML growth. The delivery of miR-181a mimics to target AML cells using transferrin-targeting lipopolyplex nanoparticles (NP) increased mature miR-181a; downregulated KRAS, NRAS and MAPK1; and resulted in decreased phosphorylation of the downstream RAS effectors. NP-mediated upregulation of miR-181a led to reduced proliferation, impaired colony formation and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy. Ectopic expression of KRAS, NRAS and MAPK1 attenuated the anti-leukemic activity of miR-181a mimics, thereby validating the relevance of the deregulated miR-181a-RAS network in AML. Finally, treatment with miR-181a-NP in a murine AML model resulted in longer survival compared to mice treated with scramble-NP control. These data support that targeting the RAS-MAPK-pathway by miR-181a mimics represents a novel promising therapeutic approach for AML and possibly for other RAS-driven cancers.","['Huang, Xiaomeng', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Eisfeld, Ann-Kathrin', 'Chiang, Chi-Ling', 'Lankenau, Malori', 'Yu, Bo', 'Hoellerbauer, Pia', 'Jin, Yan', 'Tarighat, Somayeh S', 'Khalife, Jihane', 'Walker, Alison', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Wang, Hongyan', 'Lee, Robert J', 'Lee, Ly James', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Huang X', 'Schwind S', 'Santhanam R', 'Eisfeld AK', 'Chiang CL', 'Lankenau M', 'Yu B', 'Hoellerbauer P', 'Jin Y', 'Tarighat SS', 'Khalife J', 'Walker A', 'Perrotti D', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Wang H', 'Lee RJ', 'Lee LJ', 'Marcucci G']","['Molecular Cellular and Developmental Biology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center for Affordable Nanoengineering of Polymeric Biomedical Devices, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center for Affordable Nanoengineering of Polymeric Biomedical Devices, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center for Affordable Nanoengineering of Polymeric Biomedical Devices, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'William G.

In this study, we show that subtoxic doses of metformin effectively sensitize human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which induces apoptosis. Metformin alone did not induce apoptosis, but significantly potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis in CRC cells. CRC cells treated with metformin and TRAIL showed activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of caspase activation. We attempted to elucidate the underlying mechanism, and found that metformin significantly reduced the protein levels of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) in CRC cells and, the overexpression of Mcl-1 inhibited cell death induced by metformin and/or TRAIL. Further experiments revealed that metformin did not affect mRNA levels, but increased proteasomal degradation and protein stability of Mcl-1. Knockdown of Mule triggered a significant decrease of Mcl-1 polyubiquitination. Metformin caused the dissociation of Noxa from Mcl-1, which allowed the binding of the BH3-containing ubiquitin ligase Mule followed by Mcl-1ubiquitination and degradation. The metformin-induced degradation of Mcl-1 required E3 ligase Mule, which is responsible for the polyubiquitination of Mcl-1. Our study is the first report indicating that metformin enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis through Noxa and favors the interaction between Mcl-1 and Mule, which consequently affects Mcl-1 ubiquitination.","['Park, Seong Hye', 'Lee, Dae-Hee', 'Kim, Jung Lim', 'Kim, Bo Ram', 'Na, Yoo Jin', 'Jo, Min Jee', 'Jeong, Yoon A', 'Lee, Suk-Young', 'Lee, Sun Il', 'Lee, Yong Yook', 'Oh, Sang Cheul']","['Park SH', 'Lee DH', 'Kim JL', 'Kim BR', 'Na YJ', 'Jo MJ', 'Jeong YA', 'Lee SY', 'Lee SI', 'Lee YY', 'Oh SC']","['Brain Korea 21 Program for Biomedicine Science, Korea University College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Program for Biomedicine Science, Korea University College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Oncology/Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Oncology/Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Program for Biomedicine Science, Korea University College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Program for Biomedicine Science, Korea University College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Program for Biomedicine Science, Korea University College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Oncology/Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Oncology/Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Surgery, Korea University Guro Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'The Korean Ginseng Research Institute, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Program for Biomedicine Science, Korea University College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Oncology/Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (HUWE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Metformin/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",['NOTNLM'],"['CRC', 'Mcl-1', 'Noxa', 'TRAIL', 'metformin']",2016/08/16 06:00,2018/01/31 06:00,['2016/08/13 06:00'],"['2015/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['11147 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11147 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 13;7(37):59503-59518. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11147.,10.18632/oncotarget.11147 [doi],,,,,PMC5312327,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using an established murine acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model, we here show that systemic administration of recombinant IL-33 dramatically inhibits the leukemia growth and prolongs the survival of leukemia-bearing mice in a CD8+ T cell dependent manner. Exogenous IL-33 treatment enhanced anti-leukemia activity by increasing the expansion and IFN-gamma production of leukemia-reactive CD8+ T cells. Moreover, IL-33 promoted dendritic cell (DC) maturation and activation in favor of its cross presentation ability to evoke a vigorous anti-leukemia immune response. Finally, we found that the combination of PD-1 blockade with IL-33 further prolonged the survival, with half of the mice achieving complete regression. Our data establish a role of exogenous IL-33 in reversing T cell tolerance, and suggest its potential clinical implication into leukemia immunotherapy.","['Qin, Lei', 'Dominguez, Donye', 'Chen, Siqi', 'Fan, Jie', 'Long, Alan', 'Zhang, Minghui', 'Fang, Deyu', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Kuzel, Timothy M', 'Zhang, Bin']","['Qin L', 'Dominguez D', 'Chen S', 'Fan J', 'Long A', 'Zhang M', 'Fang D', 'Zhang Y', 'Kuzel TM', 'Zhang B']","['Biotherapy Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, Henan, China.', 'Robert H.

However, intrinsic and acquired resistance against this drug has been defined and this issue has become a problem and a challenge in CML treatment. According to new findings, the inhibition of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) in Bcr-Abl+ cells can promote apoptosis in IM-resistant cells. microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the gene expression by targeting the messenger RNA (mRNA) for degradation. Recently, a growing body of evidence has implicated that dysregulation of miRNAs is associated with cancer initiation and development. In this report, we proposed that miRNA-101 targets Jak2 mRNA and regulates its expression and induces K562 leukemia cell apoptosis. Here, we transduced the K562 cell line with a miR-101-overexpressing vector and evaluated the Jak2 mRNA level. Our results showed that miR-101 overexpression in Bcr-Abl+ cells reduced the Jak2 mRNA level. Moreover, imatinib treatment and miR-101 upregulation led to miR-23a overexpression, which has putative binding site(s) on 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of STAT5, CCND1, and Bcl-2 genes. Our results also indicated that miR-101 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation indicated by the MTT assay and promoted apoptosis detected via flow cytometry. Importantly, mRNA expression of NF-kappa B-regulated anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, MCL-1, XIAP, and survivin) and proliferative (c-Myc and CCND1) genes was decreased. These findings suggest that miR-101 acts as a tumor suppressor by downregulating Jak2 expression and sensitizing K562 cells to imatinib. Therefore, restoration of miR-101 may be a therapeutic approach for CML treatment.","['Farhadi, Elham', 'Zaker, Farhad', 'Safa, Majid', 'Rezvani, Mohammad Reza']","['Farhadi E', 'Zaker F', 'Safa M', 'Rezvani MR']","['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Hemmat Highway, Tehran, 1449614535, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Hemmat Highway, Tehran, 1449614535, Iran. farhadz20@yahoo.co.uk.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. farhadz20@yahoo.co.uk.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Hemmat Highway, Tehran, 1449614535, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Hemmat Highway, Tehran, 1449614535, Iran.', 'Immune and Gene Therapy Laboratory, Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160812,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN101 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*CML', '*Imatinib', '*Jak2', '*miR-101']",2016/08/16 06:00,2017/03/01 06:00,['2016/08/13 06:00'],"['2016/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13277-016-5205-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-016-5205-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2016 Oct;37(10):14117-14128. doi: 10.1007/s13277-016-5205-9.

We showed that CD133(+)CD13(+) hepatocytes isolated from HuH7 cells and primary HCC cells display biochemical and functional characteristics typical of CSCs, suggesting that CD133(+)CD13(+) hepatocytes in primary HCC tumors function as CSCs. We also found that arsenite treatment reduced the viability and stemness of CD133(+)CD13(+) hepatocytes, enhanced the sensitivity of HuH7 cells to pirarubicin, and reduced the tumorigenicity of CD133(+)CD13(+) hepatocytes xenografts in mice. The effects of sodium arsenite treatment in CD133(+)CD13(+) hepatocytes were mediated by the post-transcriptional suppression of PML expression and the inhibition of Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 expression at the transcriptional level. Incomplete rescue of Oct4 expression in arsenic-treated cells ectopically expressing an siRNA-resistant PML transcript suggested that OCT4 regulation in liver CSCs involves other factors in addition to PML. Our findings provide evidence of a specific role for PML in regulating Oct4 levels in liver CSCs and highlight the clinical importance of arsenic for improving the efficacy of other chemotherapeutic agents and the prevention of post-operative HCC recurrence and metastasis.","['Tang, Huaming', 'Jin, Yukai', 'Jin, Shilong', 'Tan, Zhiming', 'Peng, Zhang', 'Kuang, Yuanli']","['Tang H', 'Jin Y', 'Jin S', 'Tan Z', 'Peng Z', 'Kuang Y']","['Department of Hepaticbiliary Surgery, Kai Xian Poeples Hospital of Chongqing City, 8#, Ankang Road, Hanfeng Street, Kai County, Chongqing city, 405400, China.', 'the Clinical Medical Department, Peking Union Medical College, Zijing Department, Tsinghua University, 328A 27#, Beijing City, China.', 'Department of Hepaticbiliary Surgery, Kai Xian Poeples Hospital of Chongqing City, 8#, Ankang Road, Hanfeng Street, Kai County, Chongqing city, 405400, China.

Here, we identify the host transcript of miR-223, linc-223, as a novel functional long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in AML. We show that from the primary nuclear transcript, the alternative production of miR-223 and linc-223 is finely regulated during monocytic differentiation. Moreover, linc-223 expression inhibits cell cycle progression and promotes monocytic differentiation of AML cells. We also demonstrate that endogenous linc-223 localizes in the cytoplasm and acts as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-125-5p, an oncogenic microRNA in leukemia. In particular, we show that linc-223 directly binds to miR-125-5p and that its knockdown increases the repressing activity of miR-125-5p resulting in the downregulation of its target interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), which it was previously shown to inhibit the oncogenic activity of miR-125-5p in vivo. Furthermore, data from primary AML samples show significant downregulation of linc-223 in different AML subtypes. Therein, these findings indicate that the newly identified lncRNA linc-223 may have an important role in myeloid differentiation and leukemogenesis, at least in part, by cross-talking with IRF4 mRNA.","['Mangiavacchi, Arianna', 'Sorci, Melissa', 'Masciarelli, Silvia', 'Larivera, Simone', 'Legnini, Ivano', 'Iosue, Ilaria', 'Bozzoni, Irene', 'Fazi, Francesco', 'Fatica, Alessandro']","['Mangiavacchi A', 'Sorci M', 'Masciarelli S', 'Larivera S', 'Legnini I', 'Iosue I', 'Bozzoni I', 'Fazi F', 'Fatica A']","['Department of Biology and Biotechnology ""C.

Homing and lodgement into BM of transplanted HSCs are the first critical steps in their engraftment and involve multiple interactions between HSCs and the BM microenvironment.uPAR is a three domain receptor (DIDIIDIII) which binds urokinase, vitronectin, integrins. uPAR can be cleaved and shed from the cell surface generating full-length and cleaved soluble forms (suPAR and DIIDIII-suPAR). DIIDIII-suPAR can bind fMLF receptors through the SRSRY sequence (residues 88-92).We previously reported the involvement of soluble uPAR in HSC mobilization. We now investigate its possible role in HSC homing and engraftment.We show similar levels of circulating full-length suPAR in healthy donors and in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients before and after the pre-transplant conditioning regimen. By contrast, levels of circulating DIIDIII-suPAR in AML patients are higher as compared to controls and significantly decrease after the conditioning.We found that suPAR and uPAR84-95, a uPAR-derived peptide which mimics active DIIDIII-suPAR, induce a significant increase in Long Term Culture (LTC)-Initiating Cells (ICs) and in the release of clonogenic progenitors from LTCs of CD34+ HSCs. Further, suPAR increases adhesion and survival of CD34+ KG1 AML cells, whereas uPAR84-95 increases their proliferation.Thus, circulating DIIDIII-suPAR, strongly increased in HSC mobilization, is indeed down-regulated by pre-transplant conditioning, probably to favour HSC homing. BM full-length suPAR and DIIDIII-suPAR may be involved in HSC lodgement within the BM by contributing to a suitable microenvironment.","['Selleri, Carmine', 'Montuori, Nunzia', 'Salvati, Annamaria', 'Serio, Bianca', 'Pesapane, Ada', 'Ricci, Patrizia', 'Gorrasi, Anna', 'Li Santi, Anna', 'Hoyer-Hansen, Gunilla', 'Ragno, Pia']","['Selleri C', 'Montuori N', 'Salvati A', 'Serio B', 'Pesapane A', 'Ricci P', 'Gorrasi A', 'Li Santi A', 'Hoyer-Hansen G', 'Ragno P']","['Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Salerno, Salerno, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medical Sciences, ""Federico II"" University, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biology, University of Salerno, Salerno, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Salerno, Salerno, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medical Sciences, ""Federico II"" University, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Salerno, Salerno, Italy.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biology, University of Salerno, Salerno, Italy.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biology, University of Salerno, Salerno, Italy.', 'The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biology, University of Salerno, Salerno, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/metabolism/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator/blood/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Stem Cell Niche', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['bone marrow microenvironment', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'leukemia', 'uPAR', 'urokinase receptor']",2016/08/16 06:00,2018/02/06 06:00,['2016/08/13 06:00'],"['2016/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['11115 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11115 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 13;7(37):60206-60217. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11115.,10.18632/oncotarget.11115 [doi],,,,,PMC5312379,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated this by describing associations between infection transmission using the population mixing (PM) proxy and incidence of cancers in TYAs in Yorkshire, UK. METHODS: We extracted cancer cases from the Yorkshire Specialist Register of Cancer in Children and Young People from 1990 to 2013 (n = 1929). Using multivariable Poisson regression models (adjusting for effects of deprivation and population density), we investigated whether PM was associated with cancer incidence. We included population mixing-population density interaction terms to examine for differences in effects of PM in urban and rural populations. RESULTS: Nonsignificant IRRs were observed for leukemias (IRR 1.20, 95% CI 0.91-1.59), lymphomas (IRR 1.09, 95% CI 0.90-1.32), central nervous system tumors (IRR 1.06, 95% CI 0.80-1.40) and germ cell tumors (IRR 1.14, 95% CI 0.92-1.41). The association between PM and cancer incidence did not vary in urban and rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: Study results suggest PM is not associated with incidence of cancers among TYAs. This effect does not differ between rural and urban settings.","['Imam, A', 'Fairley, L', 'Parslow, R C', 'Feltbower, R G']","['Imam A', 'Fairley L', 'Parslow RC', 'Feltbower RG']","['Department of Paediatrics, Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, PMB 3452 Zaria road, Kano, Nigeria.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Medicine, University of Leeds, Room 8.49, Worsley Building, Clarendon Way, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK. l.fairley@leeds.ac.uk.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Medicine, University of Leeds, Room 8.49, Worsley Building, Clarendon Way, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Medicine, University of Leeds, Room 8.49, Worsley Building, Clarendon Way, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160812,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Rural Population/statistics & numerical data', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Urban Population/statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Population mixing', '*Teenagers and young adults']",2016/08/16 06:00,2017/06/03 06:00,['2016/08/13 06:00'],"['2016/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10552-016-0797-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s10552-016-0797-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2016 Oct;27(10):1287-92. doi: 10.1007/s10552-016-0797-3.

It is necessary and feasible to analyze known lncRNA-disease associations, predict potential lncRNA-disease associations, and provide the most possible lncRNA-disease pairs for experimental validation. Considering the limitations of traditional Random Walk with Restart (RWR), the model of Improved Random Walk with Restart for LncRNA-Disease Association prediction (IRWRLDA) was developed to predict novel lncRNA-disease associations by integrating known lncRNA-disease associations, disease semantic similarity, and various lncRNA similarity measures. The novelty of IRWRLDA lies in the incorporation of lncRNA expression similarity and disease semantic similarity to set the initial probability vector of the RWR. Therefore, IRWRLDA could be applied to diseases without any known related lncRNAs. IRWRLDA significantly improved previous classical models with reliable AUCs of 0.7242 and 0.7872 in two known lncRNA-disease association datasets downloaded from the lncRNADisease database, respectively. Further case studies of colon cancer and leukemia were implemented for IRWRLDA and 60% of lncRNAs in the top 10 prediction lists have been confirmed by recent experimental reports.","['Chen, Xing', 'You, Zhu-Hong', 'Yan, Gui-Ying', 'Gong, Dun-Wei']","['Chen X', 'You ZH', 'Yan GY', 'Gong DW']","['School of Information and Electrical Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, 221116, China.', 'School of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, 221116, China.', 'Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China.', 'National Center for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China.', 'School of Information and Electrical Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, 221116, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Computer Simulation', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Statistical', 'Normal Distribution', 'Probability', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results']",['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'disease', 'lncRNAs', 'random walk with restart']",2016/08/16 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2016/08/13 06:00'],"['2016/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['11141 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11141 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 6;7(36):57919-57931. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11141.,10.18632/oncotarget.11141 [doi],,,,,PMC5295400,['The authors declare no conflict(s) of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical signs were mainly presented with tumor syndrome (73.1%), fever (61%) and hemorrhagic syndrome (50%). The most common blood count abnormalities were: thrombopenia (89.4%), anemia (86.5%), hyperleukocytosis (79.8%). The rate of peripheral and bone marrow blasts was statistically higher for LAL than for AML and BAL (p <0.001). The rate of relapse and mortality was 21.2% and 16. 3% respectively. Concordance rate between the results of cytology and of immunophenotyping was 92.7% for LAL and 82.6% for AML. Diagnosis of AL is always based primarily on cytology. Immunophenotyping allowed us to make a better distinction between acute leukemias.

Here, we examined the function of SOCS3 in the growth and chemo-sensitivity of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and explored the involved mechanisms. METHODS: Expression levels of SOCS3 in several leukemia cell lines and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNCs) from CML patients were determined using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting (WB). The roles of SOCS3 in the proliferation, apoptosis, and drug resistance of CML cells were examined by clonogenic progenitor cell assay, flow cytometry, and CCK-8 assay. A detailed analysis of the underlying mechanism of SOCS3 in K562 cells was performed using the Human HT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip, which has more than 48000 gene probes including 600 microRNAs (miRNA) probes. The correlation between the mRNA expression of SOCS3 and miR-124-3p in BMNCs from 30 CML patients was tested by qPCR and analyzed by Pearson correlation and linear regression analysis. The potential target of miR-124-3p in CML cells was explored using the luciferase reporter assay, qPCR, and WB. The effect of SOCS3 on the miR-124-3p/B4GALT1 axis was investigated by qPCR, WB, CCK-8 assay, and tumorigenicity assays in nude mice. RESULTS: SOCS3 was down-regulated in CML cell lines and most of BMNCs from CML patients, and the expression level of SOCS3 was associated with the inhibition of cell proliferation and drug resistance of CML cells. Over-expression of SOCS3 in K562 cells inhibited the expression of leukemia-specific genes and promoted the expression of some miRNAs, among which miR-124-3p was the highest. SOCS3 over-expression enhanced the expression of miR-124-3p and vice versa. The mRNA expression of miR-124-3p and SOCS3 in BMNCs from 30 CML patients was positively correlated. Consistently, the tumor suppressing effects of SOCS3 were partially neutralized by the miR-124-3p inhibitor. B4GALT1 was downstream of miR-124-3p and regulated by SOCS3/miR-124-3p in vitro. Furthermore, SOCS3 over-expression could inhibit the growth and B4GALT expression of K562 cells in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: SOCS3/miR-124-3p/B4GALT1 axis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CML.","['Liu, Yu-Xiao', 'Wang, Li', 'Liu, Wen-Jia', 'Zhang, Hai-Tao', 'Xue, Jing-Hui', 'Zhang, Zhi-Wen', 'Gao, Chun-Ji']","['Liu YX', 'Wang L', 'Liu WJ', 'Zhang HT', 'Xue JH', 'Zhang ZW', 'Gao CJ']","[""Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chinese PLA General Hospital, 51 Fushi Road, Beijing, 100048, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Laoshan Branch, No. 401, Qingdao, 266100, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Genetic Laboratory of Development and Diseases, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100071, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chinese PLA General Hospital, 51 Fushi Road, Beijing, 100048, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chinese PLA General Hospital, 51 Fushi Road, Beijing, 100048, People's Republic of China. xuejh629@163.com."", ""Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chinese PLA General Hospital, 51 Fushi Road, Beijing, 100048, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, People's Republic of China. gaochunji@hotmail.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160812,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (MIRN124 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Galactosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Galactosyltransferases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/drug effects/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein/analysis/genetics/*physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B4GALT1', '*Chemo-sensitivity', '*Leukemogenesis', '*SOCS3', '*miR-124']",2016/08/16 06:00,2017/12/06 06:00,['2016/08/13 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-016-0300-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-016-0300-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Aug 12;9(1):69. doi: 10.1186/s13045-016-0300-3.,10.1186/s13045-016-0300-3 [doi],,,,,PMC4982324,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological features of patients with MS and reviewed the relevant literature. RESULTS: There were 39 patients (20 male and 19 female, with a ratio of 1.1:1) aged 2-62 years (median: 33 years; mean: 33.4 years), with 53.9% patients in the 21-50 years age group. The clinical manifestations varied and were dependent on the lesion location. Immunohistochemistry and special staining showed that the positive rates for myeloperoxidase, CD43, CD34, CD117, CD68, Lysozyme, CD99, and naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase were 92.1% (35/38), 91.3% (21/23), 44.8% (13/29), 42.3% (11/26), 61.1% (11/18), 100.0% (5/5), 78.6% (11/14), and 55.6% (10/18), respectively. Histologically, the cells were predominantly arranged diffusely, and the solitary infiltrating cells may show an acinus-like arrangement, while some cells were arranged in linear or ""Indian file"" pattern. Obvious small nucleoli were seen in most cases. The nuclei were predominantly round or oval, although eccentric, kidney-shaped, and lobulated nuclei were also observed. A varied number of eosinophilic granulocytes were found in most cases. The ""starry sky"" appearance was observed in a few patients. Among 18 patients, the survival rate was 38.9% and the median survival time was 28 months. MS occurred following allogeneic stem cell transplantation in 5 cases. There were 14 de-novo (45.2%,14/31) and 17 secondary MS (54.8%, 17/31). As for de-novo MS, female rates was higher (64.3% vs. 29.4%), older average years (41.4 vs. 31.1 years), older middle years (47.5 vs.32 years). CONCLUSIONS: The combined application of morphology, immunohistochemistry, and special staining may facilitate the diagnosis of this malignancy. Surgery plus chemotherapy remains the most common treatment for MS. The prognosis of MS was bad.","['Wang, Hong-Qun', 'Li, Jie']","['Wang HQ', 'Li J']","[""Department of Pathology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China; Department of Pathology, The Third People's Hospital of Hefei City, Hefei, China.

The protocol was subsequently amended and imatinib was incorporated in the induction and post-remission phase together with chemotherapy. Due to the toxicity of this combined approach, the protocol was further amended to a sequential scheme based on imatinib plus steroids as induction, followed by consolidation with chemotherapy plus imatinib and, when applicable, by a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Fifty-one patients (median age 45.9 years) were enrolled in the final sequential protocol. At the end of induction (day +50), 96% of evaluable patients (n=49) achieved a complete hematologic remission; after consolidation, all were in complete hematologic remission. No deaths in induction were recorded. Overall survival and disease-free survival at 60 months are 48.8% and 45.8%, respectively. At day +50 (end of imatinib induction), a more than 1.3 log-reduction of BCR-ABL1 levels was associated with a significantly longer disease-free survival (55.6%, 95%CI: 39.0-79.3 vs. 20%, 95%CI: 5.8-69.1; P=0.03), overall survival (59.1%, 95%CI: 42.3-82.6 vs. 20%, 95%CI: 5.8-69.1; P=0.02) and lower incidence of relapse (20.5%, 95%CI: 7.2-38.6 vs. 60.0%, 95%CI: 21.6-84.3; P=0.01). Mean BCR-ABL1 levels remained significantly higher in patients who subsequently relapsed. Finally, BCR-ABL1(p190) patients showed a significantly faster molecular response than BCR-ABL1(p210) patients (P=0.023). Though the study was not powered to evaluate the role of allogeneic stem cell transplant, allografting positively impacted on both overall and disease-free survival. In conclusion, a sequential approach with imatinib alone in induction, consolidated by chemotherapy plus imatinib followed by a stem cell transplant is a feasible, well-tolerated and effective strategy for adult Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, leading to the best long-term survival rates so far reported.

However, few studies have investigated the risk of metabolic syndrome, a known predictor of cardiovascular disease, in patients treated without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We describe the overall and age-specific prevalence, and the risk factors for metabolic syndrome and its components in the L.E.A. (Leucemie de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent) French cohort of childhood acute leukemia survivors treated without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The study included 650 adult patients (mean age at evaluation: 24.2 years; mean follow-up after leukemia diagnosis: 16.0 years). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 6.9% (95% CI 5.1-9.2). The age-specific cumulative prevalence at 20, 25, 30 and 35 years of age was 1.3%, 6.1%, 10.8% and 22.4%, respectively. The prevalence of decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, increased triglycerides, increased fasting glucose, increased blood pressure and increased abdominal circumference was 26.8%, 11.7%, 5.8%, 36.7% and 16.7%, respectively. Risk factors significantly associated with metabolic syndrome in the multivariate analysis were male sex (OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.32-5.29), age at last evaluation (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.04-1.17) and body mass index at diagnosis (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.01-1.32). The cumulative steroid dose was not a significant risk factor. Irradiated and non-irradiated patients exhibited different patterns of metabolic abnormalities, with more frequent abdominal obesity in irradiated patients and more frequent hypertension in non-irradiated patients.

The study evaluated the potential mechanism of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in HQ-induced TK6 cell malignant transformation. The data of our study show that short term exposure of TK6 cells to HQ led to a decrease expression of SIRT1. Knockdown of SIRT1 sensitized to the HQ-induced apoptosis in vitro and increased the expression of p53, p21 and gamma-H2AX. Furthermore, chronic HQ-treated (20muM once a week for 19 weeks) caused carcinogenic transformation and was confirmed by abnormal cell proliferation, matrix metalloproteinase 9(MMP9) and subcutaneous tumor formation in nude mice. SIRT1 increased KRAS expression, and decreased H3K9 and H3K18 acetylation, inhibited p53 signaling and the level of caspase-3 in HQ-induced transformation cells. Taken together, these data suggest that SIRT1 is involved in HQ-induced malignant transformation associated with suppressing p53 signaling and activation of KRAS.","['Chen, Yuting', 'Chen, Jiajia', 'Yun, Lin', 'Xu, Longmei', 'Liu, Jiaxian', 'Xu, Yongchun', 'Yang, Hui', 'Liang, Hairong', 'Tang, Huanwen']","['Chen Y', 'Chen J', 'Yun L', 'Xu L', 'Liu J', 'Xu Y', 'Yang H', 'Liang H', 'Tang H']","['School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China; Dongguan Key Laboratory of Enviromental Medicine, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China.', 'School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China; Dongguan Key Laboratory of Enviromental Medicine, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China.', 'School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China; Dongguan Key Laboratory of Enviromental Medicine, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China.', 'School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China; Dongguan Key Laboratory of Enviromental Medicine, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China.', 'School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China; Dongguan Key Laboratory of Enviromental Medicine, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China.', 'School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China; Dongguan Key Laboratory of Enviromental Medicine, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China.', 'School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China; Dongguan Key Laboratory of Enviromental Medicine, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China.', 'School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China; Dongguan Key Laboratory of Enviromental Medicine, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China.', 'School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China; Dongguan Key Laboratory of Enviromental Medicine, PR-523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China.

CD49d, the alpha chain of the alpha4beta1 integrin heterodimer, is one of the main interactors between CLL cells and accessory cells in the microenvironmental sites and one of the main predictors of overall survival. In particular, CD49d is known to play a pivotal role in mediating both cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in CLL-involved tissues eventually delivering prosurvival signals and protecting CLL cells from drug-induced damages. Treatment strategies targeting the alpha4beta1 integrin could represent an interesting option in CLL. In this context, the recombinant anti-CD49d antibody natalizumab demonstrated the potential to overcome stromal cell-induced resistance of B cell lymphoma cells against cytotoxic drugs and rituximab in vitro. Moreover, a specific interest for the CD49d molecule raises from the clinical activity of the recently proposed inhibitors of kinases downstream the BCR that has been recently related with the inside-out activation of the alpha4beta1 integrin. In the review, we addressed in detail the role of CD49d in CLL cells, including clinical impact, relationship with specific cytogenetic features, and CD49d-dependent interactions in lymph node and bone marrow microenvironment responsible for growth- and survival- supporting signals, eventually influencing CLL prognosis and therapeutic options.","['Dal Bo, Michele', 'Tissino, Erika', 'Benedetti, Dania', 'Caldana, Chiara', 'Bomben, Riccardo', 'Poeta, Giovanni Del', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Rossi, Francesca Maria', 'Bulian, Pietro', 'Zucchetto, Antonella', 'Gattei, Valter']","['Dal Bo M', 'Tissino E', 'Benedetti D', 'Caldana C', 'Bomben R', 'Poeta GD', 'Gaidano G', 'Rossi FM', 'Bulian P', 'Zucchetto A', 'Gattei V']","['Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Via Franco Gallini 2, Postal code 33081, Aviano (PN), Italy. micheledalbo@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Integrin alpha Chains)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '143198-26-9 (Integrin alpha4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha Chains/*metabolism', 'Integrin alpha4/*metabolism', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism']",,,2016/10/21 06:00,2017/10/04 06:00,['2016/08/13 06:00'],"['1970/01/01 00:00 [received]', '1970/01/01 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/04 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['CCDT-EPUB-77645 [pii]', '10.2174/1568009616666160809102219 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2016;16(8):659-668. doi: 10.2174/1568009616666160809102219.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protein interactions necessary for assembly are mediated predominantly by the capsid (CA) and nucleocapsid (NC) domains, which have conserved structures. In contrast, the structural arrangement of the CA-NC connecting region differs between retroviral species. In HIV-1 and Rous sarcoma virus, this region forms a rod-like structure that separates the CA and NC domains, whereas in Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, this region is densely packed, thus holding the CA and NC domains in close proximity. Interestingly, the sequence connecting the CA and NC domains in gammaretroviruses, such as murine leukemia virus (MLV), is unique. The sequence is called a charged assembly helix (CAH) due to a high number of positively and negatively charged residues. Although both computational and deletion analyses suggested that the MLV CAH forms a helical conformation, no structural or biochemical data supporting this hypothesis have been published. Using an in vitro assembly assay, alanine scanning mutagenesis, and biophysical techniques (circular dichroism, NMR, microcalorimetry, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay), we have characterized the structure and function of the MLV CAH. We provide experimental evidence that the MLV CAH belongs to a group of charged, E(R/K)-rich, single alpha-helices. This is the first single alpha-helix motif identified in viral proteins.","['Dolezal, Michal', 'Hadravova, Romana', 'Kozisek, Milan', 'Bednarova, Lucie', 'Langerova, Hana', 'Ruml, Tomas', 'Rumlova, Michaela']","['Dolezal M', 'Hadravova R', 'Kozisek M', 'Bednarova L', 'Langerova H', 'Ruml T', 'Rumlova M']","['From the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Flemingovo namesti 2, 16610 Prague 6.', 'From the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Flemingovo namesti 2, 16610 Prague 6.', 'From the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Flemingovo namesti 2, 16610 Prague 6.', 'From the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Flemingovo namesti 2, 16610 Prague 6.', 'the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Chemistry and Technology, Prague 6, Technicka 3, 166 28 Prague, and.', 'the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Chemistry and Technology, Prague 6, Technicka 3, 166 28 Prague, and.', 'From the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Flemingovo namesti 2, 16610 Prague 6, the Department of Biotechnology, University of Chemistry and Technology, Technicka 5, 166 28 Prague, Czech Republic michaela.rumlova@vscht.cz.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160811,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,['0 (Capsid Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Capsid Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*chemistry/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Structure, Secondary']",['NOTNLM'],"['*capsid protein (CA)', '*charged assembly helix (CAH)', '*circular dichroism (CD)', '*electron microscopy (EM)', '*murine leukemia virus (MLV)', '*nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)', '*retrovirus', '*single alpha-helix (SAH)', '*spacer peptide (SP)', '*virus assembly']",2016/08/16 06:00,2017/05/20 06:00,['2016/08/13 06:00'],"['2016/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)35933-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.746461 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Sep 23;291(39):20630-42. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.746461.

The smart nanostructures were functionalized gold nanoparticles (FGNs) containing five antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) and one anti-CD33(+)/CD34(+) aptamer. First, the best AO for each gene was selected with the OligoWalk online software, and then different arrangements of AOs were evaluated with the RNAstructure software. Thereafter, naked gold nanoparticles (NGNs) were synthesized by the reaction of 1000 mm HAuCl4 with 10 mug ml(-1) ascorbic acid. Next, five AOs and one anti-CD33(+)/CD34(+) aptamer were attached to NGNs through serial reactions. Later, 5 ml of heparinized blood samples from five AML-M2 patients were prepared, cancerous cells were isolated and then incubated with three concentrations (75, 150 and 300 mug ml(-1)) each of FGNs, NGNs, gold nanoparticles functionalized with scrambled oligonucleotides (GNFSONs) and doxorubicin. Finally, cell death percentage and gene expressions were measured by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and real-time PCR, respectively. This study showed that FGNs and doxorubicin led to more cell death compared with NGNs and GNFSONs (P<0.05). Interestingly, all concentrations of FGNs led to a decrease in gene expression. As an important finding, although all concentrations of doxorubicin could also inhibit the expression of genes, FGNs had more effect (P<0.05). Moreover, both NGNs and GNFSONs could silence all genes only at a concentration of 300 mug ml(-1).

METHODS: Field investigation and routine data analysis were performed to analyze the cases diagnosed by Guangdong Provincial Hospital for Occupational Disease Prevention and Treatment from January 2009 to December 2014. RESULTS: A total of 136 cases of occupational diseases were diagnosed by Guangdong Provincial Hospital for Occupational Disease Prevention and Treatment from 2009 to 2014, and there were 66 cases of leukemia, 18 cases of suspected occupational benzene poisoning, 12 cases of suspected occupational handarm vibration disease, and 11 cases of suspected pneumoconiosis. Of all these patients, 41.91% were engaged in at least three types of work, 70.59% were exposed to at least three types of chemicals, 25.74% experienced changes in technical processes and chemicals, and 47.06% had disputes on the chemicals they were exposed to during verification by both parties. Occupational hazard factors were detected. Most samples (358)were used to measure benzene concentration in workplace air, among which 11.7% had a benzene concentration of >6.00 mg/m(3)(exceeding standard), 13.41% had a benzene concentration of 3.26~6.00 mg/m(3), 75.42% had a benzene concentration of<0.03 to <3.25 mg/m(3). The samples of suspected occupational hand-arm vibration disease, suspected pneumoconiosis, and suspected occupational noiseinduced hearing loss had high overstandard rates (100%, 93.8%, and 83.3%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Field investigation of occupational disease diagnosis reveals large numbers of cases of leukemia, suspected occupational benzene poisoning, suspected occupational hand-arm vibration disease, and suspected pneumoconiosis. The key aspects of field investigation include confirmation of the history of occupational exposure, identification of occupational hazard factors, confirmation of the changes in technical processes and chemicals, detection of occupational hazard factors, sampling and analysis of raw materials, and epidemiological investigation of workers with the same type of work.","['Fan, C Y', 'Li, X D', 'Wen, W', 'Wang, Y Y', 'Zhang, Y', 'Lang, L']","['Fan CY', 'Li XD', 'Wen W', 'Wang YY', 'Zhang Y', 'Lang L']","['Guangdong Province Hospital for Occupational Disease Prevention and Treatment, Guangzhou 510300, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Lao Dong Wei Sheng Zhi Ye Bing Za Zhi,Zhonghua lao dong wei sheng zhi ye bing za zhi = Zhonghua laodong weisheng zhiyebing zazhi = Chinese journal of industrial hygiene and occupational diseases,8410840,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Benzene', 'Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome', 'Humans', '*Occupational Diseases', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Pneumoconiosis', 'Vibration']",,,2016/08/16 06:00,2017/04/04 06:00,['2016/08/13 06:00'],"['2016/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-9391.2016.04.010 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Lao Dong Wei Sheng Zhi Ye Bing Za Zhi. 2016 Apr 20;34(4):278-82. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-9391.2016.04.010.,10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-9391.2016.04.010 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we have hypothesized that this defect might originate from BCR-ABL-dependent dysfunctions in myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs). Indeed, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy revealed that cell surface expression of CD1d was downregulated in CML mDCs, relative to healthy donor (HD) controls. The decreased cell surface display of CD1d could not be ascribed to defective mDC differentiation, as attested by normal expression of HLA-DR and the CD86 maturation marker. On the other hand, reduced membrane expression was not associated with decreased intracytoplasmic levels of CD1d or its mRNA transcripts, consistent with intracellular retention. In vitro treatment of CML mDCs with the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 partially restored both cell surface CD1d expression and CD1d-mediated antigen presentation, whereas it had no effect on HD mDCs. An inhibitor of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase (TK), imatinib mesylate (IM), had no such activity. Similar recovery of CD1d expression occurred with fasudil, another ROCK inhibitor that is commonly used in clinical trials. Our data support the conclusion that BCR-ABL-dependent ROCK, but not TK, is involved in CD1d downregulation. We propose that ROCK, which is most likely activated by the DH/PH domain of BCR-ABL, mediates iNKT-cell immune subversion in CML patients by downregulating CD1d expression on CML mDCs. Our study reveals the ROCK-mDC axis as a new potential target to restore immune surveillance in patients with CML, offering new therapeutic perspectives for CML treatment.

ALL treatment has standard protocols, and treatment abandonment is a main cause of treatment failure. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the relationship between socioeconomic status and rate as well as cause of abandoned treatment in children with ALL in the southeast of Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective, descriptive cohort study was conducted with ALL patients at the Ali Asghar Hospital in the city of Zahedan. The study population included 22 children with different subtypes of ALL who had abandoned their treatment. A structural questionnaire was filled out by patients or their parents. Results were assessed using descriptive and analytical tests. RESULTS: The rate of treatment abandonment was 24.4% (22 patients).We had 18 ALL-L1 (78.3%) and four ALL-L2 (17.4%) patients. Reasons for treatment abandonment were low family income, transportation difficulties, the father's education status, conviction about ALL's incurability, and reference to spiritual means, respectively. CONCLUSION: Low family income, transportation difficulties, the father's education status, belief about ALL's incurability, and reference to spiritual means were the most common associations with ALL treatment abandonment in that order. Financial problems in this part of the country can impose high costs to the healthcare system.","['Naderi, Majid', 'Esmaeili Reykande, Samira', 'Tabibian, Shadi', 'Alizadeh, Shaban', 'Dorgalaleh, Akbar', 'Shamsizadeh, Morteza']","['Naderi M', 'Esmaeili Reykande S', 'Tabibian S', 'Alizadeh S', 'Dorgalaleh A', 'Shamsizadeh M']","['Genetic Researcher Center in Non-Communicable Diseases, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Students Research Center, School of Allied Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Students Research Center, School of Allied Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'School of Nursing and Midwifery, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160419,Turkey,Turk J Med Sci,Turkish journal of medical sciences,9441758,,IM,"['Humans', 'Iran', 'Parents', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'socioeconomic status', 'treatment abandonment']",2016/08/12 06:00,2018/09/21 06:00,['2016/08/12 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3906/sag-1412-42 [doi]'],epublish,Turk J Med Sci. 2016 Apr 19;46(3):706-11. doi: 10.3906/sag-1412-42.,10.3906/sag-1412-42 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27512771,,Publisher,,,,,,2016 Mar,Dendritic Cell-Based Cancer Immunotherapy Targeting Wilms' Tumor 1 for Pediatric Cancer,,"The treatment of advanced pediatric cancers that have metastasized to distant organs remains difficult. Investigations evaluating the potential treatment of these cancers using therapeutic vaccination with an active dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy are also being conducted. This method induces an efficient immune response by the acquired immune system against tumor-associated antigens. Cancer vaccination therapies have been prepared using autologous monocyte-derived mature DCs exposed to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4, which are the molecules principally attributed to the presence of tumor-associated antigens. Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1), an attractive target antigen that has been widely detected in cancers including sarcoma and leukemia, has been shown to be the most potent tumor-associated antigen. DC-based immunotherapy targeting WT1 may have a potentially strong therapeutic activity against cancers. DC vaccines primed with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I-/II-restricted WT1 peptides (WT1-DC) are a feasible option. A 6-year-old girl with neuroblastoma and a 14-year-old girl with WT received autologous DC vaccination pulsed with a modified WT1 peptide compatible with HLA-A(*)24:02. The patients received 20 and 25 vaccines, respectively, and experienced no adverse effects aside from a grade 2 skin reaction at the injection site and a fever with tolerable elevation. WT1tetramer analysis after vaccination detected WT1-specific immune responses. This treatment strategy may be safe, tolerable, and even feasible for all patients who are refractory to treatment and for pediatric patients who have relapsed with neoplasms.","['Shimodaira, Shigetaka', 'Hirabayashi, Koichi', 'Yanagisawa, Ryu', 'Higuchi, Yumiko', 'Sano, Kenji', 'Koizumi, Tomonobu']","['Shimodaira S', 'Hirabayashi K', 'Yanagisawa R', 'Higuchi Y', 'Sano K', 'Koizumi T']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Brisbane (AU),,,,,,,,,2016/08/12 06:00,2016/08/12 06:00,,,"['NBK373368 [bookaccession]', '10.15586/codon.wt.2016.ch8 [doi]']",,,10.15586/codon.wt.2016 [doi],['Copyright: The Authors.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20160812,['9780994438119'],['Codon Publications'],['Wilms Tumor'],['Chapter 8'],"['van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M.']",['van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM'],['2016/08/12 06:00']
27512765,,Publisher,,,,,,2016 Mar,Wilms' Tumor Gene (WT1) Expression and Minimal Residual Disease in Acute Myeloid Leukemia,,"The identification of minimal residual disease (MRD) has led to substantial improvements in early recognition of the recurrence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Flow cytometry (FC), real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization are useful methods for the detection of MRD in AML patients although molecular monitoring of leukemia-specific rearranged (RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and CBFB-MYH11) or mutated genetic (NPM1, CEBPA) sequences represents the most sensitive methodology. Besides, more than 50% of all AML patients lack one of these specific sequences, so it is crucial to identify molecular targets applicable for the majority of patients. WT1 is overexpressed at the mRNA level in 80-90% of AML cases at diagnosis in both peripheral blood and bone marrow, and is detectable in a consistent low range in normal donors. These features have led to its adoption for MRD detection using RQ-PCR. A European LeukemiaNet Study found the magnitude of WT1 log reduction after induction chemotherapy to be an independent predictor of relapse. Other studies showed a poorer outcome in patients having WT1 levels above reference thresholds at specific time points. WT1 expression was compared with other modalities of MRD assessment, such as RQ-PCR of specific fusion genes and FC, but no differences in terms of predictive value emerged. Finally, some authors translated the use of WT1 in the clinic giving donor lymphocytes infusions to patients with increasing WT1-mRNA levels after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and obtaining an improvement of survival in this subset. Data collected on WT1 expression over the past years provided evidence for the use of this molecular marker to stratify high-risk AML patients. It can also be used as a marker for early interventional therapy, but further studies are needed to demonstrate it.","['Rossi, Giovanni', 'Minervini, Maria Marta', 'Carella, Angelo Michele', 'Melillo, Lorella', 'Cascavilla, Nicola']","['Rossi G', 'Minervini MM', 'Carella AM', 'Melillo L', 'Cascavilla N']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Brisbane (AU),,,,,,,,,2016/08/12 06:00,2016/08/12 06:00,,,"['NBK373357 [bookaccession]', '10.15586/codon.wt.2016.ch16 [doi]']",,,10.15586/codon.wt.2016 [doi],['Copyright: The Authors.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20160812,['9780994438119'],['Codon Publications'],['Wilms Tumor'],['Chapter 16'],"['van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M.']",['van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM'],['2016/08/12 06:00']

The mechanistic interplay between these two networks is obscured by functional redundancy and the ability of cells to die either in mitosis or in the subsequent interphase. By coupling time-lapse microscopy with selective pharmacological agents, we systematically probe pro-survival Bcl-xL in response to various mitotic perturbations. Concentration matrices show that BH3-mimetic-mediated inhibition of Bcl-xL synergises with perturbations that induce an SAC-mediated mitotic block, including drugs that dampen microtubule dynamics, and inhibitors targeting kinesins and kinases required for spindle assembly. By contrast, Bcl-xL inhibition does not synergize with drugs which drive cells through an aberrant mitosis by overriding the SAC. This differential effect, which is explained by compensatory Mcl-1 function, provides opportunities for patient stratification and combination treatments in the context of cancer chemotherapy.","['Bennett, Ailsa', 'Sloss, Olivia', 'Topham, Caroline', 'Nelson, Louisa', 'Tighe, Anthony', 'Taylor, Stephen S']","['Bennett A', 'Sloss O', 'Topham C', 'Nelson L', 'Tighe A', 'Taylor SS']","['Manchester Cancer Research Centre, University of Manchester, Wilmslow Road, Manchester M20 4QL, UK.', 'Manchester Cancer Research Centre, University of Manchester, Wilmslow Road, Manchester M20 4QL, UK.', 'Manchester Cancer Research Centre, University of Manchester, Wilmslow Road, Manchester M20 4QL, UK.', 'Manchester Cancer Research Centre, University of Manchester, Wilmslow Road, Manchester M20 4QL, UK.', 'Manchester Cancer Research Centre, University of Manchester, Wilmslow Road, Manchester M20 4QL, UK.', 'Manchester Cancer Research Centre, University of Manchester, Wilmslow Road, Manchester M20 4QL, UK stephen.taylor@manchester.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Open Biol,Open biology,101580419,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin Modulators/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*WEHI-539', '*apoptosis', '*paclitaxel', '*spindle checkpoint', '*taxol']",2016/08/12 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/08/12 06:00'],"['2016/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['rsob.160134 [pii]', '10.1098/rsob.160134 [doi]']",ppublish,Open Biol. 2016 Aug;6(8). pii: rsob.160134. doi: 10.1098/rsob.160134.,10.1098/rsob.160134 [doi] 160134 [pii],['(c) 2016 The Authors.'],['ORCID: 0000-0003-4621-9326'],,,PMC5008013,,"['11913/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'MR/L006839/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting c-KIT, such as imatinib, has been used successfully to treat c-KIT driven gastrointestinal stromal tumors. However, the effect of TKI on c-KIT-driven leukemia, including CBF-AML and systemic mastocytosis (SM), has not been satisfactory. BPR1J373 is a 5-phenylthiazol-2-ylamine-pyriminide derivative targeting multiple tyrosine kinases. It was shown to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in AML cells with constitutively activated c-KIT via inhibiting c-KIT phosphorylation and its downstream signals. The compound induced apoptosis by the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway through upregulation of proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak and caspase 8 and 9 activation in c-KIT mutant Kasumi-1 cells. Furthermore, it induced cell-cycle arrest via targeting aurora kinase B in c-KIT wild-type KG-1 cells. The antitumor response of BPR1J373 was also shown in subcutaneously grafted SCID mice. BPR1J373 was shown to effectively suppress c-KIT phosphorylation of D816V mutation by treating c-KIT-null COS-1 cells transfected with c-KIT D816V mutant plasmid. In conclusion, BPR1J373 inhibits cell proliferation of c-KIT-driven AML cells via induction of apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. It is also effective for multiple drug-resistant c-KIT D816V mutation.

Viral integration sites that contribute to oncogenesis are selected in tumor cells. Deep-sequencing analysis of B-cell lymphoma DNA confirmed that the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene promoter is a common ALV integration target. Twenty-six unique proviral integration sites were mapped between 46 and 3,552 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the TERT transcription start site, predominantly in the opposite transcriptional orientation to TERT Transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of normal bursa revealed a transcribed region upstream of TERT in the opposite orientation, suggesting the TERT promoter is bidirectional. This transcript appears to be an uncharacterized antisense RNA. We have previously shown that TERT expression is upregulated in tumors with integrations in the TERT promoter region. We now report that the viral promoter drives the expression of a chimeric transcript containing viral sequences spliced to exons 4 through 7 of this antisense RNA. Clonal expansion of cells with ALV integrations driving overexpression of the TERT antisense RNA suggest it may have a role in tumorigenesis. IMPORTANCE: The data suggest that ALV integrations in the TERT promoter region drive the overexpression of a novel antisense RNA and contribute to the development of lymphomas.","['Nehyba, Jiri', 'Malhotra, Sanandan', 'Winans, Shelby', ""O'Hare, Thomas H"", 'Justice, James 4th', 'Beemon, Karen']","['Nehyba J', 'Malhotra S', 'Winans S', ""O'Hare TH"", 'Justice J 4th', 'Beemon K']","['Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA BIOO Scientific, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA Quantabio, Beverly, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA klb@jhu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160929,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Antisense)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*genetics/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chickens', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/*virology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Antisense/*genetics', 'Telomerase/*genetics', 'Transcription Initiation Site/physiology', 'Transcriptome/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Virus Integration/genetics']",,,2016/08/12 06:00,2017/05/10 06:00,['2016/08/12 06:00'],"['2016/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01127-16 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01127-16 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2016 Sep 29;90(20):9509-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01127-16.

We later measured the expression profile of IL-6, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and their signalling molecules, in respect to the type and number of infections, by immunohistochemistry, ELISA and quantitative RT-PCR. The frequencies of CT, and MG mono- and co-infections were significantly higher in EP. IL-6, LIF, their receptors and intracellular mediators were significantly up-regulated at the gene and protein levels in positive compared with negative FTs within each group (P < 0.05). EP tubal samples with co-infections showed the highest significant expression of the candidate cytokines by all techniques (P < 0.05). CT and MG are frequent in EP and up-regulate the tubal expression of IL-6, LIF and their signalling molecules. Both cytokines could be involved in the tubal immune response against bacterial infections, as well as the pathogenesis of EP. Further studies are needed to explore the roles of IL-6 family in infection-induced tubal inflammation and EP.","['Refaat, Bassem', 'Ashshi, Ahmed Mohamed', 'Batwa, Sarah Abdullah', 'Ahmad, Jawwad', 'Idris, Shakir', 'Kutbi, Seham Yahia', 'Malibary, Faizah Ahmed', 'Kamfar, Fadi Fayez']","['Refaat B', 'Ashshi AM', 'Batwa SA', 'Ahmad J', 'Idris S', 'Kutbi SY', 'Malibary FA', 'Kamfar FF']","['Laboratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Umm Al-Qura University, Al Abdeyah, Makkah, KSA bassem.refaat@yahoo.co.uk.', 'Laboratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Umm Al-Qura University, Al Abdeyah, Makkah, KSA.', 'Obstertics and Gynaecology Department, Maternity and Children Hospital, Al-Aziziyah, Ministry of Health, Jeddah, KSA.', 'Laboratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Umm Al-Qura University, Al Abdeyah, Makkah, KSA.', 'Laboratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Umm Al-Qura University, Al Abdeyah, Makkah, KSA.', 'Obstertics and Gynaecology Department, Maternity and Children Hospital, Al-Aziziyah, Ministry of Health, Jeddah, KSA.', 'Obstertics and Gynaecology Department, Maternity and Children Hospital, Al-Aziziyah, Ministry of Health, Jeddah, KSA.', 'Pathology Department, Clinical Laboratories, Maternity and Children Hospital, Ministry of Health, Makkah, KSA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160810,United States,Innate Immun,Innate immunity,101469670,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chlamydia Infections/*epidemiology/immunology', '*Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Fallopian Tubes/*immunology/microbiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mycoplasma Infections/*epidemiology/immunology', '*Mycoplasma genitalium', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Ectopic/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Saudi Arabia/epidemiology', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Ectopic pregnancy', '*Fallopian tube', '*interleukin-6', '*leukaemia inhibitory factor', '*upper genital tract infection']",2016/08/12 06:00,2017/06/27 06:00,['2016/08/12 06:00'],"['2016/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1753425916662326 [pii]', '10.1177/1753425916662326 [doi]']",ppublish,Innate Immun. 2016 Oct;22(7):534-45. doi: 10.1177/1753425916662326.

PROCEDURE: We evaluated miR-155 expression in 198 children with normal karyotype AML (NK-AML) enrolled in Children's Oncology Group (COG) AML trial AAML0531 and correlated miR-155 expression levels with disease characteristics and clinical outcome. Patients were divided into quartiles (Q1-Q4) based on miR-155 expression level, and disease characteristics were then evaluated and correlated with miR-155 expression. RESULTS: MiR-155 expression varied over 4-log10-fold range relative to its expression in normal marrow with a median expression level of 0.825 (range 0.043-25.630) for the entire study cohort. Increasing miR-155 expression was highly associated with the presence of FLT3/ITD mutations (P < 0.001) and high-risk disease (P < 0.001) and inversely associated with standard-risk (P = 0.008) and low-risk disease (P = 0.041). Patients with highest miR-155 expression had a complete remission (CR) rate of 46% compared with 82% in low expressers (P < 0.001) with a correspondingly lower event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). In a multivariate model that included molecular risk factors, high miR-155 expression remained a significant independent predictor of OS (P = 0.022) and EFS (0.019). CONCLUSIONS: High miR-155 expression is an adverse prognostic factor in pediatric NK-AML patients. Specifically, high miR-155 expression not only correlates with FLT3/ITD mutation status and high-risk disease but it is also an independent predictor of worse EFS and OS.","['Ramamurthy, Ranjani', 'Hughes, Maya', 'Morris, Valerie', 'Bolouri, Hamid', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Wang, Yi-Cheng', 'Loken, Michael R', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Hirsch, Betsy A', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Oehler, Vivian G', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Meshinchi, Soheil']","['Ramamurthy R', 'Hughes M', 'Morris V', 'Bolouri H', 'Gerbing RB', 'Wang YC', 'Loken MR', 'Raimondi SC', 'Hirsch BA', 'Gamis AS', 'Oehler VG', 'Alonzo TA', 'Meshinchi S']","['University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', ""Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington."", 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California."", 'Hematologics, Inc, Seattle, Washington.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California."", 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical Center-Fairview, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California."", ""Children's Mercy Hospitals & Clinics, Kansas City, Missiouri."", 'University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Keck School of Medical Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington. smeshinc@fhcrc.org.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington. smeshinc@fhcrc.org.', ""Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington. smeshinc@fhcrc.org."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California. smeshinc@fhcrc.org.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160811,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*analysis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*children', '*miR-155']",2016/10/21 06:00,2017/06/15 06:00,['2016/08/12 06:00'],"['2016/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26157 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Dec;63(12):2096-2103. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26157.

We have evaluated a recently identified set of RNR inhibitors with respect to inhibition of the human enzyme and cellular toxicity. One compound, NSC73735, is particularly interesting; it is specific for leukemia cells and is the first identified compound that hinders oligomerization of the mammalian large RNR subunit. Similar to hydroxyurea, it caused a disruption of the cell cycle distribution of cultured HL-60 cells. In contrast to hydroxyurea, the disruption was reversible, indicating higher specificity. NSC73735 thus defines a potential lead candidate for RNR-targeted anticancer drugs, as well as a chemical probe with better selectivity for RNR inhibition than hydroxyurea.","['Crona, Mikael', 'Codo, Paula', 'Jonna, Venkateswara Rao', 'Hofer, Anders', 'Fernandes, Aristi P', 'Tholander, Fredrik']","['Crona M', 'Codo P', 'Jonna VR', 'Hofer A', 'Fernandes AP', 'Tholander F']","['Department of Medicinal Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, 171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicinal Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, 171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Umea University, 90187, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Umea University, 90187, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicinal Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, 171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicinal Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, 171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.

The treatment-independent mechanisms that mediate leukemia-associated T cell impairments are poorly understood, but metabolism tightly regulates T cell function and may contribute. In this study, we show that B cell leukemia causes T cells to become activated and hyporesponsive with increased PD-1 and TIM3 expression similar to exhausted T cells and that T cells from leukemic hosts become metabolically impaired. Metabolic defects included reduced Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, decreased expression of the glucose transporter Glut1 and hexokinase 2, and reduced glucose uptake. These metabolic changes correlated with increased regulatory T cell frequency and expression of PD-L1 and Gal-9 on both leukemic and stromal cells in the leukemic microenvironment. PD-1, however, was not sufficient to drive T cell impairment, as in vivo and in vitro anti-PD-1 blockade on its own only modestly improved T cell function. Importantly, impaired T cell metabolism directly contributed to dysfunction, as a rescue of T cell metabolism by genetically increasing Akt/mTORC1 signaling or expression of Glut1 partially restored T cell function. Enforced Akt/mTORC1 signaling also decreased expression of inhibitory receptors TIM3 and PD-1, as well as partially improved antileukemia immunity. Similar findings were obtained in T cells from patients with acute or chronic B cell leukemia, which were also metabolically exhausted and had defective Akt/mTORC1 signaling, reduced expression of Glut1 and hexokinase 2, and decreased glucose metabolism. Thus, B cell leukemia-induced inhibition of T cell Akt/mTORC1 signaling and glucose metabolism drives T cell dysfunction.","['Siska, Peter J', 'van der Windt, Gerritje J W', 'Kishton, Rigel J', 'Cohen, Sivan', 'Eisner, William', 'MacIver, Nancie J', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Weinberg, J Brice', 'Rathmell, Jeffrey C']","['Siska PJ', 'van der Windt GJ', 'Kishton RJ', 'Cohen S', 'Eisner W', 'MacIver NJ', 'Kater AP', 'Weinberg JB', 'Rathmell JC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710; Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt Center for Immunobiology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232; Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt Center for Immunobiology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232;', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands;', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710;', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710;', 'Department of Pediatrics, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710;', 'Department of Pediatrics, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710;', 'Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, 1100 DD Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands;', 'Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708; and Department of Medicine, Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Durham, NC 27705.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710; Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt Center for Immunobiology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232; Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt Center for Immunobiology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232; jeff.rathmell@vanderbilt.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160810,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glucose/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mice', 'Multiprotein Complexes/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",,,2016/08/12 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/08/12 06:00'],"['2015/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1502464 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1502464 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2016 Sep 15;197(6):2532-40. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1502464.

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the levels of magnesium (Mg) and cadmium (Cd) in serum and blood samples of smokers and nonsmokers who have chronic myeloid (CML) and lymphocytic (CLL) leukemia, age ranged 31-50 years. For comparative study, age-matched smokers and nonsmoker males were chosen as controls/referents. The levels of elements in patient were analyzed before any treatment by atomic absorption spectrophotometer, after microwave assisted acid digestion. The validation of the method was done by using certified reference materials of serum and blood samples. The resulted data indicated that the adult male smokers and nonsmokers have two- to fourfold higher levels of Cd in the blood and sera samples as compared to the referents (p < 0.01), whereas two- to threefold lower levels of Mg was found in blood and serum samples of both types of leukemia patients as related to referent values. The resulted data indicates significant negative correlation among Mg and Cd in leukemia patients and smoker referents. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of these elements in pathogenesis of chronic leukemia.","['Khan, Noman', 'Afridi, Hasan Imran', 'Kazi, Tasneem Gul', 'Arain, Muhammad Balal', 'Bilal, Muhammad', 'Akhtar, Asma', 'Khan, Mustafa']","['Khan N', 'Afridi HI', 'Kazi TG', 'Arain MB', 'Bilal M', 'Akhtar A', 'Khan M']","['National Centre of Excellence in Analytical Chemistry, University of Sindh, Jamshoro, 76080, Pakistan.', 'National Centre of Excellence in Analytical Chemistry, University of Sindh, Jamshoro, 76080, Pakistan. hassanimranafridi@yahoo.com.', 'National Centre of Excellence in Analytical Chemistry, University of Sindh, Jamshoro, 76080, Pakistan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan 23200, Mardan, PK, 23200, Pakistan.', 'National Centre of Excellence in Analytical Chemistry, University of Sindh, Jamshoro, 76080, Pakistan.', 'National Centre of Excellence in Analytical Chemistry, University of Sindh, Jamshoro, 76080, Pakistan.', 'National Centre of Excellence in Analytical Chemistry, University of Sindh, Jamshoro, 76080, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160811,United States,Biol Trace Elem Res,Biological trace element research,7911509,"['00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cadmium/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Magnesium/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*blood', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic']",['NOTNLM'],"['Atomic absorption spectrophotometer', 'Biological samples', 'Cadmium', 'Chronic myeloid and lymphocytic leukemia', 'Magnesium', 'Smoker']",2016/08/12 06:00,2017/02/28 06:00,['2016/08/12 06:00'],"['2016/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12011-016-0816-y [doi]', '10.1007/s12011-016-0816-y [pii]']",ppublish,Biol Trace Elem Res. 2017 Mar;176(1):81-88. doi: 10.1007/s12011-016-0816-y.

The majority being acute myeloid leukemia (AML), neonatal leukemia can present with a variety of symptoms including hyperleucocytosis, cytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and skin infiltrates. Chromosomal rearrangements including mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) translocations are common in neonatal AML. CASE PRESENTATION: A female neonate born at 34 weeks gestation presented with cardiorespiratory failure, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and coagulopathy. She required intensive care treatment including mechanical ventilation, high-dose catecholamine therapy, and multiple transfusions. Small intestinal biopsy obtained during laparotomy for meconium ileus revealed an infiltrate by an undifferentiated monoblastic, MLL-rearranged leukemia. No other manifestations of leukemia could be detected. After spontaneous clinical remission, lasting 5 months without any specific treatment, the patient presented with leukemia cutis and full-blown monoblastic leukemia. MLL-AF10-rearranged AML could be re-diagnosed and successfully treated with chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient exhibited a unique manifestation of neonatal MLL-AF10 rearranged AML with cardiorespiratory failure and intestinal infiltration. It highlights the importance of leukemia in the differential diagnosis of neonatal distress, congenital hematological abnormalities, and skin lesions.","['Gyarfas, Tobias', 'Wintgens, Juergen', 'Biskup, Wolfgang', 'Oschlies, Ilske', 'Klapper, Wolfram', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Bens, Susanne', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Meisel, Roland', 'Kuhlen, Michaela', 'Borkhardt, Arndt']","['Gyarfas T', 'Wintgens J', 'Biskup W', 'Oschlies I', 'Klapper W', 'Siebert R', 'Bens S', 'Haferlach C', 'Meisel R', 'Kuhlen M', 'Borkhardt A']","['Medical Faculty, Department of General Pediatrics, Neonatology and Pediatric Cardiology, Centre for Child and Adolescent Health, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Neonatology, Staedtische Kliniken Moenchengladbach, Elisabeth Krankenhaus Rheydt, Rheydt, Germany.', 'Department of Neonatology, Staedtische Kliniken Moenchengladbach, Elisabeth Krankenhaus Rheydt, Rheydt, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Moorenstr. 5, 40225, Duesseldorf, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Moorenstr. 5, 40225, Duesseldorf, Germany. michaela.kuhlen@med.uni-duesseldorf.de."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Moorenstr. 5, 40225, Duesseldorf, Germany.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160829,Germany,Mol Cell Pediatr,Molecular and cellular pediatrics,101660689,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cardiorespiratory failure', 'Case report', 'Congenital', 'Meconium ileus', 'Spontaneous remission']",2016/08/12 06:00,2016/08/12 06:01,['2016/08/12 06:00'],"['2016/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40348-016-0061-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s40348-016-0061-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Pediatr. 2016 Dec;3(1):30. doi: 10.1186/s40348-016-0061-7.

RESULTS: We found that the expression of CD71 was most prevalent in AMLs (84%), followed by T-ALL (50%) and least in B-ALL (30%). CONCLUSION: This finding clearly shows the higher expression of CD71 in AMLs compared to other common type of leukemias, such as B- and T-ALL.

These applications include improving our understanding of behavior of cellular systems, identifying rare cell populations and personalized medication. A common critical issue in the existing methods is identification of the number of cellular populations which heavily affects the accuracy of results. Furthermore, anomaly detection is crucial in flow cytometry experiments. In this work, we propose a two-stage clustering technique for cell type identification in single subject flow cytometry data and extend it for anomaly detection among multiple subjects. RESULTS: Our experimentation on 42 flow cytometry datasets indicates high performance and accurate clustering (F-measure > 91 %) in identifying main cellular populations. Furthermore, our anomaly detection technique evaluated on Acute Myeloid Leukemia dataset results in only <2 % false positives.","['Pouyan, Maziyar Baran', 'Jindal, Vasu', 'Birjandtalab, Javad', 'Nourani, Mehrdad']","['Pouyan MB', 'Jindal V', 'Birjandtalab J', 'Nourani M']","['Quality of Life Technology Laboratory, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, USA.', 'Quality of Life Technology Laboratory, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Computer Science, The University of Texas at Dallas, RichardsonTexas, USA.', 'Quality of Life Technology Laboratory, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, USA.', 'Quality of Life Technology Laboratory, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, USA. nourani@utdallas.edu.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20160810,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cells/*classification/cytology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Markov Chains']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Anomaly detection', '*Biaxial gating', '*Cell-type population', '*Flow cytometry', '*Single-cell technology', '*Two-stage clustering']",2016/08/12 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2016/08/12 06:00'],"['2016/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12920-016-0201-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12920-016-0201-x [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2016 Aug 10;9 Suppl 2:41. doi: 10.1186/s12920-016-0201-x.,10.1186/s12920-016-0201-x [doi],,,,,PMC4980779,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The food processing industry produces large amounts of citrus peels that may be an inexpensive source of useful agents. OBJECTIVE: The present work aimed to explore the phytochemical content, antioxidant, anticancer, antiproliferation, and antigenotxic activities of lemon, grapefruit, and mandarin peels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peels were extracted using 98% ethanol and the three crude extracts were assessed for their total polyphenol content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and antioxidant activity using DPPH (1, 1diphenyl2picrylhydrazyl). Their cytotoxic and mitogenic proliferation activities were also studied in human leukemia HL60 cells and mouse splenocytes by CCK8 assay. In addition, genotoxic/ antigenotoxic activity was explored in mouse splenocytes using chromosomal aberrations (CAs) assay. RESULTS: Lemon peels had the highest of TPC followed by grapefruit and mandarin. In contrast, mandarin peels contained the highest of TFC followed by lemon and grapefruit peels. Among the extracts, lemon peel possessed the strongest antioxidant activity as indicated by the highest DPPH radical scavenging, the lowest effective concentration 50% (EC50= 42.97 ?g extract/ mL), and the highest Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC=0.157). Mandarin peel exhibited moderate cytotoxic activity (IC50 = 77.8 ?g/mL) against HL60 cells, whereas grapefruit and lemon peels were ineffective antileukemia. Further, citrus peels possessed immunostimulation activity via augmentation of proliferation of mouse splenocytes (Tlymphocytes). Citrus extracts exerted noncytotoxic, and antigenotoxic activities through remarkable reduction of CAs induced by cisplatin in mouse splenocytes for 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: The phytochemical constituents of the citrus peels may exert biological activities including anticancer, immunostimulation and antigenotoxic potential.","['Diab, Kawthar Ae']",['Diab KA'],"['Genetics and Cytology Department, National Research Centre, Dokki, Cairo, Egypt Email : kawthar_diab@yahoo.com; ka.diab@nrc.sci.eg.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phytochemicals)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Polyphenols)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Citrus/*chemistry', 'Citrus paradisi/*chemistry', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Fruit/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunization/methods', 'Mice', 'Phytochemicals/*pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Polyphenols/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects']",,,2016/08/12 06:00,2017/01/25 06:00,['2016/08/12 06:00'],"['2016/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016;17(7):3559-67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Access to treatment has also improved with the National Health Security system. Since these innovations, survival of childhood LL has not been fully described. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Trends and survival of children under 15 with childhood cancers diagnosed between 1993 and 2012 were investigated using the hospitalbased data from the Khon Kaen Cancer Registry, Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Thailand. Childhood cancers were classified into 12 diagnostic groups, according to the ICCC based on the histology of the cancer. Survival rates were described by period, depending on the treatment protocol. For leukemias and lymphomas, survival was assessed for 3 periods (199399, 20005, 200612) while for solid tumors it was for 2 periods (before and after 2000). The impacts of sex, age, use of the national protocol, and catchment area on leukemia and lymphoma were evaluated. Overall survival was calculated using the KaplanMeier method while the Cox proportional hazard model was used for multivariate analysis. Trends were calculated using the R program. RESULTS: A total of 2,343 childhood cancer cases were included. Survival for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) from 19939, 20005, and 200612 improved significantly (43.7%, 64.6%, and 69.9%). This was to a lesser extent true for acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) (28.1%, 42.0%, and 42.2%). Survival of nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) also improved significantly (44%, 65.5%, and 86.8%) but not for Hodgkin disease (HD) (30.1%, 66.1%, and 70.6%). According to multivariate analysis, significant risk factors associated with poor survival in the ALL group were age under 1 and over 10 years, while not using the national protocol had hazard ratios (HR) of 1.6, 1.3, and 2.3 respectively. In NHL, only nonuse of national protocols was a risk factor (HR 3.9). In ANLL and HD, none of the factors influenced survival. Survival of solid tumors (liver tumors, retinoblastomas) were significantly increased compared to after and before 2000 while survival for CNS tumors, neuroblastoma and bone tumors was not changed. CONCLUSIONS: The survival of childhood cancer in Thailand has markedly improved. Since implementation of national protocols, this is particularly the case for ALL and NHL. These results may be generalizable for the whole country.","['Wongmeerit, Phunnipit', 'Suwanrungruang, Krittika', 'Jetsrisuparb, Arunee', 'Komvilaisak, Patcharee', 'Wiangnon, Surapon']","['Wongmeerit P', 'Suwanrungruang K', 'Jetsrisuparb A', 'Komvilaisak P', 'Wiangnon S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand Email : suraponwiangnon@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Hospitals, University/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Survival Rate', 'Thailand']",,,2016/08/12 06:00,2017/01/27 06:00,['2016/08/12 06:00'],"['2016/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016;17(7):3515-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other categories of cancer care are subsidized under more stringent eligibility criteria. MOPH's large database offers an excellent opportunity to analyze the cost of cancer treatment in Lebanon. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using utilization and spending data accumulated at MOPH during 20082013, the cost to the public budget of cancer drugs was assessed per case and per drug type. RESULTS: The average annual cost of cancer drugs was 6,475$ per patient. Total cancer drug costs were highest for breast cancer, followed by chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and NonHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), which together represented 74% of total MOPH cancer drug expenditure. The annual average cancer drug cost per case was highest for CML ($31,037), followed by NHL ($11,566). Trastuzumab represented 26% and Imatinib 15% of total MOPH cancer drug expenditure over six years. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained increase in cancer drug cost threatens the sustainability of MOPH coverage, so crucial for socially vulnerable citizens. To enhance the bargaining position with pharmaceutical firms for drug cost containment in a small market like Lebanon, drug price comparisons with neighboring countries which have already obtained lower prices may succeed in lowering drug costs.","['Elias, Fadia', 'Khuri, Fadlo R', 'Adib, Salim M', 'Karam, Rita', 'Harb, Hilda', 'Awar, May', 'Zalloua, Pierre', 'Ammar, Walid']","['Elias F', 'Khuri FR', 'Adib SM', 'Karam R', 'Harb H', 'Awar M', 'Zalloua P', 'Ammar W']","['Ministry of Public Health, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Beirut, Lebanon Email : mphealth@cyberia.net.lb.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', '*Cost of Illness', '*Drug Costs', 'Health Expenditures/*statistics & numerical data', '*Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Insurance Coverage/*economics', 'Lebanon', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*economics']",,,2016/08/12 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/08/12 06:00'],"['2016/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016;17(7):3173-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to describe the incidence of toxicity associated with ASNase in Asian adults. Secondary objectives were to investigate the management and impact of toxicity on subsequent ASNase use, and to compare the actual management against current recommendations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, multicenter, observational study, Asian patients >/= 18 years old who received >/= 1 dose of the native E. coli ASNase from 2008 to 2013 were included. Patients were excluded if they did not receive ASNase. Endpoints of this study were development of specific toxicities, whether ASNase was discontinued or rechallenged, and developmentg of recurrent toxicity. All data analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were analyzed. Mean (+/-SD) age was 36.2 (+/-15.2) years old, with 62.5% being males, 55.4% with ALL and 28.6% with NK/Tcell lymphoma. Hypersensitivity (12.5%) was associated with the highest incidence of toxicity (6 out of 7 patients had Grade 3 and 4 toxicity), followed by 10.7% for hepatic transaminitis, 3.6% for nonCNS thrombosis and 1.8% each for hyperbilirubinemia and pancreatitis. Hypersensitivity recurred in the 3 patients who were rechallenged with E. coli ASNase. CONCLUSIONS: ASNase is associated with a wide range of toxicities, with hypersensitivity being the most commonly observed among Asian adult patients.","['Yeang, Shu Hui', 'Chan, Alexandre', 'Tan, Chuen Wen', 'Lim, Soon Thye', 'Ng, Heng Joo']","['Yeang SH', 'Chan A', 'Tan CW', 'Lim ST', 'Ng HJ']","['Clinical Pharmacist, Department of Pharmacy, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore Email : yeang.shu.hui@sgh.com.sg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Escherichia coli/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2016/08/12 06:00,2017/01/26 06:00,['2016/08/12 06:00'],"['2016/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016;17(7):3155-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deregulated BCRABL fusion tyrosine kinase activity is the main cause of CML disease pathogenesis, making BCRABL an ideal target for inhibition. Current tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) designed to inhibit BCRABL oncoprotein activity, have completely transformed the prognosis of CML. Interruption of TKI treatment leads to minimal residual disease reside (MRD), thought to reside in TKIinsensitive leukaemia stem cells which remain a potential reservoir for disease relapse. This highlights the need to develop new therapeutic strategies for CML either as small molecule master TKIs or phytopharmaceuticals derived from nature to achieve chronic molecular remission. This review outlines the past, present and future therapeutic approaches for CML including coverage of relevant mechanisms, whether ABL dependent or independent, and epigenetic factors responsible for developing resistance against TKIs. Appearance of mutant clones along the course of therapy either preexisting or induced due to therapy is still a challenge for the clinician. A proposed invitro model of generating colony forming units from CML stem cells derived from diagnostic samples seems to be achievable in the era of high throughput technology which can take care of single cell genomic profiling.","['Shah, Krupa', 'Parikh, Sonia', 'Rawal, Rakesh']","['Shah K', 'Parikh S', 'Rawal R']","['Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacogenomics, The Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, AHMEDABAD, India Email : rakeshmrawal@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",,,2016/08/12 06:00,2017/01/26 06:00,['2016/08/12 06:00'],"['2016/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016;17(7):3025-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the feedback, we have made marked efforts to provide patients with an improved environment during the explanatory session. This includes installing a special display for the patients, drawing a schematic illustration that shows how the blood cells differentiate, and putting them into operation in a hematology ward to promote patient privacy and precautions against infectious diseases.

Enabling replicative immortalization via telomerase reactivation is a crucial step in cancer development. However, AE expression alone is not sufficient to maintain high telomerase activity to immortalize human HSPC cells, which may hamper transformation. Here, we investigated the cooperativity of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), the catalytic subunit of telomerase, and AE in disease progression. Enforced expression of hTERT immortalized human AE pre-leukemia cells in a telomere-lengthening independent manner, and improved the pre-leukemia stem cell function by enhancing cell proliferation and survival. AE-hTERT cells retained cytokine dependency and multi-lineage differentiation potential similar to parental AE clones. Over the short-term, AE-hTERT cells did not show features of stepwise transformation, with no leukemogenecity evident upon initial injection into immunodeficient mice. Strikingly, after extended culture, we observed full transformation of one AE-hTERT clone, which recapitulated the disease evolution process in patients and emphasizes the importance of acquiring cooperating mutations in t(8;21) AML leukemogenesis. In summary, achieving unlimited proliferative potential via hTERT activation, and thereby allowing for acquisition of additional mutations, is a critical link for transition from pre-leukemia to overt disease in human cells. AE-hTERT cells represent a tractable model to study cooperating genetic lesions important for t(8;21) AML disease progression.","['Lin, Shan', 'Wei, Junping', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Chou, Fu-Sheng', 'Mulloy, James C']","['Lin S', 'Wei J', 'Wunderlich M', 'Chou FS', 'Mulloy JC']","[""Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Preleukemia/genetics/pathology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['hTERT', 'immortalization', 't(8;21) fusion genes,']",2016/08/11 06:00,2018/01/18 06:00,['2016/08/11 06:00'],"['2016/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['11093 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11093 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 30;7(35):55939-55950. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11093.,10.18632/oncotarget.11093 [doi],,,,,PMC5302887,['The authors declared no conflict of interest.'],"['M01 RR008084/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK090971/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA168369/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR026314/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, no head-to-head comparison of dasatinib and nilotinib has been conducted in patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP. METHODS: The authors conducted a propensity score (PS) matched comparison of patients with CML-CP who received frontline therapy with either dasatinib (N = 102) or nilotinib (N = 104) under the respective phase 2 trials conducted in parallel. RESULTS: PS matching resulted in 87 patients from each trial being matched for pretreatment characteristics. The 3-month BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratio <10% rate was 93% with dasatinib and 94% with nilotinib (P = .25); the rates of major molecular response at 12 months were 77% and 85%, respectively (P = .13); and the rates of molecular response with 4.5-log reduction in the ratio at 36 months were 66% and 64%, respectively (P = .96). All other clinically relevant responses were similar between the 2 treatment cohorts. The 3-year probability of event-free survival was 89% among the patients who received dasatinib and 87% among those who received nilotinib (P = .99), and the corresponding 3-year overall survival probabilities were 99% and 93%, respectively (P = .95). No statistical difference was observed between the dasatinib and nilotinib groups in any of the other survival endpoints. The treatment discontinuation rate also was similar between the 2 cohorts (dasatinib group, 18%; nilotinib group, 19%; P = .82).

METHODS: This study evaluated 389 adolescent and adult patients with previously untreated Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL who received frontline induction chemotherapy and for whom a D14 BM assessment was performed. RESULTS: A D14 BM blast proportion < 10% (including blast-free aplastic BM) was observed in 319 patients (82%), 10% to 29% was observed in 31 patients (8%), and >/=30% was observed in 39 patients (10%). The composite complete remission (CR)/complete remission with inadequate platelet recovery (CRp) rates for these groups were 99.7%, 87%, and 79%, respectively. The median event-free survival (EFS) was 49, 33, and 9 months, respectively (P < .001). The median overall survival (OS) was 88, 37, and 21 months, respectively (P < .001). The D14 BM blast group was the only factor predictive for the achievement of CR/CRp (P < .001). According to a multivariate analysis, the D14 BM blast group was independently prognostic for both EFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.85; P = .004) and OS (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.14-1.85; P = .003). However, when minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment at the time of CR was added to the model, the D14 BM blast group was no longer prognostic for EFS or OS. CONCLUSIONS: An assessment of residual D14 BM blasts in patients with ALL is highly predictive of the achievement of CR with induction chemotherapy and of EFS and OS.

Chidamide, a novel HDAC inhibitor of the benzamide class, is currently under clinical trials. In this study, we aimed to investigate the antitumor activity of Chidamide on myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and explore the possible mechanism. Chidamide exhibited efficient anti-proliferative activity on MDS and AML cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, accompanied by cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and cell apoptosis. Importantly, Chidamide possessed potent HDAC inhibition property, as evaluated by HDAC activity analysis and acetylation of histone H3 and H4. Moreover, Chidamide significantly increased the expression of Suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), reduced the expression of Janus activated kinases 2 (JAK2) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and inhibited STAT3 downstream genes, including c-Myc, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, which are involved in cell cycle progression and anti-apoptosis. Therefore, we demonstrate that Chidamide exhibits potent inhibitory effect on cell viability of MDS and AML cells, and the possible mechanism may lie in the downregulation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling through SOCS3 upregulation. Our data provide rationale for clinical investigations of Chidamide in MDS and AML.","['Zhao, Sida', 'Guo, Juan', 'Zhao, Youshan', 'Fei, Chengming', 'Zheng, Qingqing', 'Li, Xiao', 'Chang, Chunkang']","['Zhao S', 'Guo J', 'Zhao Y', 'Fei C', 'Zheng Q', 'Li X', 'Chang C']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160715,United States,Am J Transl Res,American journal of translational research,101493030,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chidamide', 'STAT3', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'histone deacetylase inhibitor', 'myelodysplastic syndromes']",2016/08/11 06:00,2016/08/11 06:01,['2016/08/11 06:00'],"['2016/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/11 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Transl Res. 2016 Jul 15;8(7):3169-78. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,PMC4969454,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the cancer treatment, anthracyclines also can be combined with other chemotherapies and molecular-targeted drugs. The combination of anthracyclines with other therapies is usually the first-line treatment. Anthracyclines are effective and potent agents with a broad antitumor spectrum, but may cause adverse reactions, including hair loss, myelotoxicity, as well as cardiotoxicity. We used hematopoietic stimulating factors to control the myelotoxicity, such as G-CSF, EPO and TPO. However, the cardiotoxicity is the most serious side effect of anthracyclines. Clinical research and practical observations indicated that the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines is commonly progressive and irreversible. Especially to those patients who have the first time use of anthracyclines, the damage is common. Therefore, early detection and prevention of anthracyclines induced cardiotoxicity are particularly important and has already aroused more attention in clinic. By literature review, we reviewed the research progress of cardioprotective agents for prevention of anthracycline cardiotoxicity.","['Zhang, Jing', 'Cui, Xiaohai', 'Yan, Yan', 'Li, Min', 'Yang, Ya', 'Wang, Jiansheng', 'Zhang, Jia']","['Zhang J', 'Cui X', 'Yan Y', 'Li M', 'Yang Y', 'Wang J', 'Zhang J']","[""Second Department of Thoracic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University 277# West Yanta Road, Xi'an 710061, shaanxi, China."", ""Second Department of Thoracic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University 277# West Yanta Road, Xi'an 710061, shaanxi, China."", ""Second Department of Thoracic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University 277# West Yanta Road, Xi'an 710061, shaanxi, China."", ""Second Department of Thoracic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University 277# West Yanta Road, Xi'an 710061, shaanxi, China."", ""Second Department of Thoracic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University 277# West Yanta Road, Xi'an 710061, shaanxi, China."", ""Second Department of Thoracic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University 277# West Yanta Road, Xi'an 710061, shaanxi, China."", ""Second Department of Thoracic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University 277# West Yanta Road, Xi'an 710061, shaanxi, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160715,United States,Am J Transl Res,American journal of translational research,101493030,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anthracycline', 'cardioprotective agents', 'cardiotoxicity', 'prevention']",2016/08/11 06:00,2016/08/11 06:01,['2016/08/11 06:00'],"['2016/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/11 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Transl Res. 2016 Jul 15;8(7):2862-75. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,PMC4969424,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, origin of this abnormal clone and its clinical significance remains unknown. RESULTS: We present 12 cases with SCL who underwent alloHSCT; 9 patients (4 men and 5 women with a median age of 56 years) developed isolated SCL after alloHSCT (Group I), and 3 patients (all women with a median age of 58 years) had a SCL before undergoing alloHSCT after which SCL disappeared (Group II). The primary neoplasms included chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 5), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 5), chronic myelogenous leukemia with nodal marginal zone lymphoma (n = 1) and Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 1). According to the donor/recipient relationship, their alloHSCT can be divided into sex-matched, HLA-matched, unrelated donors (n = 2); sex-mismatched, HLA-matched, unrelated donors (n = 4); sex-mismatched, HLA-matched, related donors (2 HLA-identical and 2 HLA-haploidentical cases) and sex-matched, HLA-matched, related donors (2 HLA-haploidentical cases). In Group I, isolated SCL was first detected with a median interval of 3 months (range 1 to 42 months) after the alloHSCT. By the end of clinical follow-up in patients in Group I, 7 patients expired with a median overall survival of 45 months (range 3 to 108 months) after alloHSCT and 33 months (range 0 to 66 months) after SCL detection. In Group II, 1 patient expired with a survival time of 54 months after the alloHSCT. Detection of SCL after alloHSCT can be transient, intermittent or persistent. CONCLUSIONS: Interpretation of SCL is challenging in the context of alloHSCT. Chimerism testing is useful in determining the origin of SCL. In the case of SCL with donor/recipient chimerism, deduction of the SCL origin by all means and use of ""-?X"" or ""-?Y"" in the ISCN nomenclature are recommended. Clinical follow-up with closely monitoring the SCL by both cytogenetic and molecular analyses is needed.","['Tang, Zhenya', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Wang, Wei', 'Lu, Xinyan', 'Young, Ken H', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Tang, Guilin']","['Tang Z', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Yin CC', 'Wang W', 'Lu X', 'Young KH', 'Khoury JD', 'Tang G']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030-4009 USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030-4009 USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030-4009 USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030-4009 USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030-4009 USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030-4009 USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030-4009 USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030-4009 USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160808,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT)', 'Chimerism testing', 'Cytogenetic (CG) analyses', 'Sex chromosome loss (SCL)', '-X', '-Y']",2016/08/11 06:00,2016/08/11 06:01,['2016/08/11 06:00'],"['2016/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13039-016-0275-3 [doi]', '275 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2016 Aug 8;9:62. doi: 10.1186/s13039-016-0275-3. eCollection 2016.,10.1186/s13039-016-0275-3 [doi],,,,,PMC4977628,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A better understanding of the biology of ESCC recurrence is needed to improve patient care. Our goal was to identify small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) that could predict the likelihood of recurrence after surgical resection and to uncover potential molecular mechanisms that dictate clinical heterogeneity. DESIGN: We developed a robust prediction model for recurrence based on the analysis of the expression profile data of sncRNAs from 108 fresh frozen ESCC specimens as a discovery set and assessment of the associations between sncRNAs and recurrence-free survival (RFS). We also evaluated the mechanistic and therapeutic implications of sncRNA obtained through integrated analysis from multiple datasets. RESULTS: We developed a risk assessment score (RAS) for recurrence with three sncRNAs (microRNA (miR)-223, miR-1269a and nc886) whose expression was significantly associated with RFS in the discovery cohort (n=108). RAS was validated in an independent cohort of 512 patients. In multivariable analysis, RAS was an independent predictor of recurrence (HR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.26 to 4.09; p=0.007). This signature implies the expression of DeltaNp63 and multiple alterations of driver genes like PIK3CA. We suggested therapeutic potentials of immune checkpoint inhibitors in low-risk patients, and Polo-like kinase inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, and histone deacetylase inhibitors in high-risk patients. CONCLUSION: We developed an easy-to-use prognostic model with three sncRNAs as robust prognostic markers for postoperative recurrence of ESCC. We anticipate that such a stratified and systematic, tumour-specific biological approach will potentially contribute to significant improvement in ESCC treatment.","['Jang, Hee-Jin', 'Lee, Hyun-Sung', 'Burt, Bryan M', 'Lee, Geon Kook', 'Yoon, Kyong-Ah', 'Park, Yun-Yong', 'Sohn, Bo Hwa', 'Kim, Sang Bae', 'Kim, Moon Soo', 'Lee, Jong Mog', 'Joo, Jungnam', 'Kim, Sang Cheol', 'Yun, Ju Sik', 'Na, Kook Joo', 'Choi, Yoon-La', 'Park, Jong-Lyul', 'Kim, Seon-Young', 'Lee, Yong Sun', 'Han, Leng', 'Liang, Han', 'Mak, Duncan', 'Burks, Jared K', 'Zo, Jae Ill', 'Sugarbaker, David J', 'Shim, Young Mog', 'Lee, Ju-Seog']","['Jang HJ', 'Lee HS', 'Burt BM', 'Lee GK', 'Yoon KA', 'Park YY', 'Sohn BH', 'Kim SB', 'Kim MS', 'Lee JM', 'Joo J', 'Kim SC', 'Yun JS', 'Na KJ', 'Choi YL', 'Park JL', 'Kim SY', 'Lee YS', 'Han L', 'Liang H', 'Mak D', 'Burks JK', 'Zo JI', 'Sugarbaker DJ', 'Shim YM', 'Lee JS']","['Center for Lung Cancer, Research Institute and Hospital, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Gyeonggi, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, The Graduate School of Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Center for Lung Cancer, Research Institute and Hospital, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Gyeonggi, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Division of Thoracic Surgery, Michael E.

Identification of risk factors and druggable molecular targets in ALL can lead to a better stratification of treatments and subsequent improvement in prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 59 children with relapsed or primary refractory ALL who were treated in our institutions. We primarily performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using patients' leukemic cells to comprehensively detect gene fusions and analyze gene expression profiles. On the basis of results obtained by RNA-seq, we performed genetic validation, functional analysis, and in vitro drug sensitivity testing using patients' samples and an exogenous expression model. RESULTS: We identified a total of 26 gene fusions in 22 patients by RNA-seq. Among these, 19 were nonrandom gene fusions already described in ALL, and four of the remaining seven involved identical combination of MEF2D and BCL9. All MEF2D-BCL9-positive patients had B-cell precursor immunophenotype and were characterized as being older in age, being resistant to chemotherapy, having very early relapse, and having leukemic blasts that mimic morphologically mature B-cell leukemia with markedly high expression of HDAC9. Exogenous expression of MEF2D-BCL9 in a B-cell precursor ALL cell line promoted cell growth, increased HDAC9 expression, and induced resistance to dexamethasone. Using a primary culture of leukemic blasts from a patient, we identified several molecular targeted drugs that conferred inhibitory effects in vitro. CONCLUSION: A novel MEF2D-BCL9 fusion we identified characterizes a novel subset of pediatric ALL, predicts poor prognosis, and may be a candidate for novel molecular targeting.","['Suzuki, Kyogo', 'Okuno, Yusuke', 'Kawashima, Nozomu', 'Muramatsu, Hideki', 'Okuno, Tatsuya', 'Wang, Xinan', 'Kataoka, Shinsuke', 'Sekiya, Yuko', 'Hamada, Motoharu', 'Murakami, Norihiro', 'Kojima, Daiei', 'Narita, Kotaro', 'Narita, Atsushi', 'Sakaguchi, Hirotoshi', 'Sakaguchi, Kimiyoshi', 'Yoshida, Nao', 'Nishio, Nobuhiro', 'Hama, Asahito', 'Takahashi, Yoshiyuki', 'Kudo, Kazuko', 'Kato, Koji', 'Kojima, Seiji']","['Suzuki K', 'Okuno Y', 'Kawashima N', 'Muramatsu H', 'Okuno T', 'Wang X', 'Kataoka S', 'Sekiya Y', 'Hamada M', 'Murakami N', 'Kojima D', 'Narita K', 'Narita A', 'Sakaguchi H', 'Sakaguchi K', 'Yoshida N', 'Nishio N', 'Hama A', 'Takahashi Y', 'Kudo K', 'Kato K', 'Kojima S']","[""Kyogo Suzuki, Yusuke Okuno, Nozomu Kawashima, Hideki Muramatsu, Tatsuya Okuno, Xinan Wang, Shinsuke Kataoka, Yuko Sekiya, Motoharu Hamada, Norihiro Murakami, Daiei Kojima, Atsushi Narita, Nobuhiro Nishio, Asahito Hama, Yoshiyuki Takahashi, and Seiji Kojima, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine;

Mogamulizumab (anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody; Mog) was recently approved as a treatment for ATLL in Japan. Major concerns exist about the possible adverse effects of pretransplantation Mog because Mog depletes regulatory T cells for several months. We assessed the impact of pretransplantation Mog on clinical outcomes after allo-HSCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 996 allo-HSCT recipients age 70 years or younger with aggressive ATLL who were given the diagnosis between 2000 and 2013 and who received intensive chemotherapy by multiple chemotherapeutic drugs as first-line therapy. Before allo-HSCT, 82 patients received Mog with a median interval of 45 days from the last Mog to allo-HSCT. RESULTS: Pretransplantation Mog was associated with an increased risk of grade 3 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; relative risk, 1.80; P < .01) and refractoriness to systemic corticosteroid for acute GVHD (relative risk, 2.09; P < .01). One-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was significantly higher in patients with pretransplantation Mog compared with those without (43.7% v 25.1%; P < .01). The probability of 1-year overall survival was also significantly inferior in patients with pretransplantation Mog compared with those without (32.3% v 49.4%; P < .01). In particular, use of Mog with intervals < 50 days to allo-HSCT was associated with a dismal clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Pretransplantation Mog was significantly associated with an increased risk of GVHD-related mortality, which supports the relevance of CCR4-expressing Tregs after allo-HSCT in humans. In clinical practice, Mog should be cautiously used for patients with ATLL who are eligible for allo-HSCT.","['Fuji, Shigeo', 'Inoue, Yoshitaka', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Moriuchi, Yukiyoshi', 'Uchimaru, Kaoru', 'Choi, Ilseung', 'Otsuka, Eiichi', 'Henzan, Hideho', 'Kato, Koji', 'Tomoyose, Takeaki', 'Yamamoto, Hisashi', 'Kurosawa, Saiko', 'Matsuoka, Ken-Ichi', 'Yamaguchi, Takuhiro', 'Fukuda, Takahiro']","['Fuji S', 'Inoue Y', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Uchimaru K', 'Choi I', 'Otsuka E', 'Henzan H', 'Kato K', 'Tomoyose T', 'Yamamoto H', 'Kurosawa S', 'Matsuoka K', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Fukuda T']","['Shigeo Fuji, Yoshitaka Inoue, Saiko Kurosawa, and Takahiro Fukuda, National Cancer Center Hospital;

Patients and Methods Eighteen patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia were enrolled in the SELHEM (Selinexor With Fludarabine and Cytarabine for Treatment of Refractory or Relapsed Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome) clinical trial (NCT02212561). Selinexor, initially at 30 mg/m(2) per dose, was given orally on days 1, 3, 8, 10, 22, and 24 and was escalated according to a rolling-six design. Fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) and cytarabine 2 g/m(2) were administered on days 15 to 19. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were performed on days 1 and 22. Response evaluations were performed on day 15 and at the completion of course 1. Results Among the 17 patients who were evaluable for toxicity, three were treated at 30 mg/m(2), three at 40 mg/m(2), six at 55 mg/m(2), and five at 70 mg/m(2). The most common grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity was asymptomatic hyponatremia. Two patients who were treated at 70 mg/m(2) experienced reversible cerebellar toxicity, thereby defining the dose-limiting toxicity. Pharmacokinetic parameters demonstrated that plasma exposure was dose proportional. Fifteen of 16 patients demonstrated at least a twofold increase of XPO1 mRNA, indicating inhibition of the XPO1 protein. In this group of heavily pretreated, relapsed, and refractory patients, seven of 15 evaluable patients (47%) achieved complete response or complete response with incomplete count recovery. Conclusion Selinexor, in combination with fludarabine and cytarabine, is tolerable at doses up to 55 mg/m(2) in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia. All patients who received selinexor at >/= 40 mg/m(2) demonstrated XPO1 target inhibition. Response rates are promising and will be further explored in a phase II trial.","['Alexander, Thomas B', 'Lacayo, Norman J', 'Choi, John K', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E']","['Alexander TB', 'Lacayo NJ', 'Choi JK', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Pui CH', 'Rubnitz JE']","[""Thomas B.

A recent study showed that some genetic loci within the MKL1 gene, especially single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6001946, may increase schizophrenia susceptibility. Here, we sought to determine whether the polymorphism rs6001946 was associated with schizophrenia in a Han Chinese population using the ligase detection reaction-polymerase chain reaction method to genotype SNP rs6001946 in the MKL1 gene. We observed that there was a marginally significant association between SNP rs6001946 and the risk of schizophrenia (P=0.077). Our results indicated that SNP rs6001946 of the MKL1 gene is likely a risk factor for schizophrenia, but the role of SNP rs6001946 in the development of schizophrenia in Han Chinese should be interpreted cautiously. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to determine the involvement of the MKL1 polymorphism in schizophrenia susceptibility.","['Wang, Dong', 'Cheng, Zaohuo', 'Zhao, Xingfu', 'Li, Zongchang', 'Wang, Jun', 'Dong, Aiguo', 'Zhou, Zhenhe', 'Zhang, Fuquan']","['Wang D', 'Cheng Z', 'Zhao X', 'Li Z', 'Wang J', 'Dong A', 'Zhou Z', 'Zhang F']","['Wuxi Mental Health Center, Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214151, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Wuxi Mental Health Center, Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214151, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Wuxi Mental Health Center, Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214151, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Institute of Mental Health of the second Xiangya hospital, National Laboratory for Psychiatry Disease Diagnosis and Treatment, Key Laboratory of Psychiatry and Mental Health of Hunan Province, The Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Wuxi Mental Health Center, Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214151, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Wuxi Mental Health Center, Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214151, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Wuxi Mental Health Center, Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214151, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Wuxi Mental Health Center, Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214151, Jiangsu Province, China.

This can be particularly relevant for aggressive tumors such as melanoma in which FASN overexpression has been associated with increased depth of invasion and worse prognosis. We have previously shown that a sub-class of cyclic imides, the N-phenylmaleimides, presented antitumor activity against L1210 leukemia and B16F10 melanoma with evidences of interference in the energetic metabolism. Here, we aimed to investigate if some selected N-phenylmaleimides (M1 and M5) interfere with fatty acids metabolism and its relation with cancer. For that, a model of pre-adipocytes differentiation (3T3-L1 cells) and also human melanoma cells (SK-Mel-147) were used. As results, when 3T3-L1 cells were exposed to non-cytotoxic concentrations of M1 and M5 in the presence of an adipogenic cocktail, intracellular lipid content decreased by 26-36%, marking the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. High selectivity indexes were obtained for both compounds for tumoral cells. Cell cycle phases analysis revealed a remarkable proportion of cells with DNA fragmentation after their exposure to M1 and M5. This was correlated to both apoptosis and necrosis, showed by Annexin-V/PI assay. Furthermore, M1 and M5 reduced FASN expression by 19-39%, respectively. In conclusion, M1 and M5 presented antiadipogenic and antitumoral activities. The antitumoral activity that was associated to apoptosis and necrosis is a possible consequence of the FASN reduction, which in turn, might result in a fuel decrease to cell proliferation.

The clinical scenario is often an emergency situation, while the pathologist is usually confronted only with small biopsy samples. Classical Hodgkin's lymphoma is by far the most frequently occurring lymphoma in the mediastinum and predominantly the nodular sclerosis subtype. In small and very sclerotic specimens it can be difficult to morphologically detect Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells and to identify the characteristic phenotype by immunohistochemistry. Primary mediastinal large Bcell lymphomas should be distinguished from classical Hodgkin's lymphomas as the treatment is different. This is characterized by the detection of sheets of blast cells, which immunohistochemically show a strong Bcell phenotype (positivity for CD20 and CD79a), while CD30 can also often be expressed. The intimate biological relationship between classical Hodgkin's lymphomas and mediastinal large Bcell lymphomas is illustrated by the existence of Bcell lymphomas with intermediate features (so-called mediastinal grey zone lymphomas). It is important to recognize and diagnose these lymphomas as they are associated with a slightly inferior prognosis. Extranodal thymic marginal zone lymphomas of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type are a rare form of lymphoma encountered in the mediastinum, which can be associated with autoimmune diseases. Tlymphoblastic lymphomas and leukemia, which occur predominantly in children and young adults, represent a rapidly growing precursor cell neoplasia and must be distinguished from thymomas in the differential diagnostics as well as from normal and hyperplastic thymus glands.","['Rauthe, S', 'Rosenwald, A']","['Rauthe S', 'Rosenwald A']","['Institut fur Pathologie, Universitat Wurzburg, Josef-Schneider-Str. 2, 97080, Wurzburg, Deutschland.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken (CCC MF), Wurzburg, Deutschland.', 'Institut fur Pathologie, Universitat Wurzburg, Josef-Schneider-Str. 2, 97080, Wurzburg, Deutschland.

We have investigated the role of the FA pathway in oncogenic stress response by employing an in vivo stress-response model expressing the Gadd45beta-luciferase transgene. Using two inducible models of oncogenic activation (LSL-K-rasG12D and MycER), we show that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from mice deficient for the FA core complex components Fanca or Fancc exhibit aberrant short-lived response to oncogenic insults. Mechanistic studies reveal that FA deficiency in HSPCs impairs oncogenic stress-induced G1 cell-cycle checkpoint, resulting from a compromised K-rasG12D-induced arginine methylation of p53 mediated by the protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). Furthermore, forced expression of PRMT5 in HSPCs from LSL-K-rasG12D/CreER-Fanca-/- mice prolongs oncogenic response and delays leukemia development in recipient mice. Our study defines an arginine methylation-dependent FA-p53 interplay that controls oncogenic stress response.","['Du, Wei', 'Amarachintha, Surya', 'Erden, Ozlem', 'Wilson, Andrew', 'Pang, Qishen']","['Du W', 'Amarachintha S', 'Erden O', 'Wilson A', 'Pang Q']","['Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati, 45229 Ohio, USA.', 'Divisions of Radiation Health,College of Pharmacy, UAMS, Little Rock, 72205 Arkansas, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati, 45229 Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati, 45229 Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati, 45229 Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati, 45229 Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, 45229 Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (GADD45B protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (PRMT5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arginine/metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'DNA Damage', 'Fanconi Anemia/*genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['fanconi anemia', 'hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells', 'oncogenic stress', 'protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5)']",2016/08/11 06:00,2018/02/08 06:00,['2016/08/11 06:00'],"['2015/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/08 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['11088 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11088 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 13;7(37):60005-60020. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11088.,10.18632/oncotarget.11088 [doi],,,,,PMC5312365,,"['R01 CA109641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA157537/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL076712/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA117846/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia Stem Cells (LSCs) are the main player for AML relapses and drug resistance. LSCs might rely on the B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site-1 (BMI-1) in promoting cellular proliferation and survival. Growth of LSCs in microenvironments that are deprived of nutrients leads to up-regulation of the signaling pathways during the progression of the disease, which may illustrate the sensitivity of LSCs to inhibitors of those signaling pathways as compared to normal cells. We analyzed the expression of LSC markers (CD34, CLL-1, TIM-3 and BMI-1) using quantitative RT-PCR in bone marrow samples of 40 AML patients of different FAB types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, and M7). We also studied the expression of these markers in 2 AML cell lines (Kasumi-1 and KG-1a) using flow cytometry and quantitative RT-PCR. The overexpression of TIM-3, CLL-1, and BMI-1 was markedly correlated with poor prognosis in these patients. Our in vitro findings demonstrate that targeting BMI-1, which markedly increased in the leukemic cells, was associated with marked decrease in leukemic burden. This study also presents results for blocking LSCs' surface markers CD44, CLL-1, and TIM-3. These markers may play an important role in elimination of AML. Our study indicates a correlation between the expression of markers TIM-3, CLL-1, and especially of BMI-1 and the aggressiveness of AML and thus the potential impact of prognosis and therapies that target LSCs on improving the cure rates.","['Darwish, Noureldien H E', 'Sudha, Thangirala', 'Godugu, Kavitha', 'Elbaz, Osama', 'Abdelghaffar, Hasan A', 'Hassan, Emad E A', 'Mousa, Shaker A']","['Darwish NH', 'Sudha T', 'Godugu K', 'Elbaz O', 'Abdelghaffar HA', 'Hassan EE', 'Mousa SA']","['Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'The Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Rensselaer, NY, USA.', 'The Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Rensselaer, NY, USA.', 'The Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Rensselaer, NY, USA.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'The Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Rensselaer, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (CLEC12A protein, human)', '0 (HAVCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Disease Progression', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/metabolism', 'Lectins, C-Type/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Mitogen/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['PTC-209', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'leukemic stem cells']",2016/08/11 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2016/08/11 06:00'],"['2016/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['11063 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11063 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 6;7(36):57811-57820. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11063.,10.18632/oncotarget.11063 [doi],,,,,PMC5295391,['The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies suggested that baicalein could inhibit the growth of several cancers, while its effect on T-ALL cells remains unclear. We used Jurkat cells as an in vitro model of T-ALL. Cell counting kit-8 assay and cytometric analysis with Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining were used to investigate the proliferation and apoptosis of Jurkat cells treated with increasing concentration of baicalein for indicated time. RT-PCR and western blotting was used to test the expression of Wnt/beta-catenin associated genes and proteins. In cell viability assay, baicalein could inhibit the proliferation of Jurkat cells both in dose- and time-dependent manners. In cell apoptosis assay, baicalein could stimulate apoptosis of Jurkat cells both in dose- and time-dependent manners. Moreover, we demonstrated that baicalein could down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of beta-catenin and its widely accepted downstream targets (c-Myc, cyclin D1, and Axin2) in dose-dependent manners.

We present herein our designated multidisciplinary program for FP in pediatric and adolescent population and present our data on FP in female patients. METHODS: Pediatric patients (age 0-18) who were candidate for highly gonadotoxic treatments were referred to FP program for a multidisciplinary discussion and gonadal risk-assessment followed by either oocyte cryopreservation or ovarian cryopreservation (OCP) for female patients, and sperm banking for male patients. The OCP protocol consists of aspiration of oocytes from small antral follicles and in-vitro maturation followed by cryopreservation, as well as ovarian tissue cryopreservation. RESULTS: The establishment of a designated FP program resulted in a significant increase in referral and subsequent FP procedures of all eligible patients. Sixty-two female patients were referred for FP discussion during a period of 36 months; 41 underwent OCP; 11 underwent oocyte cryopreservation and six were declined due to parental decision. The median age was 13.2y (range 18 months-18y). Thirty-two (51.6 %) were chemotherapy-naive. Seventeen patients (27 %) had sarcoma, 16 patients (26 %) had acute leukemia.

Furthermore, ZNF521 is expressed in human hematopoietic cells, and translocations between ZNF521 and PAX5 are associated with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the regulatory factors that control Zfp521 expression directly have not been characterized. Here we demonstrate that the transcription factors SPI1 (PU.1) and HOXC13 synergistically regulate Zfp521 expression, and identify the regions of the Zfp521 promoter required for this transcriptional activity. We also show that SPI1 and HOXC13 activate Zfp521 in a dose-dependent manner. Our data support a role for this regulatory mechanism in vivo, as transgenic mice over-expressing Hoxc13 in the fetal liver show a strong correlation between Hoxc13 expression levels and Zfp521 expression. Overall these experiments provide insights into the regulation of Zfp521 expression in a nononcogenic context. The identification of transcription factors capable of activating Zfp521 provides a foundation for further investigation of the regulatory mechanisms involved in ZFP521-driven cell differentiation processes and diseases linked to Zfp521 mis-expression.","['Yu, Ming', 'Al-Dallal, Salma', 'Al-Haj, Latifa', 'Panjwani, Shiraj', 'McCartney, Akina S', 'Edwards, Sarah M', 'Manjunath, Pooja', 'Walker, Catherine', 'Awgulewitsch, Alexander', 'Hentges, Kathryn E']","['Yu M', 'Al-Dallal S', 'Al-Haj L', 'Panjwani S', 'McCartney AS', 'Edwards SM', 'Manjunath P', 'Walker C', 'Awgulewitsch A', 'Hentges KE']","['Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK.', ""The Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan Province, 650500, People's Republic of China."", 'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK.', 'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK.', 'Molecular Biomedicine Program, Program in Biomolecular Research, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, 11211, Saudi Arabia.', 'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK.', 'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK.', 'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK.', 'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK.', 'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, 29425.', 'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK. kathryn.hentges@manchester.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160829,United States,Genesis,"Genesis (New York, N.Y. : 2000)",100931242,"['0 (Evi3 protein, mouse)', '0 (HOXC13 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AKXD mice', '*B-cell differentiation', '*B-cell leukemia', '*Evi3', '*ZNF521']",2016/10/21 06:00,2017/05/04 06:00,['2016/08/11 06:00'],"['2016/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/dvg.22963 [doi]'],ppublish,Genesis. 2016 Oct;54(10):519-533. doi: 10.1002/dvg.22963.

In this study, we analyzed the outcome of ETV6/RUNX1 (+) ALL patients treated at our institution with the aim of identifying significant prognostic variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-three patients were diagnosed with ETV6/RUNX1 (+) ALL from 2005 to 2011. Prognostic variables studied included minimal residual disease (MRD) as detected by ETV6/RUNX1 (+) fusion, and the presence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities. RESULTS: The 5-year event-free survival was 84.1+/-4.6%, with 10 patients relapsing at a median of 28.3 months from diagnosis for a 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse of 15.9+/-4.6%. Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence MRD, as detected by real-time quantitative-polymerase chain reaction or fluorescence in situ hybridization for ETV6/RUNX1 fusion at end of remission induction, and the presence of additional structural abnormalities of 12p (translocations or inversions) negatively affected outcome. Despite treatment such as allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, eight of the 10 relapsed patients died from disease progression for overall survival of 82.5+/-6.9%. CONCLUSION: ETV6/RUNX1 (+) ALL may be heterogeneous in terms of prognosis, and variables such as MRD at end ofremission induction or additional structural abnormalities of 12p could define a subset of patients who are likely to have poor outcome.","['Lee, Jae Wook', 'Kim, Seong-Koo', 'Jang, Pil-Sang', 'Chung, Nack-Gyun', 'Jeong, Dae-Chul', 'Kim, Myungshin', 'Cho, Bin', 'Kim, Hack-Ki']","['Lee JW', 'Kim SK', 'Jang PS', 'Chung NG', 'Jeong DC', 'Kim M', 'Cho B', 'Kim HK']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160810,Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence', 'Republic of Korea', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['12p abnormalities', 'Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'ETV6/RUNX1', 'Minimal residual disease']",2016/08/11 06:00,2018/02/08 06:00,['2016/08/11 06:00'],"['2016/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/08 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['crt.2016.211 [pii]', '10.4143/crt.2016.211 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res Treat. 2017 Apr;49(2):446-453. doi: 10.4143/crt.2016.211.

A few studies have reported that nitrofurantoin has cytotoxic activity against cancer cells; however, nitrofurans remain a poorly explored class of compounds with respect to their anticancer potential. The aim of this study was to investigate the anticancer effects of a nitrofurantoin derivative, n-pentyl-nitrofurantoin (NFP), on HL-60 leukemia cells. METHODS: Cytotoxicity was assayed by the MTT assay. Cell morphology and phosphatidylserine externalization were visualized after Giemsa-May-Grunwald and annexin V staining, respectively. DNA content and mitochondrial depolarization were measured by flow cytometry. BAX and BCL-xL expression was examined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: NFP was 3.8-fold more cytotoxic against HL-60 leukemia cells than against normal cells. NFP reduced the number of viable cells 24h after the treatment with a concomitant increase in the number of apoptotic cells indicated by the externalization of phosphatidylserine, DNA fragmentation, and mitochondrial depolarization. The mRNA levels of BAX increased, whereas the mRNA levels of BCL-xL decreased. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that NFP induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells by upregulating BAX and downregulating BCL-xL.","['Andrade, Jeyce K F', 'Souza, Marcia I F', 'Gomes Filho, Manoel A', 'Silva, Diogo M F', 'Barros, Andre L S', 'Rodrigues, Maria D', 'Silva, Paulo B N', 'Nascimento, Silene C', 'Aguiar, Jaciana S', 'Brondani, Dalci J', 'Militao, Gardenia C G', 'Silva, Teresinha G']","['Andrade JK', 'Souza MI', 'Gomes Filho MA', 'Silva DM', 'Barros AL', 'Rodrigues MD', 'Silva PB', 'Nascimento SC', 'Aguiar JS', 'Brondani DJ', 'Militao GC', 'Silva TG']","['Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Pernambuco, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Department of Morphology and Animal Physiology, Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Department of Morphology and Animal Physiology, Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Pernambuco, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Pernambuco, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Pernambuco, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Pernambuco, Brazil.

Both PL and HDACi components, either in combination or in hybrid molecules, are essential for inducing significant DNA damage and apoptosis. Introducing C2-chloro substituent to 1-58 yielded 3-35 with increased cytotoxicity but decreased selectivity in noncancerous MCF-10A cells; eliminating C7-C8 olefin of PL obtained 3-31/3-98 scaffolds which were still more active than PL or SAHA in AML and were well-tolerated by MCF-10A cells. The HDACi function was crucial for modulating expression of DNA repair and apoptosis-related proteins. Collectively, PL and SAHA hybrids are potent, multifunctional anti-AML agents, acting in part, by interfering cellular GSH defense, suppressing expression of DNA repair and pro-survival proteins, and inducing expression of pro-apoptotic proteins.","['Liao, Yi', 'Niu, Xiaojia', 'Chen, Bailing', 'Edwards, Holly', 'Xu, Liping', 'Xie, Chengzhi', 'Lin, Hai', 'Polin, Lisa', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Ge, Yubin', 'Qin, Zhihui']","['Liao Y', 'Niu X', 'Chen B', 'Edwards H', 'Xu L', 'Xie C', 'Lin H', 'Polin L', 'Taub JW', 'Ge Y', 'Qin Z']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Wayne State University , Detroit, Michigan 48201, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Wayne State University School of Medicine , Detroit, Michigan 48201, United States.', 'School of Life Sciences, Jilin University , Changchun 130012, P.R.

However DLI is associated with an increased incidence of acute Graft vs. Host Disease (aGVHD). In mice, administration of azacitidine (AzaC) on days 4, 6, 8, and 10 post DLI increases regulatory T cell (Treg) numbers and prevents GVHD without hindering Graft vs. Leukemia (GVL). Based on these findings, we conducted a phase 1 study of AzaC post DLI for AML relapse post allo-SCT. AzaC was administered on days 4, 6, 8 and 10 post-DLI. Dose escalation was done using a 3+3 design with three AzaC dose levels: 30mg/m(2) (level -1), 45mg/m(2) (level 1) and 75mg/m(2) (level 2). Three patients were treated in the 45mg/m(2) dose level and 5 patients were treated in the 75mg/m(2) dose level; no DLTs or grade 3-5 treatment related toxicities were observed. After a median follow-up of 5.2 months, no patients developed grade III-IV aGVHD and no patients died of aGVHD. Six out of 8 patients in the treatment group responded to treatment including two cytogenetic complete remissions, one hematologic complete remission, and three complete remissions with incomplete count recovery. In conclusion, administration of AzaC early post DLI is well tolerated and can potentially prevent GVHD after DLI. Further studies are required to evaluate the effect of azacitidine early post DLI on GVHD and GVL.","['Ghobadi, Armin', 'Choi, Jaebok', 'Fiala, Mark A', 'Fletcher, Theresa', 'Liu, Jingxia', 'Eissenberg, Linda G', 'Abboud, Camille', 'Cashen, Amanda', 'Vij, Ravi', 'Schroeder, Mark A', 'Pusic, Iskra', 'Stockerl-Goldstein, Keith', 'Jacoby, Meagan', 'Uy, Geoffrey', 'DiPersio, John', 'Westervelt, Peter']","['Ghobadi A', 'Choi J', 'Fiala MA', 'Fletcher T', 'Liu J', 'Eissenberg LG', 'Abboud C', 'Cashen A', 'Vij R', 'Schroeder MA', 'Pusic I', 'Stockerl-Goldstein K', 'Jacoby M', 'Uy G', 'DiPersio J', 'Westervelt P']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis MO, United States.

We pooled data from 3 clinical trials (N=671) to determine the impact of ponatinib dose intensity on the following adverse events: arterial occlusive events (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular events), venous thromboembolic events, cardiac failure, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, hypertension, pancreatitis, increased lipase, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, rash, arthralgia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Multivariate analyses allowed adjustment for covariates potentially related to changes in dosing or an event. Logistic regression analysis identified significant associations between dose intensity and most events after adjusting for covariates. Pancreatitis, rash, and cardiac failure had the strongest associations with dose intensity (odds ratios >2). Time-to-event analyses showed significant associations between dose intensity and risk of arterial occlusive events and each subcategory. Further, these analyses suggested that a lag exists between a change in dose and the resulting change in event risk. No significant association between dose intensity and risk of venous thromboembolic events was evident. Collectively, these findings suggest a potential causal relationship between ponatinib dose and certain adverse events and support prospective investigations of approaches to lower average ponatinib dose intensity.","['Dorer, David J', 'Knickerbocker, Ronald K', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Haluska, Frank G']","['Dorer DJ', 'Knickerbocker RK', 'Baccarani M', 'Cortes JE', 'Hochhaus A', 'Talpaz M', 'Haluska FG']","['ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 26 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, 02139-4234, USA.

Since then, several reports confirmed the capability of LPL to predict CLL disease evolution at the moment of diagnosis. In contrast, data on the functional implications of LPL in CLL are scarce. LPL exerts a central role in overall lipid metabolism and transport, but plays additional, non-catalytic roles as well.

We also carried out an in vivo study using rats to verify the dose adjustment. METHODS: This study included 20 adult patients. ETP was administered intravenously at a dose of 15 mg/kg once daily for 2 days (total dose: 30 mg/kg) combined with standard conditioning of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. In an in vivo study using rats, ETP was administered intravenously at a dose of 15 mg/kg or an adjusted dose. The ETP plasma concentration was determined by using HPLC. The pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by using a 1-compartment model. RESULTS: The peak concentration (Cmax) of ETP and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of ETP differed greatly among patients (range of Cmax, 51.8 - 116.5 mug/mL; range of AUC, 870 - 2015 mug . h/mL). A significant relationship was found between Cmax and AUC (R = 0.85, P < 0.05). Distribution volume (Vd) was suggested to be one of the factors of inter-individual variation in plasma concentration of ETP in patients (range of Vd, 0.13 - 0.27 L/kg), and correlated with Alb and body weight (R = 0.56, P < 0.05; R = 0.40, P < 0.05 respectively). We predicted Vd of rats by body weight of rats (with normal albumin levels and renal function), and the dose of ETP was adjusted using predicted Vd. In the dose adjustment group, the target plasma ETP concentration was achieved and the variation of plasma ETP concentration was decreased. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that inter-individual variation of plasma concentration of ETP could be reduced by predicting Vd. Prediction of Vd is effective for reducing individual variation of ETP concentration and might enable a good therapeutic effect to be achieved.","['Tazawa, Yuki', 'Shigematsu, Akio', 'Kasashi, Kumiko', 'Sugita, Junichi', 'Endo, Tomoyuki', 'Kondo, Takeshi', 'Teshima, Takanori', 'Iseki, Ken', 'Sugawara, Mitsuru', 'Takekuma, Yoh']","['Tazawa Y', 'Shigematsu A', 'Kasashi K', 'Sugita J', 'Endo T', 'Kondo T', 'Teshima T', 'Iseki K', 'Sugawara M', 'Takekuma Y']","['Laboratory of Pharmacokinetics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita-12 Nishi-6, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0812 Japan ; Department of Pharmacy, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Pharmacokinetics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita-12 Nishi-6, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0812 Japan ; Education Research Center for Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Pharmacokinetics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita-12 Nishi-6, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0812 Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160808,England,J Pharm Health Care Sci,Journal of pharmaceutical health care and sciences,101672177,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Distribution volume', 'Dose adjustment', 'Medium-dose etoposide', 'Pharmacokinetics']",2016/08/10 06:00,2016/08/10 06:01,['2016/08/10 06:00'],"['2016/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40780-016-0052-9 [doi]', '52 [pii]']",epublish,J Pharm Health Care Sci. 2016 Aug 8;2:18. doi: 10.1186/s40780-016-0052-9. eCollection 2016.,10.1186/s40780-016-0052-9 [doi],,,,,PMC4976473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, deep-vein thrombosis has been noted as one of the most serious side effects with these drugs, and how these regimens cause deep-vein thrombosis is unclear. METHODS: We investigated the procoagulant effects of vorinostat, L-asparaginase, and doxorubicin in lymphoid tumors, focusing on tissue factor, phosphatidylserine, and antithrombin. The human vascular endothelial cell line EAhy926 as well as the lymphoid neoplastic cell lines HUT78 (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma), Molt4 (acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia), and Ramos (Burkitt lymphoma) were employed to investigate these procoagulant effects. RESULTS: Vorinostat, L-asparaginase, and doxorubicin induced exposure of phosphatidylserine and procoagulant activity on the surface of lymphoid tumor cells. Vorinostat and doxorubicin also induced phosphatidylserine exposure and increased procoagulant activity on EAhy926 cells. Expression of tissue factor antigen was induced by doxorubicin on the surface of each type of cells, whereas expression of tissue factor mRNA was unchanged. Secretion of antithrombin from HepG2 cells was reduced only by L-asparaginase. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that vorinostat and doxorubicin may induce procoagulant activity in vessels through apoptosis of tumor cells and through phosphatidylserine exposure and/or tissue factor expression on vascular endothelial cells. L-asparaginase may induce a thrombophilic state by reducing the secretion of anticoagulant proteins such as antithrombin. The laboratory methods described here could be useful to evaluate the procoagulant effects of antineoplastic drugs.","['Tsunaka, Misae', 'Arai, Reina', 'Ohashi, Ayaka', 'Koyama, Takatoshi']","['Tsunaka M', 'Arai R', 'Ohashi A', 'Koyama T']","['Laboratory Molecular Genetics of Hematology, Field of Applied Laboratory Science, Graduate School of Health Care Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory Molecular Genetics of Hematology, Field of Applied Laboratory Science, Graduate School of Health Care Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory Molecular Genetics of Hematology, Field of Applied Laboratory Science, Graduate School of Health Care Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory Molecular Genetics of Hematology, Field of Applied Laboratory Science, Graduate School of Health Care Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160726,England,SAGE Open Med,SAGE open medicine,101624744,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['L-asparaginase', 'Vorinostat', 'deep-vein thrombosis', 'doxorubicin', 'phosphatidylserine', 'tissue factor']",2016/08/10 06:00,2016/08/10 06:01,['2016/08/10 06:00'],"['2016/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2050312116660936 [doi]', '10.1177_2050312116660936 [pii]']",epublish,SAGE Open Med. 2016 Jul 26;4:2050312116660936. doi: 10.1177/2050312116660936. eCollection 2016.,10.1177/2050312116660936 [doi],,,,,PMC4963813,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CMCE (1 or 10 mug/mL; 14 h) significantly decreased LPS (50-100 ng/mL) induced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta production in THP-1 cells, human, and mouse whole blood as measured by ELISA. LPS-induced IRAK1, MAPK activation, TLR4 expression, TLR4-MyD88 interaction, and IkappaBalpha degradation were significantly reduced in CMCE pre-treated THP-1 cells as assessed by Western blotting. CMCE (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg; 10 days p.o.) pre-treated and LPS (10 mg/kg) challenged Swiss mice exhibited attenuated plasma TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, nitrite, aortic iNOS expression, and vascular dysfunction. In a PI permeability assay, cell lines derived from acute myeloid leukemia were most sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of CMCE. Analysis of Sub-G1 phase, Annexin V-PI positivity, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased caspase-3, and PARP-1 activation confirmed CMCE induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. IRAK inhibition also sensitized HL-60 cells to CMCE induced cytotoxicity. The present study defines the mechanism underlying the action of CMCE and suggests a therapeutic potential for its use in sepsis and leukemia.","['Rana, Minakshi', 'Maurya, Preeti', 'Reddy, Sukka S', 'Singh, Vishal', 'Ahmad, Hafsa', 'Dwivedi, Anil K', 'Dikshit, Madhu', 'Barthwal, Manoj K']","['Rana M', 'Maurya P', 'Reddy SS', 'Singh V', 'Ahmad H', 'Dwivedi AK', 'Dikshit M', 'Barthwal MK']","['Pharmacology Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - Central Drug Research Institute Lucknow, India.', 'Pharmacology Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - Central Drug Research Institute Lucknow, India.', 'Pharmacology Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - Central Drug Research Institute Lucknow, India.', 'Pharmacology Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - Central Drug Research Institute Lucknow, India.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - Central Drug Research Institute Lucknow, India.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - Central Drug Research Institute Lucknow, India.', 'Pharmacology Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - Central Drug Research Institute Lucknow, India.', 'Pharmacology Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - Central Drug Research Institute Lucknow, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160725,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['caspase-3', 'chemically modified Curcuma longa extract', 'endotoxemia', 'interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1', 'mitochondrial membrane potential']",2016/08/10 06:00,2016/08/10 06:01,['2016/08/10 06:00'],"['2016/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2016.00223 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2016 Jul 25;7:223. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2016.00223. eCollection 2016.,10.3389/fphar.2016.00223 [doi],,,,,PMC4959270,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that SIRT2 binds, deacetylates, and inhibits the peroxidase activity of the antioxidant protein peroxiredoxin (Prdx-1) in breast cancer cells. Ectopic overexpression of SIRT2, but not its catalytically dead mutant, increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by hydrogen peroxide, which led to increased levels of an overoxidized and multimeric form of Prdx-1 with activity as a molecular chaperone. Elevated levels of SIRT2 sensitized breast cancer cells to intracellular DNA damage and cell death induced by oxidative stress, as associated with increased levels of nuclear FOXO3A and the proapoptotic BIM protein. In addition, elevated levels of SIRT2 sensitized breast cancer cells to arsenic trioxide, an approved therapeutic agent, along with other intracellular ROS-inducing agents. Conversely, antisense RNA-mediated attenuation of SIRT2 reversed ROS-induced toxicity as demonstrated in a zebrafish embryo model system. Collectively, our findings suggest that the tumor suppressor activity of SIRT2 requires its ability to restrict the antioxidant activity of Prdx-1, thereby sensitizing breast cancer cells to ROS-induced DNA damage and cell cytotoxicity.

To overcome MDR, a serious of pyridine acid esters of podophyllotoxin was synthesized and their antiproliferation activities were evaluated against two human chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines in vitro. Most of them exhibited potent growth inhibition with IC50 values in the nanomolar range as well as markedly reduced resistance factors. The most potent compound, Y8 exhibited an IC50 of 0.046+/-0.003muM against resistance K562/ADR cells, showing more significant than that of adriamycin and etoposide, respectively. Furthermore, Y8 efficiently triggered cell cycle arrest at S phase and simultaneously induced apoptosis in K562/ADR cells. Meanwhile, Y8 also regulated the expression levels of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related proteins. Additionally, Y8 stimulated the ERK1/2 signalling and reduced the expression of Pgp protein. Finally, on the basis of results obtained using U0126, an ERK1/2 inhibitor, the ERK1/2 signalling pathway was proposed for the multidrug resistance-reversing effect of Y8 in K562/ADR cells.

To evaluate the influence of the 3D mechanical constraints that MKs may encounter in vivo, we differentiated mouse BM progenitors in methylcellulose (MC) hydrogels tuned to mimic BM stiffness. We found that MKs grown in a medium of 30- to 60-Pa stiffness more closely resembled those in the BM in terms of demarcation membrane system (DMS) morphological aspect and exhibited higher ploidy levels, as compared with MKs in liquid culture. Following resuspension in a liquid medium, MC-grown MKs displayed twice as much proplatelet formation as cells grown in liquid culture. Thus, the MC gel, by mimicking external constraints, appeared to positively influence MK differentiation. To determine whether MKs adapt to extracellular stiffness through mechanotransduction involving actomyosin-based modulation of the intracellular tension, myosin-deficient (Myh9(-/-)) progenitors were grown in MC gels. Absence of myosin resulted in abnormal cell deformation and strongly decreased proplatelet formation, similarly to features observed for Myh9(-/-) MKs differentiated in situ but not in vitro. Moreover, megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1), a well-known actor in mechanotransduction, was found to be preferentially relocated within the nucleus of MC-differentiated MKs, whereas its inhibition prevented MC-mediated increased proplatelet formation. Altogether, these data show that a 3D medium mimicking BM stiffness contributes, through the myosin IIA and MKL1 pathways, to a more favorable in vitro environment for MK differentiation, which ultimately translates into increased proplatelet production.","['Aguilar, Alicia', 'Pertuy, Fabien', 'Eckly, Anita', 'Strassel, Catherine', 'Collin, Dominique', 'Gachet, Christian', 'Lanza, Francois', 'Leon, Catherine']","['Aguilar A', 'Pertuy F', 'Eckly A', 'Strassel C', 'Collin D', 'Gachet C', 'Lanza F', 'Leon C']","['INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche en Sante 949, Strasbourg, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, Strasbourg, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Federation de Medecine Translationnelle, Strasbourg, France; and.', 'INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche en Sante 949, Strasbourg, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, Strasbourg, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Federation de Medecine Translationnelle, Strasbourg, France; and.', 'INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche en Sante 949, Strasbourg, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, Strasbourg, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Federation de Medecine Translationnelle, Strasbourg, France; and.', 'INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche en Sante 949, Strasbourg, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, Strasbourg, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Federation de Medecine Translationnelle, Strasbourg, France; and.', 'Institut Charles Sadron, UPR 22, Strasbourg, France.', 'INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche en Sante 949, Strasbourg, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, Strasbourg, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Federation de Medecine Translationnelle, Strasbourg, France; and.', 'INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche en Sante 949, Strasbourg, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, Strasbourg, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Federation de Medecine Translationnelle, Strasbourg, France; and.', 'INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche en Sante 949, Strasbourg, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, Strasbourg, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Federation de Medecine Translationnelle, Strasbourg, France; and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160808,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hydrogels)', '0 (Mrtfa protein, mouse)', '0 (Myh9 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIA)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/cytology/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hydrogels/chemistry', 'Mechanotransduction, Cellular/*physiology', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Methylcellulose/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myosin Heavy Chains', 'Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIA/genetics/metabolism', 'Surface Tension', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/08/10 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/08/10 06:00'],"['2016/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)34029-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-02-699959 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Oct 20;128(16):2022-2032. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-02-699959.

At the time of PCP, all patients had CD4 T-cell count >500/muL (median, 966/muL) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) >500 mg/dL (median, 727 mg/dL). All patients underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. P jirovecii was identified by polymerase chain reaction in all 5 cases; direct fluorescence antibody staining was positive in 1. All events were grade </=2 and resolved with oral therapy. Secondary prophylaxis was not given to 3 patients; after 61 patient-months of follow up, no recurrence occurred. Lack of correlation with CD4 count and IgG level suggests that susceptibility to PCP may be linked to Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibition. If confirmed, this association could result in significant changes in surveillance and/or prophylaxis, possibly extending to other BTK inhibitors. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01500733 and #NCT02514083.","['Ahn, Inhye E', 'Jerussi, Theresa', 'Farooqui, Mohammed', 'Tian, Xin', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Gea-Banacloche, Juan']","['Ahn IE', 'Jerussi T', 'Farooqui M', 'Tian X', 'Wiestner A', 'Gea-Banacloche J']","['Medical Oncology Service, National Cancer Institute, and.', 'Office of Patient Safety and Clinical Quality, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Lymphoid Malignancy Section, Hematology Branch, and.', 'Office of Biostatistics Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'Lymphoid Malignancy Section, Hematology Branch, and.', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20160808,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Aged', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Piperidines', '*Pneumocystis carinii', '*Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/chemically induced/diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Pyrazoles/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects']",,,2016/08/10 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/08/10 06:00'],"['2016/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)34052-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-06-722991 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Oct 13;128(15):1940-1943. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-06-722991.

To assess the status of ALV-J infection in meat-type chickens in southern China, the molecular epidemiology of ALV-J strains was investigated. A total of 265 clinical samples collected from southern China from 2013 to 2014 were investigated in this study for the presence of ALV-J, which resulted in 12 virus isolates. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 91.7 % (11/12) of the ALV-J isolates have possessed high homology to Chinese layer isolates and belong to one subgroup. One of the ALV isolates (designated GD1411-1) was relatively closely related to the ALV-J broiler isolates, indicating that the GD1411-1 isolate might be a transition strain. Several unique nucleotide substitutions in gp85 and the U3 region were detected in all 12 ALV-J isolates. This study provides some interesting information on the molecular characterization of ALV-J isolates. These findings will be beneficial for understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of ALV-J infection.","['Lin, Wencheng', 'Li, Xinjian', 'Dai, Zhenkai', 'Zhang, Xinheng', 'Chang, Shuang', 'Zhao, Peng', 'Zhang, Huanmin', 'Chen, Feng', 'Xie, Qingmei']","['Lin W', 'Li X', 'Dai Z', 'Zhang X', 'Chang S', 'Zhao P', 'Zhang H', 'Chen F', 'Xie Q']","[""Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Key Laboratory of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, 510642, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Animal Health Aquaculture and Environmental Control, Guangzhou, 510642, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""South China Collaborative Innovation Center for Poultry Disease Control and Product Safety, Guangzhou, 510642, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Key Laboratory of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, 510642, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Key Laboratory of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, 510642, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Key Laboratory of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, 510642, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, 271018, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, 271018, People's Republic of China."", 'USDA, Agriculture Research Service, Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory, East Lansing, MI, 48823, USA.', ""Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Key Laboratory of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, 510642, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Animal Health Aquaculture and Environmental Control, Guangzhou, 510642, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Key Laboratory of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, 510642, People's Republic of China. qmx@scau.edu.cn."", ""Key Laboratory of Animal Health Aquaculture and Environmental Control, Guangzhou, 510642, Guangdong, People's Republic of China. qmx@scau.edu.cn."", ""South China Collaborative Innovation Center for Poultry Disease Control and Product Safety, Guangzhou, 510642, People's Republic of China. qmx@scau.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160809,Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Chickens', 'China/epidemiology', '*Genotype', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Phylogeny', 'Point Mutation', 'Poultry Diseases/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,,2016/08/10 06:00,2017/01/27 06:00,['2016/08/10 06:00'],"['2016/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00705-016-3003-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00705-016-3003-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Virol. 2016 Nov;161(11):3039-46. doi: 10.1007/s00705-016-3003-8.

Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 study of temozolomide with escalating doses of veliparib in patients with relapsed, refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or AML arising from aggressive myeloid malignancies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients received veliparib [20-200 mg once a day on day 1 and twice daily on days 4-12 in cycle 1 (days 1-8 in cycle >/=2)] and temozolomide [150-200 mg/m(2) daily on days 3-9 in cycle 1 (days 1-5 in cycle >/=2)] every 28 to 56 days. Veliparib pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [ability to inhibit poly(ADP-ribose) polymer (PAR) formation and induce H2AX phosphorylation] were assessed. Pretreatment levels of MGMT and PARP1 protein, methylation of the MGMT promoter, and integrity of the Fanconi anemia pathway were also examined. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were treated at seven dose levels. Dose-limiting toxicities were oral mucositis and esophagitis lasting >7 days. The MTD was veliparib 150 mg twice daily with temozolomide 200 mg/m(2) daily. The complete response (CR) rate was 17% (8/48 patients). Veliparib exposure as well as inhibition of PAR polymer formation increased dose proportionately. A veliparib-induced increase in H2AX phosphorylation in CD34(+) cells was observed in responders. Three of 4 patients with MGMT promoter methylation achieved CR. CONCLUSIONS: Veliparib plus temozolomide is well tolerated, with activity in advanced AML. Further evaluation of this regimen and of treatment-induced phosphorylation of H2AX and MGMT methylation as potential response predictors appears warranted. Clin Cancer Res; 23(3); 697-706.

However, some del(17p) patients do not progress for years, suggesting that del(17p) is not the only driving event in CLL progression. We hypothesize that other concomitant genetic abnormalities underlie the clinical heterogeneity of del(17p) CLL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We profiled the somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNA) in a large group of del(17p) CLLs as well as wild-type CLL and analyzed the genetic basis of their clinical heterogeneity. RESULTS: We found that increased somatic mutation number associates with poor overall survival independent of 17p deletion (P = 0.003). TP53 mutation was present in 81% of del(17p) CLL, mostly clonal (82%), and clonal mutations with del(17p) exhibit shorter overall survival than subclonal mutations with del(17p) (P = 0.019). Del(17p) CLL has a unique driver mutation profile, including NOTCH1 (15%), RPS15 (12%), DDX3X (8%), and GPS2 (6%). We found that about half of del(17p) CLL cases have recurrent deletions at 3p, 4p, or 9p and that any of these deletions significantly predicts shorter overall survival. In addition, the number of CNAs, but not somatic mutations, predicts shorter time to treatment among patients untreated at sampling. Indolent del(17p) CLLs were characterized by absent or subclonal TP53 mutation and few CNAs, with no difference in somatic mutation number. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that del(17p) has a unique genomic profile and that clonal TP53 mutations, 3p, 4p, or 9p deletions, and genomic complexity are associated with shorter overall survival.

The purpose of this study was to assess a recipient dual-testing strategy before HSCT. METHODS: CMV serologic testing was performed before allogeneic HSCT using 2 different assays: reference laboratory (RL) and American Red Cross (ARC). In all cases, blood samples were obtained for RL testing either before ARC testing (median 130 days before HSCT [range 12-2594]) or at the same time (median 25 days before HSCT [range 8-129]). The results of serologic testing were correlated with CMV viremia post HSCT. RESULTS: Of 287 recipients evaluated, 76 (26.5%) had discordant results, of which 74 (97.4%) tested RL-/ARC+. Ten had RL and ARC testing performed on simultaneously obtained samples, 3 of which (30%) were discordant (3 [100%] RL-/ARC+). Acute myeloid leukemia and receipt of blood product transfusion in the interval between testing were associated with RL-/ARC+ discordance. Correlation with viremia after HSCT suggested that RL-/ARC+ discordance was caused by detection of anti-CMV immunoglobulin transferred in transfused blood products and reduced specificity of the ARC assay. CONCLUSION: CMV-seronegative hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients may be misclassified as seropositive if testing is performed after receipt of blood products or when using assays optimized for sensitivity at the expense of specificity. This misclassification may negatively affect post-HSCT outcomes for individual patients and studies that rely on accurate CMV serology reporting.","['Perry, D A', 'Hakki, M']","['Perry DA', 'Hakki M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA. hakki@ohsu.edu.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA. hakki@ohsu.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160923,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Component Transfusion/adverse effects', 'Cytomegalovirus/*isolation & purification', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/blood/*prevention & control', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Preoperative Care/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serologic Tests/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Viremia/*blood', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['cytomegalovirus', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplant', 'seroconversion', 'serology', 'testing']",2016/08/10 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/08/10 06:00'],"['2016/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tid.12591 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2016 Oct;18(5):809-814. doi: 10.1111/tid.12591.

In this study, we have explored the bio-application of new nanocomposites composed with PLA nanofibers and Au nanoparticles as the potential drug carrier for an efficient drug delivery in target cancer cells. The results demonstrated that the anticancer drug daunorubicin could be efficiently self-assembled on the surface of PLA/Au nanocomposites and the synergistic enhancement of PLA/Au nanocomposites conjugated with daunorubicin into drug-sensitive K562 and drug-resistant leukemia K562/AO2 cells could be obviously observed by MTT assay and confocal fluorescence microscopy studies. These observations suggest that the new nanocomposites could readily induce daunorubicin to accumulate and uptake in target leukemia cells and increase the drug's cytotoxicity. Especially, the PLA/Au nanocomposites could significantly facilitate the cellular drug absorbtion of daunorubicin into drug-resistant K562/AO2 cells and efficiently inhibit the cancer cell proliferation. This raised the possibility to utilize the PLA/Au nanocomposites as a new effective additive agent to inhibit the drug resistance and thus as a novel strategy to sensitively track the respective cancer cells.","['Li, Jingyuan', 'Chen, Chen', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Gu, Zhongze', 'Chen, Baoan']","['Li J', 'Chen C', 'Wang X', 'Gu Z', 'Chen B']","['State Key Lab of Bioelectronics (Chien-Shiung WU Laboratory), Southeast University, 210096, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Lab of Bioelectronics (Chien-Shiung WU Laboratory), Southeast University, 210096, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Lab of Bioelectronics (Chien-Shiung WU Laboratory), Southeast University, 210096, Nanjing, China. xuewang@seu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Lab of Bioelectronics (Chien-Shiung WU Laboratory), Southeast University, 210096, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, 210096, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100914,United States,Nanoscale Res Lett,Nanoscale research letters,101279750,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Daunorubicin', 'Drug delivery', 'Human leukemia', 'Multidrug resistance', 'PLA/Au nanocomposites']",2011/12/01 00:00,2011/12/01 00:01,['2016/08/10 06:00'],"['2010/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11671-010-9762-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s11671-010-9762-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Nanoscale Res Lett. 2011 Dec;6(1):29. doi: 10.1007/s11671-010-9762-3.

Knock-out experimental strategies-targeting retinoid nuclear receptors RARs and RXRs have confirmed that the effects of vitamin A are mediated by retinoic acid (especially all-trans retinoic acid) and that this vitamin is essential for the developmental process. All these data show that the vitamin A pathway and metabolism are as important for the well-being of the foetus, as they are for that of the adult. Accordingly, during this last decade, extensive research on retinoid metabolism has yielded detailed knowledge on all the actors in this pathway, spurring the development of antagonists and agonists for therapeutic and research applications. Natural and synthetic retinoids are currently used in clinical practice, most often on the skin for the treatment of acne, and as anti-oncogenic agents in acute promyelocytic leukaemia. However, because of the toxicity and teratogenicity of retinoids during pregnancy, their pharmacological use needs a sound knowledge of their metabolism, molecular aspects, placental transfer, and action.","['Comptour, Aurelie', 'Rouzaire, Marion', 'Belville, Corinne', 'Bouvier, Damien', 'Gallot, Denis', 'Blanchon, Loic', 'Sapin, Vincent']","['Comptour A', 'Rouzaire M', 'Belville C', 'Bouvier D', 'Gallot D', 'Blanchon L', 'Sapin V']","[""EA7281, Retinoids, Reproduction Developmental Diseases, School of Medicine, Clermont Universite, Universite d'Auvergne, 63000, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", ""EA7281, Retinoids, Reproduction Developmental Diseases, School of Medicine, Clermont Universite, Universite d'Auvergne, 63000, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", ""EA7281, Retinoids, Reproduction Developmental Diseases, School of Medicine, Clermont Universite, Universite d'Auvergne, 63000, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", ""GReD, Clermont Universite, Universite d'Auvergne, 63000, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", ""EA7281, Retinoids, Reproduction Developmental Diseases, School of Medicine, Clermont Universite, Universite d'Auvergne, 63000, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", 'Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department, CHU Clermont-Ferrand, 63000, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""EA7281, Retinoids, Reproduction Developmental Diseases, School of Medicine, Clermont Universite, Universite d'Auvergne, 63000, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, CHU Clermont-Ferrand, 63000, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""EA7281, Retinoids, Reproduction Developmental Diseases, School of Medicine, Clermont Universite, Universite d'Auvergne, 63000, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", ""EA7281, Retinoids, Reproduction Developmental Diseases, School of Medicine, Clermont Universite, Universite d'Auvergne, 63000, Clermont-Ferrand, France. vincent.sapin@udamail.fr."", 'Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department, CHU Clermont-Ferrand, 63000, Clermont-Ferrand, France. vincent.sapin@udamail.fr.', 'Laboratoire de Biochimie Medicale, 4R3, Faculte de Medecine, 28 Place Henri-Dunant, BP38, 63001, Clermont-Ferrand Cedex, France. vincent.sapin@udamail.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160809,Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,"['0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations/chemistry/metabolism', 'Placenta/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Reproduction', 'Species Specificity']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Agonists', '*Antagonists', '*Placentation', '*Retinoid receptors', '*Vitamin A']",2016/08/10 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/08/10 06:00'],"['2016/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00018-016-2332-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00018-016-2332-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2016 Oct;73(20):3823-37. doi: 10.1007/s00018-016-2332-9.

DExD/H-box helicases comprise the largest SF2 helicase superfamily, which are characterized by two conserved RecA-like domains. In recent years, an increasing number of unexpected functions of these proteins have been discovered. They play important roles not only in innate immune response but also in diseases like cancers and chronic hepatitis C. In this review, we summarize the recent literatures on one member of the SF2 superfamily, the DEAD-box protein DDX41. After bacterial or viral infection, DNA or cyclic-di-GMP is released to cells. After phosphorylation of Tyr414 by BTK kinase, DDX41 will act as a sensor to recognize the invaders, followed by induction of type I interferons (IFN). After the immune response, DDX41 is degraded by the E3 ligase TRIM21, using Lys9 and Lys115 of DDX41 as the ubiquitination sites. Besides the roles in innate immunity, DDX41 is also related to diseases. An increasing number of both inherited and acquired mutations in DDX41 gene are identified from myelodysplastic syndrome and/or acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) patients. The review focuses on DDX41, as well as its homolog Abstrakt in Drosophila, which is important for survival at all stages throughout the life cycle of the fly.","['Jiang, Yan', 'Zhu, Yanping', 'Liu, Zhi-Jie', 'Ouyang, Songying']","['Jiang Y', 'Zhu Y', 'Liu ZJ', 'Ouyang S']","['National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.', 'National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.', 'National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.', 'iHuman Institute, Shanghai Tech University, Shanghai, 201210, China.', 'National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China. ouyangsy@ibp.ac.cn.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA. ouyangsy@ibp.ac.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160809,Germany,Protein Cell,Protein & cell,101532368,"['0 (Abs protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Narf protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', ""61093-23-0 (bis(3',5')-cyclic diguanylic acid)"", 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (DDX41 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Infections/genetics/*immunology', 'Cyclic GMP/analogs & derivatives/genetics/immunology', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/genetics/*immunology', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*immunology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/immunology', 'Virus Diseases/genetics/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DDX41', '*RNA helicases', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*innate immunity', '*myelodysplastic syndrome']",2016/08/10 06:00,2017/06/06 06:00,['2016/08/10 06:00'],"['2016/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13238-016-0303-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s13238-016-0303-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Protein Cell. 2017 Feb;8(2):83-89. doi: 10.1007/s13238-016-0303-4.

However, studies regarding the outcomes and late effects among AML survivors are relatively limited. METHODS: This nationwide population-based study used medical records from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database. A total of 3356 AML patients diagnosed from 2000 to 2008 were analyzed. The physiological and psychological morbidities in AML survivors were compared to those identified from a normal population. This study also compared late effects among AML survivors treated by intensive chemotherapy alone and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). RESULTS: The incidence of AML in Taiwan has increased from 1.07 per 100,000 persons in 2000 to 2.17 per 100,000 persons in 2008 (p < 0.0001). With the median overall survival (OS) time of 0.98 years, 25.0 % of AML patients in this study cohort received best supportive care alone. Compared to the normal population, AML survivors had higher rates of hypertension (hazard ratio [HR] 1.69; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.18-2.42; p < 0.01), cardiovascular disease (HR 2.53; 95 % CI 1.39-4.61; p < 0.01), diabetes (HR 2.27; 95 % CI 1.48-3.48; p < 0.001), and psychological disorders (HR 1.45; 95 % CI 1.04-2.04; p < 0.05). Although patients undergoing allo-HSCT had a better OS than did patients treated with intensive chemotherapy alone (median not reached vs. 1.53 years; p < 0.0001), diabetes was found more often among allo-HSCT recipients than among patients receiving intensive chemotherapy only (HR 2.93; 95 % CI 1.21-7.08; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Regular physical and psychological surveillance of AML survivors is needed especially for those receiving allo-HSCT.","['Chang, Kuang-Hsi', 'Hwang, Wen-Li', 'Muo, Chih-Hsin', 'Hsu, Chung Y', 'Teng, Chieh-Lin Jerry']","['Chang KH', 'Hwang WL', 'Muo CH', 'Hsu CY', 'Teng CJ']","['Department of Public Health, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, 1650 Taiwan Boulevard Sect. 4, Taichung, 40705, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Management Office for Health Data, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Science, China Medical University, 91 Hsueh-Shih Road, Taichung, 40402, Taiwan. hsuc@mail.cmuh.org.tw.', 'Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, 1650 Taiwan Boulevard Sect. 4, Taichung, 40705, Taiwan. drteng@vghtc.gov.tw.', 'Department of Life Science, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan. drteng@vghtc.gov.tw.', 'School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. drteng@vghtc.gov.tw.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160809,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survivors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*Diabetes', '*Overall survival', '*Survivorship']",2016/10/28 06:00,2017/08/17 06:00,['2016/08/10 06:00'],"['2016/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-016-3361-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-016-3361-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2016 Dec;24(12):4993-5000. doi: 10.1007/s00520-016-3361-5.

Simulation studies demonstrate its advantages over previous methods.","['Jin, Yuxue', 'Lai, Tze Leung']","['Jin Y', 'Lai TL']","['Quantitative Marketing, Google, New York, NY, 10011, USA. yuxue@google.com.', 'Department of Statistics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20160808,United States,Lifetime Data Anal,Lifetime data analysis,9516348,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Models, Statistical', 'Normal Distribution', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Regression Analysis', '*Risk']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Asymptotic efficiency', '*Cumulative incidence function', '*Empirical process theory', '*Hazard function of subdistribution', '*Martingale central limit theorem', '*Semiparametric likelihood', '*Volterra equation']",2016/08/10 06:00,2019/01/29 06:00,['2016/08/10 06:00'],"['2014/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10985-016-9378-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s10985-016-9378-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Lifetime Data Anal. 2017 Oct;23(4):605-625. doi: 10.1007/s10985-016-9378-8.

This study was the first prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of nilotinib in Turkish patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP. The primary endpoint of the study was the rate of major molecular response (MMR; BCR-ABL1 </= 0.1% on the International Scale [BCR-ABL1(IS)]) by 12 months. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP were treated with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily. This analysis was based on the first 12 months of follow-up in a 24-month study. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Of 112 patients enrolled, 66.1% (80% CI, 59.7-72.0%) achieved MMR and 22.3% achieved a deep molecular response of MR(4.5) (BCR-ABL1(IS) </= 0.0032%) by 12 months. During the first year of treatment, 1 patient progressed to blast crisis and 2 patients died. Safety results were consistent with previous studies. Most adverse events (AEs) were grade 1/2. Most frequently reported nonhematologic AEs of any grade were elevations in bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, and triglycerides. These results support the use of nilotinib 300 mg twice daily as a standard-of-care treatment option for patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP.","['Saydam, Guray', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim Celalettin', 'Kaynar, Leylagul', 'Yavuz, Akif S', 'Ali, Ridvan', 'Guvenc, Birol', 'Akay, Olga M', 'Baslar, Zafer', 'Ozbek, Ugur', 'Sonmez, Mehmet', 'Aydin, Demet', 'Pehlivan, Mustafa', 'Undar, Bulent', 'Dagdas, Simten', 'Ayyildiz, Orhan', 'Akkaynak, Diyar Z', 'Dag, Ilkiz M', 'Ilhan, Osman']","['Saydam G', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Kaynar L', 'Yavuz AS', 'Ali R', 'Guvenc B', 'Akay OM', 'Baslar Z', 'Ozbek U', 'Sonmez M', 'Aydin D', 'Pehlivan M', 'Undar B', 'Dagdas S', 'Ayyildiz O', 'Akkaynak DZ', 'Dag IM', 'Ilhan O']","['a Department of Internal Medicine , Ege University Medical Faculty Hospital , Izmir , Turkey.', 'b Department of Internal Medicine , Hacettepe University Medical Faculty Hospital , Ankara , Turkey.', 'c Hematology Division , Erciyes University Medical Faculty Hospital , Kayseri , Turkey.', 'd Department of Internal Medicine , Istanbul University Istanbul Medical Faculty , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'e Department of Internal Medicine , Uludag University Medical Faculty , Bursa , Turkey.', 'f Department of Internal Medicine , Cukurova University Medical Faculty Hospital , Adana , Turkey.', 'g Department of Internal Medicine , Eskisehir Osmangazi University Medical Faculty Hospital , Eskisehir , Turkey.', 'h Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'i Institute of Experimental Medicine (DETAE) , Istanbul University , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'j Department of Internal Medicine , Karadeniz Technical University Medical Faculty , Trabzon , Turkey.', 'k Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'l Department of Internal Medicine , Gaziantep University Medical Faculty , Gaziantep , Turkey.', 'm Department of Internal Medicine , Dokuz Eylul University Medical Faculty , Izmir , Turkey.', 'n Department of Internal Medicine , Ankara Numune Training and Research Hospital , Ankara , Turkey.', 'o Medical Faculty Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine , Dicle University , Diyarbakir , Turkey.', 'p Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'p Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'q Ankara University School of Medicine , Ankara , Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20160818,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL1', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*molecular response', '*nilotinib', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2016/08/09 06:00,2017/03/11 06:00,['2016/08/09 06:00'],"['2016/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/14656566.2016.1219338 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2016 Oct;17(14):1851-8. doi: 10.1080/14656566.2016.1219338.

The chromatographic separation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), adenosine (ADO) and inosine (INO) is performed at RT on a silica-based, reversed-phase column that is used for polar compound retention. The method includes a binary mobile phase, which consists of 7 mM ammonium acetate and acetonitrile with a flow rate of 1.00 ml/min. The eluates are monitored using a Photodiode Array UV detector set at 260 nm. A standard calibration curve is generated to calculate the equation for the analytical quantification of each purine compound. System control, data acquisition and analysis are then performed. Applying this protocol, AMP, INO and ADO elute at 7, 11 and 11.9 min, respectively, and the total run time for each sample is 20 min. This protocol may be applied to different cell types and cell lines (both suspension and adherent), using culture media as matrix. The advantages are easy and fast sample preparation and the requirement of a small amount of supernatant for analysis. Furthermore, the use of a serum-free medium allows skipping the protein precipitation step with acetonitrile that impacts the final concentration of purine compounds. One of the limitations of the method is the requirement of the equilibration column run before each single sample run, making the total run time of the experiment longer and preventing high throughput screening applications.","['Serra, Sara', 'Deaglio, Silvia']","['Serra S', 'Deaglio S']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Human Genetics Foundation (HuGeF), University of Turin.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Human Genetics Foundation (HuGeF), University of Turin; silvia.deaglio@unito.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Video-Audio Media']",20160720,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Nucleotides)']",IM,"['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods', 'Chromatography, Reverse-Phase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Nucleosides/*metabolism', 'Nucleotides/*metabolism']",,,2016/08/09 06:00,2017/08/22 06:00,['2016/08/09 06:00'],"['2016/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/54124 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2016 Jul 20;(113). doi: 10.3791/54124.,10.3791/54124 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported retrospective analyses of a conditioning regimen of medium-dose etoposide, cyclophosphamide (CY), and total body irradiation (TBI) before allo-SCT for ALL. To prospectively analyze the efficacy of this conditioning regimen, we conducted a trial prospectively. METHODS: The eligibility criteria of this study were as follows: diagnosis of ALL, aged between 15 and 50 years, in complete remission, and first SCT from HLA serologically matched donor. The primary endpoint of this study was event-free survival at 1 year after SCT, and the events were defined as death and relapse. RESULTS: Fifty eligible patients were treated, and the median age of the patients was 33.5 years. Nineteen patients were Philadelphia chromosome-positive, and 47 were in first complete remission at SCT. All patients achieved neutrophil engraftment. Grade 3 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease and extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease developed in 4 patients and 18 patients, respectively. No patient died within 100 days after SCT. One-year event-free survival was 76.0%, and 1-year overall survival was 80.0%. The cumulative incidences of relapse and non-relapse mortality at 1-year after SCT were 10.0% and 14.0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Medium-dose etoposide + CY + TBI is an effective conditioning before allo-SCT for adult patients with ALL, enabling good disease control without an increase in nonrelapse mortality. A phase 3 trial comparing this regimen with the standard CY + TBI regimen for adult patients with ALL is warranted.","['Shigematsu, Akio', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Fujisawa, Shin', 'Suzuki, Ritsuro', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Hatanaka, Kazuo', 'Masuko, Masayoshi', 'Ito, Toshiro', 'Kobayashi, Naoki', 'Kato, Jun', 'Miyamura, Koichi', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Morishima, Yasuo', 'Imamura, Masahiro']","['Shigematsu A', 'Ozawa Y', 'Onizuka M', 'Fujisawa S', 'Suzuki R', 'Atsuta Y', 'Hatanaka K', 'Masuko M', 'Ito T', 'Kobayashi N', 'Kato J', 'Miyamura K', 'Fukuda T', 'Morishima Y', 'Imamura M']","['Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of HSCT Data Management and Biostatistics, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of HSCT Data Management and Biostatistics, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Wakayama Medical University Hospital, Wakayama, Japan.', 'Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Division, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150313,United States,Transplant Direct,Transplantation direct,101651609,,,,,,2015/03/01 00:00,2015/03/01 00:01,['2016/08/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1097/TXD.0000000000000514 [doi]', 'TXD14012 [pii]']",epublish,Transplant Direct. 2015 Mar 13;1(2):e8. doi: 10.1097/TXD.0000000000000514. eCollection 2015 Mar.,10.1097/TXD.0000000000000514 [doi],,,,,PMC4946459,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the potential mechanism underlying the effects of NLS-RARalpha on APL is still not entirely clear. Here, we investigated the effects of NLS-RARalpha on APL NB4 cells and its mechanism. We found that all-trans retinoic acid(ATRA) could promote differentiation while inhibit proliferation of APL NB4 cells via upregulating the expression of phosphorylated p38alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase(p-p38alpha MAPK). We also found that NLS-RARalpha could inhibit differentiation while accelerate proliferation of NB4 cells via downregulating the expression of p-p38alpha protein in the presence of ATRA. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed NLS-RARalpha interacted with p38alpha protein directly. Finally, application of PD169316, an inhibitor of p38alpha protein, suggested that recruitment p38alpha-combinded NLS-RARalpha by ATRA eventually caused activation of p38alpha protein. In summary, our study demonstrated that ATRA cound promote differentiation while inhibit proliferation of APL NB4 cells via activating p38alpha protein after recruiting p38alpha-combinded NLS-RARalpha, while NLS-RARalpha could inhibit the effects of ATRA in the process.","['Xiao, Chunlan', 'Zhong, Liang', 'Shan, Zhiling', 'Xu, Ting', 'Gan, Liugen', 'Song, Hao', 'Yang, Rong', 'Li, Liu', 'Liu, Beizhong']","['Xiao C', 'Zhong L', 'Shan Z', 'Xu T', 'Gan L', 'Song H', 'Yang R', 'Li L', 'Liu B']","['1.

In this study, we examined the effects and mechanism of action of lapatinib on several human leukemia cells lines, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. We found that lapatinib inhibited the growth of human AML U937, HL-60, NB4, CML KU812, MEG-01, and ALL Jurkat T cells. Among these leukemia cell lines, lapatinib induced apoptosis in HL-60, NB4, and Jurkat cells, but induced nonapoptotic cell death in U937, K562, and MEG-01 cells. Moreover, lapatinib treatment caused autophagic cell death as shown by positive acridine orange staining, the massive formation of vacuoles as seen by electronic microscopy, and the upregulation of LC3-II, ATG5, and ATG7 in AML U937 cells. Furthermore, autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine and knockdown of ATG5, ATG7, and Beclin-1 using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) partially rescued lapatinib-induced cell death. In addition, the induction of phagocytosis and ROS production as well as the upregulation of surface markers CD14 and CD68 was detected in lapatinib-treated U937 cells, suggesting the induction of macrophagic differentiation in AML U937 cells by lapatinib. We also noted the synergistic effects of the use of lapatinib and cytotoxic drugs in U937 leukemia cells. These results indicate that lapatinib may have potential for development as a novel antileukemia agent.","['Chen, Yu-Jen', 'Fang, Li-Wen', 'Su, Wen-Chi', 'Hsu, Wen-Yi', 'Yang, Kai-Chien', 'Huang, Huey-Lan']","['Chen YJ', 'Fang LW', 'Su WC', 'Hsu WY', 'Yang KC', 'Huang HL']","['Department of Medical Research; Department of Radiation Oncology, Mackay Memorial Hospital; Institute of Traditional Medicine, School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University; Institute of Pharmacology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei.', 'Department of Nutrition, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung.', 'Research Center for Emerging Viruses, China Medical University Hospital; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Science, China Medical University, Taichung.', 'Department of Medical Research.', 'Department of Medical Research.', 'Department of Bioscience Technology, College of Health Science, Chang Jung Christian University, Tainan, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160720,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'autophagic cell death', 'differentiation', 'lapatinib', 'leukemia']",2016/08/09 06:00,2016/08/09 06:01,['2016/08/09 06:00'],"['2016/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S105664 [doi]', 'ott-9-4453 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2016 Jul 20;9:4453-64. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S105664. eCollection 2016.,10.2147/OTT.S105664 [doi],,,,,PMC4959590,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alloimmunization not only causes symptomatic reactions, transfused cells can also be (silently) destroyed. Immunization by BT can contribute to hemolytic disease of the newborn as well as to allograft rejection after transplantation. Reversely, pregnancy and transplantation may evoke immunity hampering transfusion therapy. Besides causing mortality and morbidity, alloimmunization has a huge economic impact. Transfusion reactions prolong hospital stay, require diagnostic tests and complex donor selection procedures and create the need for typed donor registries. In the 1970s, Opeltz and colleagues described that pre-transplantation BT impaired rejection of renal transplants. Leukocytes were essential for this immunosuppressive BT effect that raised concern about negative effects on cancer growth and resistance against infections. Studies on the mechanism were however preliminary abandoned when calcineurin inhibitors for prevention of graft rejection became available and since all blood products underwent leukoreduction in most countries as precautionary measure against transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. Whether current leukoreduced BT are immunosuppressive and for which patients or circumstances this may contribute to worse outcome, is unknown. The last decades of the previous century, leukoreduction of cellular blood products for leukemia patients significantly reduced the incidence of immunological platelet transfusion refractoriness. The first decade of this century the avoidance of plasma- and platelet-products from females, that may contain donor-derived leukocyte antibodies, decreased transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) by more than 30%. These were major achievements. Challenge for the near future is to further reduce alloimmunization in particular against red blood cells (RBC) as a cause of severe hemolytic transfusion reactions and problems to find compatible donors. This can be achieved by extended matching. Inventory limitations prevent to match all BT for clinically relevant RBC antigens. A (European-wide) registration of clinical and genetic risk factors associated with alloimmunization could support effective use of matched blood products.","['Brand, Anneke']",['Brand A'],"['Leiden University Medical Centre and Sanquin blood supply, Leiden, Netherlands.

Memory B cells are generated in germinal center (GC) reactions in the course of T cell-dependent immune responses and are distinguished from naive B cells by an increased lifespan, faster and stronger response to stimulation and expression of somatically mutated and affinity matured immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. Approximately 40% of human B cells in adults are memory B cells, and several subsets were identified. Besides IgG(+) and IgA(+) memory B cells, approximately 50% of peripheral blood memory B cells express IgM with or without IgD. Further smaller subpopulations have additionally been described. These various subsets share typical memory B cell features, but likely also fulfill distinct functions. IgM memory B cells appear to have the propensity for refined adaptation upon restimulation in additional GC reactions, whereas reactivated IgG B cells rather differentiate directly into plasma cells. The human memory B-cell pool is characterized by (sometimes amazingly large) clonal expansions, often showing extensive intraclonal IgV gene diversity. Moreover, memory B-cell clones are frequently composed of members of various subsets, showing that from a single GC B-cell clone a variety of memory B cells with distinct functions is generated. Thus, the human memory B-cell compartment is highly diverse and flexible. Several B-cell malignancies display features suggesting a derivation from memory B cells. This includes a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia and marginal zone lymphomas. The exposure of memory B cells to oncogenic events during their generation in the GC, the longevity of these B cells and the ease to activate them may be key determinants for their malignant transformation.","['Seifert, M', 'Kuppers, R']","['Seifert M', 'Kuppers R']","['Institute of Cell Biology (Cancer Research), Medical Faculty, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell Biology (Cancer Research), Medical Faculty, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160808,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/classification/cytology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Neoplasms/pathology']",,,2016/08/09 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/08/09 06:00'],"['2016/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016226 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.226 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Dec;30(12):2283-2292. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.226.

Here, we demonstrated that Rictor is essential for the maintenance of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-driven leukemia by preventing leukemia stem cells (LSCs) from exhaustion. Rictor depletion led to a reactive activation of mTORC1 signaling by facilitating the assembly of mTORC1. Hyperactivated mTORC1 signaling in turn drove LSCs into cycling, compromised the quiescence of LSCs and eventually exhausted their capacity to generate leukemia. At the same time, loss of Rictor had led to a reactive activation of FoxO3a in leukemia cells, which acts as negative feedback to restrain greater over-reactivation of mTORC1 activity and paradoxically protects leukemia cells from exhaustion. Simultaneous depletion of Rictor and FoxO3a enabled rapid exhaustion of MLL LSCs and a quick eradication of MLL leukemia. As such, our present findings highlighted a pivotal regulatory axis of Rictor-FoxO3a in maintaining quiescence and the stemness of LSCs.","['Fang, Y', 'Yang, Y', 'Hua, C', 'Xu, S', 'Zhou, M', 'Guo,

To identify robust biomarkers for BCL-2 inhibitor sensitivity, we evaluated the ex vivo sensitivity of fresh leukemic cells from 73 diagnosed and relapsed/refractory AML patients, and then comprehensively assessed whether the responses correlated to specific mutations or gene expression signatures. Compared with samples from healthy donor controls (nonsensitive) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients (highly sensitive), AML samples exhibited variable responses to BCL-2 inhibition. Strongest CLL-like responses were observed in 15% of the AML patient samples, whereas 32% were resistant, and the remaining exhibited intermediate responses to venetoclax. BCL-2 inhibitor sensitivity was associated with genetic aberrations in chromatin modifiers, WT1 and IDH1/IDH2. A striking selective overexpression of specific HOXA and HOXB gene transcripts were detected in highly BCL-2 inhibitor sensitive samples. Ex vivo responses to venetoclax showed significant inverse correlation to beta2-microglobulin expression and to a lesser degree to BCL-XL and BAX expression. As new therapy options for AML are urgently needed, the specific HOX gene expression pattern can potentially be used as a biomarker to identify venetoclax-sensitive AML patients for clinical trials.","['Kontro, M', 'Kumar, A', 'Majumder, M M', 'Eldfors, S', 'Parsons, A', 'Pemovska, T', 'Saarela, J', 'Yadav, B', 'Malani, D', 'Floisand, Y', 'Hoglund, M', 'Remes, K', 'Gjertsen, B T', 'Kallioniemi, O', 'Wennerberg, K', 'Heckman, C A', 'Porkka, K']","['Kontro M', 'Kumar A', 'Majumder MM', 'Eldfors S', 'Parsons A', 'Pemovska T', 'Saarela J', 'Yadav B', 'Malani D', 'Floisand Y', 'Hoglund M', 'Remes K', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Kallioniemi O', 'Wennerberg K', 'Heckman CA', 'Porkka K']","['Department of Hematology, Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Turku University Central Hospital, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Hematology Section, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160808,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Important functional properties are associated with CD5 expression in B cells, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation, IL-10 production and the promotion of B-lymphocyte survival and transformation. However, the pathway(s) by which CD5 influences the biology of B cells and its dependence on B-cell receptor (BCR) co-signaling remain unknown. In this study, we show that CD5 expression activates a number of important signaling pathways, including Erk1/2, leading to IL-10 production through a novel pathway independent of BCR engagement. This pathway is dependent on extracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) entry facilitated by upregulation of the transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1) protein. We also show that Erk1/2 activation in a subgroup of CLL patients is associated with TRPC1 overexpression. In this subgroup of CLL patients, small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) for CD5 reduces TRPC1 expression. Furthermore, siRNAs for CD5 or for TRPC1 inhibit IL-10 production. These findings provide new insights into the role of CD5 in B-cell biology in health and disease and could pave the way for new treatment strategies for patients with B-CLL.","['Garaud, Soizic', 'Taher, Taher E', 'Debant, Marjolaine', 'Burgos, Miguel', 'Melayah, Sarra', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Parikh, Kaushal', 'Pers, Jacques-Olivier', 'Luque-Paz, Damien', 'Chiocchia, Gilles', 'Peppelenbosch, Maikel', 'Isenberg, David A', 'Youinou, Pierre', 'Mignen, Olivier', 'Renaudineau, Yves', 'Mageed, Rizgar A']","['Garaud S', 'Taher TE', 'Debant M', 'Burgos M', 'Melayah S', 'Berthou C', 'Parikh K', 'Pers JO', 'Luque-Paz D', 'Chiocchia G', 'Peppelenbosch M', 'Isenberg DA', 'Youinou P', 'Mignen O', 'Renaudineau Y', 'Mageed RA']","['INSERM ERI29/EA2216, reseau epigenetique and reseau canaux ioniques du Canceropole Grand Ouest, Brest University Medical School, Brest 29609, France.', 'Centre for Experimental Medicine and Rheumatology, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, UK.', 'INSERM ERI29/EA2216, reseau epigenetique and reseau canaux ioniques du Canceropole Grand Ouest, Brest University Medical School, Brest 29609, France.', 'Canalopathy and Calcium Signaling, INSERM UMR1078, Brest 29238, France.', 'INSERM ERI29/EA2216, reseau epigenetique and reseau canaux ioniques du Canceropole Grand Ouest, Brest University Medical School, Brest 29609, France.', 'INSERM ERI29/EA2216, reseau epigenetique and reseau canaux ioniques du Canceropole Grand Ouest, Brest University Medical School, Brest 29609, France.', 'Centre for Experimental and Molecular Medicine, Academic Medical Center, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'INSERM ERI29/EA2216, reseau epigenetique and reseau canaux ioniques du Canceropole Grand Ouest, Brest University Medical School, Brest 29609, France.', 'INSERM ERI29/EA2216, reseau epigenetique and reseau canaux ioniques du Canceropole Grand Ouest, Brest University Medical School, Brest 29609, France.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Immunotherapy, CHU Morvan, Brest 29609, France.', 'Institut Cochin, INSERM U567, Paris 75014, France.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Erasmus MC, Gravendijkwal 230, Rotterdam, 015 CE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Centre for Rheumatology, University College London, London WC1E 6JF, UK.', 'INSERM ERI29/EA2216, reseau epigenetique and reseau canaux ioniques du Canceropole Grand Ouest, Brest University Medical School, Brest 29609, France.', 'Canalopathy and Calcium Signaling, INSERM UMR1078, Brest 29238, France.', 'INSERM ERI29/EA2216, reseau epigenetique and reseau canaux ioniques du Canceropole Grand Ouest, Brest University Medical School, Brest 29609, France.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Immunotherapy, CHU Morvan, Brest 29609, France.', 'Centre for Experimental Medicine and Rheumatology, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160808,China,Cell Mol Immunol,Cellular & molecular immunology,101242872,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (TRPC Cation Channels)', '0 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member 1)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'TRPC Cation Channels/*metabolism', 'Transcriptome/genetics', '*Up-Regulation']",,,2016/08/09 06:00,2019/05/18 06:00,['2016/08/09 06:00'],"['2016/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['cmi201642 [pii]', '10.1038/cmi.2016.42 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Immunol. 2018 Feb;15(2):158-170. doi: 10.1038/cmi.2016.42.

These diseases are not curable as yet; therefore new agents for treatment and prevention are needed. Carotenoids are natural plant compounds with anti-carcinogenic activities. Peridinin is one of the most abundant carotenoids found in nature. Based on a series of past experiments, here we investigated the effects of peridinin extracted from Okinawan coral Isis hippuris on the proliferation and survival of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. The results of water-soluble tetrazolium-8 assay indicated that peridinin dose-dependently inhibits cell proliferation and viability of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. Flow cytometry showed that low concentration of peridinin induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, while higher concentration induced apoptosis. Peridinin caused cleavage of caspase-3, -8 and -9. Peridinin significantly reduced the expression of G1 cell cycle regulators, including cyclin D1, cyclin D2, CDK4, CDK6 and c-Myc, and anti-apoptotic proteins, including survivin, XIAP and Bcl-2, in a dose-dependent manner. Peridinin suppressed DNA binding of NF-kappaB. Peridinin inhibited phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, RelA, Akt and p70 S6 kinase, and reduced protein expression level of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1. Thus, peridinin exerts its anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects by suppressing NF-kappaB and Akt signaling in HTLV-1-infected T cells. Peridinin also reduced tumor growth in mice harboring ATL xenograft tumors. The results suggested that peridinin is a potentially suitable therapeutic agent against HTLV-1-associated diseases.","['Ishikawa, Chie', 'Jomori, Takahiro', 'Tanaka, Junichi', 'Senba, Masachika', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Ishikawa C', 'Jomori T', 'Tanaka J', 'Senba M', 'Mori N']","['Department of Microbiology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Biology and Marine Science, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa 903-0213, Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Biology and Marine Science, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa 903-0213, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8523, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160804,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['33281-81-1 (peridinin)', '36-88-4 (Carotenoids)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carotenoids/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/drug therapy/*pathology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, SCID', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2016/08/09 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/08/09 06:00'],"['2016/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2016.3648 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2016 Oct;49(4):1713-21. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2016.3648.

Furthermore, biallelic ATM alteration (HR: 6.4; p </= 0.007) was significantly associated with an increased risk of death similar to p53 deletion (HR: 6.1; p </= 0.004), superior to 11q deletion alone (HR: 2.8; p </= 0.022) and independent of other significant parameters such as age, advanced clinical stage, and complex karyotype.

We used precision nuclear run-on transcription sequencing (PRO-seq) to create high-resolution maps of active RNA polymerases across the genome in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as these polymerases are exceptionally sensitive to BET inhibitors. PRO-seq identified over 1,400 genes showing impaired release of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerases, including the stem cell factor receptor tyrosine kinase KIT that is mutated in t(8;21) AML. PRO-seq also identified an enhancer 3' to KIT. Chromosome conformation capture confirmed contacts between this enhancer and the KIT promoter, while CRISPRi-mediated repression of this enhancer impaired cell growth. PRO-seq also identified microRNAs, including MIR29C and MIR29B2, that target the anti-apoptotic factor MCL1 and were repressed by BET inhibitors. MCL1 protein was upregulated, and inhibition of BET proteins sensitized t(8:21)-containing cells to MCL1 inhibition, suggesting a potential mechanism of resistance to BET-inhibitor-induced cell death.","['Zhao, Yue', 'Liu, Qi', 'Acharya, Pankaj', 'Stengel, Kristy R', 'Sheng, Quanhu', 'Zhou, Xiaofan', 'Kwak, Hojoong', 'Fischer, Melissa A', 'Bradner, James E', 'Strickland, Stephen A', 'Mohan, Sanjay R', 'Savona, Michael R', 'Venters, Bryan J', 'Zhou, Ming-Ming', 'Lis, John T', 'Hiebert, Scott W']","['Zhao Y', 'Liu Q', 'Acharya P', 'Stengel KR', 'Sheng Q', 'Zhou X', 'Kwak H', 'Fischer MA', 'Bradner JE', 'Strickland SA', 'Mohan SR', 'Savona MR', 'Venters BJ', 'Zhou MM', 'Lis JT', 'Hiebert SW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Center for Quantitative Sciences, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Center for Quantitative Sciences, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37212, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA; Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA; Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA; Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Department of Structural and Chemical Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA; Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.

We identified nine independent studies accounting for 3090 subjects up to January 30, 2016. Summary odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were used to evaluate the risk of lymphoid malignancies.

Furthermore, ethnicity (Asian and Caucasian) and histopathology subgroup analyses (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) also failed to detect an association between the studied polymorphisms and lymphoid malignancy risk.

Since paclitaxel can activate mast cell and basophils, whereas quercetin, a polyphenolic flavonoid contained in various plants, which can specifically inhibit histamine release as a mast cell stabilizer. In this study we explore whether quercetin could ameliorate paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Quercetin inhibition on histamine release was validated in vitro by detecting histamine release from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells stimulated with paclitaxel (10 mumol/L). In the in vivo experiments, rats and mice received quercetin (20, 40 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)) for 40 and 12 d, respectively. Meanwhile, the animals were injected with paclitaxel (2 mg/kg, ip) four times on d 1, 3, 5 and 7. Heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia were evaluated at the different time points. The animals were euthanized and spinal cords and dorsal root ganglions were harvested for analyzing PKCepsilon and TRPV1 expression levels. The plasma histamine levels were assessed in rats on d 31. RESULTS: Pretreatment with quercetin (3, 10, 30 mumol/L) dose-dependently inhibited excessive histamine release from paclitaxel-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells in vitro, and quercetin administration significantly suppressed the high plasma histamine levels in paclitaxel-treated rats. Quercetin administration dose-dependently raised the thresholds for heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in paclitaxel-treated rats and mice. Furthermore, quercetin administration dose-dependently suppressed the increased expression levels of PKCepsilon and TRPV1 in the spinal cords and DRGs of paclitaxel-treated rats and mice. Moreover, quercetin administration may inhibited the translocation of PKCepsilon from the cytoplasm to the membrane in the spinal cord and DRG of paclitaxel-treated rats. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal the underlying mechanisms of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of quercetin for treating this side effect.","['Gao, Wei', 'Zan, Yan', 'Wang, Zai-Jie Jim', 'Hu, Xiao-Yu', 'Huang, Fang']","['Gao W', 'Zan Y', 'Wang ZJ', 'Hu XY', 'Huang F']","['Jiangsu Key Laboratory of TCM Evaluation and Translational Research, Department of Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of TCM Evaluation and Translational Research, Department of Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences and Cancer Center, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences and Cancer Center, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of TCM Evaluation and Translational Research, Department of Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160808,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (TRPV Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPV1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trpv1 protein, rat)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-epsilon)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ganglia, Spinal/drug effects/metabolism', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Neuralgia/chemically induced/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Protein Kinase C-epsilon/genetics/*metabolism', 'Quercetin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Spinal Cord/drug effects/metabolism', 'TRPV Cation Channels/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2016/08/09 06:00,2017/03/11 06:00,['2016/08/09 06:00'],"['2016/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['aps201658 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2016.58 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2016 Sep;37(9):1166-77. doi: 10.1038/aps.2016.58.

For example, it is sometimes necessary to alter the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia from the standard protocol. Genetic variation is one important factor, which can exert a wide range of effects on sensitivities and responses to therapeutic agents. Thiopurine S-methyl transferase (TPMT) is a useful test for predicting 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) sensitivity in Caucasians. However, it is not effective for predicting the 6-MP therapeutic responses of Japanese patients because the frequency of TPMT deficiency is lower in the Japanese population (approximately 1% versus approximately 10% in Caucasians). Recently, NUDT15 polymorphisms have been reported to be predictive factors contributing to responsiveness to thiopurine therapy in Asians.

However, questions remain about whether results studying other races are applicable to Japanese due to differences in genetic variant frequencies among races.

We aimed to ascertain the relationships between soluble CD25 (sIL-2R) and CD30 (sCD30) levels and nodal or extra-nodal involvement of ATL. Our study subjects were ATL patients whose sIL-2R and sCD30 levels were measured before initial therapy (n=32). Their sCD30 levels correlated significantly with the number of ATL cells in peripheral blood (PB) (rho=0.456; P=0.009), while sIL-2R levels correlated significantly with the number of nodal lesions (rho=0.660; P=0.001). We then also assessed the relationships of pulmonary lesions with the number of ATL cells in PB, lactate dehydrogenase levels, sIL-2R levels, and sCD30 levels in 24 patients whose pleural effusions and hilar lymphadenopathy were investigated before initial therapy. The results suggested that a high number of ATL cells in PB may be associated with pulmonary lesions. It is known that metalloproteinases shed and cleave cytokine receptors such as CD25 and CD30 from the cell surface as well as E-cadherin and extracellular matrix. It seems that serum levels of sIL-2R and sCD30 indicate the activation of metalloproteinases associated with ATL involvement in vivo.","['Takemoto, Shigeki', 'Pornkuna, Ratiorn', 'Hidaka, Michihiro', 'Kawano, Fumio']","['Takemoto S', 'Pornkuna R', 'Hidaka M', 'Kawano F']","['Clinical Laboratory, National Hospital Organization Kumamoto Medical Center.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*blood', 'Ki-1 Antigen/*blood', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis']",,,2016/08/09 06:00,2017/01/25 06:00,['2016/08/09 06:00'],"['2016/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.57.848 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2016 Jul;57(7):848-53. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.57.848.,10.11406/rinketsu.57.848 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the link between leukemia cells and their environment is still poorly understood. In our study, runtrelated transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) was identified as a novel target gene affected by As2O3 and involved in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)mediated protection of leukemia cells from As2O3induced apoptosis. We observed induction of RUNX3 expression and the translocation of RUNX3 into the nucleus after As2O3 treatment in leukemia cells. In K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells, downregulation of endogenous RUNX3 compromised As2O3induced growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. In the presence of MSC, As2O3induced expression of RUNX3 was reduced significantly and this reduction was modulated by CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling. Furthermore, overexpression of RUNX3 restored, at least in part, the sensitivity of leukemic cells to As2O3. We conclude that RUNX3 plays an important role in As2O3induced cellular responses and allows cells to overcome MSCmediated drug resistance. Therefore, RUNX3 is a promising target for therapeutic approaches to overcome MSCmediated drug resistance.","['Pan, Guo-Zheng', 'Zhai, Feng-Xian', 'Lu, Yin', 'Fang, Zhi-Gang', 'Fan, Rui-Fang', 'Liu, Xiang-Fu', 'Lin, Dong-Jun']","['Pan GZ', 'Zhai FX', 'Lu Y', 'Fang ZG', 'Fan RF', 'Liu XF', 'Lin DJ']","['Renal Transplantation Center, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, Anhui 230001, P.R.

Understanding the nature of cognitive dysfunction during adulthood in ALL survivors is important as it has an impact on major life situations. Thirty-eight (21 women) ALL survivors were investigated 34 years after diagnosis. Median-age was 38 (27-46) years. All were treated with a CRT dose of 24Gy and 11 years (3-13) of complete hormone supplementation. Comparisons were made to 29 matched controls. Assessments of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (white and grey matter metabolic alterations), brain volume and neuropsychological tests were performed. ALL survivors demonstrate a generally lower performance in neuropsychological tests. ALL survivors scored lower than controls in vocabulary (p<0.001), memory (p<0.001), learning capacity (p<0.001), spatial ability (p<0.001), executive functions and attention (p<0.001) 34 years after ALL treatment.

There was a significantly negative correlation of years since ALL diagnosis to WM NAA+NAAG/Cr (r=-0.4, p=0.04) in ALL survivors. The present study shows impaired brain metabolism detected by MRS, reduced brain volumes and neurocognitive impairment in childhood ALL survivors treated with cranial radiotherapy and chemotherapy, despite complete hormone substitution. We also report an impairment of metabolites correlated to time since treatment and a progressive impairment in sustained attention, suggesting an accelerated aging in the irradiated brain. Following these survivors many decades, or throughout life, after treatment with cranial radiotherapy and chemotherapy is highly warranted for a broader understanding of long-term outcome in this patient group.","['Follin, Cecilia', 'Erfurth, Eva Marie', 'Johansson, Aki', 'Latt, Jimmy', 'Sundgren, Pia C', 'Osterberg, Kai', 'Spulber, Gabriella', 'Mannfolk, Peter', 'Bjorkman-Burtscher, Isabella M']","['Follin C', 'Erfurth EM', 'Johansson A', 'Latt J', 'Sundgren PC', 'Osterberg K', 'Spulber G', 'Mannfolk P', 'Bjorkman-Burtscher IM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Skane University Hospital and IKVL, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

Previous studies demonstrated that C8 induced apoptosis and autophagy in human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells.

In this study, the molecular mechanism of C8 on human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells was investigated. The results showed that C8 inhibited the growth of HeLa cells and triggered both apoptotic and autophagic cell death. Subsequent experiment also indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was induced in C8-treated HeLa cells. Since ROS scavenger decreased the ratio of apoptotic and autophagic cells, ROS generation contributed to C8-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Furthermore, inhibitors of apoptosis and autophagy also reduced ROS generation, respectively. Autophagy inhibition increased cell growth compared to C8-treated group and attenuated apoptotic cell death, indicating that C8-induced autophagy promoted apoptosis for cell death. However, the percentage of autophagic cells was enhanced when limiting apoptosis process. Taken together, C8 induced ROS-mediated apoptosis and autophagy in HeLa cells, autophagy promoted apoptosis but the former was antagonized by the latter.

METHODS: Thirty male rats were randomly divided into normal control, diabetic model and SFN treatment groups (N = 10 in each group). Streptozotocin (STZ) was applied to establish diabetic model. Water Morris maze task was applied to test learning and memory. Tunel assaying was used to detect apoptosis in hippocampus. The expressions of Caspase-3 and myeloid cell leukemia 1(MCL-1) were detected by western blotting. Neurotrophic factor levels and AKT/GSK3beta pathway were also detected. RESULTS: Compared with normal control, learning and memory were apparently impaired, with up-regulation of Caspase-3 and down-regulation of MCL-1 in diabetic rats. Apoptotic neurons were also found in CA1 region after diabetic modeling. By contrast, SFN treatment prevented the memory impairment, decreased the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. SFN also attenuated the abnormal expression of Caspase-3 and MCL-1 in diabetic model. Mechanically, SFN treatment reversed diabetic modeling-induced decrease of p-Akt, p-GSK3beta, NGF and BDNF expressions. CONCLUSION: SFN could prevent the memory impairment and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons in diabetic rat. The possible mechanism was related to the regulation of neurotropic factors and Akt/GSK3beta pathway.","['Wang, Gengyin', 'Fang, Hui', 'Zhen, Yanfeng', 'Xu, Gang', 'Tian, Jinli', 'Zhang, Yazhong', 'Zhang, Dandan', 'Zhang, Guyue', 'Xu, Jing', 'Zhang, Zhiyue', 'Qiu, Mingyue', 'Ma, Yijia', 'Zhang, Hongrui', 'Zhang, Xinxin']","['Wang G', 'Fang H', 'Zhen Y', 'Xu G', 'Tian J', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang D', 'Zhang G', 'Xu J', 'Zhang Z', 'Qiu M', 'Ma Y', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang X']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160809,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, rat)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', '5W494URQ81 (Streptozocin)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'GA49J4310U (sulforaphane)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Cognitive Dysfunction/physiopathology/*prevention & control', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/chemically induced/*drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology', 'Drug Repositioning', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Hippocampus/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Maze Learning/drug effects', 'Memory/*drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Neurons/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Streptozocin', 'Sulfoxides']",,,2016/08/09 06:00,2017/02/06 06:00,['2016/08/08 06:00'],"['2016/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['000447799 [pii]', '10.1159/000447799 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2016;39(3):901-7. doi: 10.1159/000447799.

Our aim was to study Auger electron radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with (111)In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 in non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice or NOD-Rag1(null)IL2rgamma(null) (NRG) mice engrafted with CD123(+) human AML-5 cells. METHODS: The toxicity of three doses of (111)In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 (3.3-4.8MBq; 11-15mug each) injected i.v. every two weeks was studied in non-engrafted NOD/SCID or NRG mice pre-treated with 200cGy of gamma-radiation required for AML engraftment. Engraftment efficiency of (1-5)x10(6) cells AML-5 cells inoculated i.v. into NOD/SCID or NRG mice was assessed by flow cytometric analysis for human CD45(+) (hCD45(+)) cells in the bone marrow (BM) and spleen. AML-5 engrafted mice were treated with two or three doses (3.7MBq; 10mug each) every two weeks of (111)In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360, non-specific (111)In-DTPA-NLS-hIgG, unlabeled CSL360 (10mug) or normal saline. The percentage of hCD45(+) cells in the BM and spleen were measured at one week after completion of treatment. RESULTS: (111)In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 in combination with 200cGy of gamma-radiation caused an initial transient decrease in body weight in NOD/SCID but not in NRG mice. There were no hematological, liver or kidney toxicities. The spleen exhibited 13-fold lower engraftment efficiency than the BM in NOD/SCID mice inoculated with 1x10(6) cells but both organs were highly (>85%) engrafted in NRG mice. Unexpectedly, (111)In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 or non-specific (111)In-DTPA-NLS-hIgG caused a paradoxical 1.5-fold increase (P<0.0001) in the proportion of hCD45(+) cells in the BM of NOD/SCID mice compared to normal saline treated mice. (111)In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 reduced hCD45(+) cells in the spleen by 3.0-fold compared to (111)In-DTPA-NLS-hIgG (P=0.0015) but the proportion of hCD45(+) cells was not significantly different than in normal saline treated mice. Unlabeled CSL360 decreased the percentage of hCD45(+) cells in the BM (P=0.004) or spleen (P=0.007) in NOD/SCID mice by 1.6-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively. (111)In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 or unlabeled CSL360 did not decrease the proportion of hCD45(+) cells in the BM or spleen of NRG mice, due to a much higher leukemic burden. CONCLUSION: (111)In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 and (111)In-DTPA-NLS-hIgG caused a paradoxical increase in the proportion of hCD45(+) cells in the BM of NOD/SCID mice. This may be due to a priming effect on the BM niche that promotes expansion of engrafted hCD45(+) cells, analogous to gamma-radiation required for AML engraftment. There appears to be a competition between this effect and the cytotoxic effects of the Auger electrons on leukemia cells. The effectiveness of (111)In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 on reducing hCD45(+) cells in the BM or spleen of NOD/SCID and NRG mice was dependent on the leukemic burden. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE: This study demonstrates for the first time a paradoxical radiation priming effect of RIT on enhancing the hCD45(+) cell population in the BM and spleen of NOD/SCID or NRG mice. Our results have important implications for preclinical evaluation of radioimmunotherapies for patients with AML.","['Bergstrom, Dane', 'Leyton, Jeffrey V', 'Zereshkian, Arman', 'Chan, Conrad', 'Cai, Zhongli', 'Reilly, Raymond M']","['Bergstrom D', 'Leyton JV', 'Zereshkian A', 'Chan C', 'Cai Z', 'Reilly RM']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Departement de Medecine Nucleaire et de Radiobiologie, Universite de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Medical Imaging, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Toronto General Research Institute and Joint Department of Medical Imaging, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.

Double strand breaks (DSB) lesions are the most severe type of DNA damage in HSCs, which, if not properly repaired, might contribute to the development of chromosomal abnormalities, which in turn may lead to leukemia development.

However, little is known of haematopoietic neoplasms associated with 11q23 translocation but without MLL rearrangement (11q23+/MLL-). The aim of this study is to characterise such cases with 11q23+/MLL-. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively searched our database for cases with haematopoietic malignancies with 11q23+/MLL-. We identified nine patients, two with AML, two with B-lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL); two with T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), two with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and one with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). The translocations included t(X;11)(p11.2;q23), t(2;11)(p21;q23), t(6;11)(q27;q23), t(8;9;11)(q13;q13;q23), t(11;11)(p15;q23), t(11;14)(q23;q24) and t(11;15)(q23;q14). Five of six patients with acute leukaemia had received chemotherapy and detection of 11q23 translocation occurred at time of disease relapse. Both patients with MDS and the patient with CMML had 11q23 translocation detected at time of initial diagnosis, all three patients progressed to AML after >1 year on hypomethylating agent therapy. All patients received risk-adapted therapies, including stem cell transplant in five patients. At the last follow-up, eight patients died with a median overall survival of 14 months. CONCLUSIONS: 11q23+/MLL- occurs rarely, involving different partner chromosomes and showing clinical and pathological features and disease subtypes different from those cases with MLL rearrangement. 11q23+/MLL- appears to be associated with clonal evolution/disease progression in acute leukaemia, a high risk for AML progression in MDS/CMML and a high incidence of disease relapse.","['Zuo, Wenli', 'Wang, Sa A', 'DiNardo, Courtney', 'Yabe, Mariko', 'Li, Shaoying', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Tang, Guilin']","['Zuo W', 'Wang SA', 'DiNardo C', 'Yabe M', 'Li S', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Tang G']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University Affiliated Cancer Hospital/Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160805,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['CYTOGENETICS', 'HAEMATOPATHOLOGY', 'LEUKAEMIA', 'MYELODYSPLASIA']",2016/08/09 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00,['2016/08/07 06:00'],"['2016/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['jclinpath-2016-203831 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2016-203831 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2017 Mar;70(3):244-249. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2016-203831.

An alternative approach is to use fewer animals per tumor line, allowing a greater number of models that capture greater molecular/genetic heterogeneity of the cancer type. We retrospectively analyzed 67 agents evaluated by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program to determine whether a single mouse, chosen randomly from each group of a study, predicted the median response for groups of mice using 83 xenograft models. The individual tumor response from a randomly chosen mouse was compared with the group median response using established response criteria. A total of 2,134 comparisons were made. The single tumor response accurately predicted the group median response in 1,604 comparisons (75.16%). The mean tumor response correct prediction rate for 1,000 single mouse random samples was 78.09%. Models had a range for correct prediction (60%-87.5%). Allowing for misprediction of +/- one response category, the overall mean correct single mouse prediction rate was 95.28%, and predicted overall objective response rates for group data in 66 of 67 drug studies. For molecularly targeted agents, occasional exceptional responder models were identified and the activity of that agent confirmed in additional models with the same genotype. Assuming that large treatment effects are targeted, this alternate experimental design has similar predictive value as traditional approaches, allowing for far greater numbers of models to be used that more fully encompass the heterogeneity of disease types.

DESIGN: Open-label, single-center, prospective pharmacokinetic study. SETTING: National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center. PATIENTS: Nine adults with hematologic malignancies or hematopoietic cell transplants who had febrile neutropenia and were admitted to a hematology-oncology service between January and July 2014. INTERVENTION: Patients received empirical cefepime 2 g every 8 hours, administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion, for febrile neutropenia. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Steady-state cefepime serum concentrations were measured after at least 2 days of continuous therapy. Venous blood samples were intensively sampled between 0 and 8 hours after the start of the 30-minute infusion at steady state. Seven of the nine patients had a hematologic malignancy diagnosis of acute leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma, and two patients had a germ cell tumor diagnosis. Noncompartmental analysis revealed mean +/- SD parameters as follows at steady state: area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0-8 hours 222.9 +/- 72.9 mg hour/L, maximum concentration 120.9 +/- 21.8 mg/L, clearance 9.7 +/- 3.7 L/hour, apparent volume of distribution 19.2 +/- 4.65 L, and elimination half-life 1.4 +/- 0.3 hours. A one-compartment pharmacokinetic model identified a mean +/- SD volume of distribution of 20.9 +/- 1.3 L and an elimination rate constant of 0.39 +/- 0.03 hour(-1) . The mean estimated percentage of time that drug concentration remains above the pathogen minimum inhibitory concentration (fT>MIC) in serum was 55%, 77%, and 99% at MICs of 16, 8, and 4 mg/L, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with hematologic malignancies or hematopoietic cell transplants who had febrile neutropenia demonstrated homogeneous calculated cefepime volumes and clearances. The population parameters presented in this study may aid in the calculation of patient-specific fT>MIC for similar patients.","['Whited, Laura', 'Grove, Meagan', 'Rose, Dusten', 'Rhodes, Nathaniel J', 'Scheetz, Marc H', ""O'Donnell, J Nicholas"", 'Neeb, Jessica', 'Thoele, Kelli', 'Jones, David R', 'Lowe, Christopher', 'Moore, Dawn', 'Kiel, Patrick J']","['Whited L', 'Grove M', 'Rose D', 'Rhodes NJ', 'Scheetz MH', ""O'Donnell JN"", 'Neeb J', 'Thoele K', 'Jones DR', 'Lowe C', 'Moore D', 'Kiel PJ']","['Indiana University Simon Cancer Center-Indiana University Health, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Indiana University Simon Cancer Center-Indiana University Health, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Indiana University Simon Cancer Center-Indiana University Health, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Midwestern University Chicago College of Pharmacy, Downers Grove, Illinois.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Midwestern University Chicago College of Pharmacy, Downers Grove, Illinois.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Midwestern University Chicago College of Pharmacy, Downers Grove, Illinois.', 'Indiana University Simon Cancer Center-Indiana University Health, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Indiana University Simon Cancer Center-Indiana University Health, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Indiana University Simon Cancer Center-Indiana University Health, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Indiana University Simon Cancer Center-Indiana University Health, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Indiana University Simon Cancer Center-Indiana University Health, Indianapolis, Indiana. pkiel@iuhealth.org.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana. pkiel@iuhealth.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160906,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Cephalosporins)', '807PW4VQE3 (Cefepime)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cefepime', 'Cephalosporins/*pharmacokinetics', 'Febrile Neutropenia/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*metabolism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Prospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['*cefepime', '*hematology', '*infectious disease', '*neutropenia', '*oncology', '*pharmacokinetics', '*transplant']",2016/08/09 06:00,2017/09/20 06:00,['2016/08/07 06:00'],"['2016/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/phar.1807 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2016 Sep;36(9):1003-10. doi: 10.1002/phar.1807.

The absence of skin lesions may delay timely diagnosis and treatment of varicella for those patients. Furthermore, abdominal imaging findings to provide information to diagnose visceral varicella have rarely been reported. Varicella was diagnosed in a 5-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia complaining of fever and abdominal pain followed by papulovesicular skin lesions. Later, the patient was found to have rapidly progressive acute hepatitis, and abdominal computed tomography showed multiple hypodense hepatic nodules. The patient was treated with intravenous acyclovir, intravenous immunoglobulin, and empirical antibiotic and antifungal therapy. However, his fever and abdominal pain persisted, and a laparoscopic liver biopsy was performed to differentiate other causes of the persisting symptoms. Eventually, the patient was diagnosed with visceral varicella based on histopathologic findings. In conclusion, visceral varicella should be considered in immunocompromised patients with abdominal pain and multiple hypodense hepatic nodules on abdominal imaging studies. However, bacteria, fungi, and tuberculosis can produce similar imaging findings; therefore, a biopsy may be necessary in patients not responding to antiviral therapy.","['Han, Seung Beom', 'Seo, Young Eun', 'Kim, Seong-Koo', 'Lee, Jae Wook', 'Lee, Dong-Gun', 'Chung, Nack-Gyun', 'Cho, Bin', 'Kang, Jin Han', 'Kim, Hack-Ki', 'Jung, Eun Sun']","['Han SB', 'Seo YE', 'Kim SK', 'Lee JW', 'Lee DG', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B', 'Kang JH', 'Kim HK', 'Jung ES']","['Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

For older patients and those lacking a related HLA-compatible donor, autologous transplantation (auto-HSCT) is a valid alternative therapeutic option. METHODS: From 1997 until 2014 in the Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Poland, 29 auto-HSCT were performed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 15 men and 14 women; median age, 52.2 years). The following FAB types of AML were diagnosed: M0, 3; M1, 4; M2, 6; M4, 10; and M5, 6. Patients with AML were classified into 3 cytogenetic prognostic groups: high risk, 9; intermediate risk, 16; and low risk, 4. Twenty-five were in first complete remission and 4 in second complete remission. The peripheral HSCs mobilized after chemotherapy (mainly second course of consolidation) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were the source of the stem cells in all cases. The median number of infused CD34+ cells was 3.58 x 10(6)/kg. The conditioning regimen was busulfan and cyclophosphamide in all patients with AML. The intravenous form of busulfan was applied in the last 15 patients. RESULTS: The median time for absolute neutrophil count recovery >0.5 x 10(9)/L and for platelet count >20.0 x 10(9)/L was 12 and 16.5 days, respectively. Treatment-related mortality rate in the whole group was 3.4% (1 patient with sepsis in the aplastic period). The median follow-up time of survivors was 21.9 months (range, 11.7-142.4).

There are very few treatment modalities for this indications. Therefore, there is a need for novel effective therapies and even more for the prevention of relapse. There are scarce data that azacitidine can be used for these purposes. METHODS: At the Polish Adult Leukemia Group, we retrospectively analyzed the results of azacitidine treatment after alloHSCT. Relapsing patients, patients with minimal residual disease/mixed chimerism, and patients in complete remission with high risk of relapse were analyzed separately. There were 17 patients, 6 with myelodysplastic syndrome, 11 with acute myeloid leukemia, 8 male, and overall median age of 56 years (range, 15-78); 7 patients received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). RESULTS: Patients treated because of relapse received a median of 3 (range, 1-6) cycles of azacitidine, patients receiving preemptive treatment received a median of 4 cycles (range, 2-6), and those on maintenance received a median of 5 cycles (range, 3-5). Toxicity was considerable, especially in relapse-neutropenia (67%), anemia (67%), thrombocytopenia (100%), serious infections (78%)-and preemptive settings. Median overall survival of patients treated for relapse reached 6.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-infinity), with better survival observed in patients with temporary disease control (7.7 vs 4.7 mo) and without previous exposure to azacitidine (7.7 vs 3.4 mo). One-year overall survival reached 75% (95% CI, 13%-96%) for preemptive and 50% (95% CI, 0%-91%) for maintenance treatment. DLI did not aggravate graft-versus-host disease. CONCLUSIONS: Effectiveness of azacitidine in relapsing patients is disappointing. Azacitidine seems to be promising in preemptive and maintenance settings. Toxicity is considerable. Further research is needed.","['Drozd-Sokolowska, J', 'Gil, L', 'Waszczuk-Gajda, A', 'Madry, K', 'Piekarska, A', 'Dutka, M', 'Basak, G W', 'Karakulska-Prystupiuk, E', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek, J']","['Drozd-Sokolowska J', 'Gil L', 'Waszczuk-Gajda A', 'Madry K', 'Piekarska A', 'Dutka M', 'Basak GW', 'Karakulska-Prystupiuk E', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek J']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Internal Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.

Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the frequency of rhinosinusitis, the impact of rhinosinusitis on post-alloHSCT outcome, and to analyze risk factors potentially predisposing to rhinosinusitis. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of acute leukemia patients undergoing alloHSCT. RESULTS: A total of 87 patients (49 male), with a median age of 36 years (range, 18-58), transplanted from 1999 to 2010, were enrolled; 61 patients suffered from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 26 of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Fifteen patients (17.2%) experienced rhinosinusitis before transplantation, among whom 5 (33%) experienced rhinosinusitis after alloHSCT; 22 patients (25.3%), 12 AML and 10 ALL, experienced rhinosinusitis after alloHSCT. The median time to rhinosinusitis was 200 days (range, 1-2,044). 11 patients experienced rhinosinusitis during the 1st 100 days after transplantation, 8 during the 1st 30 days. Post-alloHSCT rhinosinusitis did not affect overall survival of transplant patients (P = .35). In univariate analysis only total body irradiation as part of conditioning (odds ratio [OR], 2.78; 95% CI, 1-7.77) and previous nasal packing (OR, 5.18; 95% CI, 1.22-23.43) were associated with higher incidence of rhinosinusitis. In multivariate analysis, none of the analyzed parameters was shown to have an impact on rhinosinusitis development. CONCLUSIONS: Rhinosinusitis is a frequent medical condition in patients undergoing alloHSCT. The overall survival of patients developing rhinosinusitis after HSCT is similar to survival of patients who do not. No risk factors for developing rhinosinusitis could be identified.","['Drozd-Sokolowska, J', 'Sokolowski, J', 'Biecek, P', 'Niemczyk, K', 'Basak, G W', 'Wiktor-Jedrzejczak, W']","['Drozd-Sokolowska J', 'Sokolowski J', 'Biecek P', 'Niemczyk K', 'Basak GW', 'Wiktor-Jedrzejczak W']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Internal Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.

Following years brought the 1st autologous stem cell transplantations. Ten years later, unrelated bone marrow transplantation was performed for the 1st time by the team of the Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation Unit in Katowice. Since then, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation developed to be standard procedure and one of the most important therapies applied in leukemia treatment. The number of allotransplantations in Poland has grown significantly in the past 2 decades, which generated new needs and problems. In 2005, based on a new Transplant Law, a National Transplants Registry was created. Its main role is to collect data (registration of procedures and follow-up data) related to every transplantation case for stem cells and tissues as well as for organs. We present statistics concerning stem cell transplantations performed in Poland, as collected in the National Transplants Registry in the years 2006-2014. There are 18 centers transplanting hematopoietic stem cells in Poland. The total number of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations performed in 2006-2014 was 3,537, with allotransplantations from relatives accounted for 1,491 and from unrelated donors for 2,046. The main indication for allotransplantation in past years was acute leukemia.","['Leczycka, A', 'Dudkiewicz, M', 'Czerwinski, J', 'Malanowski, P', 'Zalikowska-Holowenko, J', 'Danielewicz, R']","['Leczycka A', 'Dudkiewicz M', 'Czerwinski J', 'Malanowski P', 'Zalikowska-Holowenko J', 'Danielewicz R']","['Polish Transplant Coordinating Center (Poltransplant), Warsaw, Poland.', 'Polish Transplant Coordinating Center (Poltransplant), Warsaw, Poland; Department of Experimental Design and Bioinformatics, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Warsaw, Poland.

We report the clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular features of a case of donor-derived T-LGL leukemia in a 16-year-old man who received allogeneic SCT for peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS). The patient presented with persistent neutropenia and splenomegaly 9 months after SCT when the chimerism study showed a 100% donor pattern. A splenectomy revealed T-LGL leukemia. Flow cytometric analysis showed an aberrant T-cell population positive for CD3, CD5 (dim, subset), CD7, CD8, CD16 (subset), CD57, CD94 (dim, partial), and T-cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta, and negative for CD4, CD26, CD56, and TCRgammadelta. Molecular studies showed monoclonal TCRbeta and TCRgamma gene rearrangements. Both the immunophenotype and molecular profile of the T-LGL leukemia were different from the pre-SCT PTCL. Sequencing analysis for STAT3 exon 21 did not reveal any mutation in both pre-SCT and post-SCT specimens. The patient did not receive any treatment for T-LGL leukemia; however, his count progressively increased after splenectomy, despite the presence of persistent T-LGL leukemia in the bone marrow.

Trephinobiopsy specimens of the ileac bone, aspirated specimens of the bone marrow, and peripheral blood smears were studied in 80 patients. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was associated with myelofibrosis of different severity in 22.5% cases. Morphometric analysis of trephinobiopsy specimens showed that the severity (histology and dissemination) of myelofibrosis correlated with the type of tumor involvement of the bone marrow. Focal tumor involvement of the bone marrow predominated in trephinobiopsy specimens from patients without myelofibrosis, while patients with myelofibrosis developed mainly diffuse tumor infiltration, associated with the greatest dissemination of the initial and manifest myelofibrosis.

The term MPN is mostly used for classical BCR-ABL-negative (myeloproliferative disorder) (ET, PV, PMF). These are clonal diseases resulting from the transformation of an hematopoietic stem cell and leading to an abnormal production of myeloid cells. The genetic defects responsible for the myeloproliferative abnormalities are called << driver >> mutations and all result in deregulation of the cytokine receptor / JAK2 / STAT axis. Among them, JAK2, the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) and calreticulin (CALR) mutations are found in around 90% of the cases. These driver MPN mutations can be associated with other driver mutations also found in other hematological malignancies, especially in PMFs. These are chronic diseases with major risks being thrombosis, hemorrhage and cytopenias for PMF and the long-term progression to myelofibrosis and the transformation to leukemia. Most recent therapeutic have focused on targeting the JAK2 signaling pathway directly by inhibitors of JAK2 or indirectly.

Nevertheless, the effects of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors on T lymphocytes, a key component of immune responses, have been seldom explored. In this study we investigated the effects on human CD4+ T-cells of a panel of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors: BGT226, Torin-2, MK-2206, and ZSTK474. We also assessed their efficacy against two acute leukemia T cell lines. T lymphocytes were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. Inhibitor effects on cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry, while cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assays. In addition, the activation status of the pathway as well as induction of autophagy were analyzed by Western blotting. Quiescent healthy T lymphocytes were unaffected by the drugs whereas mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes as well as leukemic cell lines displayed a cell cycle block, caspase-dependent apoptosis, and dephosphorylation of key components of the signaling pathway. Autophagy was also induced in proliferating lymphocytes and in JURKAT and MOLT-4 cell lines. When autophagy was inhibited by 3-methyladenine or Bafilomycin A1, drug cytotoxicity was increased, indicating that autophagy is a protective mechanism. Therefore, our findings suggest that PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors preserve lymphocyte viability. This is a valuable result to be taken into account when selecting drugs for targeted cancer therapy in order to minimize detrimental effects on immune function.","['Alameen, Ayman A M', 'Simioni, Carolina', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Zauli, Giorgio', 'Ultimo, Simona', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Gonelli, Arianna', 'Marisi, Giorgia', 'Ulivi, Paola', 'Capitani, Silvano', 'Neri, Luca M']","['Alameen AA', 'Simioni C', 'Martelli AM', 'Zauli G', 'Ultimo S', 'McCubrey JA', 'Gonelli A', 'Marisi G', 'Ulivi P', 'Capitani S', 'Neri LM']","['Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Biosciences Laboratory, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy.', 'Biosciences Laboratory, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'LTTA Center, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0', '(8-(6-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-3-methyl-1-(4-piperazin-1-yl-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-', '1,3-dihydroimidazo(4,5-c)quinolin-2-one)', '0', '(9-(6-aminopyridin-3-yl)-1-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)benzo(h)(1,6)naphthyridin-2', '(1H)-one)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Naphthyridines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Autophagy/drug effects', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Naphthyridines/pharmacology', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",['NOTNLM'],"['PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling', 'T lymphocytes', 'T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'autophagy', 'targeted therapies']",2016/08/06 06:00,2018/02/06 06:00,['2016/08/06 06:00'],"['2016/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10984 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10984 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 23;7(34):55690-55703. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10984.,10.18632/oncotarget.10984 [doi],,,,,PMC5342446,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consistently, p66Shc deficiency contributes to the survival and trafficking abnormalities of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells. The mechanism of p66shc silencing in CLL B cells is methylation-independent, at variance with other cancer cell types. Here we identify STAT4 as a novel transcriptional regulator of p66Shc in B cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter gene assays showed that STAT4 binds to and activates the p66shc promoter. Silencing or overexpression of STAT4 resulted in a co-modulation of p66Shc. IL-12-dependent STAT4 activation caused a coordinate increase in STAT4 and p66Shc expression, which correlated with enhanced B cell apoptosis. Treatment with the STAT4 inhibitor lisofylline reverted partly this effect, suggesting that STAT4 phosphorylation is not essential for but enhances p66shc transcription. Additionally, we demonstrate that CLL B lymphocytes have a STAT4 expression defect which partly accounts for their p66Shc deficiency, as supported by reconstitution experiments. Finally, we show that p66Shc participates in a positive feedback loop to promote STAT4 expression. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of p66Shc expression in B cells and its defect in CLL, identifying the STAT4/IL-12 pathway as a potential therapeutic target in this neoplasia.","['Cattaneo, Francesca', 'Patrussi, Laura', 'Capitani, Nagaja', 'Frezzato, Federica', ""D'Elios, Mario Milco"", 'Trentin, Livio', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Baldari, Cosima T']","['Cattaneo F', 'Patrussi L', 'Capitani N', 'Frezzato F', ""D'Elios MM"", 'Trentin L', 'Semenzato G', 'Baldari CT']","['Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (SHC1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT4 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT4 protein, human)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', 'L1F2Q2X956 (lisofylline)', 'SD6QCT3TSU (Pentoxifylline)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pentoxifylline/analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'STAT4 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1/*metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'STAT4', 'lisofylline', 'p66Shc', 'transcriptional regulation']",2016/08/06 06:00,2018/02/24 06:00,['2016/08/06 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10977 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10977 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 30;7(35):57086-57098. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10977.,10.18632/oncotarget.10977 [doi],,,,,PMC5302975,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conformational studies, by means of CD and NMR spectroscopies, showed that the H3 wt peptide was partially endowed with an alpha-helical structure, but the AML-sequences exhibited a lower content of this conformation, particularly the H3 mutA peptide. Thioflavin T assays showed that the H3 mutE and the H3 mutA peptides displayed a significant aggregation propensity that was confirmed by CD and DLS assays. In addition, we found that the H3 mutE and H3 mutA peptides, unlike the H3 wt, were moderately and highly toxic, respectively, when exposed to human neuroblastoma cells. Cellular localization experiments confirmed that the mutated sequences hamper their nucleolar accumulation, and more importantly, that the helical conformation of the H3 region is crucial for such a localization.","['Scognamiglio, Pasqualina Liana', 'Di Natale, Concetta', 'Leone, Marilisa', 'Cascella, Roberta', 'Cecchi, Cristina', 'Lirussi, Lisa', 'Antoniali, Giulia', 'Riccardi, Domenico', 'Morelli, Giancarlo', 'Tell, Gianluca', 'Chiti, Fabrizio', 'Marasco, Daniela']","['Scognamiglio PL', 'Di Natale C', 'Leone M', 'Cascella R', 'Cecchi C', 'Lirussi L', 'Antoniali G', 'Riccardi D', 'Morelli G', 'Tell G', 'Chiti F', 'Marasco D']","['Department of Pharmacy, CIRPEB: Centro Interuniversitario di Ricerca sui Peptidi Bioattivi-University of Naples ""Federico II"", DFM-Scarl, 80134, Naples, Italy.', 'Permanent address: Center for Advanced Biomaterials for Health Care@CRIB Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, 80125, Napoli, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, CIRPEB: Centro Interuniversitario di Ricerca sui Peptidi Bioattivi-University of Naples ""Federico II"", DFM-Scarl, 80134, Naples, Italy.', 'Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging - CNR, 80134, Naples, Italy.', 'Section of Biochemistry, Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, 50134, Florence, Italy.', 'Section of Biochemistry, Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, 50134, Florence, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology and DNA repair, Department of Medical and Biological Sciences, University of Udine, 33100, Udine, Italy.', 'Permanent address: Department of Clinical Molecular Biology, University of Oslo and Akershus University Hospital, Nordbyhagen, 1474, Norway.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology and DNA repair, Department of Medical and Biological Sciences, University of Udine, 33100, Udine, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, CIRPEB: Centro Interuniversitario di Ricerca sui Peptidi Bioattivi-University of Naples ""Federico II"", DFM-Scarl, 80134, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, CIRPEB: Centro Interuniversitario di Ricerca sui Peptidi Bioattivi-University of Naples ""Federico II"", DFM-Scarl, 80134, Naples, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology and DNA repair, Department of Medical and Biological Sciences, University of Udine, 33100, Udine, Italy.', 'Section of Biochemistry, Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, 50134, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, CIRPEB: Centro Interuniversitario di Ricerca sui Peptidi Bioattivi-University of Naples ""Federico II"", DFM-Scarl, 80134, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Protein Aggregation, Pathological', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Transport']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CD spectroscopy', 'aggregation phenomena', 'helical peptides']",2016/08/06 06:00,2018/01/30 06:00,['2016/08/06 06:00'],"['2015/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10991 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10991 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 13;7(37):59129-59143. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10991.,10.18632/oncotarget.10991 [doi],,,,,PMC5312300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) are established by the transfer of primary tumor cells directly from patients into immunodeficient mice and can provide primary-like tumor cells of the amount needed at the desired time. We developed a high-throughput drug screening system using PDX cells and performed drug screening using the PDX cells of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). We established four Ph+ ALL PDX mice and performed high-throughput screening of 3440 compounds using leukemia cells from the PDX mice (PDX-cell screening). The profiles of drugs selected by PDX-cell screening were markedly different from those by screening using the Ph+ ALL cell line. We found that verteporfin, an FDA-approved drug, exhibited strong PDX cell-specific cytotoxicity. In the validation assay, its GI50 was 228 nM, 395 nM, and 538 nM in three PDX cells and 3.93 microM, 2.11 microM, and 5.61 microM in three cell lines. Although verteporfin is a photosensitizer activated by photoirradiation, its cytotoxic effects were mediated by the light-independent production of reactive oxygen species; therefore, its anti-leukemic effects were also exerted in vivo without photoirradiation. Furthermore, it exhibited synergistic effects with dasatinib, an ABL kinase inhibitor.

Despite the fact that PTCLs comprise the majority of T-cell malignancies, the standard of care is poorly established. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) immunotherapy has shown in B-cell malignancies to be an effective curative option and this extends promise into treating T-cell malignancies. Because PTCLS frequently develop from mature T-cells, CD3 is similarly strongly and uniformly expressed in many PTCL malignancies, with expression specific to the hematological compartment thus making it an attractive target for CAR design. We engineered a robust 3rd generation anti-CD3 CAR construct (CD3CAR) into an NK cell line (NK-92). We found that CD3CAR NK-92 cells specifically and potently lysed diverse CD3+ human PTCL primary samples as well as T-cell leukemia cells lines ex vivo. Furthermore, CD3CAR NK-92 cells effectively controlled and suppressed Jurkat tumor cell growth in vivo and significantly prolonged survival. In this study, we present the CAR directed targeting of a novel target - CD3 using CAR modified NK-92 cells with an emphasis on efficacy, specificity, and potential for new therapeutic approaches that could improve the current standard of care for PTCLs.","['Chen, Kevin H', 'Wada, Masayuki', 'Firor, Amelia E', 'Pinz, Kevin G', 'Jares, Alexander', 'Liu, Hua', 'Salman, Huda', 'Golightly, Marc', 'Lan, Fengshuo', 'Jiang, Xun', 'Ma, Yupo']","['Chen KH', 'Wada M', 'Firor AE', 'Pinz KG', 'Jares A', 'Liu H', 'Salman H', 'Golightly M', 'Lan F', 'Jiang X', 'Ma Y']","['iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Macau Institute for Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology/metabolism', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/transplantation', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD3CAR', 'NK cells', 'T cell malignancies', 'immunotherapy']",2016/08/06 06:00,2018/01/18 06:00,['2016/08/06 06:00'],"['2016/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['11019 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.11019 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 30;7(35):56219-56232. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.11019.,10.18632/oncotarget.11019 [doi],,,,,PMC5302909,"['Yupo Ma is a co-founder of iCell Gene Therapeutics, LLC.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disease control is achieved in the majority of patients and survival is excellent such that recent focus has been on toxicities of these agents. Cumulative data have reported an excess of serious vascular complications, including arterial thrombosis and peripheral arterial occlusive disease, in patients receiving nilotinib in comparison with other TKIs, with resultant interest in delineating the pathophysiology and implications for rationale cardiovascular risk modification. To address this issue, we studied the effects of imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib on platelet function and thrombus formation in human and mouse models using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo approaches. In vitro studies demonstrated that dasatinib and imatinib but not nilotinib inhibited ADP, CRP, and collagen-induced platelet aggregation and moreover, that nilotinib potentiated PAR-1-mediated alpha granule release. Pretreatment of wild-type C57BL/6 mice with nilotinib but not imatinib or dasatinib, significantly increased thrombus growth and stability, on type I collagen under ex vivo arterial flow conditions and increased thrombus growth and stability following FeCl3-induced vascular injury of mesenteric arterioles and carotid artery injury in vivo. Whole blood from nilotinib-treated CML patients, demonstrated increased platelet adhesion ex vivo under flow, increased plasma soluble P- and E-selectin, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6 levels and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) levels in vivo, despite being on daily low-dose aspirin. These results demonstrate that nilotinib can potentiate platelet and endothelial activation and platelet thrombus formation ex vivo and in vivo.","['Alhawiti, Naif', 'Burbury, Kate L', 'Kwa, Faith A', ""O'Malley, Cindy J"", 'Shuttleworth, Peter', 'Alzard, Mohamad', 'Hamadi, Abdullah', 'Grigg, Andrew P', 'Jackson, Denise E']","['Alhawiti N', 'Burbury KL', 'Kwa FA', ""O'Malley CJ"", 'Shuttleworth P', 'Alzard M', 'Hamadi A', 'Grigg AP', 'Jackson DE']","['Thrombosis and Vascular Diseases Laboratory, School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, RMIT University, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia.', 'Haematology Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, East Melbourne, Australia.', 'Thrombosis and Vascular Diseases Laboratory, School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, RMIT University, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia.', 'Thrombosis and Vascular Diseases Laboratory, School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, RMIT University, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Austin Health, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.', 'Thrombosis and Vascular Diseases Laboratory, School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, RMIT University, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia.', 'Thrombosis and Vascular Diseases Laboratory, School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, RMIT University, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Austin Health, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.', 'Thrombosis and Vascular Diseases Laboratory, School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, RMIT University, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia.

They represent the only genetic lesion described so far present in the majority of cases clustering into a subgroup of B-other subtype characterized by a unique gene expression profile, probably sharing a common, however, not yet fully described, biological background. We aimed to elucidate whether ERG deletions could drive the specific biology of this ERG-related leukemia subgroup through expression of aberrant or decreased expression of wild type ERG isoforms. We showed that leukemic cells with endogenous ERG deletion express an aberrant transcript translated into two proteins in transfected cell lines and that one of these proteins colocalizes with wild type ERG. However, we did not confirm expression of the proteins in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases with endogenous ERG deletion. ERG deletions resulted in significantly lower expression of wild type ERG transcripts compared to B-other cases without ERG deletion. However, cases with subclonal ERG deletion, clustering to the same ERG deletion associated subgroup, presented similar levels of wild type ERG as cases without ERG deletion. In conclusion, our data suggest that neither the expression of aberrant proteins from internally deleted allele nor the reduced expression of wild type ERG seem to provide a plausible explanation of the specific biology of ERG -related leukemia subgroup.","['Potuckova, Eliska', 'Zuna, Jan', 'Hovorkova, Lenka', 'Starkova, Julia', 'Stary, Jan', 'Trka, Jan', 'Zaliova, Marketa']","['Potuckova E', 'Zuna J', 'Hovorkova L', 'Starkova J', 'Stary J', 'Trka J', 'Zaliova M']","['Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague (CLIP), Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague (CLIP), Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague (CLIP), Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague (CLIP), Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague (CLIP), Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague (CLIP), Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160805,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",IM,"['Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG/genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/08/06 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2016/08/06 06:00'],"['2016/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0160385 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-17847 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Aug 5;11(8):e0160385. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0160385. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0160385 [doi],,,,,PMC4975502,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using 19 task-based job modules, we examined the relationship between occupational exposure to organic solvents and other compounds and the risk of leukemia in children. METHODS: Latino (48%) and non-Latino (52%) children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n=670), acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n=104), and controls (n=1021) were enrolled in a study in California (2000-2008). Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for socio-demographic factors. RESULTS: Among children with non-Latino fathers, none of the exposures evaluated were associated with risks of ALL and AML. In contrast, exposure to any organic solvents in Latino fathers was associated with an increased risk of childhood ALL (OR=1.48; 95% CI: 1.01-2.16); in multivariable analyses, the OR for chlorinated hydrocarbons was 2.28 (95% CI: 0.97-5.37) while the ORs were close to one for aromatic hydrocarbons, glycol ethers, and other hydrocarbon mixtures. We also observed an increased risk of ALL with exposure to combustion exhaust/polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (ORs=1.70; 95% CI: 1.16-2.57, and 1.46; 95% CI: 0.94-2.26 with and without adjustment for chlorinated hydrocarbons, respectively). Moderately elevated risks of ALL were seen with exposure to metals, paints, and wood dust, although not statistically significant. An increased risk was reported for asbestos based on small numbers of exposed Latino fathers. No associations were reported between maternal exposures to any exposures and childhood ALL and AML. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support associations between paternal occupational exposures to chlorinated hydrocarbons, combustion exhaust, metals, and possibly asbestos and the risk of ALL in the children of Latino fathers only.","['Metayer, Catherine', 'Scelo, Ghislaine', 'Kang, Alice Y', 'Gunier, Robert B', 'Reinier, Kyndaron', 'Lea, Suzanne', 'Chang, Jeffrey S', 'Selvin, Steve', 'Kirsch, Janice', 'Crouse, Vonda', 'Does, Monique', 'Quinlan, Patricia', 'Hammond, S Katharine']","['Metayer C', 'Scelo G', 'Kang AY', 'Gunier RB', 'Reinier K', 'Lea S', 'Chang JS', 'Selvin S', 'Kirsch J', 'Crouse V', 'Does M', 'Quinlan P', 'Hammond SK']","['University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health, Division of Epidemiology, Berkeley, CA, USA.

Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for these patients is of utmost importance and should be taken into consideration when assessing new treatment options. The combination of ofatumumab with chlorambucil has shown longer progression-free survival compared with chlorambucil alone. In this study, we aim to assess how this treatment combination affects patients' health-related quality of life and patient-reported symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this open-label phase III trial, patients with previously untreated CLL for whom fludarabine-based treatment was contra-indicated, were randomized 1:1 to receive oral chlorambucil (10 mg/m(2)) on Days 1-7 of a 28-day treatment cycle or to receive chlorambucil by this schedule plus intravenous ofatumumab (Cycle 1: 300 mg on Day 1 and 1000 mg on Day 8; subsequent cycles: 1000 mg Day 1) for 3-12 cycles. The EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CLL16 questionnaires were administered to patients before and during treatment, in follow-up and at the time of disease progression. The primary specified patient-reported outcomes were HRQoL and fatigue. RESULTS: Patient-reported improvements from baseline in Global Health Status (GHS)/HRQoL scores and fatigue scores were recorded during treatment with both chlorambucil monotherapy and ofatumumab in combination with chlorambucil. There were no significant differences between the two treatment arms for GHS/HRQoL (p = 0.667) or fatigue (p = 0.103). Following treatment, numerical improvements to GHS/HRQoL and fatigue scores were reported, with no significant differences between the two treatment arms. CONCLUSION: Small but detectable improvements in patients' quality of life were reported as a result of treatment. The addition of ofatumumab to chlorambucil did not negatively impact HRQoL. Quality of life was maintained in the months following treatment.","['Hillmen, Peter', 'Janssens, Ann', 'Babu, K Govind', 'Kloczko, Janusz', 'Grosicki, Sebastian', 'Manson, Stephanie', 'McKeown, Astrid', 'Gupta, Ira', 'Chang, Chai-Ni', 'Offner, Fritz']","['Hillmen P', 'Janssens A', 'Babu KG', 'Kloczko J', 'Grosicki S', 'Manson S', 'McKeown A', 'Gupta I', 'Chang CN', 'Offner F']","[""a St James's Institute of Oncology , Leeds , West Yorkshire , UK."", 'b Universitaire Ziekenhuizen Leuven , Leuven , Belgium.', 'c HCG Curie Centre of Oncology , Bangalore , India.', 'd Kidwai Memorial Hospital , Bangalore , Karnataka , India.', 'e Medical University of Bialystok , Bialystok , Poland.', 'f Department of Cancer Prevention, School of Public Health , Silesian Medical University , Katowice , Poland.', 'g Novartis Pharmaceuticals , Uxbridge , UK.', 'g Novartis Pharmaceuticals , Uxbridge , UK.', 'h Novartis Pharmaceuticals , King of Prussia , PA , USA.', 'h Novartis Pharmaceuticals , King of Prussia , PA , USA.', 'i Universitair Ziekenhuis Gent , Ghent , Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20160805,England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Fatigue/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Reported Outcome Measures', 'Quality of Life', 'Self Report', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/08/06 06:00,2018/01/31 06:00,['2016/08/06 06:00'],"['2016/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/0284186X.2016.1205217 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2016 Sep - Oct;55(9-10):1115-1120. doi: 10.1080/0284186X.2016.1205217.

This syndrome is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposing syndrome due to a germline mutation in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. METHODS: In this study, a representative family case of Li-Fraumeni syndrome is described. The proband of this family was a 43-year-old male who had osteosarcoma of the mandible and a positive family history of cancer. His mother died at the age of 29 of brain cancer; his sister died at the age of 18 of breast cancer; his brother died at the age of 36 of liver cancer; and another sister of his died at the age of 16 of leukemia. Complete sequence analysis of the TP53 and PTEN genes was performed in this family. We used standard diagnostic tools such as sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to analyze these two genes in this family. The exons and flanking exon-intron junctions of the TP53 and PTEN genes were sequenced. RESULTS: We detected a germline mutation in the TP53 gene in this family that was previously reported as somatic mutation in LFS in the catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC). In addition, according to the International Agency for Research of Cancer (IARC) database, a 19-year-old male patient with sarcoma was recently reported to have this germline mutation. We also found two new IVS variations in the PTEN gene, one of which can be a suggestive evidence of an effect on the splicing of PTEN. CONCLUSION: Genomic modifications for tumor risk and genotype-phenotype correlations in LFS are still to be identified. We believe every new finding in this area can provide new insights into the pathogenesis and progression of Li-Fraumeni syndrome.","['Akouchekian, Mansoureh', 'Hemati, Simin', 'Jafari, Davood', 'Jalilian, Nazanin', 'Dehghan Manshadi, Masoumeh']","['Akouchekian M', 'Hemati S', 'Jafari D', 'Jalilian N', 'Dehghan Manshadi M']","['PhD, Assistant Professor, Department of Medical Genetics & Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. akouchekian.m@iums.ac.ir.', 'MD, PhD, Associate Professor, Department of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. hematti@med.mui.ac.ir.', 'MSc, PhD student, Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. davoodjafari1@yahoo.com.', 'PhD, Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. jalilian_n@razi.tums.ac.ir.', 'MSc, Medical Genetics Department, Special Medical Center, Tehran, Iran. m_dehghanmanshadi@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160529,Iran,Med J Islam Repub Iran,Medical journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran,8910777,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Germline Mutation', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome', 'PTEN Gene']",2016/08/06 06:00,2016/08/06 06:01,['2016/08/06 06:00'],"['2015/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/06 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Med J Islam Repub Iran. 2016 May 29;30:378. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,PMC4972054,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we use a tracer-based NMR analysis involving high-resolution (1)H-(13)C-HSQC spectra to assess site-specific label incorporation into a range of metabolite pools, including malate, aspartate and glutamate in the acute myeloid leukaemia cell line K562. We also determine how this is affected following treatment with the redeployed drug combination of the lipid-regulating drug bezafibrate and medroxyprogesterone (BaP). RESULTS: Using the tracer-based approach, we assessed the contribution of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) vs. pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity in the derivation of Krebs cycle intermediates. Our data show that PC activity is indeed high in K562 cells. We also demonstrate a branched entry to the Krebs cycle of K562 cells with one branch running counterclockwise using PC-derived oxaloacetate and the other clockwise from the PDH activity. Finally, we show that the PC activity of K562 cells exclusively fuels the ROS-induced decarboxylation of oxaloacetate to malonate in response to BaP treatment; resulting in further Krebs cycle disruption via depletion of oxaloacetate and malonate-mediated inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) resulting in a twofold reduction of fumarate. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends the interest in the PC activity in solid cancers to include leukaemias and further demonstrates the value of tracer-based NMR approaches in generating a more accurate picture of the flow of carbons and metabolites within the increasingly inappropriately named Krebs cycle. Moreover, our studies indicate that the PC activity in cancer cells can be exploited as an Achilles heel by using treatments, such as BaP, that elevate ROS production.","['Reed, Michelle A C', 'Ludwig, Christian', 'Bunce, Christopher M', 'Khanim, Farhat L', 'Gunther, Ulrich L']","['Reed MAC', 'Ludwig C', 'Bunce CM', 'Khanim FL', 'Gunther UL']","['Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT UK.', 'Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT UK.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT UK.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160804,England,Cancer Metab,Cancer & metabolism,101607582,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Cancer metabolism', 'Malonate', 'Pyruvate carboxylase']",2016/08/06 06:00,2016/08/06 06:01,['2016/08/06 06:00'],"['2016/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40170-016-0155-7 [doi]', '155 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Metab. 2016 Aug 4;4:15. doi: 10.1186/s40170-016-0155-7. eCollection 2016.,10.1186/s40170-016-0155-7 [doi],,,,,PMC4972992,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chlorambucil has been considered for decades as a suitable therapeutic option for frail patients. Taking into account the advantage offered by the addition of MoAbs to chemotherapy, different studies up to now have explored the feasibility of chlorambucil-based chemoimmunotherapies in treatment-naive CLL. COMPLEMENT1 is a prospective, randomized, open-label trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ofatumumab added to chlorambucil, compared with chlorambucil in monotherapy, in the setting of untreated patients with CLL considered unsuitable for a fludarabine-based approach. Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the chemoimmunotherapy arm when compared with the single-agent chlorambucil (22.4 months versus 13.1 months). Response rate and quality were also improved in the combination arm. Furthermore, the addition of ofatumumab did not lead to an unmanageable toxicity. While the employment of anti-CD20 antibodies represents an advantage in the treatment of the CLL symptomatic population, at present different patient selection and treatment schedules do not allow a reliable comparison between chlorambucil-based regimens. The addition of ofatumumab to chlorambucil represents a further therapeutic gain in CLL. Longer follow up and direct comparison with other MoAbs are warranted to establish the preferred first-line treatment in elderly and unfit patients.","['Frustaci, Anna Maria', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra', 'Picardi, Paola', 'Mazzucchelli, Maddalena', 'Cairoli, Roberto', 'Montillo, Marco']","['Frustaci AM', 'Tedeschi A', 'Picardi P', 'Mazzucchelli M', 'Cairoli R', 'Montillo M']","['Department of Hematology, Niguarda Cancer Center, Niguarda Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Niguarda Cancer Center, Niguarda Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Niguarda Cancer Center, Niguarda Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Niguarda Cancer Center, Niguarda Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Niguarda Cancer Center, Niguarda Hospital, Milan, Italy.', ""Department of Hematology, Niguarda Cancer Center, Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital, Piazza Ospedale Maggiore 3, 20162 Milan, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160521,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['COMPLEMENT1', 'chemoimmunotherapy', 'chlorambucil', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'elderly', 'ofatumumab']",2016/08/06 06:00,2016/08/06 06:01,['2016/08/06 06:00'],"['2016/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620716648567 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620716648567 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2016 Aug;7(4):222-30. doi: 10.1177/2040620716648567.

However, little is known about its pharmacokinetics, and mechanisms of therapy resistance are poorly understood. Here, we explored the in vivo biodistribution of radiolabeled asparaginase, using a combination of imaging and biochemical techniques, and provide evidence for tissue-specific clearance mechanisms, which could reduce the effectiveness of the drug at these specific sites. METHODS: In vivo localization of (111)In-labeled Escherichia coli asparaginase was performed in C57BL/6 mice by both small-animal SPECT/CT and ex vivo biodistribution studies. Mice were treated with liposomal clodronate to investigate the effect of macrophage depletion on tracer localization and drug clearance in vivo. Moreover, macrophage cell line models RAW264.7 and THP-1, as well as knockout mice, were used to identify the cellular and molecular components controlling asparaginase pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: In vivo imaging and biodistribution studies showed a rapid accumulation of asparaginase in macrophage-rich tissues such as the liver, spleen, and in particular bone marrow. Clodronate-mediated depletion of phagocytic cells markedly prolonged the serum half-life of asparaginase in vivo and decreased drug uptake in these macrophage-rich organs. Immunohistochemistry and in vitro binding assays confirmed the involvement of macrophagelike cells in the uptake of asparaginase. We identified the activity of the lysosomal protease cathepsin B in macrophages as a rate-limiting factor in degrading asparaginase both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: We showed that asparaginase is rapidly cleared from the serum by liver-, spleen-, and bone marrow-resident phagocytic cells. As a consequence of this efficient uptake and protease-mediated degradation, particularly bone marrow-resident macrophages may provide a protective niche to leukemic cells.","['van der Meer, Laurens T', 'Terry, Samantha Y A', 'van Ingen Schenau, Dorette S', 'Andree, Kiki C', 'Franssen, Gerben M', 'Roeleveld, Debbie M', 'Metselaar, Josbert M', 'Reinheckel, Thomas', 'Hoogerbrugge, Peter M', 'Boerman, Otto C', 'van Leeuwen, Frank N']","['van der Meer LT', 'Terry SY', 'van Ingen Schenau DS', 'Andree KC', 'Franssen GM', 'Roeleveld DM', 'Metselaar JM', 'Reinheckel T', 'Hoogerbrugge PM', 'Boerman OC', 'van Leeuwen FN']","['Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', ""Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, Department of Imaging Chemistry and Biology, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", 'Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Experimental Rheumatology, Radboud Insititute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Molecular Imaging, University Clinic and Helmholtz Institute for Biomedical Engineering, RWTH-Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine and Cell Research, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg, Germany.', 'BIOSS Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg, Germany; and.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands FrankN.vanleeuwen@radboudumc.nl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160804,United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacokinetics', 'Bone Marrow/diagnostic imaging/*enzymology', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Macrophages/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Imaging/*methods', 'Organ Specificity', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Computed Tomography/*methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['*asparaginase', '*cathepsin B', '*imaging', '*leukemia', '*macrophages']",2016/08/06 06:00,2017/05/02 06:00,['2016/08/06 06:00'],"['2016/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['jnumed.116.177741 [pii]', '10.2967/jnumed.116.177741 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2017 Feb;58(2):214-220. doi: 10.2967/jnumed.116.177741.

This study was designed to explore the expression and functional significance of microRNA (miR)-212 in ATL. The expression of miR-212 in human ATL tissues and cell lines were investigated. Gain-of-function experiments were carried out to determine the roles of miR-212 in cell proliferation, tumorigenesis, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. We also identified and functionally characterized the target genes of miR-212 in ATL cells. Compared with normal lymph node biopsies, lymphoma samples from ATL patients displayed underexpression of miR-212 (p=0.0032). Consistently, miR-212 was downregulated in human ATL cell lines, compared with normal T lymphocytes. Restoration of miR-212 significantly (p<0.05) inhibited ATL cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in mice. Overexpression of miR-212 led to an accumulation of G0/G1-phase cells and a concomitant reduction of S-phase cells. Moreover, enforced expression of miR-212-induced significant apoptosis in ATL cells. CCND3, which encodes a cell cycle regulator cyclin D3, was identified as a direct target of miR-212 in ATL cells. Rescue experiments with a miR-212-resistant variant of CCND3 demonstrated that overexpression of CCND3 restored cell-cycle progression and attenuated apoptotic response in miR-212-overexpressing ATL cells. Taken together, miR-212 exerts growth-suppressive effects in ATL cells largely by targeting CCND3 and may have therapeutic potential in ATL.","['Wang, Haihao', 'Guo, Qiannan', 'Yang, Peiwen', 'Long, Guoxian']","['Wang H', 'Guo Q', 'Yang P', 'Long G']","['Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Reproductive Medicine Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160804,England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (MIRN212 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cyclin D3/*genetics', 'Female', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Cancer']",2016/08/06 06:00,2018/02/10 06:00,['2016/08/06 06:00'],"['2016/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/10 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['jim-2016-000233 [pii]', '10.1136/jim-2016-000233 [doi]']",ppublish,J Investig Med. 2017 Jan;65(1):82-87. doi: 10.1136/jim-2016-000233.

Obstacles to eradicating LSCs include limited understanding of the regulation network of LSCs. The current study aimed to examine the interplay between NF-kappaB and FOXM1/beta-catenin, and the effect of its chemical intervention on CML LSCs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The interplay between NF-kappaB and FOXM1/beta-catenin was analyzed by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay in CML cells. The effect of disturbing NF-kappaB and FOXM1/beta-catenin by niclosamide on the self-renewal capacity and survival of LSCs was evaluated in vitro in human primary CML CD34(+) cells and in vivo in CML mice. RESULTS: Reciprocal co-IP experiments showed physical interaction of p65 and FOXM1. p65 promoted transcription of FOXM1 gene. ChIP assay revealed recruitment of p65 on the promoter of FOXM1 gene. Conversely, FOXM1 and beta-catenin positively regulated the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB in CML cells. Niclosamide disrupted the positive feedback loop between NF-kappaB and FOXM1/beta-catenin, thereby impairing the self-renewal capacity and survival of CML LSCs. Niclosamide decreased the long-term engraftment of human CML LSCs in NOD-SCID IL2Rgamma chain-deficient (NOG) mice, and prolonged the survival of CML mice. CONCLUSIONS: Interaction of p65 with FOXM1/beta-catenin is critical in CML and its disruption by niclosamide eradicates LSCs. These findings may improve the understanding of a self-renewal regulatory mechanism of LSCs and offer a rationale-based approach to eliminate LSCs in CML. Clin Cancer Res; 23(3); 789-803.

Individual-level data on parental cigarette smoking were obtained from 12 case-control studies from the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium (CLIC, 1974-2012), including 1,330 AML cases diagnosed at age <15 years and 13,169 controls. We conducted pooled analyses of CLIC studies, as well as meta-analyses of CLIC and non-CLIC studies. Overall, maternal smoking before, during, or after pregnancy was not associated with childhood AML; there was a suggestion, however, that smoking during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk in Hispanics (odds ratio = 2.08, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20, 3.61) but not in other ethnic groups. By contrast, the odds ratios for paternal lifetime smoking were 1.34 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.62) and 1.18 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.51) in pooled and meta-analyses, respectively. Overall, increased risks from 1.2- to 1.3-fold were observed for pre- and postnatal smoking (P < 0.05), with higher risks reported for heavy smokers. Associations with paternal smoking varied by histological type. Our analyses suggest an association between paternal smoking and childhood AML. The association with maternal smoking appears limited to Hispanic children, raising questions about ethnic differences in tobacco-related exposures and biological mechanisms, as well as study-specific biases.","['Metayer, Catherine', 'Petridou, Eleni', 'Arangure, Juan Manuel Mejia', 'Roman, Eve', 'Schuz, Joachim', 'Magnani, Corrado', 'Mora, Ana Maria', 'Mueller, Beth A', 'de Oliveira, Maria S Pombo', 'Dockerty, John D', 'McCauley, Kathryn', 'Lightfoot, Tracy', 'Hatzipantelis, Emmanouel', 'Rudant, Jeremie', 'Flores-Lujano, Janet', 'Kaatsch, Peter', 'Miligi, Lucia', 'Wesseling, Catharina', 'Doody, David R', 'Moschovi, Maria', 'Orsi, Laurent', 'Mattioli, Stefano', 'Selvin, Steve', 'Kang, Alice Y', 'Clavel, Jacqueline']","['Metayer C', 'Petridou E', 'Arangure JM', 'Roman E', 'Schuz J', 'Magnani C', 'Mora AM', 'Mueller BA', 'de Oliveira MS', 'Dockerty JD', 'McCauley K', 'Lightfoot T', 'Hatzipantelis E', 'Rudant J', 'Flores-Lujano J', 'Kaatsch P', 'Miligi L', 'Wesseling C', 'Doody DR', 'Moschovi M', 'Orsi L', 'Mattioli S', 'Selvin S', 'Kang AY', 'Clavel J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160803,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,['0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Parents', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/chemically induced', 'Risk', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*adverse effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*childhood cancer', '*international collaboration', '*parental smoking']",2016/08/06 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2016/08/06 06:00'],"['2015/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['kww018 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kww018 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2016 Aug 15;184(4):261-73. doi: 10.1093/aje/kww018.

The prognostic value of measurable levels of minimal residual disease (MRD) at time of conditioning is a matter of debate. We analyzed the predictive relevance of MRD levels before transplantation on the clinical outcome of Ph+ ALL patients treated with chemotherapy and imatinib in 2 consecutive prospective clinical trials. MRD evaluation before transplantation was available for 65 of the 73 patients who underwent an alloHSCT in CR1. A complete or major molecular response at time of conditioning was achieved in 24 patients (37%), whereas 41 (63%) remained carriers of any other positive MRD level in the bone marrow. MRD negativity at time of conditioning was associated with a significant benefit in terms of risk of relapse at 5 years, with a relapse incidence of 8% compared with 39% for patients with MRD positivity (P = .007). However, thanks to the post-transplantation use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), disease-free survival was 58% versus 41% (P = .17) and overall survival was 58% versus 49% (P = .55) in MRD-negative compared with MRD-positive patients, respectively. The cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was similar in the 2 groups.

MicroRNA regulates cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle. Whether microRNA could be treated as a target for leukemia is still unclear and the mechanism by which microRNA143 regulates K562 cells needs further investigation. MATERIAL AND METHODS miRNA143 and its scramble miRNA were synthesized and transfected to K562 cells. MTT assay was used to detect K562 cell proliferation. Flow cytometry and a caspase-3 activity detection kit were used to test K562 cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis was performed to determine breakpoint cluster region-Abelson (BCR-ABL) expression. BCR-ABL overexpression and siRNA were used to change BCR-ABL level, and cell apoptosis was detected again after lipofection transfection. RESULTS miRNA143 transfection inhibited K562 cell growth and induced its apoptosis. miRNA143 transfection decreased BCR-ABL expression. BCR-ABL overexpression suppressed miRNA143-induced K562 cell apoptosis, while its reduction enhanced miRNA143-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS miRNA143 induced K562 cell apoptosis through downregulating BCR-ABL. miRNA143 might be a target for a new leukemia therapy.","['Liang, Bing', 'Song, Yanbin', 'Zheng, Wenling', 'Ma, Wenli']","['Liang B', 'Song Y', 'Zheng W', 'Ma W']","['Institute of Genetic Engineering, Southern Medical University, Baiyun, Guangzhou, China (mainland).', 'Institute of Genetic Engineering, Southern Medical University, Baiyun, Guangzhou, China (mainland).', 'Institute of Genetic Engineering, Southern Medical University, Baiyun, Guangzhou, China (mainland).', 'Institute of Genetic Engineering, Southern Medical University, Baiyun, Guangzhou, China (mainland).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160805,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (MIRN143 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/therapy', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']",,,2016/08/06 06:00,2017/03/21 06:00,['2016/08/06 06:00'],"['2016/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['895833 [pii]', '10.12659/msm.895833 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2016 Aug 5;22:2761-7. doi: 10.12659/msm.895833.,,,,,,PMC4978212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the association between comorbidity at diagnosis with treatment outcome and survival in chronic phase CML patients. A questionnaire was administered to patients diagnosed with CML between 2001 and 2012 and treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was used to determine concomitant diseases. In total, 79 patients (33 females; median age, 57 years) were enrolled. CCI scores at diagnosis were between 2 and 11. At the last follow-up, 46 patients showed a major molecular response. Complete cytogenetic response was achieved in 73.4 % of the cases 12 months after TKI administration. We observed only five deaths during the 55.5-month median follow-up period. The risk categories (low/intermediate/high) associated with Sokal and Hasford scores were 33/27/7 and 21/43/3, respectively. The 27 cases with a CCI score >3 had significantly poorer survival after diagnosis (52 cases had a CCI score <2). CCI scores were inversely associated to overall survival. Concomitant comorbidity at diagnosis is associated with poor outcome in CML patients treated with TKIs.","['Uemura, Makiko', 'Imataki, Osamu', 'Kawachi, Yasunori', 'Kawakami, Kimihiro', 'Hoshijima, Yasuo', 'Matsuoka, Akihito', 'Kadowaki, Norimitsu']","['Uemura M', 'Imataki O', 'Kawachi Y', 'Kawakami K', 'Hoshijima Y', 'Matsuoka A', 'Kadowaki N']","['Division of Hematology, Rheumatology and Respiratory Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Miki-town, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Rheumatology and Respiratory Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Miki-town, Japan. oima@med.kagawa-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-town, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan. oima@med.kagawa-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaisei General Hospital, The Taijukai Foundation, Sakaide City, Kagawa, 762-0007, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Takamatsu Red Cross Hospital, 4-1-3 Ban-cho, Takamatsu City, Kagawa, 760-0017, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kagawa Prefectural Central Hospital, 5-4-16 Ban-cho, Takamatsu City, Kagawa, 760-8557, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Takamatsu Municipal Hospital, 2-36-1 Miyawaki-cho, Takamatsu City, Kagawa, 760-8538, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Sakaide City Hospital, 1-6-43 Bunkyo-cho, Sakaide City, Kagawa, 762-0031, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mitoyo General Hospital, 708 Himehama, Toyohama-cho, Kanonji City, Kagawa, 769-1695, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Rheumatology and Respiratory Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Miki-town, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160804,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Charlson comorbidity index', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Hasford score', '*Sokal score', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2016/10/26 06:00,2017/03/24 06:00,['2016/08/06 06:00'],"['2016/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-016-2074-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-016-2074-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2016 Nov;104(5):621-627. doi: 10.1007/s12185-016-2074-3.

The N-terminal residue serves as the degradation signal of a protein and thus called N-degron. N-degron can be recognized and modifed by several steps of post-translational modifications, such as oxidation, deamination, arginylation or acetylation, it then polyubiquitinated by the N-recognin for degradation. The molecular basis of the N-end rule pathway has been elucidated and its physiological functions have been revealed in the past 30 years. This pathway is involved in several biological aspects, including transcription, differentiation, chromosomal segregation, genome stability, apoptosis, mitochondrial quality control, cardiovascular development, neurogenesis, carcinogenesis, and spermatogenesis. Disturbance of this pathway often causes the failure of these processes, resulting in some human diseases.

With the successful generation of canine induced pluripotent stem cells (ciPSCs), the biomedical community has a unique opportunity to study therapeutic interventions using autologous stem cells that can benefit dogs and humans. Unlike mice and human pluripotent cells, which are leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)- and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-dependent, respectively, dog iPSCs require both growth factors simultaneously. In an effort to elucidate the role of each factor in the control of ciPSC self-renewal, we performed a series of experiments aiming at understanding the signaling pathways activated by them. We found that bFGF regulates pluripotency by indirectly activating the SMAD2/3 pathway in the presence of feeder cells, exclusively targeting NANOG expression, and inhibiting spontaneous differentiation toward ectoderm and mesoderm. LIF activates the JAK-STAT3 pathway but does not function in the typical manner described in mouse naive embryonic stem cells. These results show that a unique mechanism for maintenance of pluripotency is present in ciPSC. These findings should be taken into account when establishing stem cell differentiation protocols and may provide more insight into pluripotency regulation in species other than mice and humans.","['Luo, Jiesi', 'Cibelli, Jose B']","['Luo J', 'Cibelli JB']","['1 Department of Animal Science, Michigan State University , East Lansing, Michigan.', '2 Yale Cardiovascular Research Center, Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Yale University , New Haven, Connecticut.', '1 Department of Animal Science, Michigan State University , East Lansing, Michigan.', '3 Department of Physiology, Michigan State University , East Lansing, Michigan.', '4 LARCEL, Laboratorio Andaluz de Reprogramacion Celular , BIONAND, Andalucia, Spain .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160919,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['autologous', 'dog', 'pluripotency']",2016/08/06 06:00,2016/08/06 06:01,['2016/08/06 06:00'],"['2016/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/06 06:01 [medline]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2016.0164 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2016 Nov 1;25(21):1670-1680. doi: 10.1089/scd.2016.0164.

Splicing mutations are mutually exclusive with one another and collectively represent the most common mutation class in MDS, occurring in approximately 60 % of patients overall and more than 80 % of those with ring sideroblasts. Evidence from animal models suggests that homozygous splicing mutations are lethal, and that in heterozygously mutated models, any further disruption of splicing triggers apoptosis and cell death. MDS cells with spliceosome mutations are thus uniquely vulnerable to therapies targeting splicing, which may be tolerated by healthy cells. The spliceosome is emerging as a novel therapeutic target in MDS and related myeloid neoplasms, with the first clinical trial of a splicing modulator opening in 2016.","['Brierley, Charlotte K', 'Steensma, David P']","['Brierley CK', 'Steensma DP']","['Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, Churchill Hospital, Old Road, Oxford, OX3 7LE, UK.', 'Adult Leukemia Program, Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, D2037, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.

In particular, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), an uncommon, but highly aggressive hematologic malignancy, is one example of a cancer with limited information readily available to the general public. The infrequent incidence of BPDCN, the challenges in recognizing the disease and making a clinico-pathologic diagnosis, and the lack of standard therapies are some of the reasons accounting for the dearth of expert opinion, scientific publications and discussion, and accessibility of online information for patients. This article highlights social media and Internet sources available for patients and other healthcare stakeholders in the field of BPDCN and discusses our efforts to increase awareness and propagation of BPDCN electronic resources, including the founding of an online Twitter community, #BPDCN.","['Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Gupta, Vikas', 'Thompson, Michael A', 'Lane, Andrew A']","['Pemmaraju N', 'Gupta V', 'Thompson MA', 'Lane AA']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Unit 428, PO Box 301402, Houston, TX, 77230-1402, USA. npemmaraju@mdanderson.org.', 'The Elizabeth and Tony Comper MPN Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Aurora Research Institute, Aurora Health Care, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,IM,"['Dendritic Cells/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Health Information Exchange', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology/psychology', 'Humans', 'Internet', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*pathology/psychology', '*Social Media']",['NOTNLM'],"['*#BPDCN', '*BPDCN', '*Disease-specific hashtag', '*Rare disease', '*Social media', '*Twitter']",2016/08/06 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2016/08/06 06:00'],"['2016/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-016-0340-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-016-0340-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2016 Dec;11(6):462-467. doi: 10.1007/s11899-016-0340-3.,10.1007/s11899-016-0340-3 [doi],,,,,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the conventional optical image-guidance mode has caused strong tissue autofluorescence of the living tissue, which leads to the accurate infrared light irradiation cannot be conducted. In this article, ICG and persistent luminescence phosphors (PLPs) coloaded mesoporous silica nanocarriers ((ICG+PLPs)@mSiO2) were first designed and prepared for persistent luminescent imaging-guided PTT. The (ICG+PLPs)@mSiO2 nanocarriers could significantly improve signal-to-noise ratio during luminescence imaging-guided PTT, making the PLP promising for improving the accuracy of the tumor site for photothermal therapy in vivo.

Recent studies have shown that nilotinib induces potent sensitization to anticancer agents by blocking the functions of ABCB1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in multidrug resistance (MDR). However, changes in P-gp expression or function affect the cardiac disposition and prolong the presence of both doxorubicin (DOX) and doxorubicinol (DOXol) in cardiac tissue, thus, enhancing the risk of cardiotoxicity. In this study, we used a MDR xenograft model to evaluate the antitumor activity, tissue distribution and cardiotoxicity of DOX when co-administered with nilotinib. This information will provide more insight into the pharmacological role of nilotinib in MDR reversal and the risk of DOX cardiotoxicity. Our results showed that nilotinib significantly enhanced DOX cytotoxicity and increased intracellular rhodamine 123 accumulation in MG63/DOX cells in vitro and strongly enhanced DOX inhibition of growth of P-gp-overexpressing MG63/DOX cell xenografts in nude mice. Additionally, nilotinib significantly increased DOX and DOXol accumulation in serum, heart, liver and tumor tissues. Importantly, nilotinib induced a disproportionate increase in DOXol in cardiac tissue. In the co-administration group, CBR1 and AKR1A1 protein levels were significantly increased in cardiac tissue, with more severe necrosis and vacuole formation. These results indicate that nilotinib reverses P-gp- mediated MDR by blocking the efflux function and potentiates DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. These findings represent a guide for the design of future clinical trials and studies of pharmacokinetic interactions and may be useful in guiding the use of nilotinib in combination therapy of cancer in clinical practice.","['Zhou, Zhi-Yong', 'Wan, Li-Li', 'Yang, Quan-Jun', 'Han, Yong-Long', 'Li, Dan', 'Lu, Jin', 'Guo, Cheng']","['Zhou ZY', 'Wan LL', 'Yang QJ', 'Han YL', 'Li D', 'Lu J', 'Guo C']","[""Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, 200233 Shanghai, China; College of Medical Science, Three Gorges University, 443002 Yichang, Hubei, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, 200233 Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, 200233 Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, 200233 Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, 200233 Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, 200233 Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, 200233 Shanghai, China.

In contrast to many other mature B-cell lymphomas, only a few recurrently mutated genes involved in canonical or non-canonical NF-kappaB activation have been identified in CLL (i.e. BIRC3, MYD88 and NFKBIE mutations) and often at a low frequency. On the other hand, CLL B cells seem 'addicted' to the tumor microenvironment for their survival and proliferation, which is primarily mediated by interaction through a number of cell surface receptors, e.g. the B-cell receptor (BcR), Toll-like receptors and CD40, that in turn activate downstream NF-kappaB. The importance of cell-extrinsic triggering for CLL pathophysiology was recently also highlighted by the clinical efficacy of novel drugs targeting microenvironmental interactions through the inhibition of BcR signaling. In other words, CLL can be considered a prototype disease for studying the intricate interplay between external triggers and intrinsic aberrations and their combined impact on disease evolution. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of mechanisms underlying NF-kappaB deregulation in CLL, including micro-environmental, genetic and epigenetic events, and summarize data generated in murine models resembling human CLL. Finally, we will also discuss different strategies undertaken to intervene with the NF-kappaB pathway and its upstream mediators.","['Mansouri, Larry', 'Papakonstantinou, Nikos', 'Ntoufa, Stavroula', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Mansouri L', 'Papakonstantinou N', 'Ntoufa S', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden; Institute of Applied Biosciences, CERTH, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden; Institute of Applied Biosciences, CERTH, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden; Institute of Applied Biosciences, CERTH, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.

However, the potential for insertional mutagenesis and genotoxicity of viral vectors is a safety concern, and their cost and regulatory demands a roadblock for rapid and broad clinical translation. Here, we demonstrate that CAR T cells can be engineered through non-viral Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposition of CAR genes from minimalistic DNA vectors called minicircles (MCs). We analyzed genomic distribution of SB and LV integrations and show that a significantly higher proportion of MC-derived CAR transposons compared with LV integrants had occurred outside of highly expressed and cancer-related genes into genomic safe harbor loci that are not expected to cause mutagenesis or genotoxicity. CD19-CAR T cells engineered with our enhanced SB approach conferred potent reactivity in vitro and eradicated lymphoma in a xenograft model in vivo. Intriguingly, electroporation of SB MCs is substantially more effective and less toxic compared with conventional plasmids, and enables cost-effective rapid preparation of therapeutic CAR T-cell doses. This approach sets a new standard in advanced cellular and gene therapy and will accelerate and increase the availability of CAR T-cell therapy to treat hematologic malignancies.","['Monjezi, R', 'Miskey, C', 'Gogishvili, T', 'Schleef, M', 'Schmeer, M', 'Einsele, H', 'Ivics, Z', 'Hudecek, M']","['Monjezi R', 'Miskey C', 'Gogishvili T', 'Schleef M', 'Schmeer M', 'Einsele H', 'Ivics Z', 'Hudecek M']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Division of Medical Biotechnology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institute, Langen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'PlasmidFactory, Bielefeld, Germany.', 'PlasmidFactory, Bielefeld, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Division of Medical Biotechnology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institute, Langen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160624,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (DNA, Kinetoplast)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Cell Engineering/*methods', 'DNA, Kinetoplast/therapeutic use', 'Genetic Vectors/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,,2016/08/06 06:00,2017/08/31 06:00,['2016/08/06 06:00'],"['2016/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/08 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016180 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.180 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Jan;31(1):186-194. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.180.

Pharmacological antagonism of RORgamma has therapeutic potential for autoimmune diseases; however, this mechanism may potentially carry target-related safety risks, as mice deficient in Rorc, the gene encoding RORgamma, develop T-cell lymphoma with 50% frequency. Due to the requirement of RORgamma during development, the Rorc knockout (KO) animals lack secondary lymphoid organs and have a dysregulation in the generation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We wanted to extend the evaluation of RORgamma deficiency to address the question whether lymphomas, similar to those observed in the Rorc KO, would develop in an animal with an otherwise intact adult immune system. Accordingly, we designed a conditional RORgamma knockout mouse (Rorc CKO) where the Rorc locus could be deleted in adult animals. Based on these studies we can confirm that these animals also develop lymphoma in a similar time frame as embryonic Rorc knockouts. This study also suggests that in animals where the gene deletion is incomplete, the thymus undergoes a rapid selection process replacing Rorc deficient cells with remnant thymocytes carrying a functional Rorc locus and that subsequently, these animals do not develop lymphoblastic lymphoma.","['Liljevald, Maria', 'Rehnberg, Maria', 'Soderberg, Magnus', 'Ramnegard, Marie', 'Borjesson, Jenny', 'Luciani, Donatella', 'Krutrok, Nina', 'Branden, Lena', 'Johansson, Camilla', 'Xu, Xiufeng', 'Bjursell, Mikael', 'Sjogren, Anna-Karin', 'Hornberg, Jorrit', 'Andersson, Ulf', 'Keeling, David', 'Jirholt, Johan']","['Liljevald M', 'Rehnberg M', 'Soderberg M', 'Ramnegard M', 'Borjesson J', 'Luciani D', 'Krutrok N', 'Branden L', 'Johansson C', 'Xu X', 'Bjursell M', 'Sjogren AK', 'Hornberg J', 'Andersson U', 'Keeling D', 'Jirholt J']","['Drug Safety and Metabolism, Innovative Medicines and Early Development Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, , Pepparedsleden 1, Molndal 431 83, SE, Sweden.

The prognosis is generally favorable with modern treatment. In post-pubertal adults, virtually all patients with malignant mGCT are males; the prognosis is more guarded and depends (among other factors) on the histological GCT components and is similar to GCT in other organs. So-called somatic type malignancies (i. e. clonally related, non-germ cell neoplasias arising in a GCT) are much more frequent in mGCT than in other organs, and the association between mediastinal yolk sac tumors and hematological malignancies, such as myelodysplasias and leukemias, is unique to mediastinal tumors.

Post-transplant adoptive immunotherapy using cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) of the donor origin provide graft-versus-tumor effects, with or without graft-versus-host disease. Myeloid leukemias express immunogenic leukemia associated antigens (LAAs); such as WT-1, PRAME, MAGE, h-TERT and others, most of them are able to induce specific T cell responses whenever associated with the proper co-stimulation. We investigated the ability of a LAA-expressing hybridoma cell line to induce CTL clones in PBMCs of HLA-matched healthy donors in vitro. The CTL clones were induced by repetitive co-culture with LAAs-expressing, HLA-A*0201(+) hybrid cell line, generated by fusion of leukemia blasts to human immortalized APC (EBV-sensitized B-lymphoblastoid cell line; HMy2). The induced cytotoxic T cell clones were phenotypically and functionally characterized by pentamer analysis, IFN-gamma release ELISPOT and cellular cytotoxicity assays. All T cell lines showed robust peptide recognition and functional activity when sensitized with HLA-A*0201-restricted WT-1235-243, hTERT615-624 or PRAME100-108 peptides-pulsed T2 cells, in addition to partially HLA-matched leukemia blasts.

To prepare highly purified cell suspensions of peripheral blood lymphocytes for further analysis on mass cytometer, we used the new CD81+ immune affinity chromatography cell isolation approach. Using 21 metal conjugated antibodies in a single tube we were able to identify all basic cell subsets and compare their relative abundance in final products obtained by density gradient (Ficoll-Paque) and immune affinity chromatography (CD81+ T-catch) isolation approach. We show that T-catch isolation approach results in purer final product than Ficoll-Paque (P values 0.0156), with fewer platelets bound to target cells. As a result acquisition time of 10(5) nucleated cells was 3.5 shorter. We then applied unsupervised high dimensional analysis viSNE algorithm to compare the two isolation protocols, which allowed us to evaluate the contribution of unsupervised analysis over supervised manual gating. ViSNE algorithm effectively characterized almost all supervised cell subsets. Moreover, viSNE uncovered previously overseen cell subsets and showed inaccuracies in Maxpar Human peripheral blood phenotyping panel kit recommended gating strategy. These findings emphasize the use of unsupervised analysis tools in parallel with conventional gating strategy to mine the complete information from a set of samples.

DESIGN: Experimental basic science study. SETTING: Reproductive biology laboratory. PATIENT(S): Cryopreserved testicular tissue with normal spermatogenesis obtained from three donors subjected to orchiectomy due to a prostate cancer treatment. INTERVENTION(S): Testicular cells used to create in vitro cell cultures corresponding to the following groups: [1] unsorted human testicular cells, [2] differentially plated human testicular cells, and [3] cells enriched with major histocompatibility complex class 1 (HLA(-))/epithelial cell surface antigen (EPCAM(+)) in coculture with inactivated testicular feeders from the same patient. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Analyses and characterization including immunocytochemistry and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for somatic and germ cell markers, testosterone and inhibin B quantification, and TUNEL assay. RESULT(S): Putative hSSCs appeared in singlets, doublets, or small groups of up to four cells in vitro only when testicular cells were cultured in StemPro-34 medium supplemented with glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting with HLA(-)/EPCAM(+) resulted in an enrichment of 27% VASA(+)/UTF1(+) hSSCs, compared to 13% in unsorted controls. Coculture of sorted cells with inactivated testicular feeders gave rise to an average density of 112 hSSCs/cm(2) after 2 weeks in vitro compared with unsorted cells (61 hSSCs/cm(2)) and differentially plated cells (49 hSSCS/cm(2)). However, putative hSSCs rarely stained positive for the proliferation marker Ki67, and their presence was reduced to the point of almost disappearing after 4 weeks in vitro. CONCLUSION(S): We found that hSSCs show limited proliferation in vitro under mSSC culture conditions. Coculture of HLA(-)/EPCAM(+) sorted cells with testicular feeders improved the germ cell/somatic cell ratio.","['Medrano, Jose V', 'Rombaut, Charlotte', 'Simon, Carlos', 'Pellicer, Antonio', 'Goossens, Ellen']","['Medrano JV', 'Rombaut C', 'Simon C', 'Pellicer A', 'Goossens E']","['Reproductive Medicine Unit, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe (IIS La Fe), Valencia, Spain; Fundacion Instituto Valenciano de Infertilidad (FIVI), INCLIVA, Department of Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Valencia University, Valencia, Spain.', 'Biology of the Testis, Research Laboratory for Reproduction, Genetics and Regenerative Medicine, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Fundacion Instituto Valenciano de Infertilidad (FIVI), INCLIVA, Department of Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Valencia University, Valencia, Spain.', 'Reproductive Medicine Unit, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe (IIS La Fe), Valencia, Spain.', 'Biology of the Testis, Research Laboratory for Reproduction, Genetics and Regenerative Medicine, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium.

RAR agonists are used in the treatment of a number of dermal conditions and specific types of cancer, such as acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, when administered chronically, there is strong evidence that RAR agonists cause hepatosteatosis and liver injury. After compiling information on ligand-protein-interactions, common substructures and physico-chemical properties of ligands were identified manually and coded into SMARTS strings. Based on these SMARTS strings and calculated physico-chemical features, a rule-based screening workflow was built within the KNIME platform. The workflow was evaluated on two datasets: one with RAR agonists exclusively and another large, chemically diverse dataset containing only a few RAR agonists.

Macrophages are in charge of phagocytosis. Innate Immune cells and specific T cells are in charge of immunosurveillance. Little is known on BM cell recruitment and activity as BM aspirate is frequently contaminated with peripheral blood. But evidences suggest an active role of immune cells in protection against MDS and secondary leukemia. BM CD8(+) CD28(-) CD57(+) T cells are directly cytotoxic and have a distinct cytokine signature in MDS, producing TNF-alpha, IL-6, CCL3, CCL4, IL-1RA, TNFalpha, FAS-L, TRAIL, and so on. These tools promote apoptosis of aberrant cells. On the other hand, they also increase MDS-related cytopenia and myelofibrosis together with TGFbeta. IL-32 produced by stromal cells amplifies NK cytotoxicity but also the vicious circle of TNFalpha production. Myeloid-derived suppressing cells (MDSC) are increased in MDS and have ambiguous role in protection/progression of the diseases. CD33 is expressed on hematopoietic stem cells on MDS and might be a potential target for biotherapy. MDS also has impact on immunity and can favor chronic inflammation and emergence of autoimmune disorders. BM is the site of hematopoiesis and thus contains a complex population of cells at different stages of differentiation from stem cells and early engaged precursors up to almost mature cells of each lineage including erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, myelo-monocytic cells (monocyte/macrophage and granulocytes), NK cells, and B cells. Monocytes and B cell finalize their maturation in peripheral tissues or lymph nodes after migration through the blood. On the other hand, T cells develop in thymus and are present in BM only as mature cells, just like other well vascularized tissues. BM precursors have a strong proliferative capacity, which is usually associated with a high risk for genetic errors, cell dysfunction, and consequent cell death. Abnormal cells are prone to destruction through spontaneous apoptosis or because of the immunosurveillance that needs to stay highly vigilant. High rates of proliferation or differentiation failures lead to a high rate of cell death and massive release of debris to be captured and destroyed (1). Numerous macrophages reside in BM in charge of home-keeping. They have a high capacity of phagocytosis required for clearing all these debris.","['Lambert, Claude', 'Wu, Yuenv', 'Aanei, Carmen']","['Lambert C', 'Wu Y', 'Aanei C']","['Immunology Laboratory, Pole de Biologie-Pathologie, University Hospital of St Etienne , St Etienne , France.', 'Haematology Laboratory, Pole de Biologie-Pathologie, University Hospital of St Etienne , St Etienne , France.', 'Haematology Laboratory, Pole de Biologie-Pathologie, University Hospital of St Etienne , St Etienne , France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160720,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['T cell', 'bone marrow', 'macrophage', 'monocytes', 'myelodysplasia']",2016/08/05 06:00,2016/08/05 06:01,['2016/08/05 06:00'],"['2016/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2016.00172 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2016 Jul 20;6:172. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2016.00172. eCollection 2016.,10.3389/fonc.2016.00172 [doi],,,,,PMC4953538,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Less frequent side effects include pancytopenia, febrile neutropenia, flushing, and liver function test abnormalities. Very rare side effects include secondary malignancies, Sweet's syndrome, angioedema, or cardiac arrest. We report the first case report of gastrointestinal perforation complicating imatinib treatment for CML. Unlike other antiangiogenic TKIs such as sunitinib or sorafenib that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and known to cause gastrointestinal perforation, imatininib is a TKI with no known anti-VEGF activity, and so it remains unclear how imatinib would be associated with developing this life threatening complication.

Myelofibrosis is often associated with other conditions, including infections, nutritional/endocrine dysfunction, toxin/drug exposure, and connective tissue diseases, including scleroderma and systemic lupus erythematosus. Absence of clonal markers (JAK2) and heterogeneity of the symptoms often complicate the diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present two cases of systemic lupus erythematosus-induced autoimmune myelofibrosis. The first case is of a 36-year-old African American female with diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus at the age of 12 years. The second patient is a 44-year-old African American male with family history of systemic lupus erythematosus who developed anemia and constitutional symptoms later on. Both patients showed hypercellularity and fibrotic changes of the bone marrow. Moreover, mutational analysis showed that both patients were wild type for JAK2 (V617F and exon 12) and MPL (exon 10). CONCLUSIONS: These two cases illustrate that anemic patients with fibrotic changes in the bone marrow without other clinicopathologic features associated with primary myelofibrosis in the presence of clinical manifestations and history of an autoimmune disease should suggest an autoimmune myelofibrosis.

Therapies such as corticosteroids, cytotoxic and radiotherapy will have harmful effect on bone mineral density (BMD) which can lead to increased possibility of osteoporosis and pathological fractures. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This 3-year cross-sectional study was performed in 50 children with ALL (n=25) and NHL (n=25) at Dr. Sheikh Children's Hospital in Mashhad. Half the patients received chemotherapy alone (n=25), while the other half received chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (n=25). We assessed them in the remission phase by DEXA bone mineral densitometry at the lumbar spine and femoral neck (hip). The survey results were adjusted in accordance with age, height, sex and Body Mass Index. Results : The mean age was 3.93+/- 8.28 years. There was no significant difference in bone biomarkers (Ca, P, ALP, PTH) among ALL, NHL and also the two treatment groups. Children with ALL had lower density at the hip and lumbar spine (p-value<0.001 and p-value=0.018, respectively). Among the total of 50 patients, 3 patients had normal results for detected hip BMD (6%), while 14 (28%) had osteopenia and 33 had osteoporosis (66%). Only one patient had normal BMD among all the patients who received chemotherapy plus radiotherapy, whereas 2 patients had normal BMD with just chemotherapy treatment. Conclusion : Given that 94% of our patients had abnormal bone density, it seems to be crucial to pay more attention to the metabolic status and BMD in children with cancer.","['Ghassemi, Ali', 'Banihashem, Abdollah', 'Ghaemi, Nosrate', 'Elmi, Saghi', 'Erfani Sayyar, Reza', 'Elmi, Sam', 'Esmaeili, Habibollah']","['Ghassemi A', 'Banihashem A', 'Ghaemi N', 'Elmi S', 'Erfani Sayyar R', 'Elmi S', 'Esmaeili H']","['Department of Pediatric, Hematology and Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Pediatric, Hematology and Oncology, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Pediatric, Endocrine and Metabolism, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Pediatric, Intensive Care Unit (PICU), Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Intensive, Care Unit (ICU), Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology and Health Sciences Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'Bone mineral density', 'Chemotherapy', ""Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)"", 'Radiotherapy']",2016/08/05 06:00,2016/08/05 06:01,['2016/08/05 06:00'],"['2016/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/05 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2016 Jul 1;10(3):153-60.,,,,,,PMC4969560,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately, 50% of AML patients do not have clonal chromosomal aberrations and categorize as a cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). About 60% of adult CN-AML has a mutation in exon 12 of NPM1 gene. This mutation is specific for malignant clone and potentially is a good marker of MRD. In this retrospective study, we set up a quantitative test for quantifying NPM1 type A mutation and AML patients carrying this mutation at the time of diagnosis, were followed-up. Materials and Methods : We prepared plasmids containing a cDNA fragment of NPM1 and ABL genes by PCR cloning. The plasmids were used to construct standard curves. Eleven patients were analyzed using established method. Serial PB and/or BM samples (n=71) were taken in 1-3 months intervals (mean 1.5-month intervals) and median follow-up duration after chemotherapy was 11 months (5-28.5 months). RESULTS: In this study, we developed RNA-based RQ-PCR to quantitation of NPM1 mutation A with sensitivities of 10((-5)). The percent of NPMmut/ABL level showed a range between 132 and 757 with median of 383.5 in samples at diagnosis. The median NPMmut transcript level log reduction was 3 logs. Relapse occurred in 54.5% of patients (n=6), all cases at diagnosis demonstrated the same mutation at relapse. In patients who experienced relapse, log reduction levels of NPM1 mRNA transcript after therapy were 4 (n=2), 3 (n=2) and 1 log (n=2). Totally, NPMmut level showed less than 5 log reduction in all of them, whereas this reduction was 5-6 logs in other patients. CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of this study in terms of sample size and duration of follow-up, it showed the accuracy of set up for detection of mutation and this marker has worth for following-up at different stages of disease. Because of high frequency, stability, specificity to abnormal clone and high sensitivity, NPM1 is a suitable marker for monitoring of NPMc+ AML patients.","['Alizad Ghandforoush, Nasrin', 'Chahardouli, Bahram', 'Rostami, Shahrbano', 'Ghadimi, Habibeh', 'Ghasemi, Ali', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir', 'Nadali, Fatemeh']","['Alizad Ghandforoush N', 'Chahardouli B', 'Rostami S', 'Ghadimi H', 'Ghasemi A', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Nadali F']","['MSc, Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Assistant Professor, Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Assistant Professor, Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'MSc Student, Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'PhD Student of Hematology, Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Professor, Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Professor, Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Associate Professor, Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'MRD', 'NPM1 mutation', 'Q-RT-PCR']",2016/08/05 06:00,2016/08/05 06:01,['2016/08/05 06:00'],"['2016/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/05 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2016 Jul 1;10(3):147-52.,,,,,,PMC4969559,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We applied a selective panel of immunohistochemical markers on bone marrow trephine tissue sections and observed their utility in diagnosis and typing of acute leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was done at PSG Institute of Medical Sciences and Research from 1st January, 2008 to 30th June, 2012. Immunohistochemistry was done to detect the expression of Myeloperoxidase (MPO), Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), Cluster of Differentiation 3 (CD3) and Cluster of Differentiation 20 (CD20). RESULTS: On an average, 76 new cases of leukemia are diagnosed each year in our hospital. Of these 28.7% are acute leukemias, which had a bimodal peak age of occurrence with almost equal sex distribution. Only 9 cases could be typed as Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL) purely by morphology. Another 10 cases were typed using cytochemistry. Immunohistochemical panel helped to type 90% of cases. We also identified 1 case of AML of ambiguous lineage. The data were analysed statistically using SPSS version 21 and found out that the immunohistochemistry was found to be extremely significant (p<001) by Chi-Square test. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we suggest the use of this limited panel of markers for routine evaluation of all acute leukemias. It is easier to type using immunohistochemistry rather than flow cytometry, given the disadvantage of the costs involved with the latter.","['Subashchandrabose, Priya', 'Ramiah Madanagopaal, Lakshmikanth', 'Subba Rao, Tadury Madhukar']","['Subashchandrabose P', 'Ramiah Madanagopaal L', 'Subba Rao TM']","['Assistant Professor, Department of Pathology, Saveetha Medical College, Chennai, India.', 'Chief of Lab and Consultant Pathologist, Department of Pathology, Dr Lal Path Labs, Chennai, India.', 'Professor, Department of Pathology, PSG Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Coimbatore, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Classification', 'Diagnosis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Trephine biopsy']",2016/08/05 06:00,2016/08/05 06:01,['2016/08/05 06:00'],"['2016/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/05 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2016 Jul 1;10(3):138-46.,,,,,,PMC4969558,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MTHFR were determined by ARMS-PCR or PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: Our investigation revealed that rs13306561 both TC and TC + CC genotypes decreased the risk of ALL compared to TT genotype (OR=0.32, 95%CI=0.15-0.68, p=0.002 and OR=0.35, 95%CI=0.17-0.70, p=0.003, respectively). In addition, the rs13306561 C allele decreased the risk of ALL in comparison with T allele (OR=0.42, 95% CI=0.22-0.78, P=0.005). MTHFR rs1801131 (A1298C) polymorphism showed that the AC heterozygous genotype decreased the risk of ALL in comparison with AA homozygous genotype (OR=0.43, 95%CI=0.21-0.90, p=0.037). Neither the overall Chi-square comparison of cases and control subjects (2=5.54, p=0.063) nor the logistic regression analysis showed significant association between C677T polymorphism and ALL (OR=1.25, 95% CI=0.69-2.23, p=0.552; CT vs. CC).

Osteopontin (OPN) plays different roles in physiologic and pathologic conditions like: survival, metastasis and cell protection from cytotoxic and apoptotic stimuli. Due to anti-apoptotic effect of OPN in normal and malignant cells, silencing of OPN leads to elevation of sensitivity towards chemotherapeutic agents and attenuates cancer cells migration and invasion. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate OPN roles in modulating curcumin-mediated growth inhibitory on leukemic stem cells (LSCs) colony forming potential and survival in AML cell lines and primary CD34+/CD38- bone marrow-derived AML cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary human CD34+/CD38- cells were isolated from bone marrow mononuclear cells of 10 AML patients at initial state of diagnosis, using a CD34 Multi sort kit. The growth inhibitory effects of curcumin (CUR) were evaluated by MTT and colony-formation assays. Apoptosis was analyzed by 7AAD assay in CD34+ KG-1, U937 cell lines and primary isolated cells. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) against OPN was used for OPN silencing in both cell lines and primary AML cells. Then, transfected cells were incubated with/without curcumin. The change in OPN gene expression was examined by Real-time PCR. RESULTS: CUR inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in both KG-1 and U937 cells and also primary isolated AML cells. OPN silencing by siRNA increased the susceptibility of KG-1, U937 and primary CD34+/CD38- AML cells to apoptosis. Moreover, soft agar colony assays revealed that silencing of OPN with siRNA significantly decreased colony numbers in LSCs compared with the non-targeting group. Furthermore, CD34+/CD38- populations as a main LSCs compartment through OPN overexpression towards CUR treatment might be nullified the inhibitory effects of OPN siRNA on their survival and colony forming potential. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggested that knockdown of OPN using OPN specific siRNA significantly decreased colony numbers in LSCs and this effect might be vetoed by LSCs via induction of OPN overexpressionin combination of CUR and siRNA.","['Mohammadi, Saeed', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H', 'Shaiegan, Mojgan', 'Nikogoftar Zarif, Mahin', 'Nikbakht, Mohsen', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir']","['Mohammadi S', 'Ghaffari SH', 'Shaiegan M', 'Nikogoftar Zarif M', 'Nikbakht M', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghavamzadeh A']","['Iranian Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Education and Research in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran; Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Iranian Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Education and Research in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Iranian Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Education and Research in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Colony forming potential', 'Curcumin', 'Leukemic stem cell', 'Osteopontin', 'SiRNA']",2016/08/05 06:00,2016/08/05 06:01,['2016/08/05 06:00'],"['2016/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/05 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2016 Jul 1;10(3):120-9.,,,,,,PMC4969556,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical features and consequences of febrile neutropenia attacks in children who were treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nighty-six children who received chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in our center between January 1995 and December 2010 were included in the study. The data related to demographic characteristics, treatment features, relapse and febrile neutropenia incidences, risk factors, culture results and prognosis were retrospectively evaluated from the patients' files. RESULTS: A total of two hundred-ninety nine febrile neutropenia attacks observed in the patients during initial treatment and relapse treatment were evaluated. When the incidence of febrile neutropenia was evaluated by years, it was observed that the patients treated after year 2000 had statistically significantly more febrile neutopenia attacks compared to the patients treated before year 2000. When the incidences of febrile neutropenia during initial treatment and during relapse treatment were compared, it was observed that more febrile neutropenia attacks occured during relapse treatment. Fifty-nine percent of all febrile neutropenia attacks were fever of unknown origin. Eighty microorganisms grew in cultures during febrile neutropenia throughout treatment in 75 patients; 86% were bacterial infections (50% gram positive and 50% gram negative), 8% were viral infections and 6% were fungal infections. Coagulase negative staphylococcus (n=17) was the most frequent gram positive pathogen; E. Coli (n=17) was the most commonly grown gram negative pathogen. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it was found that an increase in the incidence of febrile neutropenia occured in years. Increments in treatment intensities increase the incidence of febrile neutropenia while improving survival. Evaluation of febrile neutropenia results by hematology-oncology units in years will be directive in early and successful treatment.","['Ozdemir, Nihal', 'Tuysuz, Gulen', 'Celik, Nigar', 'Yantri, Leman', 'Erginoz, Ethem', 'Apak, Hilmi', 'Ozkan, Alp', 'Yildiz, Inci', 'Celkan, Tiraje']","['Ozdemir N', 'Tuysuz G', 'Celik N', 'Yantri L', 'Erginoz E', 'Apak H', 'Ozkan A', 'Yildiz I', 'Celkan T']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Microbiology, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Public Health, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160601,Turkey,Turk Pediatri Ars,Turk pediatri arsivi,9803140,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'child', 'febrile neutropenia']",2016/08/05 06:00,2016/08/05 06:01,['2016/08/05 06:00'],"['2015/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5152/TurkPediatriArs.2016.2757 [doi]', 'tpa_51_2_79 [pii]']",epublish,Turk Pediatri Ars. 2016 Jun 1;51(2):79-86. doi: 10.5152/TurkPediatriArs.2016.2757. eCollection 2016 Jun.,10.5152/TurkPediatriArs.2016.2757 [doi],,,,,PMC4959745,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, all new compounds and novel strategies which are able to eradicate CLL cells should be considered as valuable clues for a potential future remedy against this malignancy. In the present study, the cytotoxic profiles of natural flavonoids were described in two human CLL cell lines, HG-3 and EHEB, indicating the flavone luteolin as the most potent flavonoid with half-maximal inhibitory constants (IC50) of 37 muM and 26 muM, respectively. Luteolin significantly increased the apoptotic cell population in both cell lines by increasing the activities of caspases-3 and -9 and triggering the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Two flavonols, fisetin and quercetin, were somewhat less efficient in suppressing cellular viability, whereas baicalein, chrysin, (+)-catechin and hesperetin exerted only a small or no response at doses as high as 100 muM. Both fisetin and quercetin were able to augment the cytotoxic activity of luteolin in both cell lines by reducing the IC50 values up to four fold. As a result of this, luteolin displayed cytotoxicity activity already at low micromolar concentrations that could potentially be physiologically achievable through oral ingestion. No other tested flavonoids were capable of sensitizing CLL cells to luteolin pointing to a specific binding of fisetin and quercetin to the cellular targets which interfere with the signaling pathways induced by luteolin. Although further molecular studies to unravel this potentiating mechanism are certainly needed, this phenomenon could contribute to future remedies for prevention and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Sak, Katrin', 'Kasemaa, Kristi', 'Everaus, Hele']","['Sak K', 'Kasemaa K', 'Everaus H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tartu, Estonia. katrin.sak.001@mail.ee.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160804,England,Food Funct,Food & function,101549033,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Flavonols)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'KUX1ZNC9J2 (Luteolin)', 'OO2ABO9578 (fisetin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Flavonols/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Luteolin/*pharmacology', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology']",,,2016/08/05 06:00,2018/02/06 06:00,['2016/08/05 06:00'],"['2016/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c6fo00583g [doi]'],ppublish,Food Funct. 2016 Sep 14;7(9):3815-24. doi: 10.1039/c6fo00583g.

Unanswered questions include how long must a patient continue on TKI therapy, and how does a patient know when he/she can safely stop or finish this therapy? Imagawa et al. have carefully addressed these questions of safety and efficacy using a stop study of the second-generation TKI dasatinib. The results of a multicenter phase II trial termed the ""dasatinib discontinuation"" (DADI) trial indicated that 48% (30/63) of CML patients who had maintained a deep molecular response (DMR) to second-line or subsequent dasatinib therapy for at least for 1 year did not show any signs of disease relapse. Thus, even after it is stopped, dasatinib treatment may decrease the chance of disease relapse and provide a curative benefit to CML patients. This work by Imagawa et al. strongly supports the clinical utility of the second-generation TKI dasatinib for CML treatment.","['Naka, Kazuhito', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo']","['Naka K', 'Ichinohe T']","['1 Department of Stem Cell Biology, 2 Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', '1 Department of Stem Cell Biology, 2 Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comment', 'Journal Article']",20160603,China,Stem Cell Investig,Stem cell investigation,101672113,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)', 'dasatinib discontinuation (DADI)', 'deep molecular response (DMR)', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy']",2016/08/05 06:00,2016/08/05 06:01,['2016/08/05 06:00'],"['2016/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/sci.2016.05.05 [doi]', 'sci-03-2016.05.05 [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Investig. 2016 Jun 3;3:19. doi: 10.21037/sci.2016.05.05. eCollection 2016.,10.21037/sci.2016.05.05 [doi],,,,,PMC4958058,,,,,,,,['Lancet Haematol. 2015 Dec;2(12):e528-35.

In human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), tumor B cells lodge in lymph nodes where interactions with the microenvironment occur. Tumor cell homing stimulates proliferation, such that engagement of the B-cell receptor is important for malignant progression. In the Emu-Tcl1 murine model of CLL, we identified gene expression signatures indicative of a skewed polarization in the phenotype of monocytes and neutrophils. Selective ablation of either of these cell populations in mice delayed leukemia growth. Despite tumor infiltration of these immune cells, a systemic inflammation was not detected. Notably, in progressive CLL, splenic neutrophils were observed to differentiate toward a B-cell helper phenotype, a process promoted by the induction of leukemia-associated IL10 and TGFbeta. Our results suggest that targeting aberrant neutrophil differentiation and restoring myeloid cell homeostasis could limit the formation of survival niches for CLL cells. Cancer Res; 76(18); 5253-65.

METHODS: We retrospectively compared the outcome of 3398 patients above the age of 50 years who underwent 10/10 M-URD (n = 2567), 9/10 (n = 723), or 8/10 (n = 108) mM-URD allo-SCT for acute myeloid leukemia after reduced intensity conditioning regimen between 2000 and 2013. The Kaplan-Meier estimator, the cumulative incidence function, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used where appropriate. RESULTS: HLA matching had no impact on engraftment (p = 0.31). In univariate analysis, in comparison to 10/10 M-URD, mM-URD was associated with higher incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (p = 0.0002), similar rates of chronic GVHD (p = 0.138) but increased incidence of its extensive form (p = 0.047). Compared to 10/10 M-URD, patients transplanted in the first complete remission (CR1) with a 9 or an 8/10 mM-URD had decreased 2-year leukemia free (LFS) (p = 0.005) and overall survivals (OS) (56.7, 46.1, and 50.2 %, respectively, p = 0.005), while outcomes were comparable between all groups for patients transplanted beyond CR1. In multivariate analysis, 9/10 versus 10/10 URD was associated with higher non-relapse mortality (HR 1.34, p = 0.001), similar risk of relapse and chronic GVHD and inferior LFS (HR 1.25, p = 0.0001), and OS (HR 1.27, p = 0.0001). There was no difference in adjusted transplant outcomes between 9/10 and 8/10 mM-URD. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced intensity conditioned allo-SCT with a 10/10 M-URD remains the preferable option for AML patients above the age of 50 years. The use of a 9/10 or an 8/10 mM-URD in patients not having a fully matched donor represents an alternative therapeutic option that should be compared to other alternative donor transplant strategies.","['Rubio, Marie T', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Polge, Emmanuelle', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Schwerdtfeger, Rainer', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Renate, Arnold', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Jindra, Pavel', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Rubio MT', 'Savani BN', 'Labopin M', 'Polge E', 'Niederwieser D', 'Ganser A', 'Schwerdtfeger R', 'Ehninger G', 'Finke J', 'Renate A', 'Craddock C', 'Kroger N', 'Hallek M', 'Jindra P', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['Department of Hematology, Hopital Brabois, CHRU Nancy, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France. mt_rubio@hotmail.com.', 'CNRS UMR 7365, IMoPA, Nancy, France. mt_rubio@hotmail.com.', 'Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France. mt_rubio@hotmail.com.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France. mt_rubio@hotmail.com.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France.

This suggests that future studies need to be conducted with a subset of AML patients characterized by high EGFR expression.","['Mahmud, Hasan', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Ter Elst, Arja', 'Scherpen, Frank J G', 'Qiu, Yi Hua', 'Coombes, Kevin R', 'de Bont, Eveline S J M']","['Mahmud H', 'Kornblau SM', 'Ter Elst A', 'Scherpen FJ', 'Qiu YH', 'Coombes KR', 'de Bont ES']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, PO Box 30.001, 9700 RB, Groningen, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, PO Box 30.001, 9700 RB, Groningen, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, PO Box 30.001, 9700 RB, Groningen, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, PO Box 30.001, 9700 RB, Groningen, The Netherlands. e.s.j.m.de.bont@umcg.nl.""]",['eng'],['Letter'],20160803,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Child', '*Cluster Analysis', 'ErbB Receptors/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*EGFR', '*Kinome', '*Leukemia', '*RPPA']",2016/08/05 06:00,2017/12/02 06:00,['2016/08/05 06:00'],"['2016/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-016-0294-x [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-016-0294-x [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Aug 3;9(1):64. doi: 10.1186/s13045-016-0294-x.,10.1186/s13045-016-0294-x [doi],,,,,PMC4971659,,['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The secondary aim was to evaluate the utility of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography during diagnosis. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma, in a five-year period, were identified. Patient, tumour and treatment characteristics were identified. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging was reviewed and correlated with histopathology findings. RESULTS: Eight patients were identified. There was a delay in diagnosis of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in two patients. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography differentiated metastatic squamous cell carcinoma from low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma with a sensitivity of 88.2 per cent and a specificity of 94.7 per cent. In 38 per cent of patients, compromises in management had to be made. CONCLUSION: The management of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma can be challenging in patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography can be useful in the diagnosis of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma.","['Kader, I', 'Leavers, B', 'Shashinder, S', 'Wylie, B', 'Chi, K-K', 'Sundaresan, P']","['Kader I', 'Leavers B', 'Shashinder S', 'Wylie B', 'Chi KK', 'Sundaresan P']","['Department of Otolaryngology/ Head and Neck Surgery,Gosford,New South Wales,Australia.', 'Department of Otolaryngology/ Head and Neck Surgery,Gosford,New South Wales,Australia.', 'Department of Otolaryngology/ Head and Neck Surgery,Gosford,New South Wales,Australia.', 'Central Coast Clinical School,University of Newcastle,Gosford,New South Wales,Australia.', 'PRP Diagnostic Imaging,Gosford,New South Wales,Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School,University of Sydney,New South Wales,Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Laryngol Otol,The Journal of laryngology and otology,8706896,['0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology/therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Fluorodeoxyglucose F18/metabolism', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology/therapy', 'Positron-Emission Tomography']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Head And Neck Cancer', 'Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma', 'Positron Emission Tomography', 'Skin Cancer', 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma']",2016/08/05 06:00,2017/01/31 06:00,['2016/08/05 06:00'],"['2016/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S002221511600832X [pii]', '10.1017/S002221511600832X [doi]']",ppublish,J Laryngol Otol. 2016 Jul;130 Suppl 4:S45-9. doi: 10.1017/S002221511600832X.,10.1017/S002221511600832X [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IQGAP1 is expressed in all cells, while IQGAP2 and IQGAP3 are mainly expressed in hepatic cells. IQGAP1 has been suggested to be an oncogene, while IQGAP2 is considered a tumor-suppressor gene. However, the relationship between RAS family genes and IQGAP genes remains unclear. We recently demonstrated this interaction in a chemically induced mouse liver cancer. In this study, IQGAP1 expression was partially silenced in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. We investigated the impact of IQGAP1 silencing on the interactions of IQGAP and RAS with several apoptotic proteins, including caspase-3 (CASP3), BCL2-associated X protein (BAX), and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2). Additionally, we investigated the effects of the interactions of these genes on cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, and invasive capacity. IQGAP1 siRNA-treated HepG2 cells showed lower invasive capacity than the control cells, and this reduction was time- and vector concentration-dependent. In addition, IQGAP1 silencing resulted in significantly lower IQGAP1 level and subsequently higher IQGAP2 and IQGAP3 expression in HepG2 cells than in the control. Flow cytometry analyses indicated that the silencing of IQGAP1 can induce early and late apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Additionally, IQGAP2, IQGAP3, CASP3, and BAX were upregulated whereas IQGAP1 and BCL2 were downregulated in the siRNA-treated cells. Furthermore, we observed that the mRNA levels of HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, and MRAS decreased upon IQGAP1 silencing. These findings indicate that IQGAP1 potentially regulates the expression of IQGAP and RAS gene families and demonstrate its regulatory role in the apoptotic network. Taken together, our findings suggest that IQGAP1 silencing plays crucial roles in the apoptosis of HepG2 cells and lowers their proliferative and invasive capacities.","['Zoheir, Khairy Ma', 'Abd-Rabou, Ahmed A', 'Harisa, Gamaleldin I', 'Kumar, Ashok', 'Ahmad, Sheikh Fayaz', 'Ansari, Mushtaq Ahmad', 'Abd-Allah, Adel R']","['Zoheir KM', 'Abd-Rabou AA', 'Harisa GI', 'Kumar A', 'Ahmad SF', 'Ansari MA', 'Abd-Allah AR']","['Pharmacology and Toxicology Department, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. khma25@gmail.com.', 'Cell Biology Department, National Research Centre, Cairo, 12622, Egypt. khma25@gmail.com.', 'Hormones Department, Medical Research Division, National Research Centre, Cairo, 12622, Egypt.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, PO Box 11451, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Vitiligo Research Chair, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Pharmacology and Toxicology Department, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Pharmacology and Toxicology Department, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160803,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (ras GTPase-Activating Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', '*Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'ras GTPase-Activating Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'HepG2 cells', 'IQGAP1', 'RAS', 'siRNA']",2016/08/05 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/08/05 06:00'],"['2016/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13277-016-5283-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-016-5283-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2016 Oct;37(10):13927-13939. doi: 10.1007/s13277-016-5283-8.

Identification of the specific molecular elements of the LTRs that have a role in insertional oncogenesis events is important as it can lead to the development of safer gene transfer vectors. The negative control region (NCR) of the LTR is a particularly well-conserved sequence among mammalian gamma-retroviruses with demonstrated regulatory activity of gene transcription in hematopoietic cells, which led us to hypothesize that this region may have a role in insertional oncogenesis after gamma-retroviral vector (GV)-mediated gene transfer into hematopoietic progenitors. We used an in vitro assay of murine bone marrow cell immortalization to compare the immortalization capabilities of a series of GVs carrying murine leukemia virus (MLV) LTR deletion mutants. Compared with GV carrying the full-length MLV LTR, deletion of the complete LTR enhancer sequence showed significant reduction of immortalization rates. However, the use of a mutant LTR deleted of the enhancer sequence, with exception of the NCR, did not affect immortalization. Importantly, the inclusion of an LTR mutant devoid only of the NCR did show significant reduction of immortalization rates compared with the full LTR sequence. Therefore, our data point to the NCR as a key element for immortalization and justify additional studies to evaluate its specific role in MLV-mediated insertional oncogenesis.","['Ikawa, Y', 'Uchiyama, T', 'Jagadeesh, G J', 'Candotti, F']","['Ikawa Y', 'Uchiyama T', 'Jagadeesh GJ', 'Candotti F']","['Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Human Genetics, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Division of Immunology and Allergy, University Hospital of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160804,England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences']",,,2016/11/04 06:00,2017/08/16 06:00,['2016/08/05 06:00'],"['2016/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['gt201651 [pii]', '10.1038/gt.2016.51 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2016 Nov;23(11):815-818. doi: 10.1038/gt.2016.51.

New vaccines, changing age distribution, prolonged survival among immunocompromised patients and improved sepsis management have created a need for an update of basic facts to inform vaccine recommendations. METHODS: Age, gender and comorbidities were related to manifestations and death for 2977 consecutive patients with IPD in a Swedish region with 1.5 million inhabitants during 13 years before introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) in the infant vaccination program. These data were related to population statistics and prevalence of several comorbidities, and compared with two previous studies giving a total follow-up of 45 years in the same area. RESULTS: The annual incidence was 15/100,000 for any IPD and 1.1/100,000 for meningitis; highest among elderly followed by children < 2 years. It was 2238/100,000 among myeloma patients, followed by chronic lymphatic leukemia, hemodialysis and lung cancer, but not elevated among asthma patients. CFR was 10 % among all patients, varying from 3 % below 18 years to 22 % >/= 80 years. During 45 years, the IPD incidence increased threefold and CFR dropped from 20 to 10 %. Meningitis incidence remained stable (1.1/100,000/year) but CFR dropped from 33 to 13 %. IPD-specific mortality decreased among children <2 years from 3.1 to 0.46/100,000/year but tripled among those >/=65 years. CONCLUSIONS: IPD incidence and CFR vary widely between age and risk groups and over time even without general infant vaccination. Knowledge about specific epidemiological characteristics is important for informing and evaluating vaccination policies.","['Backhaus, Erik', 'Berg, Stefan', 'Andersson, Rune', 'Ockborn, Gunilla', 'Malmstrom, Petter', 'Dahl, Mats', 'Nasic, Salmir', 'Trollfors, Birger']","['Backhaus E', 'Berg S', 'Andersson R', 'Ockborn G', 'Malmstrom P', 'Dahl M', 'Nasic S', 'Trollfors B']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Skaraborg Hospital, 54185, Skovde, Sweden. erik.backhaus@vgregion.se.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden. erik.backhaus@vgregion.se.', ""Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden."", 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Sodra Alvsborg Hospital, Boras, Sweden.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Norra Alvsborg Hospital, Trollhattan, Sweden.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Kungalv Hospital, Kungalv, Sweden.', 'Research and Development Center, Skaraborg Hospital, Skovde, Sweden.', ""Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160803,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,"['0 (Pneumococcal Vaccines)', '0 (Vaccines, Conjugate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunization Programs/statistics & numerical data', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Pneumococcal Infections/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*mortality/prevention & control', 'Pneumococcal Vaccines/immunology', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis/epidemiology', 'Sex Factors', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae/immunology', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Vaccination/statistics & numerical data', 'Vaccines, Conjugate/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Incidence', '*Manifestations', '*Meningitis', '*Mortality', '*Pneumococcal disease', '*Predisposing factors', '*Streptococcus pneumoniae']",2016/08/05 06:00,2017/05/13 06:00,['2016/08/05 06:00'],"['2015/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-016-1648-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-016-1648-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2016 Aug 3;16:367. doi: 10.1186/s12879-016-1648-2.,10.1186/s12879-016-1648-2 [doi],,,,,PMC4972955,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about whether radiation exposure is also a prognostic factor of MDS. We investigated the impact of radiation exposure on the prognosis of MDS in Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors using the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and the revised version (IPSS-R). Subjects were 140 patients with primary MDS diagnosed between 1985 and 2011 and evaluable for IPSS, IPSS-R, and exposure distance. Of those, 31 were exposed at <1.5 km, 35 at 1.5-2.99 km, and 74 at >/=3.0 km. By the end of March 2014, 47 patients (34%) progressed to overt leukemia and 106 (75.7%) died. By comparing with patients exposed at >/=3.0 km, those exposed at <1.5 km had significantly higher frequencies of abnormal chromosome (P = 0.02), intermediate/poor IPSS, and intermediate/poor/very poor IPSS-R cytogenetic category (P = 0.0001, and P < 0.0001, respectively). As with de novo MDS, multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that cytogenetic abnormalities, IPSS karyotype, and IPSS-R cytogenetics were significantly associated with poor survival, and cumulative incidence of leukemic transformation in MDS among atomic bomb survivors, but exposure distance was not associated with any poor outcomes. These suggest that exposure to the greater dose of atomic bomb radiation is associated with developing poor cytogenetic abnormalities in MDS, which might consequently lead to overt leukemia among atomic bomb survivors.","['Matsuo, Masatoshi', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Kondo, Hisayoshi', 'Soda, Midori', 'Jo, Tatsuro', 'Horio, Kensuke', 'Takasaki, Yumi', 'Kawaguchi, Yasuhisa', 'Tsushima, Hideki', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Imanishi, Daisuke', 'Taguchi, Jun', 'Sawayama, Yasushi', 'Hata, Tomoko', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi']","['Matsuo M', 'Iwanaga M', 'Kondo H', 'Soda M', 'Jo T', 'Horio K', 'Takasaki Y', 'Kawaguchi Y', 'Tsushima H', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Imanishi D', 'Taguchi J', 'Sawayama Y', 'Hata T', 'Miyazaki Y']","['Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusya Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Frontier Life Science, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan. masakoiwng@nagasaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Scientific Data Registry, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusya Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Nagasaki Prefectural Cancer Registry, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagasaki Genbaku Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagasaki Genbaku Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, St. Francis Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Nagasaki Harbor Medical Center City Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Nagasaki Harbor Medical Center City Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusya Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusya Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusya Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan. y-miyaza@nagasaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan. y-miyaza@nagasaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan. y-miyaza@nagasaki-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",20160902,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Disasters/history', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*etiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Weapons', 'Patient Outcome Assessment', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['Atomic bomb survivors', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'prognosis', 'radiation exposure', 'therapy-related myeloid neoplasms']",2016/10/30 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2016/08/04 06:00'],"['2016/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13025 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2016 Oct;107(10):1484-1491. doi: 10.1111/cas.13025.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine gene and cytokine expression levels with AML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 42 patients with AML and 85 healthy individuals. Eight SNPs in five cytokine genes, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1), were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer method. RESULTS: We found that the frequencies of the TNF-alpha (-308) GG genotype and G allele were significantly higher in the patients with AML compared to the healthy control group (p = 0.020 and 0.014). The AML patients had significantly lower frequencies of the CC genotype and C allele of the IL-10 (-819 SNP), the G allele of the IL-10 (-1082 SNP), the CC genotype and C allele of the IL-10 (-592 SNP), and the codon 25 GC genotype of TGF-beta1, (p = 0.024, p = 0.012, p = 0.038, p = 0.024, p = 0.012, p = 0.028, respectively). However, no significant differences were found between AML and healthy control groups with respect to the distributions of genotypes in IL-6, IFN-gamma, IL-10 (-1082), TGF-beta1 (codon 10), and haplotypes of IL-10, TGF-beta1 gene. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that functional variants of the TNF-alpha, IL-10, and TGF-beta1 genes may have a significant association with the etiopathogenesis of AML. Further studies with larger groups and different ethnicities are needed to determine the impact of cytokine variants on the risk of developing AML.","['Nursal, Ayse Feyda', 'Pehlivan, Mustafa', 'Sahin, Handan Haydaroglu', 'Pehlivan, Sacide']","['Nursal AF', 'Pehlivan M', 'Sahin HH', 'Pehlivan S']","['1 Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Giresun University , Giresun, Turkey .', '2 Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Gaziantep University , Gaziantep, Turkey .', '2 Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Gaziantep University , Gaziantep, Turkey .', '3 Department of Medical Biology, Istanbul Medical Faculty, Istanbul University , Istanbul, Turkey .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160803,United States,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,101494210,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Codon', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*genetics', 'Interleukin-10/blood/*genetics', 'Interleukin-6/blood/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/blood/*genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/blood/*genetics', 'Turkey']",,,2016/08/04 06:00,2017/04/05 06:00,['2016/08/04 06:00'],"['2016/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/gtmb.2016.0036 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2016 Sep;20(9):544-51. doi: 10.1089/gtmb.2016.0036.

Hence, we examined a cohort of 123 myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients without BCR-ABL1 rearrangement and additional ET patients (n=96) for coexistence of JAK2 and CALR mutations. The frequency of CALR mutations was 20.3% in 123 MPN patients; 31.1% in ET (n=74), 25% in primary myelofibrosis (n=4) and 2.2% in polycythemia vera (n=45). JAK2 and CALR mutations coexisted in 7 (4.2%) of 167 ET patients. Clinical characteristics, progression-free survival (PFS), and elapsed time to achieve partial remission across 4 groups (JAK2+/CALR+, JAK2+/CALR-, JAK2-/CALR+, JAK2-/CALR-) were reviewed. The JAK2+/CALR- group had higher leukocyte counts and hemoglobin levels and more frequent thrombotic events than JAK2-/CALR- group. JAK2 mutations have a greater effect on the disease phenotype and the clinical features of MPN patients rather than do CALR mutation. JAK2+ groups showed a tendency of poor PFS than JAK2- groups regardless of CALR mutation. CALR+ was a predictor of late response to the treatment. Our study also showed that thrombosis was more frequent in ET patients with type 2 CALR mutations than in those with type 1 CALR mutations.","['Kang, Min-Gu', 'Choi, Hyun-Woo', 'Lee, Jun Hyung', 'Choi, Yong Jun', 'Choi, Hyun-Jung', 'Shin, Jong-Hee', 'Suh, Soon-Pal', 'Szardenings, Michael', 'Kim, Hye-Ran', 'Shin, Myung-Geun']","['Kang MG', 'Choi HW', 'Lee JH', 'Choi YJ', 'Choi HJ', 'Shin JH', 'Suh SP', 'Szardenings M', 'Kim HR', 'Shin MG']","['Departments of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, 322 Seoyang-ro, Hwasun-eup, Hwasun-gun, Jeollanam-do, South Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Plus Project, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, South Korea.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, 322 Seoyang-ro, Hwasun-eup, Hwasun-gun, Jeollanam-do, South Korea.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, 322 Seoyang-ro, Hwasun-eup, Hwasun-gun, Jeollanam-do, South Korea.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, 322 Seoyang-ro, Hwasun-eup, Hwasun-gun, Jeollanam-do, South Korea.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, 322 Seoyang-ro, Hwasun-eup, Hwasun-gun, Jeollanam-do, South Korea.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, 322 Seoyang-ro, Hwasun-eup, Hwasun-gun, Jeollanam-do, South Korea.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, 322 Seoyang-ro, Hwasun-eup, Hwasun-gun, Jeollanam-do, South Korea.', 'Department of Cell Therapy, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, Leipzig, Germany.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Dongshin University, Naju, Jeollanam-do, South Korea.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, 322 Seoyang-ro, Hwasun-eup, Hwasun-gun, Jeollanam-do, South Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Plus Project, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, South Korea.', 'Environmental Health Center for Childhood Leukemia and Cancer, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun-eup, Hwasun-gun, Jeollanam-do, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Calreticulin/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Hemoglobins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['calreticulin', 'coexistence', 'essential thrombocythemia', 'myeloproliferative disorders', 'Janus kinase 2']",2016/08/04 06:00,2018/02/24 06:00,['2016/08/04 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10958 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10958 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 30;7(35):57036-57049. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10958.,10.18632/oncotarget.10958 [doi],,,,,PMC5302971,['The authors have no potential conflict of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with low risk cytogenetic features account for 80% of CMML cases and often fall into the low risk categories of CMML prognostic scoring systems, but the outcome differs considerably among them. We performed targeted deep sequencing of 83 myeloid-related genes in 56 CMML patients with low risk cytogenetic features or uninformative conventional cytogenetics (CC) at diagnosis, with the aim to identify the genetic characteristics of patients with a more aggressive disease. Targeted sequencing was also performed in a subset of these patients at time of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation. Overall, 98% of patients harbored at least one mutation. Mutations in cell signaling genes were acquired at time of AML progression. Mutations in ASXL1, EZH2 and NRAS correlated with higher risk features and shorter overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). Patients with SRSF2 mutations associated with poorer OS, while absence of TET2 mutations (TET2wt) was predictive of shorter PFS. A decrease in OS and PFS was observed as the number of adverse risk gene mutations (ASXL1, EZH2, NRAS and SRSF2) increased. On multivariate analyses, CMML-specific scoring system (CPSS) and presence of adverse risk gene mutations remained significant for OS, while CPSS and TET2wt were predictive of PFS. These results confirm that mutation analysis can add prognostic value to patients with CMML and low risk cytogenetic features or uninformative CC.","['Palomo, Laura', 'Garcia, Olga', 'Arnan, Montse', 'Xicoy, Blanca', 'Fuster, Francisco', 'Cabezon, Marta', 'Coll, Rosa', 'Adema, Vera', 'Grau, Javier', 'Jimenez, Maria-Jose', 'Pomares, Helena', 'Marce, Silvia', 'Mallo, Mar', 'Milla, Fuensanta', 'Alonso, Esther', 'Sureda, Anna', 'Gallardo, David', 'Feliu, Evarist', 'Ribera, Josep-Maria', 'Sole, Francesc', 'Zamora, Lurdes']","['Palomo L', 'Garcia O', 'Arnan M', 'Xicoy B', 'Fuster F', 'Cabezon M', 'Coll R', 'Adema V', 'Grau J', 'Jimenez MJ', 'Pomares H', 'Marce S', 'Mallo M', 'Milla F', 'Alonso E', 'Sureda A', 'Gallardo D', 'Feliu E', 'Ribera JM', 'Sole F', 'Zamora L']","['MDS Research Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Departament de Bioquimica i Biologia Molecular, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Duran i Reynals, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'MDS Research Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Josep Trueta, Girona, Spain.', 'MDS Research Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Duran i Reynals, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'MDS Research Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Duran i Reynals, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Duran i Reynals, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Josep Trueta, Girona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'MDS Research Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'gene mutations', 'normal karyotype', 'prognostic factors', 'targeted deep sequencing']",2016/08/04 06:00,2018/02/24 06:00,['2016/08/04 06:00'],"['2016/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10937 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10937 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 30;7(35):57021-57035. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10937.,10.18632/oncotarget.10937 [doi],,,,,PMC5302970,['The authors have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TP53 is involved in cellular responses to dysfunctional telomeres, and its inactivation is the strongest adverse prognostic factor for CLL. Given the biological relationship between TP53 and telomeres, and their prognostic value, it is important to improve our understanding of the impact of TP53 alterations on telomeres. We performed a comprehensive study of the deletions and mutations of the TP53 gene and telomere parameters, including hTERT and the shelterin complex, in 115 CLL patients. We found that any type of TP53 alteration was associated with very short telomeres and high hTERT expression, independently of other biological CLL features. Patients with disrupted TP53 showed telomere deletions and chromosomal end-to-end fusions in cells with complex karyotypes. TP53 disruption was characterized by downregulation of shelterin genes. Interestingly, low expression of POT1, TPP1 and TIN2 was also found in some patients with wild-type TP53 and had an adverse impact on progression-free survival after standard genotoxic therapy. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that patients with disrupted TP53 have severe telomere dysfunction and high genomic instability. Thus, the telomeric profile could be tested as a biomarker in CLL patients treated with new therapeutic agents.","['Guieze, Romain', 'Pages, Melanie', 'Veronese, Lauren', 'Combes, Patricia', 'Lemal, Richard', 'Gay-Bellile, Mathilde', 'Chauvet, Martine', 'Callanan, Mary', 'Kwiatkowski, Fabrice', 'Pereira, Bruno', 'Vago, Philippe', 'Bay, Jacques-Olivier', 'Tournilhac, Olivier', 'Tchirkov, Andrei']","['Guieze R', 'Pages M', 'Veronese L', 'Combes P', 'Lemal R', 'Gay-Bellile M', 'Chauvet M', 'Callanan M', 'Kwiatkowski F', 'Pereira B', 'Vago P', 'Bay JO', 'Tournilhac O', 'Tchirkov A']","['CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Hematologie Clinique, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""EA 7283 CREaT, Universite d'Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", 'Department de Neuropathologie, Hopital Sainte-Anne, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Universite Clermont 1, UFR Medecine, Cytologie Histologie Embryologie Cytogenetique, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Cytogenetique Medicale, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""EA 4677 ERTICa, Universite d'Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", 'Universite Clermont 1, UFR Medecine, Cytologie Histologie Embryologie Cytogenetique, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Cytogenetique Medicale, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""EA 4677 ERTICa, Universite d'Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Hematologie Clinique, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""EA 7283 CREaT, Universite d'Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", 'Universite Clermont 1, UFR Medecine, Cytologie Histologie Embryologie Cytogenetique, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Cytogenetique Medicale, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""EA 4677 ERTICa, Universite d'Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", 'Inserm U823, Institut Albert Bonniot & Universite Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France', 'CHU Grenoble, Laboratoire de Genetique Onco-hematologique, Grenoble, France.', 'Inserm U823, Institut Albert Bonniot & Universite Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France', 'CHU Grenoble, Laboratoire de Genetique Onco-hematologique, Grenoble, France.', ""EA 4677 ERTICa, Universite d'Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", 'Centre Jean Perrin, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""Direction de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation, Departement de Biostatistiques, CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", 'Universite Clermont 1, UFR Medecine, Cytologie Histologie Embryologie Cytogenetique, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Cytogenetique Medicale, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""EA 4677 ERTICa, Universite d'Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Hematologie Clinique, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""EA 7283 CREaT, Universite d'Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Hematologie Clinique, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""EA 7283 CREaT, Universite d'Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", 'Universite Clermont 1, UFR Medecine, Cytologie Histologie Embryologie Cytogenetique, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Cytogenetique Medicale, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""EA 4677 ERTICa, Universite d'Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (POT1 protein, human)', '0 (Shelterin Complex)', '0 (TINF2 protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tripeptidyl-Peptidase 1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.4.- (Serine Proteases)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.14.- (Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases)', 'EC 3.4.14.9 (TPP1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aminopeptidases/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases/metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Serine Proteases/metabolism', 'Shelterin Complex', 'Telomerase/genetics', 'Telomere/*ultrastructure', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Tripeptidyl-Peptidase 1', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['TP53', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'hTERT', 'shelterin', 'telomere']",2016/08/04 06:00,2018/02/24 06:00,['2016/08/04 06:00'],"['2016/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10927 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10927 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 30;7(35):56976-56985. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10927.,10.18632/oncotarget.10927 [doi],,,,,PMC5302966,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It plays a role in signal transduction and as a regulator of B-cell receptor signaling in B-cell development. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to screen exons 9-14 of the CD22 gene, which is a mutational hot spot region in B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL) patients, to find possible genetic variants that could play role in the pathogenesis of pre-B ALL in Turkish children. METHODS: This study included 109 Turkish children with pre-B ALL who were diagnosed at Losante Hospital for Children with Leukemia. Genomic DNA was extracted from both peripheral blood and bone marrow leukocytes. Gene amplification was performed with PCR, and all samples were screened for the variants by single strand conformation polymorphism. Samples showing band shifts were sequenced on an automated sequencer. RESULTS: In our patient group a total of 9 variants were identified in the CD22 gene by sequencing: a novel variant in intron 10 (T2199G); a missense variant in exon 12; 5 intronic variants between exon 12 and intron 13; a novel intronic variant (C2424T); and a synonymous in exon 13. Thirteen of 109 children (11.9%) carried the T2199G novel intronic variant located in intron 10, and 17 of 109 children (15.6%) carried the C2424T novel intronic variant. CONCLUSION: Novel variants in the CD22 gene in children with pre-B ALL in Turkey that are not present, in the Human Gene Mutation Database or NCBI SNP database, were found.","['Aslar Oner, Deniz', 'Akin, Dilara Fatma', 'Sipahi, Kadir', 'Mumcuoglu, Mine', 'Ezer, Ustun', 'Kurekci, A Emin', 'Akar, Nejat']","['Aslar Oner D', 'Akin DF', 'Sipahi K', 'Mumcuoglu M', 'Ezer U', 'Kurekci AE', 'Akar N']","['1 Cancer Genetic Research Laboratory, Losante Hospital , Ankara, Turkey .', '1 Cancer Genetic Research Laboratory, Losante Hospital , Ankara, Turkey .', '1 Cancer Genetic Research Laboratory, Losante Hospital , Ankara, Turkey .', '1 Cancer Genetic Research Laboratory, Losante Hospital , Ankara, Turkey .', '2 Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Losante Hospital , Ankara, Turkey .', '2 Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Losante Hospital , Ankara, Turkey .', '3 TOBB-ETU Hospital , Ankara, Turkey .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160803,United States,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,101494210,"['0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Introns', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Turkey']",,,2016/08/04 06:00,2017/04/05 06:00,['2016/08/04 06:00'],"['2016/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/gtmb.2016.0006 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2016 Sep;20(9):552-5. doi: 10.1089/gtmb.2016.0006.

In mammals, inhibition of Smoothened, the key mediator of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, reduces Chronic Myeloid Leukemia progression and propagation. These findings make Smo a candidate target to inhibit maintenance of leukemia-initiating cells. In Drosophila melanogaster the same pathway maintains the hematopoietic precursor cells of the lymph gland, the hematopoietic organ that develops in the larva. Using Drosophila as an in vivo model, we investigated the mode of action of PF-04449913, a small-molecule inhibitor of the human Smo protein. Drosophila larvae fed with PF-04449913 showed traits of altered hematopoietic homeostasis. These include the development of melanotic nodules, increase of circulating hemocytes, the size increase of the lymph gland and accelerated differentiation of blood cells likely due to the exit of multi-potent precursors from quiescence. Importantly, the Smo inhibition can lead to the complete loss of hematopoietic precursors. We conclude that PF-04449913 inhibits Drosophila Smo blocking the Hh signaling pathway and causing the loss of hematopoietic precursor cells. Interestingly, this is the effect expected in patients treated with PF-04449913: number decrease of cancer initiating cells in the bone marrow to reduce the risk of leukemia relapse. Altogether our results indicate that Drosophila comprises a model system for the in vivo study of molecules that target evolutionary conserved pathways implicated in human hematological malignancies.","['Giordani, Giorgia', 'Barraco, Marilena', 'Giangrande, Angela', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Guadagnuolo, Viviana', 'Simonetti, Giorgia', 'Perini, Giovanni', 'Bernardoni, Roberto']","['Giordani G', 'Barraco M', 'Giangrande A', 'Martinelli G', 'Guadagnuolo V', 'Simonetti G', 'Perini G', 'Bernardoni R']","['Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology (FaBiT), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Present address: Department of Biological Sciences, School of Applied Sciences, University of Huddersfield, Queensgate, Huddersfield, UK.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology (FaBiT), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Present address: Institute of Hematology, ""L e A Seragnoli"", S.

Mutations of the NPM1 gene are the most frequent genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and result in the expression of a mutant protein with aberrant cytoplasmic localization, NPMc+. Although NPMc+ causes myeloproliferation and AML in animal models, its mechanism of action remains largely unknown. Here we report that NPMc+ activates canonical Wnt signaling during the early phases of zebrafish development and determines a Wnt-dependent increase in the number of progenitor cells during primitive hematopoiesis. Coherently, the canonical Wnt pathway is active in AML blasts bearing NPMc+ and depletion of the mutant protein in the patient derived OCI-AML3 cell line leads to a decrease in the levels of active beta-catenin and of Wnt target genes. Our results reveal a novel function of NPMc+ and provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of AML bearing NPM1 mutations.","['Barbieri, Elisa', 'Deflorian, Gianluca', 'Pezzimenti, Federica', 'Valli, Debora', 'Saia, Marco', 'Meani, Natalia', 'Gruszka, Alicja M', 'Alcalay, Myriam']","['Barbieri E', 'Deflorian G', 'Pezzimenti F', 'Valli D', 'Saia M', 'Meani N', 'Gruszka AM', 'Alcalay M']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Milan, Italy.', 'Current address: Gene Expression and Regulation Program, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'The FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology (IFOM) Foundation, Milan, Italy.', 'The FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology (IFOM) Foundation, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Milan, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Oncologia ed Emato-Oncologia, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (AXIN2 protein, human)', '0 (Axin Protein)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axin Protein/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*physiology', 'Zebrafish/*embryology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Wnt signaling', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'nucleophosmin', 'primitive hematopoiesis', 'zebrafish']",2016/08/04 06:00,2018/02/14 06:00,['2016/08/04 06:00'],"['2015/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10878 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10878 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 23;7(34):55302-55312. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10878.,10.18632/oncotarget.10878 [doi],,,,,PMC5342418,,['P30 CA010815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These RNA transcripts termed competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) regulate the distribution of miRNAs on their targets. One corollary from ceRNA interaction is that chromosomal translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) would perturb ceRNA regulation due to altered expression of 3'UTRs. In our study, we demonstrate that expression of PML/RARalpha, the APL-associated fusion oncogene is repressed by c-Myc mRNA transcript independent of protein-coding function but dependent upon microRNA. Attenuation of c-Myc transcript results in PML/RARalpha-degraded cellular phenotypes in APL cells, but these Myc reduction-associated cell phenotypes are sufficient to abrogate in a microRNA dependent manner. We also show that let-7 microRNA family members promote differentiation of All-Trans-Retinoic Acid (ATRA)-induced NB4 cells and their activities are affected by expression levels of both c-Myc and PML/RARalpha through altering miRNA targets. These results indicate that c-Myc mRNA represses PML/RARalpha expression via altering the distribution of let-7 miRNAs on their targets. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of c-Myc as a potential ceRNA for PML/RARalpha in APL.","['Ding, Ye', 'Wang, Ze-Chuan', 'Zheng, Yi', 'Hu, Zheng', 'Li, Yang', 'Luo, Dong-Feng', 'Wang, Shao-Yuan']","['Ding Y', 'Wang ZC', 'Zheng Y', 'Hu Z', 'Li Y', 'Luo DF', 'Wang SY']","['Union Clinical Medical College, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, P.R.

METHODS: In this retrospective interventional case series at a tertiary referral center, 66 eyes of 66 patients with untreated unilateral retinoblastoma were used. intraarterial chemotherapy into the ophthalmic artery under fluoroscopic guidance was performed using melphalan in every case, with additional topotecan as necessary. Intravitreal chemotherapy using melphalan and/or topotecan was employed as needed for active vitreous seeding. Globe salvage was measured based on the International Classification of Retinoblastoma (ICRB) during two eras. RESULTS: The two eras encompassed 2008 to 2012 (intraarterial chemotherapy alone, Era I) and 2012 to 2015 (intraarterial chemotherapy plus intravitreal chemotherapy, Era II). Over this period, there were 66 patients with unilateral untreated retinoblastoma treated with primary intra-arterial chemotherapy. A comparison of features (Era I vs Era II) revealed no significant difference in mean patient age (24 vs 24 months), ICRB groups, mean largest tumor diameter (19 vs 17 mm), mean largest tumor thickness (10 vs 10 mm), vitreous seed presence (56% vs 59%), subretinal seed presence (67% vs 62%), retinal detachment (70% vs 66%), or vitreous hemorrhage (0% vs 5%). There was no significant difference in mean number of intra-arterial chemotherapy cycles (3 vs 3.1) or intraarterial chemotherapy dosages. Following therapy, there was a significant difference (Era I vs Era II) in the need for enucleation overall (44% vs 15%, P = .012), especially for group E eyes (75% vs 27%, P = .039). Four of the eyes that initiated therapy in Era I later required intravitreal chemotherapy during Era II. The enucleation rate was 0% for groups B and C in both eras and non-significant for group D (23% vs 13%). There were no patients with stroke, seizure, limb ischemia, extraocular tumor extension, secondary leukemia, metastasis, or death. CONCLUSIONS: The current era of retinoblastoma management using intra-arterial chemotherapy plus additional intravitreal chemotherapy (as needed for vitreous seeding) has improved globe salvage in eyes with advanced retinoblastoma.

Since macrophages act as the important defense line against invading pathogens in host innate immunity, we investigated the function and innate immune responses of chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) after ALV-J infection in this study. Our results indicated that ALV-J was stably maintained in MDM cells but that the viral growth rate was significantly lower than that in DF-1 cells. We also found that ALV-J infection significantly increased nitric oxide (NO) production, but had no effect on MDM phagocytic capacity. Interestingly, infection with ALV-J rapidly promoted the expression levels of Myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx) (3 h, 6 h), ISG12 (6 h), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) (3 h, 12 h) at an early infection stage, whereas it sharply decreased the expression of Mx (24 h, 36 h), ISG12 (36 h), and made little change on IL-1beta (24 h, 36 h) production at a late infection stage in MDM cells. Moreover, the protein levels of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) had sharply increased in infected MDM cells from 3 to 36 h post infection (hpi) of ALV-J. And, the protein level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) was dramatically decreased at 36 hpi in MDM cells infected with ALV-J. These results demonstrate that ALV-J can induce host innate immune responses and we hypothesize that macrophages play an important role in host innate immune attack and ALV-J immune escape.","['Feng, Min', 'Dai, Manman', 'Cao, Weisheng', 'Tan, Yan', 'Li, Zhenhui', 'Shi, Meiqing', 'Zhang, Xiquan']","['Feng M', 'Dai M', 'Cao W', 'Tan Y', 'Li Z', 'Shi M', 'Zhang X']","['Department of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding and Key Laboratory of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, China.', ""College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding and Key Laboratory of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding and Key Laboratory of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, China.', 'Division of Immunology, Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Department of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, China scauxqz@163.com.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding and Key Laboratory of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160802,England,Poult Sci,Poultry science,0401150,"['0 (Avian Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*immunology/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*immunology', 'Avian Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', '*Chickens', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Macrophages/immunology/virology', 'Male', 'Poultry Diseases/*immunology/virology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ALV-J', '*innate immune response', '*macrophage']",2016/08/04 06:00,2017/04/13 06:00,['2016/08/04 06:00'],"['2016/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0032-5791(19)31245-3 [pii]', '10.3382/ps/pew229 [doi]']",ppublish,Poult Sci. 2017 Jan 1;96(1):42-50. doi: 10.3382/ps/pew229.

This study investigated antitumor activity and toxicity of alemtuzumab with regard to response, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival in patients with human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1)-associated ATL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-nine patients with chronic, acute, and lymphomatous types of ATL were enrolled in a single-institution, nonrandomized, open-label phase II trial wherein patients received intravenous alemtuzumab 30 mg three times weekly for a maximum of 12 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. The overall objective response was 15 of 29 patients [95% confidence interval (CI), 32.5%-70.6%]. The 15 patients who responded manifested a median time to response of 1.1 months. Median response duration was 1.4 months for the whole group and 14.5 months among responders. Median progression-free survival was 2.0 months. Median overall survival was 5.9 months. The most common adverse events were 2 with vasovagal episodes (7%) and 3 with hypotensive episodes (10%), leukopenia (41%) grade 3 and (17%) grade 4, lymphocytopenia (59%) grade 3, neutropenia (31%) grade 3, anemia (24%), and thrombocytopenia (10%). All patients developed cytomegalovirus antigenemia (CMV). Three were symptomatic and all responded to antiviral therapy. Grade 3 or 4 infections were reported in 4 (14%) of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Alemtuzumab induced responses in patients with acute HTLV-1-associated ATL with acceptable toxicity, but with short duration of responses. These studies support inclusion of alemtuzumab in novel multidrug therapies for ATL. Clin Cancer Res; 23(1); 35-42.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of low (11 mM), moderate (25 mM), and high (55 mM) FRU concentrations alone or in combination with rotenone (ROT) or doxorubicin (DOX) in Jurkat cells, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell model. Glucose (GLU) was used as a control. Using different cell analysis techniques, we demonstrated that FRU was predominantly metabolized via oxidative phosphorylation ( approximately 95%) (i.e., lactate production was reduced >120-fold), resulting in endogenous oxidative stress-induced conditions. The cells were characterized by generation of O2(*)(-) (43%)/ H2 O2 (40%) and activation of NF-kappaB ( approximately 95-fold increase, fi), c-Jun-N terminal kinase (JNK), p53 (40-fi), and c-Jun (9-fi). In addition, we observed a loss of DeltaPsim (10%), activation of caspase-3 (50-fi) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF, 2-fi), and condensation and fragmentation of the nuclei [20% by acridine orange/ethidium bromide/Hoechst (AO/EB/H) staining, 15% by flow cytometry] compared to those of GLU 11 at 24 h. Although DOX killed Jurkat cells independent of sugar content in the culture medium, leukemic cells in low, but not high, FRU were extremely sensitive to ROT. Taken together, our findings suggest that Jurkat cells are more susceptible to cell death if forced to shift from GLU metabolism (i.e., aerobic glycolysis) to FRU metabolism (i.e., oxidative phosphorylation) after treatment with mitochondria-targeting molecules. These observations may help elucidate the cell death mechanism of leukemic cells cultured in FRU.","['Diaz-Aguirre, Viviana', 'Velez-Pardo, Carlos', 'Jimenez-Del-Rio, Marlene']","['Diaz-Aguirre V', 'Velez-Pardo C', 'Jimenez-Del-Rio M']","['Neuroscience Research Group, Faculty of Medicine, Medical Research Institute, University of Antioquia (UdeA), Calle 70 No. 52-21 and Calle 62 # 52-59, Building 1, Room 412, SIU Medellin, Colombia.', 'Neuroscience Research Group, Faculty of Medicine, Medical Research Institute, University of Antioquia (UdeA), Calle 70 No. 52-21 and Calle 62 # 52-59, Building 1, Room 412, SIU Medellin, Colombia.', 'Neuroscience Research Group, Faculty of Medicine, Medical Research Institute, University of Antioquia (UdeA), Calle 70 No. 52-21 and Calle 62 # 52-59, Building 1, Room 412, SIU Medellin, Colombia. marlene.jimenez@udea.edu.co.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160817,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '30237-26-4 (Fructose)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Fructose/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Rotenone/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Superoxides/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AIF', '*NF-kappaB', '*apoptosis', '*c-Jun', '*caspase-3', '*fructose', '*oxidative stress', '*p53']",2016/08/04 06:00,2017/03/03 06:00,['2016/08/04 06:00'],"['2016/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbin.10653 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2016 Nov;40(11):1162-1173. doi: 10.1002/cbin.10653.

While AML1-ETO prolongs survival and inhibits differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), other contributory events are needed for cell proliferation and leukemogenesis. We have postulated that specific tumor suppressor genes keep the leukemic potential of AML1-ETO in check. In studying del(9q), one of the most common concomitant chromosomal abnormalities with t(8;21), we identified the loss of an apparent tumor suppressor, TLE4, that appears to cooperate with AML1-ETO to confer a leukemic phenotype. This study sought to identify the molecular basis of this cooperation. We show that the loss of TLE4 confers proliferative advantage to leukemic cells, simultaneous with an upregulation of a pro- inflammatory signature mediated through aberrant increases in Wnt signaling activity. We further demonstrate that inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity partly reverses the pro-leukemic phenotype due to TLE4 knockdown, pointing towards a novel therapeutic approach for myeloid leukemia.","['Shin, Thomas H', 'Brynczka, Christopher', 'Dayyani, Farshid', 'Rivera, Miguel N', 'Sweetser, David A']","['Shin TH', 'Brynczka C', 'Dayyani F', 'Rivera MN', 'Sweetser DA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Divisions of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Medical Genetics, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, United States; Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Divisions of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Medical Genetics, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Divisions of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Medical Genetics, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Molecular Pathology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA 02129, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Divisions of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Medical Genetics, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, United States.

Facebook has become a ubiquitous part of many Americans' lives, and may offer a way for patients and caregivers experiencing a similar illness to exchange specialized health-related support. However, little is known about the content of communication among people who have coped with the same illness on personal Facebook pages. We conducted a content analysis of 12 months of data from 18 publicly available Facebook pages hosted by parents of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, focusing on communication between users who self-identified as parents of pediatric cancer patients. Support exchanges between users with experiential similarity contained highly specialized health-related information, including information about health services use, symptom recognition, compliance, medication use, treatment protocols, and medical procedures. Parents also exchanged tailored emotional support through comparison, empathy, encouragement, and hope. Building upon previous research documenting that social media use can widen and diversify support networks, our findings show that cancer caregivers access specialized health-related informational and emotional support through communication with others who have experienced the same illness on personal Facebook pages. These findings have implications for health communication practice and offer evidence to tailor M-Health interventions that leverage existing social media platforms to enhance peer support for patients and caregivers.","['Gage-Bouchard, Elizabeth A', 'LaValley, Susan', 'Mollica, Michelle', 'Beaupin, Lynda Kwon']","['Gage-Bouchard EA', 'LaValley S', 'Mollica M', 'Beaupin LK']","['a Department of Cancer Prevention and Control , Roswell Park Cancer Institute.', 'b Department of Community Health and Health Behavior , The University at Buffalo.', 'c The National Cancer Institute.', 'd Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology , Roswell Park Cancer Institute.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160802,England,Health Commun,Health communication,8908762,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Caregivers/*psychology', 'Child', '*Communication', 'Humans', '*Information Dissemination', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*psychology/*therapy', 'Parents/psychology', 'Peer Group', 'Social Media/*statistics & numerical data', '*Social Support']",,,2016/08/04 06:00,2018/06/12 06:00,['2016/08/04 06:00'],"['2016/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10410236.2016.1196518 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Commun. 2017 Oct;32(10):1233-1240. doi: 10.1080/10410236.2016.1196518.

We report that Kmt2a conditional deletion in postnatal forebrain is associated with excessive nocturnal activity and with absent or blunted responses to stimulant and dopaminergic agonist drugs, in conjunction with near-complete loss of spike-timing-dependent long-term potentiation in medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Selective ablation of Kmt2a, but not the ortholog Kmt2b, in adult ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens neurons markedly increased anxiety scores in multiple behavioral paradigms. Striatal transcriptome sequencing in adult mutants identified 262 Kmt2a-sensitive genes, mostly downregulated in Kmt2a-deficient mice. Transcriptional repression includes the 5-Htr2a serotonin receptor, strongly associated with anxiety- and depression-related disorders in human and animal models. Consistent with the role of Kmt2a in promoting gene expression, the transcriptional regulators Bahcc1, Isl1, and Sp9 were downregulated and affected by H3K4 promoter hypomethylation. Therefore, Kmt2a regulates synaptic plasticity in striatal neurons and provides an epigenetic drug target for anxiety and dopamine-mediated behaviors.","['Shen, Erica Y', 'Jiang, Yan', 'Javidfar, Behnam', 'Kassim, Bibi', 'Loh, Yong-Hwee E', 'Ma, Qi', 'Mitchell, Amanda C', 'Pothula, Venu', 'Stewart, A Francis', 'Ernst, Patricia', 'Yao, Wei-Dong', 'Martin, Gilles', 'Shen, Li', 'Jakovcevski, Mira', 'Akbarian, Schahram']","['Shen EY', 'Jiang Y', 'Javidfar B', 'Kassim B', 'Loh YE', 'Ma Q', 'Mitchell AC', 'Pothula V', 'Stewart AF', 'Ernst P', 'Yao WD', 'Martin G', 'Shen L', 'Jakovcevski M', 'Akbarian S']","['Department of Psychiatry, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Hess Center for Science and Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Brudnick Neuropsychiatric Research Institute, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, New York, NY, USA.', 'Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitaet, Dresden, Germany.', 'University of Colorado School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, USA.', 'Brudnick Neuropsychiatric Research Institute, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Hess Center for Science and Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Stress Neurobiology and Neurogenetics, Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Psychiatry, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160803,England,Neuropsychopharmacology,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,8904907,"['0 (Dopamine Agents)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Action Potentials/drug effects/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', '*Anxiety/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Circadian Rhythm/drug effects/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dopamine Agents/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*deficiency/genetics', 'Locomotion/drug effects/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*deficiency/genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Neuronal Plasticity/*genetics', 'Neurons/drug effects/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Ventral Striatum/*cytology']",,,2016/08/04 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2016/08/04 06:00'],"['2016/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['npp2016144 [pii]', '10.1038/npp.2016.144 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuropsychopharmacology. 2016 Dec;41(13):3103-3113. doi: 10.1038/npp.2016.144.

Appropriate strategies are ultimately driven by the assessment of patients' fitness to define suitability for intensive induction chemotherapy, which produces high initial remission rates but, increased likelihood of relapse. Old/unfit AML patients still represent an urgent and unmet therapeutic need. Epigenetic deregulation represents a strategic characteristic of AML pathophysiology whereby aberrant gene transcription provides an advantage to leukemic cell survival. Efforts to re-establish impaired epigenetic regulation include hypomethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). AREAS COVERED: The review discusses the underlying mechanisms leading to disruption of lysine acetyltransferases (KAT or HAT)/deacetylase (KDAC or HDAC) balance and the rationale for using the HDACi panobinostat (LBH-589) in AML. EXPERT OPINION: Although panobinostat has produced significant results in myeloma, its efficacy remains limited in AML. Panobinostat exerts pleiotropic activity and lack of specificity, which likely contributes to its inadequate safety in elderly AML patients. Phase I-II trials, utilizing panobinostat associated with well-known chemotherapeutic agents are ongoing and combinations with other druggable targets may likely be evaluated in future trials. The clinical use of this HDACi in AML the near future does not appearing promising.","['Morabito, Fortunato', 'Voso, Maria Teresa', 'Hohaus, Stefan', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Vigna, Ernesto', 'Recchia, Anna Grazia', 'Iovino, Lorenzo', 'Benedetti, Edoardo', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Galimberti, Sara']","['Morabito F', 'Voso MT', 'Hohaus S', 'Gentile M', 'Vigna E', 'Recchia AG', 'Iovino L', 'Benedetti E', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Galimberti S']","['a Hematology Unit, Department of Onco-Hematology , A.O. of Cosenza , Cosenza , Italy.', 'b Biotechnology Research Unit , ASP of Cosenza , Aprigliano (CS) , Italy.', ""c Department of Biomedicine and Prevention , Universita' Tor Vergata , Rome , Italy."", ""d Department of Hematology , Universita' Cattolica S.

Additionally, Hck activity has also been connected with the pathogenesis of HIV-1 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In this study, three-dimensional (3D) QSAR pharmacophore models were generated for Hck based on experimentally known inhibitors. A best pharmacophore model, Hypo1, was developed with high correlation coefficient (0.975), Low RMS deviation (0.60) and large cost difference (49.31), containing three ring aromatic and one hydrophobic aliphatic feature. It was further validated by the test set (r = 0.96) and Fisher's randomization method (95%). Hypo 1 was used as a 3D query for screening the chemical databases, and the hits were further screened by applying Lipinski's rule of five and ADMET properties. Selected hit compounds were subjected to molecular docking to identify binding conformations in the active site. Finally, the appropriate binding modes of final hit compounds were revealed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculation studies.

This is a tightly regulated hierarchical system in which mature circulating blood cells develop from a small population of haematopoietic stem (HSC) and progenitor cells within the microenvironment of the bone marrow. Molecular and genetic abnormalities arising in these stem cells lead to a block in the normal programme of proliferation and differentiation and result in the development of the blood cancers known as the leukaemias and lymphomas. Recently the regulatory role of the bone marrow microenvironment or niche has also become increasingly recognised. The interface between the bone and bone marrow (endosteum) and the region surrounding the blood vessels (perivascular) provide distinct niches harbouring quiescent HSC or proliferative HSC respectively. Current chemotherapeutic regimes can often successfully target the proliferative HSC but disease relapse occurs due to residual quiescent HSC. Understanding these developmental and regulatory processes and the associated cell communication mechanisms are thus crucial to the development of new treatment strategies. The CCN family of proteins have been recognised to play a key role in all aspects of haematopoiesis.,"['Crawford, Lisa Judith', 'Irvine, Alexandra Elizabeth']","['Crawford LJ', 'Irvine AE']","[""Haematology Research Unit, Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Room OG/013, Belfast, BT9 7BL, Northern, Ireland."", ""Haematology Research Unit, Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Room OG/013, Belfast, BT9 7BL, Northern, Ireland. s.irvine@qub.ac.uk.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160803,Netherlands,J Cell Commun Signal,Journal of cell communication and signaling,101308338,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Blood cancer', 'Bone marrow microenvironment', 'Haematopoiesis', 'Leukaemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Stem cells']",2016/08/04 06:00,2016/08/04 06:01,['2016/08/04 06:00'],"['2016/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/04 06:01 [medline]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12079-016-0342-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12079-016-0342-x [pii]']",ppublish,J Cell Commun Signal. 2016 Sep;10(3):197-205. doi: 10.1007/s12079-016-0342-x.

In this setting, earlier detection of emerging BCR-ABL1 KD mutations would offer greater chances of efficacy for subsequent salvage therapy and limit the biological consequences of full BCR-ABL1 kinase reactivation. Taking advantage of an already set up and validated next-generation deep amplicon sequencing (DS) assay, we aimed to assess whether DS may allow a larger window of detection of emerging BCR-ABL1 KD mutants predicting for an impending relapse. METHODS: a total of 125 longitudinal samples from 51 CML patients who had acquired dasatinib- or nilotinib-resistant mutations during second-line therapy were analyzed by DS from the time of failure and mutation detection by conventional sequencing backwards. BCR-ABL1/ABL1%(IS) transcript levels were used to define whether the patient had 'optimal response', 'warning' or 'failure' at the time of first mutation detection by DS. RESULTS: DS was able to backtrack dasatinib- or nilotinib-resistant mutations to the previous sample(s) in 23/51 (45 %) pts. Median mutation burden at the time of first detection by DS was 5.5 % (range, 1.5-17.5 %); median interval between detection by DS and detection by conventional sequencing was 3 months (range, 1-9 months). In 5 cases, the mutations were detectable at baseline. In the remaining cases, response level at the time mutations were first detected by DS could be defined as 'Warning' (according to the 2013 ELN definitions of response to 2nd-line therapy) in 13 cases, as 'Optimal response' in one case, as 'Failure' in 4 cases. No dasatinib- or nilotinib-resistant mutations were detected by DS in 15 randomly selected patients with 'warning' at various timepoints, that later turned into optimal responders with no treatment changes. CONCLUSIONS: DS enables a larger window of detection of emerging BCR-ABL1 KD mutations predicting for an impending relapse. A 'Warning' response may represent a rational trigger, besides 'Failure', for DS-based mutation screening in CML patients undergoing second-line TKI therapy.","['Soverini, Simona', 'De Benedittis, Caterina', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Mancini, Manuela', 'Bavaro, Luana', 'Machova Polakova, Katerina', 'Linhartova, Jana', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Russo, Domenico', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Soverini S', 'De Benedittis C', 'Castagnetti F', 'Gugliotta G', 'Mancini M', 'Bavaro L', 'Machova Polakova K', 'Linhartova J', 'Iurlo A', 'Russo D', 'Pane F', 'Saglio G', 'Rosti G', 'Cavo M', 'Baccarani M', 'Martinelli G']","['Hematology ""L. e A.

Early detection is necessary to prevent the high mortality rate associated with heart failure (HF). We evaluated cardiac function in 142 patients using conventional echocardiography and the phased tracking method (PTM), which was measured using the minute vibration and the rapid motion components, neither of which is recognized in standard M-mode nor in tissue Doppler imaging. For systolic function comparison, we compared left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in conventional echocardiography with the average velocity of ventricular septum myocytes (Vave ) in the PTM. The Vave of 12 healthy volunteers was 1.5 (m/s)/m or more. At baseline of 99 patients, there was a positive correlation between LVEF and Vave in all patients. There were no significant differences in baseline cardiac function between patients with and without HF. There was a negative correlation between the cumulative anthracycline dose and LVEF or Vave among all patients. We determined that Vave 1.5 (m/s)/m was equivalent to LVEF 60%, 1.25 (m/s)/m to 55%, and 1.0 (m/s)/m to 50%. During the follow-up period, there was a pathological decrease in LVEF (<55%) and Vave (<1.25 m/s/m) in patients with HF; decreases in Vave were detected significantly earlier than those in LVEF (P < 0.001). When Vave declined to 1.5 (m/s)/m or less, careful continuous observation and cardiac examination was required. When Vave further declined to 1.0 (m/s)/m or lower, chemotherapy was postponed or discontinued; thus, serious drug-induced cardiomyopathy was avoided in patients who did not relapse. The PTM was superior to echocardiography for early, noninvasive detection and intermediate-term monitoring of left ventricle systolic function associated with anthracycline chemotherapy, among patients with hematologic malignancies.

This study evaluated the immunohistochemical profile of HBME-1 in a panel of 52 normal, dyserythropoietic and neoplastic marrow samples. We compared the staining property of HBME-1 with that of the commonly used erythroid marker, glycophorin A (CD235a) and in each case, we semi-quantitatively evaluated the HBME-1/CD235a-positive cells ratio. In normal samples, HBME-1 labelled scattered immature erythroid precursors. In dyserythropoietic specimens, HBME-1 stained nucleated erythroid precursors in varying degrees, from pronormoblast through normoblast stages, with the highest intensity in immature forms. Overall, the cellular background of non-erythroid progenitors, erythrocytes and neoplastic cells did not react with HBME-1, except in leukaemia cases with myelodysplasia-related changes. Our study shows that HBME-1 is a useful marker to identify immature erythroid precursors and that an HBME-1/CD235a-positive cells ratio >/=10% is associated with dyserythropoiesis.","['Arana, Riad', 'Lusina, Daniel', 'Braun, Thorsten', 'Letestu, Remi', 'Gardin, Claude', 'Martin, Antoine']","['Arana R', 'Lusina D', 'Braun T', 'Letestu R', 'Gardin C', 'Martin A']","['Department of Pathology, Avicenne Hospital, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Biological Haematology, Avicenne Hospital, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Avicenne Hospital, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Biological Haematology, Avicenne Hospital, Bobigny, France University of Paris 13, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Avicenne Hospital, Bobigny, France University of Paris 13, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Pathology, Avicenne Hospital, Bobigny, France University of Paris 13, Bobigny, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160802,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (HBME-1 antigen)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/immunology/*metabolism', 'Biopsy, Large-Core Needle', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Glycophorins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['HEMATOPATHOLOGY', 'HISTOPATHOLOGY', 'IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY']",2016/08/04 06:00,2017/04/06 06:00,['2016/08/04 06:00'],"['2016/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['jclinpath-2016-203850 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2016-203850 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2016 Oct;69(10):933-7. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2016-203850.

In the present study, we have investigated the cytotoxicity of 20 methanol extracts from 10 medicinal plants against the sensitive leukemia CCRF-CEM cells. The most cytotoxic extracts were then further tested on a panel of 8 human cancer cell lines, including various MDR phenotypes. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of the 20 methanol extracts from 10 Cameroonian medicinal plants was determined using a resazurin reduction assay. Meanwhile, flow cytometry was used to measure cell cycle, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). RESULTS: In the preliminary assay using CCRF-CEM cells, 12 extracts from five plants displayed IC50 values below 80 mug/mL, namely Albizia adianthifolia, Alchornea cordifolia, Alchornea laxiflora, Pennisetum purpureum, and Spathodea campanulata. the four best extracts were from two plants: Albizia adianthifolia roots (AAR) and bark (AAB) as well as Alchornea cordifolia leaves (ACL) and bark (ACB) had respective IC50 values of 0.98 mug/mL, 1.45 mug/mL, 8.02 mug/mL and 12.57 mug/mL in CCRF-CEM cells. They were further tested in 8 other cell lines as well as in normal AML12 hepatocytes. IC50 values ranging from 2.71 mug/mL (towards glioblastoma U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells) to 10.30 mug/mL (towards breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231-BCRP cells) for AAB, from 3.43 mug/mL (towards U87MG cells) to 10.77 mug/mL (towards colon carcinoma HCT116 (p53 (-/-) ) cells) for AAR and from 0.11 mug/mL (towards CCRF-CEM cells) to 108 mug/mL (towards leukemia CEM/ADR5000 cells) for doxorubicin (as control drug) were obtained. ACL and ACB extracts displayed selective activities. AAR and ACL extracts induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells, through caspases activation and loss of MMP, while apoptotic cell death was mediated by MMP diruption and increase ROS production for ACL. CONCLUSION: Some of the tested plants namely Albizia adianthifolia, Alchornea cordifolia, Alchornea laxiflora, Pennisetum purpureum, Spathodea campanulata represent a potential source of novel anticancer drugs. Especially, Albizia adianthifolia and Alchornea cordifolia revealed considerable cytotoxic activities that could be exploited to develop phytomedicines to fight cancers including MDR phenotypes.","['Kuete, Victor', 'Tchinda, Cedric F', 'Mambe, Flora T', 'Beng, Veronique P', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Kuete V', 'Tchinda CF', 'Mambe FT', 'Beng VP', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, 55128, Mainz, Germany. kuetevictor@yahoo.fr.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, P.O.

We assessed genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in human macrophage-like U937 cells following infection with Burkholderia pseudomallei, an intracellular bacterial pathogen and the causative agent of human melioidosis. Our analyses revealed significant changes in host cell DNA methylation, at multiple CpG sites in the host cell genome, following infection. Infection induced differentially methylated probes (iDMPs) showing the greatest changes in DNA methylation were found to be in the vicinity of genes involved in inflammatory responses, intracellular signalling, apoptosis and pathogen-induced signalling. A comparison of our data with reported methylome changes in cells infected with M. tuberculosis revealed commonality of differentially methylated genes, including genes involved in T cell responses (BCL11B, FOXO1, KIF13B, PAWR, SOX4, SYK), actin cytoskeleton organisation (ACTR3, CDC42BPA, DTNBP1, FERMT2, PRKCZ, RAC1), and cytokine production (FOXP1, IRF8, MR1).

Vosaroxin has chemical and pharmacologic characteristics distinct from other topoisomerase II inhibitors due to its quinolone scaffold. The efficacy and safety of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine were evaluated in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a phase III, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (VALOR). In this study, the addition of vosaroxin produced a 1.4-month improvement in median overall survival (OS; 7.5 months with vosaroxin/cytarabine vs. 6.1 months with placebo/cytarabine; hazard ratio [HR] 0.87, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.73-1.02; unstratified log-rank p [Formula: see text] 0.061; stratified log-rank p [Formula: see text]0.024), with the greatest OS benefit observed in patients >/=60 years of age (7.1 vs. 5.0 months; HR 0.75, 95 % CI 0.62-0.92; p [Formula: see text]0.003) and patients with early relapse (6.7 vs. 5.2 months; HR 0.77, 95 % CI 0.59-1.00; p [Formula: see text] 0.039), two AML patient groups that typically have poor prognosis.

Looking for novel agents with anti-MDR activity is an effectively way to overcome cancer drug resistance. Our previous study showed that podophyllotoxin derivative exhibited potent anti-proliferative effect and down-regulated the expression level of P-gp in K562/ADR cells, which probably was related with the MAPK pathways. However, the relation of P-gp expression and MAPK pathways still remains unclear. In this study, a series of aromatic heterocyclic esters of podophyllotoxin were synthesized and their anticancer effects were evaluated against two human chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines (K562 and K562/ADR), simultaneously, the initial structure-activity relationship was summarized. The most potent compound, Z5, displayed an IC50 value of 0.032 +/- 0.006 muM against K562/ADR cells, with a lower resistant factor value of 1.280. Treatment of K562/ADR cells with Z5 caused S cell cycle arrest through reductions in cyclinA, cyclinB1, CDK1 and CDK2 levels. Moreover, Z5 treatment resulted in the induction of apoptosis as characterized by DNA staining, flow cytometry analysis and cleavage of procaspases-3, -8, -9 and PARP. Notably, Z5 significantly inhibited P-gp expression in K562/ADR cells. Additionally, Z5 also caused reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which was further demonstrated by preincubation with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Western blotting revealed that Z5 markedly stimulated the MAPK pathways, including ERK1/2, JNK and P38, however, the mechanisms were prevented by NAC. Finally, the employment of NAC and MAPK inhibitors (U0126, SP600125 and SB203580) remarkably blocked the S phase arrest, apoptosis and down-regulation of P-gp induced by Z5. Taken together, Z5 strongly possessed the potential anti-MDR activity in K562/ADR cells through ROS/MAPK pathways-dependent S phase arrest, apoptosis and down-regulation of P-gp expression.","['Zhang, Lei', 'Zhang, Zeguo', 'Chen, Fan', 'Chen, Yongzheng', 'Lin, Ya', 'Wang, Jing']","['Zhang L', 'Zhang Z', 'Chen F', 'Chen Y', 'Lin Y', 'Wang J']","['School of Pharmacy, Zunyi Medical University, 201 Dalian Road, Zunyi 563003, PR China.

Elderly FCA patients died more frequently from causes not related to CLL, and more often related to comorbidity (mostly cardiovascular) than to infection. In a Cox multivariate analysis, del(17p), performance status >0, and comorbidity were associated with a higher non-CLL-related mortality in the elderly independent of the treatment modality.

METHODS: In the middle of 2015, 261 cancer registries submitted reports on new cancer cases and deaths occurred in 2012. Qualified data from 193 registries were used for analysis after evaluation. Crude rates, number of cases, and age-standardized rates stratified by area (urban/rural), sex, age group, and cancer type were calculated according to the national population in 2012. RESULTS: The covered population were 198,060,406 from 193 qualified cancer registries (74 urban and 119 rural registries). The major indicators of quality control, percentage of cases morphologically verified (MV%), death certificate-only cases (DCO%), and the mortality to incidence (M/I) ratio, were 69.13%, 2.38%, and 0.62, respectively. It was estimated that there were 3,586,200 new cancer cases and 2,186,600 cancer deaths in 2012 in China with an incidence of 264.85/100,000 [age-standardized rate of incidence by the Chinese standard population (ASRIC) of 191.89/100,000] and a mortality of 161.49/100,000 [age-standardized rate of mortality by the Chinese standard population (ASRMC) of 112.34/100,000]. The ten most common cancer sites were the lung, stomach, liver, colorectum, esophagus, female breast, thyroid, cervix, brain, and pancreas, accounting for approximately 77.4% of all new cancer cases. The ten leading causes of cancer death were lung cancer, liver cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, female breast cancer, brain tumor, leukemia, and lymphoma, accounting for 84.5% of all cancer deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous cancer registry data provides basic information in cancer control programs. The cancer burden in China is gradually increasing, both in urban and rural areas, in males and females. Efficient cancer prevention and control, such as health education, tobacco control, and cancer screening, should be paid attention by the health sector and the whole society of China.","['Chen, Wanqing', 'Zheng, Rongshou', 'Zeng, Hongmei', 'Zhang, Siwei']","['Chen W', 'Zheng R', 'Zeng H', 'Zhang S']","['National Office for Cancer Prevention and Control & National Central Cancer Registry, National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100021, P.

Herein a new method was proposed for preparing the effective chitosan-based gene carrier nanogel. The new method based on the fact that supra-molecular interactions between silica, polyethylenimine (PEI) and chitosan could be used to self-assemble them together to form a rigid and stable gene carrier material in the reverse microemulsion system. When compared with chemical cross-linking route, the proposed method is simple and easy to adjust components of the resulting nanogel and, therefore, can improve its gene carrying ability.

It is characterized by specific laboratory and clinical criteria in order to prove that kidney disorders result from cytolysis of tumour cells after chemotherapy regimen given, although on significantly fewer occasions it is likely to occur spontaneously or after radiotherapy. Essentially, failure is the disorder of functionally conserved kidney or of kidney with varying degrees of renal insufficiency, which render the kidney impaired and unable to effectively eliminate the end products of massive cytolysis and to correct the resulting disorders: hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphatemia, and others. The risk of TLS depends on tumour size, proliferative potential of malignant cells, renal function and the presence of accompanying diseases and disorders. Hydration providing adequate diuresis and administration of urinary suppressants (allopurinol, febuxostat) significantly reduce the risk of developing TLS. If prevention of renal impairment isn't possible, the treatment should be supplemented with hemodynamic monitoring and pharmacological support, with the possible application of recombinant urate-oxidase enzyme (rasburicase).

An increased serum level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) was registered while the levels of IL-1alpha and IL-1beta were normal. The patient failed to achieve remission on two induction regimens but achieved one after the successful allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which lasted for six months, after which he developed a relapse and died. CONCLUSION: The presented case may serve as a clinical demonstration of possible involvement of TNF-alpha as a pathogenic factor in the evolution of osteolytic lesions that are occasionally observed in patients with ALL.

The risk of AL following exposure to lower doses due to natural background radiation (NBR) has yet to be conclusively determined. METHODS: AL cases diagnosed over 1990-2009 (9,056 cases) were identified and their municipality of residence at diagnosis collected by the National Registry of Childhood Cancers. The Geocap study, which included the 2,763 cases in 2002-2007 and 30,000 population controls, was used for complementary analyses. NBR exposures were modeled on a fine scale (36,326 municipalities) based on measurement campaigns and geological data. The power to detect an association between AL and dose to the red bone marrow (RBM) fitting UNSCEAR (United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation) predictions was 92%, 45% and 99% for exposure to natural gamma radiation, radon and total radiation, respectively. RESULTS: AL risk, irrespective of subtype and age group, was not associated with the exposure of municipalities to radon or gamma radiation in terms of yearly exposure at age reached, cumulative exposure or RBM dose. There was no confounding effect of census-based socio-demographic indicators, or environmental factors (road traffic, high voltage power lines, vicinity of nuclear plants) related to AL in the Geocap study. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support the hypothesis that residential exposure to NBR increases the risk of AL, despite the large size of the study, fine scale exposure estimates and wide range of exposures over France. However, our results at the time of diagnosis do not rule out a slight association with gamma radiation at the time of birth, which would be more in line with the recent findings in the UK and Switzerland.","['Demoury, Claire', 'Marquant, Fabienne', 'Ielsch, Geraldine', 'Goujon, Stephanie', 'Debayle, Christophe', 'Faure, Laure', 'Coste, Astrid', 'Laurent, Olivier', 'Guillevic, Jerome', 'Laurier, Dominique', 'Hemon, Denis', 'Clavel, Jacqueline']","['Demoury C', 'Marquant F', 'Ielsch G', 'Goujon S', 'Debayle C', 'Faure L', 'Coste A', 'Laurent O', 'Guillevic J', 'Laurier D', 'Hemon D', 'Clavel J']","[""INSERM, Universite Paris-Descartes, Universite Sorbonne-Paris-Cite, CRESS-EPICEA Epidemiologie des cancers de l'enfant et de l'adolescent, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160802,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)'],IM,"['*Background Radiation', 'Child', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Gamma Rays', 'Housing/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Radiation Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Radon', 'Risk Assessment']",,,2016/08/03 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/08/03 06:00'],"['2016/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1289/EHP296 [doi]', 'EHP296 [pii]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2017 Apr;125(4):714-720. doi: 10.1289/EHP296.

Current diagnosis of this disease is not effective during the early stages and it is easily misdiagnosed as other NK cell disorders. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and flow cytometric immunophenotype of 47 patients with ANKL. Patients with extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTL) and chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK cell (CLPD-NK), who were diagnosed during the same time period were used for comparisons. Abnormal NK cells in ANKL were found to have a distinctiveCD56bright/CD16dim immunophenotype and markedly increased Ki-67 expression, whereas CD57 negativity and reduced expression of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR), CD161, CD7, CD8 and perforin were exhibited compared with other NK cell proliferative disorders (p<0.05). The positive rates of flow cytometry detection (97.4%) was higher than those of cytomorphological (89.5%), immunohistochemical (90%), cytogenetic (56.5%) and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computer tomography (18-FDG-PET/CT) examinations (50%) (p<0.05).

Further, the mechanism is investigated. METHODS: In vitro, a modified MTT method was used to assay the cytotoxicities of actein and 26-deoxyactein in 12 human tumor cell lines. In vivo, mouse sarcoma S180 and human lung cancer A549 cells were respectively implanted subcutaneously in ICR mice and nude mice to establish implanted tumor models. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to assay the cycle distribution of the tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure CD31-positive expression in the xenogrft tumor by analyzing microvessel density (MVD). In addition, acute toxicities of actein and 26-deoxyactein were also evaluated. RESULTS: Actein and 26-deoxyactein inhibited the proliferation of the 12 human cancer cell lines tested with the values of 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) between 12.29 and 88.39 mug/mL. In vivo, both actein (3-27 mg/kg) and 26-deoxyactein (3-27 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the growth of the implanted sarcoma S180 in a dose-dependent manner. Actein (10, 30 mg/kg) and 26-deoxyactein (10, 30 mg/kg) markedly inhibited the xenograft growth with T/C (%) values of 38%, 55% for actein, and 35%, 49% for 26-deoxyactein. Compared with the vehicle control, actein (10, 30 mg/kg) and 26-deoxyactein (10, 30 mg/kg) significantly reduced the MVD in the xenograft tumor. The FCM result showed that human leukemia HL-60 cells were arrested at G(1) phase after treated with either actein (6.25-25 mug/mL) or 26-deoxyactein (6.25-25 mug/mL) for 48 h. A limited trial in mice showed that both of the minimal lethal doses (MLDs) of actein and 26-deoxyactein were over 5 g/kg. CONCLUSIONS: Both actein and 26-deoxyactein have low toxicities. Importantly, both these two tetracyclic triterpenoids compounds isolated from rhizome of Cimicifuga foetida L. have significant antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo, which is associated with cell cycle arrest and angiogenesis inhibition.","['Wu, Desong', 'Yao, Qi', 'Chen, Yajuan', 'Hu, Xiaodong', 'Qing, Chen', 'Qiu, Minghua']","['Wu D', 'Yao Q', 'Chen Y', 'Hu X', 'Qing C', 'Qiu M']","['School of Pharmaceutical Science &amp; Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pharmacology for Natural Products, Kunming Medical University, Kunming 650500, China. wudesong14@163.com.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yunnan Institute of Materia Medica, Kunming 650111, China. wudesong14@163.com.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yunnan Institute of Materia Medica, Kunming 650111, China. yaoqi313@126.com.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Science &amp; Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pharmacology for Natural Products, Kunming Medical University, Kunming 650500, China. chenyajuan0873@163.com.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233030, China. huxiaodongzhi@126.com.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Science &amp; Yunnan Key Laboratory of Pharmacology for Natural Products, Kunming Medical University, Kunming 650500, China. qing_cchen@126.com.', 'Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650201, China. qiuminghua@mail.kib.ac.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160730,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '2D5AUV13AX (26-deoxyactein)', 'I14QO4LW9V (actein)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cimicifuga/*chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, Nude', 'Plant Roots/chemistry', 'Rhizome/*chemistry', 'Saponins/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Sarcoma 180/*drug therapy', 'Triterpenes/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['26-deoxyactein', 'IC50', 'actein', 'antitumor activity', 'cell cycle']",2016/08/03 06:00,2017/04/15 06:00,['2016/08/03 06:00'],"['2016/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules21081001 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules21081001 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2016 Jul 30;21(8). pii: molecules21081001. doi: 10.3390/molecules21081001.,10.3390/molecules21081001 [doi] E1001 [pii],,,,,PMC6273521,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we synthesized new honokiol analogues (HAs) that possess common features of both groups. We assessed the anti-tumor effectiveness of HAs in B-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells, namely in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells ex vivo and in pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Nalm-6), Burkitt lymphoma (BL; Raji), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; Toledo) and multiple myeloma (MM; RPMI 8226) cell lines. Four of these compounds appeared to be significantly active against the majority of cells examined, with no significant impact on healthy lymphocytes. These active HAs induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, causing significant deregulation of several apoptosis-regulating proteins. Overall, these compounds downregulated Bcl-2 and XIAP and upregulated Bax, Bak and survivin proteins. In conclusion, some of the HAs are potent tumor-selective inducers of apoptosis in ex vivo CLL and in BL, DLBCL and MM cells in vitro. Further preclinical studies of these agents are recommended.","['Medra, Aleksandra', 'Witkowska, Magdalena', 'Majchrzak, Agata', 'Cebula-Obrzut, Barbara', 'Bonner, Michael Y', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Arbiser, Jack L', 'Smolewski, Piotr']","['Medra A', 'Witkowska M', 'Majchrzak A', 'Cebula-Obrzut B', 'Bonner MY', 'Robak T', 'Arbiser JL', 'Smolewski P']","['Department of Experimental Hematology of Medical University of Lodz, Cio&#322;kowskiego 2 Street, Lodz 93-510, Poland. olajeske@o2.pl.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology of Medical University of Lodz, Cio&#322;kowskiego 2 Street, Lodz 93-510, Poland. magdamalicka@gmail.com.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology of Medical University of Lodz, Cio&#322;kowskiego 2 Street, Lodz 93-510, Poland. majchrzak_agata@o2.pl.', 'Department of Hematology of Medical University of Lodz, Cio&#322;kowskiego 2 Street, Lodz 93-510, Poland. majchrzak_agata@o2.pl.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology of Medical University of Lodz, Cio&#322;kowskiego 2 Street, Lodz 93-510, Poland. barbara_cebula@wp.pl.', 'Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, 101 Woodruff Cir, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. mybonne@emory.edu.', 'Department of Hematology of Medical University of Lodz, Cio&#322;kowskiego 2 Street, Lodz 93-510, Poland. robaktad@csk.umed.lodz.pl.', 'Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, 101 Woodruff Cir, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. jarbise@emory.edu.', 'Atlanta Veterans Administration Hospital, 1670 Clairmont Road, Decatur, GA 30033, USA. jarbise@emory.edu.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology of Medical University of Lodz, Cio&#322;kowskiego 2 Street, Lodz 93-510, Poland. piotr_smolewski@wp.pl.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160730,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Lignans)', '0 (Trityl Compounds)', '11513CCO0N (honokiol)', '8O4UTW9E17 (triphenylmethane)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lignans/*pharmacology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Trityl Compounds/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'BL', 'CLL', 'DLBCL', 'MM', 'honokiol analogues']",2016/08/03 06:00,2017/04/15 06:00,['2016/08/03 06:00'],"['2016/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules21080995 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules21080995 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2016 Jul 30;21(8). pii: molecules21080995. doi: 10.3390/molecules21080995.,10.3390/molecules21080995 [doi] E995 [pii],,,,,PMC6274336,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Baltimore arrived at the same discovery through his studies on replication of RNA-containing viruses, starting with poliovirus and then moving to vesicular stomatitis virus, where he discovered a virion RNA polymerase. Subsequent studies of reverse transcriptase led to the elucidation of the mechanism of retrovirus replication, the discovery of oncogenes, the advent of molecular cloning, the search for human cancer viruses, and the discovery and treatment of HIV/AIDS.","['Coffin, John M', 'Fan, Hung']","['Coffin JM', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts 02111; email: john.coffin@tufts.edu.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, California 92697.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20160722,United States,Annu Rev Virol,Annual review of virology,101625721,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Oncogenes/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/classification/*genetics/physiology', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*David Baltimore', '*HIV', '*Howard Temin', '*RNA tumor virus', '*Rous sarcoma virus', '*murine leukemia virus', '*retrovirus']",2016/08/03 06:00,2017/11/10 06:00,['2016/08/03 06:00'],"['2016/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-035556 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Virol. 2016 Sep 29;3(1):29-51. doi: 10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-035556.

We evaluated a human application of T cells that were genetically modified using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon/transposase system to express a CD19-specific CAR. METHODS: T cells were genetically modified using DNA plasmids from the SB platform to stably express a second-generation CD19-specific CAR and selectively propagated ex vivo with activating and propagating cells (AaPCs) and cytokines. Twenty-six patients with advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia safely underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and infusion of CAR T cells as adjuvant therapy in the autologous (n = 7) or allogeneic settings (n = 19). RESULTS: SB-mediated genetic transposition and stimulation resulted in 2,200- to 2,500-fold ex vivo expansion of genetically modified T cells, with 84% CAR expression, and without integration hotspots. Following autologous HSCT, the 30-month progression-free and overall survivals were 83% and 100%, respectively. After allogeneic HSCT, the respective 12-month rates were 53% and 63%. No acute or late toxicities and no exacerbation of graft-versus-host disease were observed. Despite a low antigen burden and unsupportive recipient cytokine environment, CAR T cells persisted for an average of 201 days for autologous recipients and 51 days for allogeneic recipients. CONCLUSIONS: CD19-specific CAR T cells generated with SB and AaPC platforms were safe, and may provide additional cancer control as planned infusions after HSCT. These results support further clinical development of this nonviral gene therapy approach. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Autologous, NCT00968760; allogeneic, NCT01497184; long-term follow-up, NCT01492036.

Today, key questions remain regarding the mechanisms involved in the long-term development of dasatinib-induced PAH. Here, we demonstrated that chronic dasatinib therapy causes pulmonary endothelial damage in humans and rodents. We found that dasatinib treatment attenuated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction responses and increased susceptibility to experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH) in rats, but these effects were absent in rats treated with imatinib, another BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, dasatinib treatment induced pulmonary endothelial cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, while imatinib did not. Dasatinib treatment mediated endothelial cell dysfunction via increased production of ROS that was independent of Src family kinases. Consistent with these findings, we observed elevations in markers of endothelial dysfunction and vascular damage in the serum of CML patients who were treated with dasatinib, compared with CML patients treated with imatinib. Taken together, our findings indicate that dasatinib causes pulmonary vascular damage, induction of ER stress, and mitochondrial ROS production, which leads to increased susceptibility to PH development.","['Guignabert, Christophe', 'Phan, Carole', 'Seferian, Andrei', 'Huertas, Alice', 'Tu, Ly', 'Thuillet, Raphael', 'Sattler, Caroline', 'Le Hiress, Morane', 'Tamura, Yuichi', 'Jutant, Etienne-Marie', 'Chaumais, Marie-Camille', 'Bouchet, Stephane', 'Maneglier, Benjamin', 'Molimard, Mathieu', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Sitbon, Olivier', 'Simonneau, Gerald', 'Montani, David', 'Humbert, Marc']","['Guignabert C', 'Phan C', 'Seferian A', 'Huertas A', 'Tu L', 'Thuillet R', 'Sattler C', 'Le Hiress M', 'Tamura Y', 'Jutant EM', 'Chaumais MC', 'Bouchet S', 'Maneglier B', 'Molimard M', 'Rousselot P', 'Sitbon O', 'Simonneau G', 'Montani D', 'Humbert M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160802,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dasatinib/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'E-Selectin/blood', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Pulmonary/*chemically induced', 'Hypoxia/metabolism', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/blood', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lung/*blood supply/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/blood']",,,2016/08/03 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2016/08/03 06:00'],"['2015/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['86249 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI86249 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2016 Sep 1;126(9):3207-18. doi: 10.1172/JCI86249.

In sheep, intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in an increase in gene expression for LIF in the arcuate nucleus ( < 0.01). In the same experiment, agouti related protein (AgRP) expression was elevated ( < 0.05) but there were no effects on proopiomelanocortin expression. Another group of sheep were provided intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of LIF at 250, 500, 1,000, and 2,500 ng per sheep. Cumulative feed intake was inhibited by the 1,000- and 2,500-ng doses at 8 and 10 h after ICV injection ( < 0.03). All doses of LIF elevated temperature above 40 degrees C, indicating a fever. When AgRP was intracerebroventricularly injected before LIF, there was no effect of LIF to reduce feed intake, suggesting the LIF inhibition of feed intake is consistent with the concept that the effect is mediated by the melanocortin-4 receptor. In an experiment to determine whether endocrine and metabolic effects of LIF were similar to reported effects of LPS, sheep were intracerebroventricularly injected with 2,500 ng LIF, and blood samples were collected at 10-min intervals for 6 h for assay of LH, samples from the first 3 h were assayed for GH, and samples at 30-min intervals were assayed for glucose and free fatty acids. The effect of treatment and treatment x time interaction was significant, indicating elevated plasma free fatty acids ( < 0.03 and < 0.001, respectively) and glucose ( < 0.01 and < 0.0001, respectively). There was also a treatment x time interaction on circulating concentrations of LH such that LIF caused LH to decrease ( < 0.0001). Additionally, there was a tendency for LIF treatment to increase circulating concentrations of GH (P = 0.0874). The effects of LIF on feed intake and other parameters was similar to the effects of LPS and leads to a hypothesis that LIF expression in response to LPS may be a component of the mechanism for feed intake inhibition and perhaps for changes in selected hormone and metabolites in disease models.","['Daniel, J A', 'Whitlock, B K', 'Marks, D L', 'Gard, J A', 'Sartin, J L']","['Daniel JA', 'Whitlock BK', 'Marks DL', 'Gard JA', 'Sartin JL']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Anim Sci,Journal of animal science,8003002,"['0 (Agouti-Related Protein)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)']",IM,"['Agouti-Related Protein/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Appetite/drug effects', 'Eating/*drug effects/physiology', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/blood', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*toxicity', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4/genetics/metabolism', 'Sheep/*physiology', 'Time Factors']",,,2016/08/03 06:00,2017/06/15 06:00,['2016/08/03 06:00'],"['2016/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2527/jas.2016-0396 [doi]'],ppublish,J Anim Sci. 2016 Jul;94(7):2789-97. doi: 10.2527/jas.2016-0396.,10.2527/jas.2016-0396 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed method involves cluster generation, selection of the best k-value or c-values, cluster identification, identifying the altered gene cluster, scoring an altered gene cluster and determining the best k-value or c-value exploring through biological repositories. The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated on three gene expression data sets dealing with human lung cancer, colon cancer, and leukemia.

This suggests that residual leukemic cells may escape to chemotherapy and immune system. Natural killer (NK) cells from AML patients (AML-NK) have a weaker natural cytotoxicity-activating receptors (NCRs) expression than NK cells from healthy donors (HD-NK). Coding genes for NCR1/NKp46, NCR2/NKp44 and NCR3/NKp30 are located at different loci on two different chromosomes; however, their expression is tightly coordinated. Most NK cells express either high (NCR(bright)) or low levels (NCR(dull)) of all three NCRs. This suggests the existence of negative/positive regulation factor(s) common to the three receptors. In order to find transcription factor(s) or pathway(s) involved in NCRs co-regulation, this study compared the transcriptomic signature of HD-NK and AML-NK cells, before and after in vitro NK cells culture. Microarrays analysis revealed a specific NK cells transcriptomic signature in patients with AML. However, in vitro NK cells expansion erased this signature and up-regulated expression of central molecules of NK functions, such as NCR, NKG2D and also ETS-1, regardless of their origin, i.e., AML-NK vs HD-NK. ETS-1 transcription factor was shown to bind to a specific and common region in the NCRs promoters, thus appearing as a good candidate to explain the coordinated regulation of three NCRs. Such results are encouraging regarding in vitro AML-NK cytotoxicity restoration and provide a new conceptual support for innovative cellular therapy based on in vitro NK cells expansion before their reinfusion in AML patients.","['Venton, G', 'Labiad, Y', 'Colle, J', 'Fino, A', 'Afridi, S', 'Torres, M', 'Monteuil, S', 'Loriod, B', 'Fernandez-Nunez, N', 'Farnault, L', 'Suchon, P', 'Mattei, J C', 'Rihet, P', 'Bergon, A', 'Nguyen, C', 'Baier, C', 'Costello, R']","['Venton G', 'Labiad Y', 'Colle J', 'Fino A', 'Afridi S', 'Torres M', 'Monteuil S', 'Loriod B', 'Fernandez-Nunez N', 'Farnault L', 'Suchon P', 'Mattei JC', 'Rihet P', 'Bergon A', 'Nguyen C', 'Baier C', 'Costello R']","['INSERM, UMR1090, Aix-Marseille Universite, TAGC Campus de Luminy, Marseille, 13288, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie et de Therapie Cellulaire Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Marseille, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire La Conception, 147 boulevard Baille, Marseille, 13005, France."", 'INSERM, UMR1090, Aix-Marseille Universite, TAGC Campus de Luminy, Marseille, 13288, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1090, Aix-Marseille Universite, TAGC Campus de Luminy, Marseille, 13288, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie et de Therapie Cellulaire Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Marseille, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire La Conception, 147 boulevard Baille, Marseille, 13005, France."", 'INSERM, UMR1090, Aix-Marseille Universite, TAGC Campus de Luminy, Marseille, 13288, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1090, Aix-Marseille Universite, TAGC Campus de Luminy, Marseille, 13288, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1090, Aix-Marseille Universite, TAGC Campus de Luminy, Marseille, 13288, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1090, Aix-Marseille Universite, TAGC Campus de Luminy, Marseille, 13288, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1090, Aix-Marseille Universite, TAGC Campus de Luminy, Marseille, 13288, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1090, Aix-Marseille Universite, TAGC Campus de Luminy, Marseille, 13288, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie et de Therapie Cellulaire Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Marseille, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire La Conception, 147 boulevard Baille, Marseille, 13005, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Marseille, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire La Timone, Marseille, France."", 'UMR 1062 NORT, INSERM, Marseille, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, UMR-911 INSERM Center for Research in Onco-biology and Onco-pharmacology, Marseille, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1090, Aix-Marseille Universite, TAGC Campus de Luminy, Marseille, 13288, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1090, Aix-Marseille Universite, TAGC Campus de Luminy, Marseille, 13288, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1090, Aix-Marseille Universite, TAGC Campus de Luminy, Marseille, 13288, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1090, Aix-Marseille Universite, TAGC Campus de Luminy, Marseille, 13288, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1090, Aix-Marseille Universite, TAGC Campus de Luminy, Marseille, 13288, France. regiscostello.tagc@gmail.com.', ""Service d'Hematologie et de Therapie Cellulaire Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Marseille, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire La Conception, 147 boulevard Baille, Marseille, 13005, France. regiscostello.tagc@gmail.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Immunol Res,Immunologic research,8611087,"['0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Transcriptome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Gene co-regulation', '*Natural activating receptor', '*Natural killer cells', '*Transcriptomic analysis']",2016/08/03 06:00,2017/12/12 06:00,['2016/08/03 06:00'],"['2016/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12026-016-8848-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12026-016-8848-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Immunol Res. 2016 Dec;64(5-6):1225-1236. doi: 10.1007/s12026-016-8848-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a survey for hematopoietic cell transplantation clinicians to identify current practices in BMT CTN SOSS priority areas and to understand, more generally, the variation in approach to transplantation and estimation of transplantation benefit in current medical practice. Of 1439 transplantation clinicians surveyed, 305 responded (20% response rate). Clinicians were well represented by age, experience, geography, and size of practice. We found that several techniques identified in the BMT CTN SOSS, such as maintenance therapy for acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes after allogeneic transplantation, were already being utilized in practice on and off study, with higher rates of use in higher-volume centers. There was significant variation among clinicians in use of transplantation technologies and approaches to common transplantation scenarios. Appraisals of risks and benefits of transplantation appeared to converge upon similar estimates despite the presentation of different hypothetical scenarios. These results suggest overall equipoise in several BMT CTN SOSS high-priority areas and support the need for better data to inform clinical practice.","['Wood, William A', 'McGinn, Margaret K', 'Wilson, Doug', 'Deal, Allison M', 'Khera, Nandita', 'Shea, Thomas C', 'Devine, Steven M', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Lee, Stephanie J']","['Wood WA', 'McGinn MK', 'Wilson D', 'Deal AM', 'Khera N', 'Shea TC', 'Devine SM', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Horowitz MM', 'Lee SJ']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

We have reported that FGF2 compromises stromal cell support of normal hematopoiesis. Here, we examined the effects of FGF2 on the leukemia microenvironment. In vitro, FGF2 significantly decreased the number of stromal-dependent and stromal-independent G0-leukemia cells in the stromal layers. Accordingly, CML cells placed on FGF2-treated stromal layers were more sensitive to imatinib. Conversely, FGF2 increased the proliferation of osteoblasts via FGFR1 IIIc, but its effects on osteoblast support of leukemia cell growth were limited. We next treated a human leukemia mouse model with Ara-C with/without systemic FGF2 administration. BM sections from FGF2-treated mice had thickened bone trabeculae and increased numbers of leukemia cells compared to controls. Leukemia cell density was increased, especially in the endosteal region in FGF2/Ara-C -treated mice compared to mice treated with Ara-C only. Interestingly, FGF2 did not promote leukemia cell survival in Ara-C treated spleen. Microarray analysis showed that FGF2 did not alter expression of many genes linked to hematopoiesis in osteoblasts, but modulated regulatory networks involved in angiogenesis and osteoblastic differentiation. These observations suggest that FGF2 promotes leukemia cell growth in the BM by modulating osteoblast functions.","['Sugimoto, Keiki', 'Miyata, Yasuhiko', 'Nakayama, Takayuki', 'Saito, Shigeki', 'Suzuki, Ritsuro', 'Hayakawa, Fumihiko', 'Nishiwaki, Satoshi', 'Mizuno, Hiroki', 'Takeshita, Kyosuke', 'Kato, Hidefumi', 'Ueda, Ryuzo', 'Takami, Akiyoshi', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Sugimoto K', 'Miyata Y', 'Nakayama T', 'Saito S', 'Suzuki R', 'Hayakawa F', 'Nishiwaki S', 'Mizuno H', 'Takeshita K', 'Kato H', 'Ueda R', 'Takami A', 'Naoe T']","['Fujii Memorial Research Institute, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.

However, tissue fibrosis in other diseases is associated with monocyte-derived fibrocytes. Therefore, we sought to determine whether fibrocytes play a role in the induction of BM fibrosis in PMF. In this study, we show that BM from patients with PMF harbors an abundance of clonal, neoplastic collagen- and fibronectin-producing fibrocytes. Immunodeficient mice transplanted with myelofibrosis patients' BM cells developed a lethal myelofibrosis-like phenotype. Treatment of the xenograft mice with the fibrocyte inhibitor serum amyloid P (SAP; pentraxin-2) significantly prolonged survival and slowed the development of BM fibrosis. Collectively, our data suggest that neoplastic fibrocytes contribute to the induction of BM fibrosis in PMF, and inhibiting fibrocyte differentiation with SAP may interfere with this process.","['Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Pilling, Darrell', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Newberry, Kate J', 'Prijic, Sanja', 'Knez, Liza', 'Bozinovic, Ksenija', 'Harris, David M', 'Spaeth, Erika L', 'Post, Sean M', 'Multani, Asha S', 'Rampal, Raajit K', 'Ahn, Jihae', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Creighton, Chad J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Verstovsek S', 'Manshouri T', 'Pilling D', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Newberry KJ', 'Prijic S', 'Knez L', 'Bozinovic K', 'Harris DM', 'Spaeth EL', 'Post SM', 'Multani AS', 'Rampal RK', 'Ahn J', 'Levine RL', 'Creighton CJ', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Biology, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77433.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Gerstner Sloan Kettering School of Biomedical Sciences, New York, NY 10065.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Dan L.

A dysregulated immune system precipitates MDS, and to gain insights into the relevance of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) in this process, we examined the frequency and function of CX3CR1- and CD57-positive T lymphocytes from MDS patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood and/or bone marrow samples from 31 MDS patients and 12 healthy controls were examined by flow cytometry. Expression of cytotoxic granule constituents, immunological co-receptors, adhesion molecules and markers of activation were quantified on unstimulated lymphocytes. Degranulation, cytotoxicity and conjugate formation with target cells following co-culture of CTL with target cell lines or autologous bone marrow-derived CD34(+) cells were quantified by flow cytometry. RESULTS: CX3CR1 expression was increased in bone marrow from high-risk MDS patients compared to healthy controls. Expression of CD57 and CX3CR1 was closely correlated, identifying a CTL subset with high cytotoxic capacity. In vitro, TCR-induced redirected cytotoxicity was markedly decreased for high-risk MDS patients compared to controls. CTL from MDS patients with the lowest target cell cytotoxicity had reduced expression of adhesion molecules and formed fewer conjugates with target cells. DISCUSSION: Although phenotypically defined CTL numbers were increased in the bone marrow of MDS patients, we found that CTL from high-risk MDS patients exhibited a lower TCR-induced redirected cytotoxic capacity. Thus, decreased T cell cytotoxicity seems related to reduced adhesion to target cells and may contribute to impaired anti-leukemic immune surveillance in MDS.","['Sand, Kristoffer', 'Theorell, Jakob', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Bryceson, Yenan T', 'Kittang, Astrid Olsnes']","['Sand K', 'Theorell J', 'Bruserud O', 'Bryceson YT', 'Kittang AO']","['Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Division for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Jonas Lies vei 65, 5021, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. astrid.kittang@k2.uib.no.', 'Division for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Jonas Lies vei 65, 5021, Bergen, Norway. astrid.kittang@k2.uib.no.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160801,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Adhesion', '*CD57', '*CX3CR1', '*Cytotoxic T lymphocytes', '*Granzyme B', '*Myelodysplastic syndromes']",2016/08/03 06:00,2017/09/19 06:00,['2016/08/03 06:00'],"['2015/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00262-016-1865-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-016-1865-y [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2016 Sep;65(9):1135-47. doi: 10.1007/s00262-016-1865-y.

In 2011, the initial analysis of sequence variation across 17 strains found 56.7 M unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 8.8 M indels. We carry out deep sequencing of 13 additional inbred strains (BUB/BnJ, C57BL/10J, C57BR/cdJ, C58/J, DBA/1J, I/LnJ, KK/HiJ, MOLF/EiJ, NZB/B1NJ, NZW/LacJ, RF/J, SEA/GnJ and ST/bJ), cataloguing molecular variation within and across the strains. These strains include important models for immune response, leukaemia, age-related hearing loss and rheumatoid arthritis. We now have several examples of fully sequenced closely related strains that are divergent for several disease phenotypes. RESULTS: Approximately 27.4 M unique SNPs and 5 M indels are identified across these strains compared to the C57BL/6 J reference genome (GRCm38). The amount of variation found in the inbred laboratory mouse genome has increased to 71 M SNPs and 12 M indels. We investigate the genetic basis of highly penetrant cancer susceptibility in RF/J finding private novel missense mutations in DNA damage repair and highly cancer associated genes. We use two highly related strains (DBA/1J and DBA/2J) to investigate the genetic basis of collagen-induced arthritis susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: This paper significantly expands the catalogue of fully sequenced laboratory mouse strains and now contains several examples of highly genetically similar strains with divergent phenotypes. We show how studying private missense mutations can lead to insights into the genetic mechanism for a highly penetrant phenotype.","['Doran, Anthony G', 'Wong, Kim', 'Flint, Jonathan', 'Adams, David J', 'Hunter, Kent W', 'Keane, Thomas M']","['Doran AG', 'Wong K', 'Flint J', 'Adams DJ', 'Hunter KW', 'Keane TM']","['Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, CB10 1HH, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, CB10 1HH, UK.', 'The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Drive, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, CB10 1HH, UK.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. hunterk@mail.nih.gov.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, CB10 1HH, UK. tk2@sanger.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160801,England,Genome Biol,Genome biology,100960660,,IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics', '*Genome', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Homozygote', 'INDEL Mutation/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*genetics', 'Mutation, Missense/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Biological pathways', '*Cancer', '*Disease', '*Genomic variation', '*Laboratory mouse', '*Mouse genomes', '*Sequencing', '*arthritis']",2016/08/03 06:00,2017/06/15 06:00,['2016/08/03 06:00'],"['2016/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13059-016-1024-y [doi]', '10.1186/s13059-016-1024-y [pii]']",epublish,Genome Biol. 2016 Aug 1;17(1):167. doi: 10.1186/s13059-016-1024-y.,10.1186/s13059-016-1024-y [doi],,,,,PMC4968449,,"['13031/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'MR/L007428/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BB/M000281/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, given the quiescent nature of CLL B-cells and the relative indolence of the disease, the dynamics of MV generation and their unique phenotypes are not clearly defined. In this study, we find that CLL B-cells generate MVs spontaneously and can be further induced by B-cell receptor-ligation. Most interestingly, CLL B-cells predominantly generate CD52(+) MVs, but not CD19(+) MVs in vitro, suggesting preferential usage of CD52 into leukemic-MVs and that the CLL plasma MV phenotypes corroborate well with the in vitro findings. Importantly, we detected increased accumulation of CD52(+) MVs in previously untreated CLL patients with progressive disease. Finally, sequential studies on MVs in pre- and post-therapy CLL patients demonstrate that although the plasma CD52(+) MV levels drop significantly after therapy in most and remain at low levels in some patients, a trend of increased accumulation of CD52(+) MVs was detected in majority of post-therapy CLL patients (25 of 33). In total, this study emphasizes that dynamic accumulation of CD52(+) MVs in plasma can be used to study CLL progression and may be a useful biomarker for patients as they progress and require therapy.","['Boysen, J', 'Nelson, M', 'Magzoub, G', 'Maiti, G P', 'Sinha, S', 'Goswami, M', 'Vesely, S K', 'Shanafelt, T D', 'Kay, N E', 'Ghosh, A K']","['Boysen J', 'Nelson M', 'Magzoub G', 'Maiti GP', 'Sinha S', 'Goswami M', 'Vesely SK', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Kay NE', 'Ghosh AK']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Stephenson Cancer Center, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.', 'Stephenson Cancer Center, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Stephenson Cancer Center, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Stephenson Cancer Center, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160802,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Biomarkers', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Disease Progression', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Time-to-Treatment', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/08/03 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/08/03 06:00'],"['2016/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/16 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016217 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.217 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Feb;31(2):350-360. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.217.

Therefore, detailed mechanisms of refractoriness, including leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) biology, should be elucidated to treat AML. The self-degradative property of cytosolic macromolecules is central to autophagy and can contribute to homeostasis and stress response. Recent reports suggest the importance of autophagy in hematopoietic stem cells and various tumors. Thus, this study investigated the functional role of autophagy in AML maintenance and drug resistance using tamoxifen-inducible conditional knockout mice of Atg5 or Atg7, which are essential genes for autophagy, combined with an mixed lineage leukemia-eleven nineteen leukemia-induced murine AML model. Inactivation of autophagy by deletion of Atg5 or Atg7 prolonged survival in leukemic mice and reduced functional LICs. Atg7-deficient LICs displayed enhanced mitochondrial activity and reactive oxygen species production together with increased cell death. In addition, Atg7 deletion markedly decreased peripheral blood leukemia cells, concurrent with increased apoptosis, suggesting a higher dependency on autophagy compared with bone marrow leukemia cells. Finally, cytarabine (AraC) treatment activated autophagy in LICs, and Atg7 deletion potentiated the therapeutic effects of AraC, which included decreased LICs and prolonged survival, suggesting that autophagy contributes to AraC resistance. Our results highlight the intratumoral heterogeneity related to autophagy in AML and the unique role of autophagy in leukemia development and drug resistance.","['Sumitomo, Yoshiki', 'Koya, Junji', 'Nakazaki, Kumi', 'Kataoka, Keisuke', 'Tsuruta-Kishino, Takako', 'Morita, Ken', 'Sato, Tomohiko', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Sumitomo Y', 'Koya J', 'Nakazaki K', 'Kataoka K', 'Tsuruta-Kishino T', 'Morita K', 'Sato T', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Oncology Research Laboratories, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co.

Here we show that interactions between leukemia cells and stromal cells (HS-5) upregulate CD20 on CLL cells and that administering ibrutinib downmodulates CD20 (MS4A1) expression in vivo. We observed that CLL cells that have recently exited the lymph node microenvironment and moved into the peripheral blood (CXCR4(dim)CD5(bright) subpopulation) have higher cell surface levels of CD20 than the cells circulating in the bloodstream for a longer time (CXCR4(bright)CD5(dim) cells). We found that CD20 is directly upregulated by CXCR4 ligand stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1alpha, CXCL12) produced by stromal cells, and BTK-inhibitor ibrutinib and CXCR4-inhibitor plerixafor block SDF-1alpha-mediated CD20 upregulation. Ibrutinib also downmodulated Mcl1 levels in CLL cells in vivo and in coculture with stromal cells. Overall, our study provides a first detailed mechanistic explanation of CD20 expression regulation in the context of chemokine signaling and microenvironmental interactions, which may have important implications for microenvironment-targeting therapies.","['Pavlasova, Gabriela', 'Borsky, Marek', 'Seda, Vaclav', 'Cerna, Katerina', 'Osickova, Jitka', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Calogero, Raffaele', 'Trbusek, Martin', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Davids, Matthew S', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Mraz, Marek']","['Pavlasova G', 'Borsky M', 'Seda V', 'Cerna K', 'Osickova J', 'Doubek M', 'Mayer J', 'Calogero R', 'Trbusek M', 'Pospisilova S', 'Davids MS', 'Kipps TJ', 'Brown JR', 'Mraz M']","['Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic; Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic;', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic;', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic; Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic;', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic; Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic;', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic;', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic;', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic;', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy;', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic;', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic;', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and.', 'Moores Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic; Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160801,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Antigens, CD20/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL12/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2016/08/03 06:00,2017/08/29 06:00,['2016/08/03 06:00'],"['2016/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34121-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-04-709519 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Sep 22;128(12):1609-13. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-04-709519.

Growth factor independence 1 (GFI1) is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor and master regulator of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. While several GFI1-interacting proteins have been described, how GFI1 leverages these relationships to carry out transcriptional repression remains unclear. Here, we describe a functional axis involving GFI1, SMYD2, and LSD1 that is a critical contributor to GFI1-mediated transcriptional repression. SMYD2 methylates lysine-8 (K8) within a -(8)KSKK(11)- motif embedded in the GFI1 SNAG domain. Methylation-defective GFI1 SNAG domain lacks repressor function due to failure of LSD1 recruitment and persistence of promoter H3K4 di-methyl marks. Methylation-defective GFI1 also fails to complement GFI1 depletion phenotypes in developing zebrafish and lacks pro-growth and survival functions in lymphoid leukemia cells. Our data show a discrete methylation event in the GFI1 SNAG domain that facilitates recruitment of LSD1 to enable transcriptional repression and co-ordinate control of hematopoietic cell fate in both normal and malignant settings.","['Velinder, Matthew', 'Singer, Jason', 'Bareyan, Diana', 'Meznarich, Jessica', 'Tracy, Christopher M', 'Fulcher, James M', 'McClellan, David', 'Lucente, Helena', 'Franklin, Sarah', 'Sharma, Sunil', 'Engel, Michael E']","['Velinder M', 'Singer J', 'Bareyan D', 'Meznarich J', 'Tracy CM', 'Fulcher JM', 'McClellan D', 'Lucente H', 'Franklin S', 'Sharma S', 'Engel ME']","['Department of Oncological Sciences, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, U.S.A.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, U.S.A.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, U.S.A.', ""Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, U.S.A.

In APL-derived cells, miR-142-3p expression can be restored by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which induces the completion of their maturation program. Here, we aimed to assess whether PU.1, essential for ATRA-induced gene transcription, regulates the expression of miR-142-3p in APL-derived cells and, based on the established cooperation between PU.1 and Vav1 in modulating gene expression, to evaluate the role of Vav1 in restoring the expression of miR-142-3p. METHODS: ATRA-induced increases in PU.1 and Vav1 expression in APL-derived NB4 cells were counteracted with specific siRNAs, and the expression of miR-142-3p was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The recruitment of PU.1 and/or Vav1 to the regulatory region of miR-142 was assessed by quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (Q-ChIP). Synthetic inhibitors or mimics for miR-142-3p were used to assess whether this miRNA plays a role in regulating the expression of PU.1 and/or Vav1. RESULTS: We found that the expression of miR-142-3p in differentiating APL-derived NB4 cells is dependent on PU.1, and that Vav1 is essential for the recruitment of this transcription factor to its cis-binding element on the miR-142 promoter. In addition, we found that in ATRA-treated NB4 cells miR-142-3p sustains agonist-induced increases in both PU.1 and Vav1. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the existence of a Vav1/PU.1/miR-142-3p network that supports ATRA-induced differentiation in APL-derived cells. Since selective regulation of miRNAs may play a role in the future treatment of hematopoietic malignancies, our results may provide a basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies to restore the expression of miR-142-3p.","['Grassilli, Silvia', 'Nika, Ervin', 'Lambertini, Elisabetta', 'Brugnoli, Federica', 'Piva, Roberta', 'Capitani, Silvano', 'Bertagnolo, Valeria']","['Grassilli S', 'Nika E', 'Lambertini E', 'Brugnoli F', 'Piva R', 'Capitani S', 'Bertagnolo V']","['Section of Anatomy and Histology, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, 44121, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Section of Anatomy and Histology, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, 44121, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Specialty Surgical Sciences, University of Ferrara, 44121, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Section of Anatomy and Histology, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, 44121, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Specialty Surgical Sciences, University of Ferrara, 44121, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Section of Anatomy and Histology, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, 44121, Ferrara, Italy.', 'LTTA, University of Ferrara, 44121, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Section of Anatomy and Histology, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, 44121, Ferrara, Italy. bgv@unife.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160801,Netherlands,Cell Oncol (Dordr),Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),101552938,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MIRN142 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (VAV1 protein, human)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['ATRA', 'Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'PU.1', 'Vav1', 'miR-142-3p']",2016/08/03 06:00,2017/02/01 06:00,['2016/08/03 06:00'],"['2016/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13402-016-0292-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s13402-016-0292-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Oncol (Dordr). 2016 Oct;39(5):483-489. doi: 10.1007/s13402-016-0292-6.

METHODS: The authors analyzed 110 patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL who were enrolled in 2 consecutive, prospective, phase 2 clinical trials of frontline HCVAD with either dasatinib (63 patients) or ponatinib (47 patients). Propensity score analysis with 1:1 matching with the nearest neighbor matching method and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis based on the propensity scores were performed to assess response rates, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) between the cohorts. RESULTS: Propensity score matching identified 41 patients in each cohort. With propensity score matching, the 3-year EFS rates for patients treated with HCVAD plus ponatinib and HCVAD plus dasatinib were 69% and 46%, respectively (P =.04), and the 3-year OS rates were 83% and 56%, respectively (P =.03). IPTW analysis using prematching cohorts demonstrated that patients treated with HCVAD plus ponatinib had significantly higher rates of minimal residual disease negativity by flow cytometry on day 21, complete cytogenetic response at complete response, major molecular response at complete response and at 3 months, and complete molecular response at 3 months. IPTW confirmed that treatment with HCVAD plus ponatinib was associated with longer EFS (P =.003) and OS (P =.001) compared with treatment with HCVAD plus dasatinib. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical outcome of patients treated with HCVAD plus ponatinib appears to be superior to that of patients treated with HCVAD plus dasatinib among individuals with Ph+ ALL.

Expression of plasma membrane P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a transporter involved in drug efflux, is the most frequently observed molecular causality of MDR. We observed the coexpression of P-gp and the filament protein nestin in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines SKM-1 and MOLM-13 following the induction of P-gp expression using vincristine. Nestin is considered a marker of neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is causal relationship between the expression of P-glycoprotein and the expression of nestin in both of these AML cell lines. The expression of P-gp was induced in SKM-1 cells by selective pressure using vincristine (VCR), mitoxantrone (MTX), azacytidine (AzaC) and lenalidomide (LEN). Whereas the selective pressure of VCR, MTX and AzaC also induced P-gp expression in MOLM-13 cells, LEN was found to be ineffective in this regard. In all cases in which P-gp expression was induced in SKM-1 and MOLM-13 cells, its expression was associated with the induction of nestin mRNA expression and the presence of a 200-220kDa nestin-immunoreactive protein band in western blots. Silencing P-gp expression using s10418 siRNA (known as the P-gp silencer) was associated with the downregulation of the nestin transcript level, demonstrated using RT-PCR. Nestin mRNA was also observed in two P-gp-positive variants of L1210 cells that were obtained either by selection with VCR or by transfection with a retrovirus encoding human P-gp. Detectable levels of nestin transcripts were not observed in P-gp-negative parental L1210 cells. Taken together, these results indicated that the induction of P-gp expression is causally associated with the expression of nestin in leukemia cells.","['Coculova, Martina', 'Imrichova, Denisa', 'Seres, M', 'Messingerova, Lucia', 'Bohacova, Viera', 'Sulova, Zdena', 'Breier, Albert']","['Coculova M', 'Imrichova D', 'Seres M', 'Messingerova L', 'Bohacova V', 'Sulova Z', 'Breier A']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology, Radlinskeho 9, 812 37 Bratislava, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 840 05 Bratislava, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 840 05 Bratislava, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology, Radlinskeho 9, 812 37 Bratislava, Slovak Republic; Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 840 05 Bratislava, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 840 05 Bratislava, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 840 05 Bratislava, Slovak Republic.

Identifying these mutated genes and understanding how they cooperate requires single-cell analysis, but current single-cell analytic methods, such as PCR-based strategies or whole-exome sequencing, are biased, lack sequencing depth or are cost prohibitive. Transposon-based mutagenesis allows the identification of early cancer drivers, but current sequencing methods have limitations that prevent single-cell analysis. We report a liquid-phase, capture-based sequencing and bioinformatics pipeline, Sleeping Beauty (SB) capture hybridization sequencing (SBCapSeq), that facilitates sequencing of transposon insertion sites from single tumor cells in a SB mouse model of myeloid leukemia (ML). SBCapSeq analysis of just 26 cells from one tumor revealed the tumor's major clonal subpopulations, enabled detection of clonal insertion events not detected by other sequencing methods and led to the identification of dominant subclones, each containing a unique pair of interacting gene drivers along with three to six cooperating cancer genes with SB-driven expression changes.","['Mann, Karen M', 'Newberg, Justin Y', 'Black, Michael A', 'Jones, Devin J', 'Amaya-Manzanares, Felipe', 'Guzman-Rojas, Liliana', 'Kodama, Takahiro', 'Ward, Jerrold M', 'Rust, Alistair G', 'van der Weyden, Louise', 'Yew, Christopher Chin Kuan', 'Waters, Jill L', 'Leung, Marco L', 'Rogers, Keith', 'Rogers, Susan M', 'McNoe, Leslie A', 'Selvanesan, Luxmanan', 'Navin, Nicholas', 'Jenkins, Nancy A', 'Copeland, Neal G', 'Mann, Michael B']","['Mann KM', 'Newberg JY', 'Black MA', 'Jones DJ', 'Amaya-Manzanares F', 'Guzman-Rojas L', 'Kodama T', 'Ward JM', 'Rust AG', 'van der Weyden L', 'Yew CC', 'Waters JL', 'Leung ML', 'Rogers K', 'Rogers SM', 'McNoe LA', 'Selvanesan L', 'Navin N', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG', 'Mann MB']","['Cancer Research Program, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore, Republic of Singapore.', 'Cancer Research Program, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'Cancer Research Program, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Cancer Research Program, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Cancer Research Program, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Cancer Research Program, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore, Republic of Singapore.', 'Experimental Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'Experimental Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore, Republic of Singapore.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore, Republic of Singapore.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore, Republic of Singapore.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Cancer Research Program, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore, Republic of Singapore.', 'Cancer Research Program, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore, Republic of Singapore.', 'Cancer Research Program, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore, Republic of Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160801,United States,Nat Biotechnol,Nature biotechnology,9604648,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Transposases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (sleeping beauty transposase, human)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'In Situ Hybridization/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods', 'Software', 'Transposases/genetics']",,,2016/08/02 06:00,2017/06/06 06:00,['2016/08/02 06:00'],"['2015/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [medline]']","['nbt.3637 [pii]', '10.1038/nbt.3637 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Biotechnol. 2016 Sep;34(9):962-72. doi: 10.1038/nbt.3637.

This review focuses on CARs recognizing the B cell antigen CD19. Both retroviral and lentiviral vectors are used, encoding various anti-CD19 CAR constructs comprising costimulatory molecules such as CD28, CD137/4-1BB, and OX40 either alone (second-generation CARs) or in combination (third-generation CARs). Current, up-to-date published studies on anti-CD19 CAR therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with observed side effects are discussed and an outlook on 58 ongoing trials is given. Clinical responses were achieved in up to 81% of ALL, 50% of CLL, and 40% of NHL patients. Factors with potential influence on the clinical outcome might be the design of the vector, the preconditioning regimen, and the number and quality of transfused CAR TCs. The applicability of clinical CAR TC therapy might include relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), and ineligibility for or ""bridging"" until alloSCT. In summary, CAR therapy represents a highly promising treatment option even in heavily pretreated patients.","['Schubert, Maria-Luisa', 'Huckelhoven, Angela', 'Hoffmann, Jean-Marc', 'Schmitt, Anita', 'Wuchter, Patrick', 'Sellner, Leopold', 'Hofmann, Susanne', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Schmitt, Michael']","['Schubert ML', 'Huckelhoven A', 'Hoffmann JM', 'Schmitt A', 'Wuchter P', 'Sellner L', 'Hofmann S', 'Ho AD', 'Dreger P', 'Schmitt M']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital , Heidelberg, Germany .', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital , Heidelberg, Germany .', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital , Heidelberg, Germany .', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital , Heidelberg, Germany .', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital , Heidelberg, Germany .', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital , Heidelberg, Germany .', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital , Heidelberg, Germany .', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital , Heidelberg, Germany .', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital , Heidelberg, Germany .', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital , Heidelberg, Germany .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160731,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/*genetics/therapeutic use', '*Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Leukemia/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/therapeutic use', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/transplantation']",,,2016/08/02 06:00,2018/01/19 06:00,['2016/08/02 06:00'],"['2016/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2016.097 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2016 Oct;27(10):758-771. doi: 10.1089/hum.2016.097.

Here, we demonstrated in healthy individuals (n=20) that the CD19-CD81 expression axis identifies three bone marrow (BM)PC subsets with distinct age-prevalence, proliferation, replication-history, immunoglobulin-production, and phenotype, consistent with progressively increased differentiation from CD19+CD81+ into CD19-CD81+ and CD19-CD81- BMPCs. Afterwards, we demonstrated in 225 newly diagnosed MM patients that, comparing to normal BMPC counterparts, 59% had fully differentiated (CD19-CD81-) clones, 38% intermediate-differentiated (CD19-CD81+) and 3% less-differentiated (CD19+CD81+) clones. The latter patients had dismal outcome, and PC differentiation emerged as an independent prognostic marker for progression-free (HR: 1.7; P=0.005) and overall survival (HR: 2.1; P=0.006). Longitudinal comparison of diagnostic vs minimal-residual-disease samples (n=40) unraveled that in 20% of patients, less-differentiated PCs subclones become enriched after therapy-induced pressure. We also revealed that CD81 expression is epigenetically regulated, that less-differentiated clonal PCs retain high expression of genes related to preceding B-cell stages (for example: PAX5), and show distinct mutation profile vs fully differentiated PC clones within individual patients. Together, we shed new light into PC plasticity and demonstrated that MM patients harbouring less-differentiated PCs have dismal survival, which might be related to higher chemoresistant potential plus different molecular and genomic profiles.","['Paiva, B', 'Puig, N', 'Cedena, M T', 'de Jong, B G', 'Ruiz, Y', 'Rapado, I', 'Martinez-Lopez, J', 'Cordon, L', 'Alignani, D', 'Delgado, J A', 'van Zelm, M

We show herein that primary in vitro stimulation of CD45RA-selected CD4 T cells of stem-cell donors with 10/10 HLA-matched AML blasts results in expansion of cytolytic T-lymphocytes (CTL) that almost all recognize HLA-DPB1 mismatch alleles, which clinically occur in up to 80% of donor-patient pairs. Primary AML blasts were found to strongly express HLA-DPB1, whereas fibroblasts and keratinocytes used as surrogate target cells for graft-versus-host disease did express HLA-DPB1 only upon IFN-gamma pre-treatment. Since patients' AML blasts are rarely available in clinical routine, we developed a protocol based on stimulation of donor-derived CD45RA-selected CD4 T cells with autologous dendritic cells electroporated with RNA encoding patients' HLA-DPB1 mismatch alleles. Short-term stimulated T cell-lines specifically lysed HLA-DPB1 mismatch-expressing AML blasts, but not fibroblasts and keratinocytes without IFN-gamma pre-treatment. Notably, these CD4 CTL efficiently eliminated AML blasts upon adoptive transfer into leukemia-engrafted NSG mice. In conclusion, we show strong immunogenicity of HLA-DPB1 mismatch alleles in CD45RA-selected CD4 T cells of stem-cell donors and introduce a novel strategy to reliably generate HLA-DPB1-specific CD4 CTL that might be powerful cellular therapeutics in relapsed or refractory AML after HSCT.","['Herr, W', 'Eichinger, Y', 'Beshay, J', 'Bloetz, A', 'Vatter, S', 'Mirbeth, C', 'Distler, E', 'Hartwig, U F', 'Thomas, S']","['Herr W', 'Eichinger Y', 'Beshay J', 'Bloetz A', 'Vatter S', 'Mirbeth C', 'Distler E', 'Hartwig UF', 'Thomas S']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Regensburg Center for Interventional Immunology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Regensburg Center for Interventional Immunology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Regensburg Center for Interventional Immunology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160801,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPB1 antigen)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2016/08/02 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/08/02 06:00'],"['2015/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016210 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.210 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Feb;31(2):434-445. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.210.

Accordingly, the evasion of apoptosis is a critical milestone for the transformation of lymphocytes on their way to becoming overt lymphomas. The anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins are pivotal regulators of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and genetic aberrations in these genes are associated with lymphomagenesis and chemotherapeutic resistance. Pharmacological targeting of BCL-2 is highly effective in certain indolent B-cell lymphomas; however, recent evidence highlights a critical role for the BCL-2 family member MCL-1 in several lymphoma subtypes. MCL-1 is recurrently highly expressed in various kinds of cancer including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of B- and T-cell origin. Moreover, both indolent and aggressive forms of lymphoma require MCL-1 for lymphomagenesis and for their continued survival.

Here, we discovered that the CK2 catalytic alpha and regulatory beta subunits are consistently expressed in leukemia stem cells isolated from acute myeloid leukemia patients and cell lines. CK2 inactivation with the selective inhibitor CX-4945 or RNA interference induced an accumulation of leukemia stem cells in the late S-G2-M phases of the cell cycle and triggered late-onset apoptosis. As a result, leukemia stem cells displayed an increased sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. From a molecular standpoint, CK2 blockade was associated with a downmodulation of the stem cell-regulating protein BMI-1 and a marked impairment of AKT, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation, whereas FOXO3a nuclear activity was induced. Notably, combined CK2 and either NF-kappaB or STAT3 inhibition resulted in a superior cytotoxic effect on leukemia stem cells. This study suggests that CK2 blockade could be a rational approach to minimize the persistence of residual leukemia cells.","['Quotti Tubi, L', 'Canovas Nunes, S', 'Brancalion, A', 'Doriguzzi Breatta,

Monocytes/macrophages represent key components of cancer immune surveillance and effectors for antibody-mediated antitumor effects. Monocytes display an altered subset composition in CLL. Moreover, we find a changed metabolic phenotype: glucose uptake, glucose transporters and expression of glycolytic molecules are reduced. Our data establish a link between glycolytic competence and monocyte-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells. Furthermore, we report that CLL monocytes express Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Our observations suggest that using BTK inhibitors in CLL might further aggravate the observed immune metabolic defects in monocytes. Triggering the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) checkpoint on monocytes hampers glycolysis, phagocytosis and BTK signaling. Conversely, disrupting PD-1/PD-L1 signaling reverses these immune metabolic dysfunctions. Taken together, our findings imply a novel metabolic interplay between CLL cells and monocytes and that blocking PD-1/PD-L1 might restore metabolic together with antitumor activity of CLL monocytes/macrophages.","['Qorraj, M', 'Bruns, H', 'Bottcher, M', 'Weigand, L', 'Saul, D', 'Mackensen, A', 'Jitschin, R', 'Mougiakakos, D']","['Qorraj M', 'Bruns H', 'Bottcher M', 'Weigand L', 'Saul D', 'Mackensen A', 'Jitschin R', 'Mougiakakos D']","['Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160801,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'B7-H1 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers', 'Energy Metabolism/immunology', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glycolysis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phagocytosis/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2016/08/02 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/08/02 06:00'],"['2016/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016214 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.214 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Feb;31(2):470-478. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.214.

In this phase I, dose-escalation portion of a phase I/II study, patients with myelofibrosis received oral NS-018 in continuous 28-day cycles. The primary study objective was to evaluate safety, tolerability and clinically active dose of NS-018. Forty-eight patients were treated; 23 (48%) had previously received a JAK inhibitor (JAKi). The most common drug-related adverse events were thrombocytopenia (27%)/anemia (15%) for hematologic events, and dizziness (23%)/nausea (19%) for non-hematologic events. Once daily NS-018 at 300 mg was chosen as the phase II study dose based on improved tolerability compared with higher doses. A 50% reduction in palpable spleen size was achieved in 56% of patients (47% of patients with prior JAKi treatment), and improvements were observed in myelofibrosis-associated symptoms. Bone marrow fibrosis grade (local assessment) improved from baseline in 11/30 evaluable patients (37%) after 3 cycles of NS-018. JAK2 allele burden was largely unchanged. Changes in cytokine/protein levels were noted after 4 weeks of treatment. NS-018 reached peak plasma concentration in 1-2 h and did not accumulate with multiple dosing.

To study the methylation status of HRK gene, we applied Methylation Sensitive-High Resolution Melting Curve Analysis (MS-HRM) in MDS patients, as well as healthy controls and EpiTect(R)PCR Control DNA. Real time RT-PCR was used for gene expression analysis. Methylation frequency in promoter region of HRK in patient samples was 20.37%. Methylation of HRK was significantly related to transcriptional downregulation (P=0.023). The difference in frequency of hypermethylated HRK gene was significant between good (10%) and poor (71.42%) cytogenetic risk groups (P= 0.001), advanced stage MDS patients (66.66%) in comparison with early stage MDS patients (2.56%) (P= 0.00), higher- risk MDS group (61.53%) and lower- risk MDS group (7.31%) (P= 0.00).

Berberine has a beneficial effect on endothelial function; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of berberine on lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the molecular mechanisms mediating the effect. The effects of berberine on LPS-induced cell apoptosis and viability were measured with 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine staining, flow cytometry, and Cell Counting Kit-8 assays. The expression and/or activation of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins or signaling pathways, including caspase-3, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, were determined with western blotting. The malondialdehyde levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and production of proinflammatory cytokines were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The results demonstrated that berberine pretreatment protected HUVECs from LPS-induced apoptosis, attenuated LPS-induced injury, inhibited LPS-induced JNK phosphorylation, increased MCL-1 expression and SOD activity, and decreased proinflammatory cytokine production. The effects of berberine on LPS-treated HUVECs were prevented by SP600125, a JNK-specific inhibitor. Thus, berberine might be a potential candidate in the treatment of endothelial cell injury-related vascular diseases.","['Guo, Junping', 'Wang, Lijun', 'Wang, Linyao', 'Qian, Senmi', 'Zhang, Dayong', 'Fang, Jie', 'Pan, Jianping']","['Guo J', 'Wang L', 'Wang L', 'Qian S', 'Zhang D', 'Fang J', 'Pan J']","['Department of Clinical Medicine, Zhejiang University City College School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310015, China.', ""Department of Endocrinology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China."", 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Zhejiang University City College School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310015, China.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Zhejiang University City College School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310015, China.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Zhejiang University City College School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310015, China.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Zhejiang University City College School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310015, China.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Zhejiang University City College School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310015, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160713,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,,,2016/08/02 06:00,2016/08/02 06:01,['2016/08/02 06:00'],"['2016/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2016/6983956 [doi]'],ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2016;2016:6983956. doi: 10.1155/2016/6983956.

A total of 102 patients from 11 institutions who developed SMN after childhood cancer treatment between 1998 and 2011 were retrospectively enrolled. The most common primary malignant neoplasms (PMNs) were central nervous system (CNS) tumors (n = 17), followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 16), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 13), and osteosarcoma (n = 12). The most common SMNs were therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs; acute myeloid leukemia [AML], 29 cases; myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS], 12 cases), followed by thyroid carcinomas (n = 15) and CNS tumors (n = 10). The median latency period was 4.9 years (range, 0.5-18.5 years). Among 45 patients with solid tumors defined as an SMN, 15 (33%) developed the lesion in a field previously subjected to radiation. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of patients with an SMN was 45% with a median follow-up time of 8.6 years. Patients with AML, MDS, and CNS tumors exhibited the poorest outcomes with 5-year OS rates of 18%, 33%, and 32%, respectively, whereas those with second osteosarcoma showed comparable outcomes (64%) to patients with primary counterpart and those with second thyroid carcinoma had a 100% OS rate. Further therapeutic efforts are recommended to improve the survival outcomes in patients with SMNs, especially in cases with t-MNs and CNS tumors.","['Koh, Kyung-Nam', 'Yoo, Keon Hee', 'Im, Ho Joon', 'Sung, Ki Woong', 'Koo, Hong Hoe', 'Kim, Hyo Sun', 'Han, Jung Woo', 'Yoon, Jong Hyung', 'Park, Hyeon Jin', 'Park, Byung-Kiu', 'Baek, Hee Jo', 'Kook, Hoon', 'Lee, Jun Ah', 'Lee, Jae Min', 'Lee, Kwang Chul', 'Kim, Soon Ki', 'Park, Meerim', 'Lee, Young-Ho', 'Lyu, Chuhl Joo', 'Seo, Jong Jin']","['Koh KN', 'Yoo KH', 'Im HJ', 'Sung KW', 'Koo HH', 'Kim HS', 'Han JW', 'Yoon JH', 'Park HJ', 'Park BK', 'Baek HJ', 'Kook H', 'Lee JA', 'Lee JM', 'Lee KC', 'Kim SK', 'Park M', 'Lee YH', 'Lyu CJ', 'Seo JJ']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea ."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea .', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea ."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea .', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea .', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Korea .', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Korea .', 'Center for Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea .', 'Center for Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea .', 'Center for Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea .', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University College of Medicine, Gwangju, Korea .', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University College of Medicine, Gwangju, Korea .', 'Department of Pediatrics, Korea Cancer Center Hospital, Seoul, Korea .', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Daegu, Korea .', 'Department of Pediatrics, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea .', 'Department of Pediatrics, Inha University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea .', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, Korea .', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea .', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Korea .', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea .""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160518,Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/diagnosis/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/epidemiology/mortality/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/epidemiology/mortality/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis/epidemiology/mortality/therapy', 'Osteosarcoma/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Childhood', 'Second Neoplasm', 'Survivors']",2016/08/02 06:00,2017/02/23 06:00,['2016/08/02 06:00'],"['2015/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3346/jkms.2016.31.8.1254 [doi]'],ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2016 Aug;31(8):1254-61. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2016.31.8.1254.

The numbers of new cancer cases and cancer deaths in Henan province with compiled cancer incidence and mortality rates were estimated. METHODS: In 2015, all registries' data in Henan province were qualified for the national cancer registry annual report in 2012. The pooled data were stratified by area (urban/rural), gender, age group (0, 1.4, 5.9, 10.14, ..., 85+) and cancer type. New cancer cases and deaths were estimated using age-specific rates and corresponding population of Henan province in 2012. The Chinese census data in 2000 and Segi's population were applied for age-standardized rates. All the rates were expressed per 100,000 person-years. RESULTS: Qualified 19 cancer registries (4 urban and 15 rural registries) covered 16,082,688 populations of Henan province in 2012. The percentage of cases with morphologically verified (MV%) and death certificateonly cases (DCO%) were 69.84% and 2.30%, respectively, and the mortality to incidence rate ratio (M/I) was 0.64. It was estimated that there were 248,510 new cancer cases and 158,630 cancer deaths in Henan province in 2012. The incidence rate was 266.17/100,000 (288.61/100,000 in males and 241.86/100,000 in females), the age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASIRC) and by world standard population (ASIRW) were 208.95/100,000 and 206.41/100,000 with the cumulative incidence rate (0.74 years old) of 24.30%. The crude incidence rate in urban areas was higher than that in rural areas. However, after adjusted by age, the cancer incidence rate in rural was higher than that in urban areas. The crude mortality of all cancers in Henan province was 169.90/100,000 (201.23/100,000 in males and 135.95/100,000 in females). The age-standardized mortality rates by Chinese standard population (ASMRC) and by world standard population (ASMRW) were 131.20/100,000 and 130.80/100,000, respectively. Among the patients aged 0.74 years, the cumulative mortality rate was 15.03%. The crude cancer mortality rate in urban areas was higher than that of rural areas. However, the age-standardized rate in rural areas was higher than that of urban areas. Cancers of lung, stomach, esophagus, liver, female breast, colorectum, cervix, brain, uterus and ovary were the most common cancers, accounting for about 82.80% of all cancer new cases. Lung cancer, stomach cancer, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, female breast cancer, brain cancer, leukemia, pancreatic cancer and cervix cancer were the leading causes of cancer deaths, accounting for about 88.50% of all cancer deaths. The burden between urban and rural, males and females were different. CONCLUSIONS: Registration data of Henan province was qualified to provide basic information on population-based cancer incidence, mortality for cancer prevention and control. The upper digestive tract cancer burden in Henan province, especially for males in rural areas, was higher. The incidence rate of female breast cancer was higher in urban areas. Targeted prevention, early detection and treatment programs should be carried out by health department to control the cancer burden.","['Liu, Shuzheng', 'Chen, Qiong', 'Quan, Peiliang', 'Zhang, Meng', 'Zhang, Shaokai', 'Guo, Lanwei', 'Sun, Xibin', 'Wang, Chengzeng']","['Liu S', 'Chen Q', 'Quan P', 'Zhang M', 'Zhang S', 'Guo L', 'Sun X', 'Wang C']","['Henan Office for Cancer Research and Control, Henan Cancer Hospital/Institute, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Henan Office for Cancer Research and Control, Henan Cancer Hospital/Institute, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Henan Office for Cancer Research and Control, Henan Cancer Hospital/Institute, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Henan Office for Cancer Research and Control, Henan Cancer Hospital/Institute, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Henan Office for Cancer Research and Control, Henan Cancer Hospital/Institute, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Henan Office for Cancer Research and Control, Henan Cancer Hospital/Institute, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Henan Office for Cancer Research and Control, Henan Cancer Hospital/Institute, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Henan Office for Cancer Research and Control, Henan Cancer Hospital/Institute, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin J Cancer Res,Chinese journal of cancer research = Chung-kuo yen cheng yen chiu,9315242,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer registry', 'Henan province', 'epidemiology', 'incidence', 'mortality']",2016/08/02 06:00,2016/08/02 06:01,['2016/08/02 06:00'],"['2016/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2016.03.02 [doi]', 'cjcr-28-3-275 [pii]']",ppublish,Chin J Cancer Res. 2016 Jun;28(3):275-85. doi: 10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2016.03.02.,10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2016.03.02 [doi],,,,,PMC4949273,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SDCDC estimated the numbers of new cancer cases and cancer deaths in Shandong province with compiled cancer incidence and mortality rates. METHODS: In 2015, there were 21 cancer registries submitted data of cancer incidence and deaths occurred in 2012. All the data were checked and evaluated based on the National Central Cancer Registry (NCCR) criteria of data quality. Qualified data from 15 registries were used for cancer statistics analysis as provincial estimation. The pooled data were stratified by area (urban/rural), gender, age group (0, 1.4, 5.9, 10.14, ..., 85+ years) and cancer type. New cancer cases and deaths were estimated using age-specific rates and corresponding provincial population in 2012. The Chinese census data in 2000 and Segi's population were applied for age-standardized rates. All the rates were expressed per 100,000 person-year. RESULTS: Qualified 15 cancer registries (4 urban and 11 rural registries) covered 17,189,988 populations (7,486,039 in urban and 9,703,949 in rural areas). The percentage of cases morphologically verified (MV%) and death certificate-only cases (DCO%) were 66.12% and 2.93%, respectively, and the mortality to incidence rate ratio (M/I) was 0.60. A total of 253,060 new cancer cases and 157,750 cancer deaths were estimated in Shandong province in 2012. The incidence rate was 263.86/100,000 (303.29/100,000 in males, 223.23/100,000 in females), the age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASIRC) and by world standard population (ASIRW) were 192.42/100,000 and 189.50/100,000 with the cumulative incidence rate (0.74 years old) of 22.07%. The cancer incidence, ASIRC and ASIRW in urban areas were 267.64/100,000, 195.27/100,000 and 192.02/100,000 compared to 262.32/100,000, 191.26/100,000 and 188.48/100,000 in rural areas, respectively. The cancer mortality was 164.47/100,000 (207.42/100,000 in males, 120.23/100,000 in females), the age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASMRC) and by world standard population (ASMRW) were 117.54/100,000 and 116.90/100,000, and the cumulative mortality rate (0.74 years old) was 13.53%. The cancer mortality, ASMRC and ASMRW were 141.59/100,000, 101.17/100,000 and 100.33/100,000 in urban areas, and 173.79/100,000, 124.20/100,000 and 123.64/100,000 in rural areas, respectively. Cancers of the lung, stomach, liver, esophagus, colorectum, female breast, brain, leukemia, bladder and pancreas were the most common cancers, accounting for about 82.12% of all cancer new cases. Lung cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, female breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, brain tumor, leukemia and lymphoma were the leading causes of cancer death, accounting for about 89.01% of all cancer deaths. The cancer spectrum showed difference between urban and rural, males and females both in incidence and mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer surveillance information in Shandong province is making great progress with the increasing number of cancer registries, population coverage and the improving data quality. Cancer registration plays a fundamental role in cancer control by providing basic information on population-based cancer incidence, mortality, survival and time trend. The disease burden of cancer is serious in Shandong province, and so cancer prevention and control in Shandong province should be enhanced including health education, health promotion, cancer screening and cancer care services.","['Fu, Zhentao', 'Lu, Zilong', 'Li, Yingmei', 'Zhang, Jiyu', 'Zhang, Gaohui', 'Chen, Xianxian', 'Chu, Jie', 'Ren, Jie', 'Liu, Haiyan', 'Guo, Xiaolei']","['Fu Z', 'Lu Z', 'Li Y', 'Zhang J', 'Zhang G', 'Chen X', 'Chu J', 'Ren J', 'Liu H', 'Guo X']","['Shandong Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jinan 250014, China.', 'Shandong Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jinan 250014, China.', ""the Second People's Hospital of Jinan, Jinan 250001, China."", 'Shandong Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jinan 250014, China.', 'Shandong Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jinan 250014, China.', 'Shandong Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jinan 250014, China.', 'Shandong Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jinan 250014, China.', 'Shandong Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jinan 250014, China.', 'Shandong Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jinan 250014, China.', 'Shandong Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jinan 250014, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin J Cancer Res,Chinese journal of cancer research = Chung-kuo yen cheng yen chiu,9315242,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer registry', 'Shandong province', 'epidemiology', 'incidence', 'mortality']",2016/08/02 06:00,2016/08/02 06:01,['2016/08/02 06:00'],"['2016/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2016.03.01 [doi]', 'cjcr-28-3-263 [pii]']",ppublish,Chin J Cancer Res. 2016 Jun;28(3):263-74. doi: 10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2016.03.01.,10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2016.03.01 [doi],,,,,PMC4949272,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were used to assess the association between the presence of a pathogenic mutation and risk of relapse after alloHSCT. Eighty-six percent (96 of 112) of patients had at least 1 pathogenic mutation. Mutations in TP53, WT1, and FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) were associated with an increased risk of relapse after alloHSCT (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.90; P = .009; aHR, 2.51; P= .02; and aHR, 1.83; P = .07, respectively). DNMT3A mutation in the absence of FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations was associated with a lower relapse risk (aHR, .22; P = .04). Comparison of pre-alloHSCT and post-alloHSCT genetic profiles showed clonal evolution in 6 of 6 patients, including acquisition of actionable mutations in 4 patients. In summary, genetic profiling is useful for assessing relapse risk in patients with AML undergoing alloHSCT and may identify patients in need of strategies to reduce this risk. Clonal evolution is present at post-alloHSCT relapse and repeat genetic profiling may uncover acquired actionable mutations.","['Luskin, Marlise R', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Lieberman, David', 'Morrissette, Jennifer J D', 'Zhao, Jianhua', 'Crisalli, Lisa', 'Roth, David B', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Porter, David L', 'Reshef, Ran']","['Luskin MR', 'Carroll M', 'Lieberman D', 'Morrissette JJD', 'Zhao J', 'Crisalli L', 'Roth DB', 'Luger SM', 'Porter DL', 'Reshef R']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program and Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.

Radotinib-induced apoptosis involved the mitochondrial pathway. Moreover, radotinib increased the apoptosis of and induced caspase-3 activity in both Kasumi-1 cells and bone marrow cells (BMCs) obtained from patients with AML. Radotinib also increased cleaved caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9 levels and decreased the number of proliferating Kasumi-1 cells and BMCs from patients with AML. In addition, radotinib induced G0/G1 phase arrest by inducing CDKIs p21 and p27 and by inhibiting CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. These results indicate that radotinib induces caspase-dependent apoptosis and G0/G1 phase arrest in AML cells by regulating CDKI-CDK-cyclin cascade. Moreover, these results indicate that radotinib inhibits AML cell proliferation by inducing mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and CDKIs p21 and p27. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that radotinib can be potentially used for the anti-leukemic therapy of patients with AML.","['Heo, Sook-Kyoung', 'Noh, Eui-Kyu', 'Gwon, Gi-Dong', 'Kim, Jeong Yi', 'Jo, Jae-Cheol', 'Choi, Yunsuk', 'Koh, SuJin', 'Baek, Jin Ho', 'Min, Young Joo', 'Kim, Hawk']","['Heo SK', 'Noh EK', 'Gwon GD', 'Kim JY', 'Jo JC', 'Choi Y', 'Koh S', 'Baek JH', 'Min YJ', 'Kim H']","['Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-060, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-714, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-060, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-060, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-714, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-714, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-714, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-714, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-714, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-060, Republic of Korea; Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan 682-714, Republic of Korea.

The prognostic significance of DNMT3A R882 mutation clearance, using traditional diagnostic next generation sequencing (NGS) methods, during complete remission (CR) in AML patients is controversial. We examined the impact of clearing DNMT3A R882 mutations at diagnosis to the detectable threshold of <3% during CR on outcome in 56 adult AML patients. Mutational remission, defined as clearance of pre-treatment DNMT3A R882 and all other AML-associated mutations to a variant allele frequency <3%, occurred in 14 patients whereas persistent DNMT3A R882 mutations were observed in 42 patients. There were no significant differences in disease-free or overall survival between patients with and without DNMT3A R882 mutation clearance. Patients with persistent DNMT3A R882 who cleared all other AML mutations and did not acquire new mutations (n = 30), trended towards longer disease-free survival (1.6 vs. 0.6 years, P = 0.06) than patients with persistence of DNMT3A R882, in addition to other mutations or acquisition of new AML-associated mutations, such as those in TET2, JAK2, ASXL1 and TP53 (n = 12).

Thus advances regarding cancer or haematological treatment, improved knowledge of usual complications and of their pathophysiology and changes in ICU admission policy and management are among factors which participated to the overall prognostic changes. Tyrosine-Kinase inhibitors in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and anti-CD20 antibodies in patients with non-hodgkin's lymphoma were among the first success of targeted therapies. These success stories have been followed by others and no less than 13 targeted therapies were available for cancer patients in December 2013. Additionally, pathophysiology of complication is better understood and prognostic impact of organ failure better apprehended. Standardized diagnostic criteria of tumor lysis syndrome along with improved understanding of short-term and long term influence of acute kidney injury (AK) in this setting have led to specific management strategiesfocusing on prevention. In non-malignant haematological diseases, pathophysiological processes leading to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or atypical haemolytic and uremic syndrome are now better understood leading to additional therapeutic options. Last, diversification of ICU admission policies may help in taking into account uncertainties, therapeutic advances and patients' autonomy.

SA plays an important role for regulation of the innate immunity, function as markers of the cells and can be recognized by a variety of receptors. Interestingly, the level of SA expression is increased on metastatic cancer cells. The availability of specific antibodies against SA is limited and, therefore, biomarker tools for detection of SA are lacking. We have recently presented a novel method for specific fluorescence labeling of SA molecular imprinted polymers (MIP). Here, we have performed an extended screening of SA expression by using SA-MIP and included four different chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell lines, conveniently analyzed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. SA expression was detected in four cell lines at different levels, and the SA expression were verified with lectin-FITC. These results show that SA-MIP can be used as a plastic antibody for detection of SA using both flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. We suggest that SA-MIP can be used for screening of different tumor cells of various stages, including CLL cells.","['El-Schich, Zahra', 'Abdullah, Mohammad', 'Shinde, Sudhirkumar', 'Dizeyi, Nishtman', 'Rosen, Anders', 'Sellergren, Borje', 'Wingren, Anette Gjorloff']","['El-Schich Z', 'Abdullah M', 'Shinde S', 'Dizeyi N', 'Rosen A', 'Sellergren B', 'Wingren AG']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health and Society, Malmo University, Malmo, Sweden.

Nevertheless, survivors exposed to cranial radiotherapy (CRT) are at particularly high risk for long-term morbidity, such as endocrine insufficiencies, metabolic complications, and cardiovascular morbidity. Deficiencies of one or more anterior pituitary hormones have been described following therapeutic CRT for primary brain tumors, nasopharyngeal tumors, and following prophylactic CRT for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Studies have consistently shown a strong correlation between the total radiation dose and the development of pituitary deficits. Further, age at treatment and also time since treatment has strong implications on pituitary hormone deficiencies. There is evidence that the hypothalamus is more radiosensitive than the pituitary and is damaged by lower doses of CRT. With doses of CRT <50 Gy, the primary site of radiation damage is the hypothalamus and this usually causes isolated GH deficiency (GHD). Higher doses (>50 Gy) may produce direct anterior pituitary damage, which contributes to multiple pituitary deficiencies. The large group of ALL survivors treated with CRT in the 70-80-ties has now reached adulthood, and these survivors were treated mainly with 24 Gy, and the vast majority of these patients suffer from GHD. Further, after long-term follow-up, insufficiencies in prolactin (PRL) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) have also been reported and a proportion of these patients were also adrenocoticotrophic hormone (ACTH) deficient. CRT to the hypothalamus causes neuroendocrine dysfunction, which means that the choice of GH test is crucial for the diagnosis of GHD.","['Follin, Cecilia', 'Erfurth, Eva Marie']","['Follin C', 'Erfurth EM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Skane University hospital and IKVL, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

Ever since its discovery in the early 1990s, there has been accumulating evidence to suggest a pathogenic role of Syk in various allergic disorders, autoimmune diseases and malignancies. Additionally, there is emerging data from both pre-clinical and clinical studies that Syk is implicated in the pathogenesis of proliferative glomerulonephritis (GN), including anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated GN, lupus nephritis and immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). Moreover, recent animal studies have shed light on the importance of Syk in mediating acute renal allograft rejection, Epstein Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease and kidney fibrosis. Fostamatinib, an oral Syk inhibitor, has undergone clinical testing in rheumatoid arthritis, refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura, leukemia and lymphoma. The recent STOP-IgAN trial showed that the addition of non-selective immunosuppressive therapy to intensive supportive care did not improve clinical outcomes in high-risk IgAN patients. A Syk-targeted approach may be beneficial and is currently being evaluated in a phase II randomized controlled trial. In this review, we will discuss the pathogenic role of Syk and potential use of Syk inhibitor in a variety of renal diseases.","['Ma, Terry King-Wing', 'McAdoo, Stephen P', 'Tam, Frederick Wai-Keung']","['Ma TK', 'McAdoo SP', 'Tam FW']","['Renal and Vascular Inflammation Section, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160730,Switzerland,Nephron,Nephron,0331777,['EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Kidney Diseases/*enzymology', 'Syk Kinase/*metabolism']",,,2016/08/01 06:00,2017/02/28 06:00,['2016/08/01 06:00'],"['2016/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['000446879 [pii]', '10.1159/000446879 [doi]']",ppublish,Nephron. 2016;133(4):261-9. doi: 10.1159/000446879.

We analyzed global levels of hematopoietic 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in a cross-sectional study comprising 198 unrelated individuals from four age categories (neonates, 25-30, 70-75, and >90 years old) by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring. X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) ratios and telomere length (TL) were measured in all individuals by polymerase chain reaction. Sequencing of epigenetic regulator genes (including TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1, IDH1, IDH2, and WT1) was performed in the two older subcohorts. We found that global 5hmC levels declined with age in human blood cells (27.5% reduction from birth to old age, p < 0.0005). The levels of 5mC underwent a more modest reduction (2.4% drop) between newborns and the elderly (p < 0.0005). Low 5hmC was associated with increased skewing of XCI (age-adjusted p = 0.0304) and reduced TL (age-adjusted p = 0.0354), both surrogate markers of clonal dominance. Of the 100 individuals over the age of 70, 16 had somatic mutations in TET2, 14 in DNMT3A, and none in IDH1, IDH2, or WT1. Individuals with TET2 mutations had significantly lower 5hmC (relative to unmutated individuals), whereas DNMT3A-mutated subjects did not. However, mutations in TET2 cannot account solely for the decline in 5hmC levels observed with aging because unmutated older individuals also had lower 5hmC levels compared with younger individuals. This suggests that the age-associated decline in 5hmC is multifactorial. Larger prospective studies are needed to determine whether 5hmC reduction is a biomarker of hematological cancer development.","['Buscarlet, Manuel', 'Tessier, Alain', 'Provost, Sylvie', 'Mollica, Luigina', 'Busque, Lambert']","['Buscarlet M', 'Tessier A', 'Provost S', 'Mollica L', 'Busque L']","['Research Centre, Montreal, Canada.', 'Centre for Biological Applications of Mass Spectrometry, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada.', 'Beaulieu-Saucier Pharmacogenomics Centre, Montreal Heart Institute Research Centre, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Montreal, Canada; Department of Hematology, Installation Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, Canada; Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Montreal, Canada; Department of Hematology, Installation Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, Canada; Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.

We performed a retrospective analysis of 363 patients with untreated AML who received induction chemotherapy in order to determine the relationship between day of blast disappearance (DOBD) and complete remission (CR) rates, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS). DOBD </= 5 vs. >5 was identified as the most discriminating cutoff for OS. DOBD > 5 was observed in 35 patients (9.6%). The CR rate for patients with DOBD </= 5 vs. >5 was 74.0 and 28.6%, median EFS was 9.4 and 1.8 months, and median OS was 17.1 and 5.8 months, respectively (P < 0.001 for all). DOBD > 5 was independently associated with a lower CR rate and shorter EFS and OS (P < 0.001 for all). DOBD > 5 retained prognostic significance for EFS and OS when patients were stratified by cytogenetic risk group, de novo vs. secondary or therapy-related AML, European LeukemiaNet-based risk groups, and whether CR was achieved. We propose DOBD > 5 as a simple and early marker of disease resistance that identifies patients with poor prognosis who otherwise may not be identified with existing risk stratification systems. Am.

A cohort of pediatric patients with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia was assembled from the Pediatric Health Information System. We evaluated whether patients not enrolled onto Children's Oncology Group trial AAML0531 had greater intensive care unit (ICU)-level requirements than enrolled patients and whether early discharge after chemotherapy administration mediated this association. Patients not enrolled on AAML0531 were more likely to be discharged early (aOR = 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02, 1.90) and to require ICU-level care (aOR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.06, 3.78) than enrolled patients, but early discharge explained only a small proportion (12.3%) of the absolute difference in ICU-level care risk.

DNA mutations are accumulated during this process including background mutations that emerge scholastically, as well as driver mutations that selectively occur in a handful of cancer genes and confer the cell a growth advantage over its neighbors. A clone of tumor cells could be superseded by another clone that acquires new mutations and grows more aggressively. Tumor evolutional patterns have been studied for years using conventional approaches that focus on the investigation of a single or a couple of genes. Latest deep sequencing technology enables a global view of tumor evolution by deciphering almost all genome aberrations in a tumor. Tumor clones and the fate of each clone during tumor evolution can be depicted with the help of the concept of variant allele frequency. Here, we summarize the new insights of cancer evolutional progression in acute myeloid leukemia. Cancer evolution is currently thought to start from a clone that has accumulated the requisite somatically-acquired genetic aberrations through a series of increasingly disordered clinical and pathological phases, eventually leading to malignant transformation [1-3]. The observations in invasive colorectal cancer that usually emerges from an antecedent benign adenomatous polyp and in cervical cancer that proceeds through intraepithelial neoplasia support the idea of stepwise or linear cancerous progression [3-5]. Genetically, such progression is achieved by successive waves of clonal expansion during which cells acquire novel genomic alterations including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions and deletions (indels), and/or copy number variations (CNVs) [6]. The latest improvement in sequencing technology has allowed the deciphering of the whole exome or genome in different types of tumor and normal tissue pairs, providing detailed catalogue about genome aberrations during tumor initiation and progression, which have been reviewed in several papers [7-10]. Here, we focus on demonstrating the cancer clonal evolution pattern revealed by recent deep sequencing studies of samples from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients.","['Zhang, Xuehong', 'Lv, Dekang', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Liu, Quentin', 'Li, Zhiguang']","['Zhang X', 'Lv D', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu Q', 'Li Z']","['Center of Genome and Personalized Medicine, Institute of Cancer Stem Cell, Cancer Center, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Center of Genome and Personalized Medicine, Institute of Cancer Stem Cell, Cancer Center, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Center of Genome and Personalized Medicine, Institute of Cancer Stem Cell, Cancer Center, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Center of Genome and Personalized Medicine, Institute of Cancer Stem Cell, Cancer Center, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Center of Genome and Personalized Medicine, Institute of Cancer Stem Cell, Cancer Center, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', '*Clonal Evolution', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Exome', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genome, Human', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Heterozygote', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'cancer genome', 'clonal evolution']",2016/07/31 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2016/07/31 06:00'],"['2016/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10850 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10850 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Sep 6;7(36):58586-58594. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10850.,10.18632/oncotarget.10850 [doi],,,,,PMC5295455,['We do not have any conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The unique action mechanism of inducing DNA strand breaks distinguishes CNDAC from other deoxycytidine analogs. To optimize the clinical potentials of CNDAC, we explored multiple strategies combining CNDAC with chemotherapeutic agents targeting distinct DNA damage repair pathways that are currently in clinical use. The ability of each agent to decrease proliferative potential, determined by clonogenic assays, was determined in paired cell lines proficient and deficient in certain DNA repair proteins. Subsequently, each agent was used in combination with CNDAC at fixed concentration ratios. The clonogenicity was quantitated by median effect analysis, and a combination index was calculated. The c-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib had synergy with CNDAC in HCT116 cells, regardless of p53 status. Inhibitors of PARP1 that interfere with homologous recombination (HR) repair or base excision repair (BER) and agents such as temozolomide that cause DNA damage repaired by the BER pathway were also synergistic with CNDAC. The toxicity of the nitrogen mustards bendamustine and cytoxan, or of platinum compounds, which generate DNA adducts repaired by nucleotide excision repair and HR, was additive with CNDAC. An additive cell killing was also achieved by the combination of CNDAC with taxane mitotic inhibitors (paclitaxel and docetaxel). At concentrations that allow survival of the majority of wild-type cells, the synergistic or additive combination effects were selective in HR-deficient cells.

Activation of M1, M3 or M5 mAChRs increases the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) through inositol-1,4,5-phosphate (IP3)-mediated Ca(2+) release from endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores. In addition, T lymphocytes express Ca(2+)-release activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels to induce Ca(2+) influx and to regulate diverse immune functions. Our aim in the present study was to assess the role of CRAC channels during mAChR activation in the Ca(2+)-dependent transduction that contributes to the regulation of T cell function. MAIN METHODS: Changes in [Ca(2+)]i following mAChR activation on human leukemic T cells, CCRF-CEM (CEM), were monitored using fura-2, based on the ratio of 510nm fluorescences elicited by excitation at 340nm and 380nm (R340/380). KEY FINDINGS: We demonstrate that CEM cells express mainly M3 and M5 mAChRs, but little the M1 subtype, and that oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M), an mAChR agonist, induces an initial transient increase in [Ca(2+)]i followed by repetitive [Ca(2+)]i oscillations. Removing extracellular Ca(2+) or pharmacological blockade of CRAC channels abolished the [Ca(2+)]i oscillations without affecting the initial [Ca(2+)]i transient induced by Oxo-M. Moreover, CRAC channel blockade also suppressed Oxo-M-induced c-fos and interleukin-2 expression. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that upon M3 or M5 mAChR activation, IP3-mediated Ca(2+) release induces extracellular Ca(2+) influx through CRAC channels, which generates repetitive [Ca(2+)]i oscillations and, in turn, enhances c-fos gene expression in T lymphocytes.","['Mashimo, Masato', 'Yurie, Yukako', 'Kawashima, Koichiro', 'Fujii, Takeshi']","['Mashimo M', 'Yurie Y', 'Kawashima K', 'Fujii T']","[""Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts, Kyotanabe, Kyoto 610-0395, Japan."", ""Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts, Kyotanabe, Kyoto 610-0395, Japan."", 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Kitasato University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8641, Japan.', ""Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts, Kyotanabe, Kyoto 610-0395, Japan.

Although this condition carries high mortality during prenatal and early postnatal life, some of the rare infants who survive the first months develop benign and malignant tumors. To determine the tumor profile associated with Edwards syndrome, we performed a systematic review of the literature. This review reveals a tumor profile differing from those of Down (trisomy 21) and Patau (trisomy 13) syndromes. The literature covers 45 malignancies: 29 were liver cancers, mainly hepatoblastomas found in Japanese females; 13 were kidney tumors, predominantly nephroblastomas; 1 was neuroblastoma; 1 was a Hodgkin disease; and 1 was acute myeloid leukemia in an infant with both trisomy 18 and type 1 neurofibromatosis. No instances of the most frequent malignancies of early life-cerebral tumors, germ cell tumors, or leukemia--are reported in children with pure trisomy 18. Tumor occurrence does not appear to correlate with body weight, tissue growth, or cancer genes mapping to chromosome 18. Importantly, the most recent clinical histories report successful treatment; this raises ethical concerns about cancer treatment in infants with Edwards syndrome. In conclusion, knowledge of the Edwards' syndrome tumor profile will enable better clinical surveillance in at-risk organs (i.e., liver, kidney). This knowledge also provides clues to understanding oncogenesis, including the probably reduced frequency of some neoplasms in infants and children with this genetic condition.

This process is dependent on Fc:Fc interactions, which promote C1q binding, the first step in classical pathway complement activation. We went on to engineer point mutations that stimulated IgG hexamer formation and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The hexamer formation-enhanced (HexaBody) CD20 and CD38 mAbs support faster, more robust CDC than their wild-type counterparts. To further investigate the CDC potential of these mAbs, we used flow cytometry, high-resolution digital imaging, and four-color confocal microscopy to examine their activity against B cell lines and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in sera depleted of single complement components. We also examined the CDC activity of alemtuzumab (anti-CD52) and mAb W6/32 (anti-HLA), which bind at high density to cells and promote substantial complement activation. Although we observed little CDC for mAb-opsonized cells reacted with sera depleted of early complement components, we were surprised to discover that the Hexabody mAbs, as well as ALM and W6/32, were all quite effective at promoting CDC in sera depleted of individual complement components C6 to C9. However, neutralization studies conducted with an anti-C9 mAb verified that C9 is required for CDC activity against cell lines. These highly effective complement-activating mAbs efficiently focus activated complement components on the cell, including C3b and C9, and promote CDC with a very low threshold of MAC binding, thus providing additional insight into their enhanced efficacy in promoting CDC.","['Cook, Erika M', 'Lindorfer, Margaret A', 'van der Horst, Hilma', 'Oostindie, Simone', 'Beurskens, Frank J', 'Schuurman, Janine', 'Zent, Clive S', 'Burack, Richard', 'Parren, Paul W H I', 'Taylor, Ronald P']","['Cook EM', 'Lindorfer MA', 'van der Horst H', 'Oostindie S', 'Beurskens FJ', 'Schuurman J', 'Zent CS', 'Burack R', 'Parren PW', 'Taylor RP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908;', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908;', 'Genmab, 3584 CM Utrecht, the Netherlands;', 'Genmab, 3584 CM Utrecht, the Netherlands;', 'Genmab, 3584 CM Utrecht, the Netherlands;', 'Genmab, 3584 CM Utrecht, the Netherlands;', 'Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY 14642;', 'Department of Pathology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY 14642; and.', 'Genmab, 3584 CM Utrecht, the Netherlands; Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZA Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908; rpt@virginia.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160729,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Complement C9)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '80295-43-8 (Complement C3b)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/immunology/*metabolism', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*chemistry/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/immunology', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Complement Activation', 'Complement C3b/metabolism', 'Complement C9/immunology/*metabolism', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology/*metabolism']",,,2016/07/31 06:00,2017/08/25 06:00,['2016/07/31 06:00'],"['2016/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1600648 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1600648 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2016 Sep 1;197(5):1762-75. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1600648.

BLV transmission depends on infected cell exchange and thus, proviral load is determinant. Understanding the mechanisms which govern the control of viral dissemination will be desirable for the design of effective therapeutic or preventive strategies for BLV. The development of high proviral load (HPL) or low proviral load (LPL) might be associated to genetic factors and humoral immune responses, however cellular responses are not fully described. We aimed to characterize cytokines and toll-like receptors (TLR) expression related to the proviral load profiles. IFN-gamma and IL-12 mRNA expression level was significantly higher in PBMC from infected cattle (LPL n=6 and HPL n=7) compared to uninfected animals (n=5). While no significant differences were observed in IL-12 expression between LPL and HPL group, IFN-gamma expression was significantly higher in LPL animals. Infected cattle exhibited higher expression levels of TLR3, 7-9. Animals with HPL had significantly higher expression of TLR7/8 than uninfected cattle. TLR8 and TLR9 were up-regulated in HPL group, and TLR3 was up-regulated in LPL group. This is the first report related to TLR gene expression in BLV infected cattle and represents evidence of the involvement of these receptors in BLV recognition. Further studies on different subpopulations of immune cells may help clarify their role in response to BLV and its consequences on viral dissemination.","['Farias, Maria Victoria Nieto', 'Lendez, Pamela Anahi', 'Marin, Maia', 'Quintana, Silvina', 'Martinez-Cuesta, Lucia', 'Ceriani, Maria Carolina', 'Dolcini, Guillermina Laura']","['Farias MVN', 'Lendez PA', 'Marin M', 'Quintana S', 'Martinez-Cuesta L', 'Ceriani MC', 'Dolcini GL']","['Laboratorio de Virologia, Centro de Investigacion Veterinaria de Tandil (CIVETAN, CONICET-CICPBA), Facultad de Cs.

Successful treatment of HLH by etoposide has improved outcomes for children with HLH. However, the development of treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) after the usage of this drug is a concern. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of acquired EBV-triggered HLH with progression to t-AML following etoposide therapy with cytogenetic abnormality for t (11; 19) (q23; p13) resulting in MLL gene fusion. The development of t-AML was detected 23 months after HLH diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although the successful treatment of HLH by etoposide has improved outcomes for children with HLH, t-AML is a serious complication of topoisomerase II inhibitor therapy and is characterized by the presence of gene rearrangement. This study suggests that HLH patients undergoing therapy with HLH-2004 protocol need monitoring for future malignancy, especially in the initial 2 to 3 years.","['Pan, Hua', 'Feng, Dong-Ning', 'Song, Liang', 'Sun, Li-Rong']","['Pan H', 'Feng DN', 'Song L', 'Sun LR']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, Shandong, 266003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Qingdao Children's Hospital, 6 Tong An Road, Qingdao, Shandong, 266003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, Shandong, 266003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, 16 Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, Shandong, 266003, People's Republic of China. sunlr@vip.sina.com.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20160729,England,BMC Pediatr,BMC pediatrics,100967804,"['0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications', 'Etoposide/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/complications/*drug therapy/virology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Etoposide', '*Hemophagocytosis', '*Secondary AML']",2016/07/31 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/07/31 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12887-016-0649-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12887-016-0649-z [pii]']",epublish,BMC Pediatr. 2016 Jul 29;16:116. doi: 10.1186/s12887-016-0649-z.,10.1186/s12887-016-0649-z [doi],,,,,PMC4967337,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combined effect of replication stress and DNA damage repair defects associated with various oncogenic events drives genomic instability and disease progression. However, these DNA repair defects found in cancer cells can also provide unique therapeutic opportunities and form the basis of synthetic lethal targeting of solid tumors carrying BRCA mutations. Although the idea of utilizing synthetic lethality as a therapy strategy has been gaining momentum in various solid tumors, its application in leukemia still largely lags behind. In this article, we review recent advances in understanding the roles of the DNA damage response in acute myeloid leukemia and examine the potential therapeutic avenues of using poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in AML treatment.","['Zhao, Lu', 'So, Chi Wai Eric']","['Zhao L', 'So CW']","[""Leukaemia and Stem Cell Biology Group.

We examined the expression of 87 genes in the complement, coagulation, and fibrinolysis-proteolytic pathways in 374 cytogenetically normal AML samples and observed that these samples can be divided into subgroups on the basis of complement gene expression. Three complement regulatory genes were linked to poor outcome as individual factors in a multivariate analysis (CFH, CFD, and SERPING1) in multiple cohorts. The combined expression of these genes was significantly associated with poorer overall survival in two cohorts of patients <60 years of age, independent of other factors (p </= 0.0004). For patients with an intermediate molecular risk, this three-gene risk marker enabled stratification of patients into prognostic subgroups with survival ranging from 17.4% to 44.1%. Thus, the expression of complement pathway genes is linked to outcome in AML, and a three-gene risk marker may improve the risk assessment of patients.","['Laverdiere, Isabelle', 'Boileau, Meaghan', 'Herold, Tobias', 'Rak, Janusz', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Wormann, Bernhard', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Eppert, Kolja']","['Laverdiere I', 'Boileau M', 'Herold T', 'Rak J', 'Berdel WE', 'Wormann B', 'Hiddemann W', 'Spiekermann K', 'Bohlander SK', 'Eppert K']","['Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre and McGill University, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre and McGill University, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 3, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat (LMU), Munich, Germany.', 'Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre and McGill University, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology, Oncology, Tumor Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 3, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat (LMU), Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 3, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat (LMU), Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre and McGill University, Montreal, Canada.

Graft versus leukemia (GVL) effects, which are exerted by donor T cells directed against leukemic-associated antigens (LAAs), are considered to play a crucial role in disease eradication. Although the expansion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for cytomegalovirus (CMV) in response to an infection has been shown in multiple studies, data on CTLs mediating GVL effects are limited. To evaluate a potential increase or decrease of T lymphocytes specific for LAAs in the setting of allogeneic HSCT, we monitored leukemia-specific CD8(+) T cells throughout the first year after HSCT in 18 patients using streptamer technology. A broad panel of promising LAAs was selected: Wilms tumor protein, proteinase 3, receptor for hyaluronan acid-mediated motility, apoptosis regulator Bcl-2, survivin, nucleophosmin, and fibromodulin. T cells specifically directed against AML- or CLL-associated antigens were found at very low frequencies in peripheral blood. Substantial frequencies of LAA-specific T cells could not be measured at any time point by flow cytometry. In contrast, abundant CMV-pp65-specific T cells were detected in CMV-seropositive patient-recipient pairs and an increase prompted by CMV infection could be demonstrated. In conclusion, T lymphocytes with specificities for the aforementioned LAAs can only be detected in minimal quantities in the early phase after allogeneic HSCT.","['Rucker-Braun, Elke', 'Link, Cornelia S', 'Schmiedgen, Maria', 'Tunger, Antje', 'Vizjak, Petra', 'Teipel, Raphael', 'Wehner, Rebekka', 'Kuhn, Denise', 'Fuchs, Yannik F', 'Oelschlagel, Uta', 'Germeroth, Lothar', 'Schmitz, Marc', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Heidenreich, Falk']","['Rucker-Braun E', 'Link CS', 'Schmiedgen M', 'Tunger A', 'Vizjak P', 'Teipel R', 'Wehner R', 'Kuhn D', 'Fuchs YF', 'Oelschlagel U', 'Germeroth L', 'Schmitz M', 'Bornhauser M', 'Schetelig J', 'Heidenreich F']","['Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.

However, curcumin takes on these contrasting roles leading to either protection or enhanced apoptosis in different irradiated cells. Here we studied whether pretreatment with free curcumin or a novel dendrosomal nanoformulation of curcumin (DNC) could exert protective/sensitizing effects on irradiated THP-1 leukemia cells. We employed assays including MTT viability, clonogenic survival, DNA fragmentation, PI/Annexin V flow cytometry, antioxidant system (ROS, TBARS for lipid peroxidation, 8-OHdG and gammaH2AX for DNA damage, glutathione, CAT and GPx activity, enzymes gene expression), ELISA (NF-kappaB and Nrf2 binding, TNF-alpha release), caspase assay, siRNA silencing of caspase-3, and western blotting to illustrate the observed protective role of curcumin in comparison with the opposite sensitizing role of its nanoformulation at a similar 10 muM concentration. The in vivo relevance of this concentration was determined via intraperitoneal administration in mice. Curcumin significantly enhanced the antioxidant defense, while DNC induced apoptosis and reduced viability as well as survival of irradiated THP-1 cells. Nrf2 binding showed an early rise and fall in DNC-treated cells, despite a gradual increase in curcumin-treated cells. We also demonstrated that DNC induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells via caspase-3 activation; whereas in combination with radiation, DNC alternatively employed a caspase-independent apoptosis pathway involving cytochrome c release from mitochondria.","['Soltani, Behrooz', 'Ghaemi, Nasser', 'Sadeghizadeh, Majid', 'Najafi, Farhood']","['Soltani B', 'Ghaemi N', 'Sadeghizadeh M', 'Najafi F']","['Department of Biotechnology, College of Science, University of Tehran, Enghelab St., Tehran, 14155-6455, Iran.', 'Department of Biotechnology, College of Science, University of Tehran, Enghelab St., Tehran, 14155-6455, Iran. nasser.ghaemi@khayam.ut.ac.ir.', 'School of Chemistry, College of Science, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran. nasser.ghaemi@khayam.ut.ac.ir.', 'Department of Genetics, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Resin and Additives, Institute for Color Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160729,Netherlands,Cell Biol Toxicol,Cell biology and toxicology,8506639,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Lipids)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Curcumin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cytoprotection/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects/radiation effects', '*Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Models, Biological', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Necrosis', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/radiation effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Cytochrome c', '*GSH', '*Nrf2', '*Radiation', '*TNF-alpha']",2016/07/31 06:00,2017/09/30 06:00,['2016/07/31 06:00'],"['2016/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10565-016-9354-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s10565-016-9354-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Toxicol. 2016 Dec;32(6):543-561. doi: 10.1007/s10565-016-9354-9.

These signals play important roles in cellular functions and malignancies. Their tumorigenic role in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) is well known; however, their potential interactions and functions are poorly characterized in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The aim of our study was to characterize mTOR and Notch signalling elements in HL cell lines (DEV, L1236, KMH2) and human biopsies and to investigate their cross-talk in the tumorous process. High mTOR activity and constitutive NOTCH1 activation was confirmed in HL cell lines, without any known oncogenic mutations in key elements, including those common to both pathways. The anti-tumour effect of Notch inhibitors are well known from several preclinical models but resistance and side effects occur in many cases. Here, we tested mTOR and Notch inhibitors and their combinations in gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) resistant HL cells in vitro and in vivo. mTOR inhibitor alone or in combination was able to reduce tumour growth; furthermore, it was more effective in xenograft models in vivo. Based on these results, we suggest that constitutively activated NOTCH1 may be a potential target in HL therapy; furthermore, mTOR inhibitors may be effective for decreasing tumour growth if resistance to Notch inhibitors develop.","['Nagy, Noemi', 'Hajdu, Melinda', 'Mark, Agnes', 'Kiraly, Peter Attila', 'Toth, Monika', 'Danko, Titanilla', 'Csoka, Monika', 'Sebestyen, Anna']","['Nagy N', 'Hajdu M', 'Mark A', 'Kiraly PA', 'Toth M', 'Danko T', 'Csoka M', 'Sebestyen A']","['1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, 26 Ulloi ut, Budapest, 1085, Hungary.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, 26 Ulloi ut, Budapest, 1085, Hungary.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, 26 Ulloi ut, Budapest, 1085, Hungary.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, 26 Ulloi ut, Budapest, 1085, Hungary.', 'Lendulet Molecular Oncohematology Research Group of Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, 26 Ulloi ut, Budapest, 1085, Hungary.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, 26 Ulloi ut, Budapest, 1085, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, 7-9 Tuzolto u, Budapest, 1094, Hungary.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, 26 Ulloi ut, Budapest, 1085, Hungary. anna@korb1.sote.hu.', 'Tumour Progression Research Group of Joint Research Organization of Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary. anna@korb1.sote.hu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160729,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['Gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI) resistance', 'Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)', 'Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)', 'Notch', 'Tumour growth']",2016/07/31 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/07/31 06:00'],"['2016/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13277-016-5272-y [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-016-5272-y [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2016 Oct;37(10):13695-13704. doi: 10.1007/s13277-016-5272-y.

Here, a triple-regulated oncolytic adenovirus was constructed to carry a VSTM1 gene expression cassette, SG611-VSTM1, and contained the E1a gene with a 24-nucleotide deletion within the CR2 region under control of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter, E1b gene directed by the hypoxia response element, and VSTM1 gene controlled by the cytomegalovirus promoter. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses showed that SG611-VSTM1 expressed VSTM1 highly efficiently in the human leukemic cell line K562 compared with SG611. In Cell Counting Kit-8 and flow cytometric assays, SG611-VSTM1 exhibited more potent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in leukemic cells compared with SG611 and exerted synergistic cytotoxicity with low-dose daunorubicin (DNR) in vitro. In xenograft models, SG611-VSTM1 intratumorally injected at a dose of 1 x 10(9) plaque forming units combined with intraperitoneally injected low-dose DNR displayed significantly stronger antitumor effects than either treatment alone. Histopathologic examination revealed that SG611-VSTM1 induced apoptosis of leukemic cells. These results implicate an important role for VSTM1 in the pathogenesis of leukemia, and SG611-VSTM1 may be a promising agent for enhancing chemosensitivity in leukemia therapy.","['Zhou, Jiao', 'Yao, Qiu-Mei', 'Li, Jin-Lan', 'Chang, Yan', 'Li, Ting', 'Han, Wen-Ling', 'Wu, Hong-Ping', 'Li, Lin-Fang', 'Qian, Qi-Jun', 'Ruan, Guo-Rui']","['Zhou J', 'Yao QM', 'Li JL', 'Chang Y', 'Li T', 'Han WL', 'Wu HP', 'Li LF', 'Qian QJ', 'Ruan GR']","[""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, 11 Xi-Zhi-Men South Street, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, 11 Xi-Zhi-Men South Street, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, 11 Xi-Zhi-Men South Street, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, 11 Xi-Zhi-Men South Street, Beijing, 100044, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Department of Immunology, Ministry of Health, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Peking University Center for Human Disease Genomics, 38 Xueyuan Road, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Department of Immunology, Ministry of Health, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Peking University Center for Human Disease Genomics, 38 Xueyuan Road, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Laboratory of Viral and Gene Therapy, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgical Hospital, Second Military Medical University, 225 Changhai Road, Shanghai, 200438, China.', 'Laboratory of Viral and Gene Therapy, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgical Hospital, Second Military Medical University, 225 Changhai Road, Shanghai, 200438, China.', 'Laboratory of Viral and Gene Therapy, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgical Hospital, Second Military Medical University, 225 Changhai Road, Shanghai, 200438, China.', ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, 11 Xi-Zhi-Men South Street, Beijing, 100044, China. ruanguorui@pkuph.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (VSTM1 protein, human)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics/physiology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/physiopathology/*therapy/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy', 'Oncolytic Viruses/*genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Daunorubicin', '*Gene therapy', '*Leukemia', '*Oncolytic adenovirus', '*VSTM1 gene']",2016/07/31 06:00,2018/02/14 06:00,['2016/07/31 06:00'],"['2016/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10495-016-1276-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s10495-016-1276-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2016 Oct;21(10):1179-90. doi: 10.1007/s10495-016-1276-8.,10.1007/s10495-016-1276-8 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively analyzed treatment outcome and prognostic factors of elderly AML patients who had received either standard-dose or low-intensity induction regimens.Two hundred forty-eight elderly AML patients with good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS </= 2) received one of three regimens for induction in this study: standard-dose cytarabine plus idarubicin (IA; n = 144) or daunorubicin (DA; n = 42); low-intensity cytarabine, aclarubicin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (CAG; n = 62).After first induction treatment cycle, the overall complete remission (CR) rate was 42.7%. Patients in IA group had a higher CR rate than in DA or CAG group (49.3%, 35.7%, and 32.3%, respectively; P = 0.046). The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 42.2%, 18.9%, and 13.5% for these 248 patients, with median survival of 9.2 months. Long-term survival of IA group was better than DA or CAG group. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS rates of IA group were 45.9%, 23.5%, and 19.4%, respectively, as compared to 39.8%, 8.3%, and estimated 2.4% in DA group, and 34.9%, 15.9%, and 6.3% in CAG group, respectively. Early induction mortality and 2-year relapse rates showed no difference among 3 groups. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis identified lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) more than two times of upper normal limit at diagnosis and nonremission after first induction cycle as adverse prognostic factors for OS. A simple and valid scoring model was constructed for risk stratification and prediction of long-term survival of elderly AML patients.Standard-dose IA regimen could improve the prognosis of elderly AML patients with good performance status compared with standard-dose DA or low-intensity CAG regimen. All prognostic factors and risk assessment should be considered to ensure that each patient receives the suitable individualized treatment.","['Chen, Yi', 'Yang, Ting', 'Zheng, Xiaoyun', 'Yang, Xiaozhu', 'Zheng, Zhihong', 'Zheng, Jing', 'Liu, Tingbo', 'Hu, Jianda']","['Chen Y', 'Yang T', 'Zheng X', 'Yang X', 'Zheng Z', 'Zheng J', 'Liu T', 'Hu J']","['Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, P.

A total of 4432 children with newly diagnosed cancer between 2000 and 2007 were identified as the cancer cohort, and 17,653 children without cancer frequency-matched by sex and age at entry were considered the noncancer cohort. The association between herpes zoster and childhood cancer was determined.Children with cancer had a higher risk of herpes zoster. The incidence rate of herpes zoster was higher in the cancer cohort than in the noncancer cohort (20.7 vs 2.4 per 10,000 person-years; IRR = 8.6; 95% CI = 4.8-15.6). The cumulative incidence was significantly higher in the cancer cohort (P < 0.0001).

For example, relapse of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) after inhibiting BCR-ABL fusion protein using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (e.g., Imatinib) is of significant clinical concern. This study developed a dual modal gene therapy that simultaneously tackles two key BCR-ABL-linked pathways using viral/nonviral chimeric nanoparticles (ChNPs). Consisting of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) core and an acid-degradable polymeric shell, the ChNPs were designed to simultaneously induce pro-apoptotic BIM expression by the AAV core and silence pro-survival MCL-1 by the small interfering RNA (siRNA) encapsulated in the shell. The resulting BIM/MCL-1 ChNPs were able to efficiently suppress the proliferation of BCR-ABL+ K562 and FL5.12/p190 cells in vitro and in vivo via simultaneously expressing BIM and silencing MCL-1. Interestingly, the synergistic antileukemic effects generated by BIM/MCL-1 ChNPs were specific to BCR-ABL+ cells and independent of a proliferative cytokine, IL-3. The AAV core of ChNPs was efficiently shielded from inactivation by anti-AAV serum and avoided the generation of anti-AAV serum, without acute toxicity. This study demonstrates the development of a synergistically efficient, specific, and safe therapy for leukemia using gene carriers that simultaneously manipulate multiple and interlinked pathological pathways.","['Hong, Cheol Am', 'Cho, Soo Kyung', 'Edson, Julius A', 'Kim, Jane', 'Ingato, Dominique', 'Pham, Bryan', 'Chuang, Anthony', 'Fruman, David A', 'Kwon, Young Jik']","['Hong CA', 'Cho SK',

The aim of this study was to evaluate maternal dietary risk factors of ALL. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Springer Link, Wiley Online, Science Direct, Mosby, ISI Web of Science, OVID, ProQuest, and Scopus from database inception until February 2, 2016. Two reviewers scanned titles, abstracts, and keywords of articles after excluding duplicates. We included case-control studies evaluating the relationship between maternal diet during pregnancy and childhood ALL. The search resulted in 2,940 papers, of which 11 full-text articles met the criteria for inclusion in the review and were analyzed. The finding of these studies suggest that maternal diet composed largely of vegetables, fruits, and protein sources before and during pregnancy can reduce the risk of ALL in offspring. Maternal alcohol intake had no effect. Nevertheless, inherent limitations of case-control studies like measurement error, random error, recall bias, and selection bias preclude conclusive evidence. Persuading pregnant women to follow a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and protein may reduce the risk of childhood ALL. Avoiding alcohol intake seems prudent.","['Abiri, Behnaz', 'Kelishadi, Roya', 'Sadeghi, Homa', 'Azizi-Soleiman, Fatemeh']","['Abiri B', 'Kelishadi R', 'Sadeghi H', 'Azizi-Soleiman F']","['a Department of Nutrition , School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran.', 'b Department of Pediatrics , Child Growth and Development Research Center, Research Institute for Primordial Prevention of Non-communicable Disease, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences , Isfahan , Iran.', 'c Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition, University of Eastern Finland , Finland.', 'a Department of Nutrition , School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20160729,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Diet/adverse effects', '*Diet, Healthy', '*Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Female', 'Folic Acid Deficiency/etiology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', '*Patient Compliance', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors', 'Vitamin A Deficiency/etiology/physiopathology']",,,2016/07/30 06:00,2017/12/20 06:00,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2016.1206581 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2016 Oct;68(7):1065-72. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2016.1206581.

We analyzed age, period of death, and cohort of birth effects for 18 major cancer sites and all neoplasms combined in the European Union and 16 European countries over the period 1970-2009 using data from the WHO mortality database. We used a log-linear Poisson model with a likelihood penalizing function to solve the identifiability problem. The present comprehensive analysis confirms the appreciable declines of cancer mortality since the late 1980s in most European countries. For several major sites, the declines were appreciably greater for cohort effects than for period ones. This reflects - besides the inherent characteristics of the model used - a major impact of tobacco smoking on total cancer mortality, particularly in men, as the role of tobacco in mortality of subsequent generations is largely - although not totally - a cohort effect. For neoplasms largely affected by improvements in management and therapy (e.g. testis, Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, but also breast and colorectal cancer), a favorable period effect is evident. However, there is also a cohort effect as the advancements have been generally greater in younger generations. For several cancer sites, there were considerable differences in cohort and period effects across Europe, and particularly high age-specific estimates were observed in eastern countries.","['Rosso, Tiziana', 'Malvezzi, Matteo', 'Bosetti, Cristina', 'Bertuccio, Paola', 'Negri, Eva', 'La Vecchia, Carlo']","['Rosso T', 'Malvezzi M', 'Bosetti C', 'Bertuccio P', 'Negri E', 'La Vecchia C']","['Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, Universita degli Studi di Milano.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, Universita degli Studi di Milano.', ""Department of Epidemiology, IRCCS, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche 'Mario Negri', Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, Universita degli Studi di Milano.', ""Department of Epidemiology, IRCCS, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche 'Mario Negri', Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, Universita degli Studi di Milano.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Cancer Prev,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),9300837,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Neoplasms/*mortality']",,,2016/07/30 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2016/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000282 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Prev. 2018 Jan;27(1):88-102. doi: 10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000282.,10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000282 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in vertebrate genes that mediate apoptosis only mildly perturb development, suggesting that other cell death modes likely have important roles. Linker cell-type death (LCD) is a morphologically conserved cell death form operating during the development of Caenorhabditis elegans and vertebrates. We recently described a molecular network governing LCD in C. elegans, delineating a key role for the transcription factor heat-shock factor 1 (HSF-1). Although HSF-1 functions to protect cells from stress in many settings by inducing expression of protein folding chaperones, it promotes LCD by inducing expression of the conserved E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme LET-70/UBE2D2, which is not induced by stress. Following whole-genome RNA interference and candidate gene screens, we identified and characterized four conserved regulators required for LCD. Here we show that two of these, NOB-1/Hox and EOR-1/PLZF, act upstream of HSF-1, in the context of Wnt signaling. A third protein, NHR-67/TLX/NR2E1, also functions upstream of HSF-1, and has a separate activity that prevents precocious expression of HSF-1 transcriptional targets. We demonstrate that the SET-16/mixed lineage leukemia 3/4 (MLL3/4) chromatin regulation complex functions at the same step or downstream of HSF-1 to control LET-70/UBE2D2 expression. Our results identify conserved proteins governing LCD, and demonstrate that transcriptional regulators influence this process at multiple levels.","['Malin, Jennifer A', 'Kinet, Maxime J', 'Abraham, Mary C', 'Blum, Elyse S', 'Shaham, Shai']","['Malin JA', 'Kinet MJ', 'Abraham MC', 'Blum ES', 'Shaham S']","['Laboratory of Developmental Genetics, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Laboratory of Developmental Genetics, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Laboratory of Developmental Genetics, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Laboratory of Developmental Genetics, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Laboratory of Developmental Genetics, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160729,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/*cytology/*genetics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics']",,,2016/07/30 06:00,2017/12/20 06:00,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2016/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['cdd201677 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2016.77 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2016 Dec;23(12):1985-1994. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2016.77.

To our knowledge, the effects of CLL plasma on cell culture have not been addressed. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CLL plasma on cell cycle regulation and von Willebrand factor (vWF) secretion, and expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures (HUVECs). Since nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) transcription factor has been a therapeutic target for treatment of cancer, we inhibited NF-kappaB using small interfering RNA to clarify if there is a role for this factor in probable effects. The cells were treated with the plasma of patients with CLL. Subsequently, cell cycle phase distribution, vWF secretion, expression, and storage were detected using ELISA, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical staining. In addition, NF-kappaB was inhibited using small interfering RNA. Plasma treatment promoted cell cycle progression by decreasing the cell number in G1 phase, while increasing the cell number in S phase and G2M phase. A significant increase of vWF expression, secretion, and storage was found, associated with the vWF levels of patients' plasma. We found that induction of cell cycle promotion, but not vWF expression and secretion, was partially suppressed by this inhibition. We found that endothelial cell cycle and vWF expression and secretion affected by CLL plasma and NF-kappaB play a role in the former. These findings would be useful for understanding the prognostic importance of plasma angiogenic factor levels in CLL.","['Shahidi, Minoo', 'Mohsen Razavi, Seyed', 'Hayat, Parisa']","['Shahidi M', 'Mohsen Razavi S', 'Hayat P']","['aCellular & Molecular Research Center (CMRC)bHematology Departments, School of Allied MedicinecFirozgar Hospital, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,9102551,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inducing Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inducing Agents/blood/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*blood/chemically induced/pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'von Willebrand Factor/*agonists/genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/07/30 06:00,2017/02/24 06:00,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MBC.0000000000000502 [doi]', '00001721-201609000-00016 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis. 2016 Sep;27(6):711-6. doi: 10.1097/MBC.0000000000000502.,10.1097/MBC.0000000000000502 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At present, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is curative, but limited by donor availability and associated mortality, making gene therapy an attractive alternative approach for HLH. We reported that perforin expression driven by cellular promoters in lentiviral (LV) vectors resulted in significant, albeit partial, correction of the inflammatory features in a murine model of HLH. We hypothesized that the level of perforin expression achieved per cell from ectopic moderate-strength cellular promoters (phosphoglycerate kinase gene/perforin-1 gene) is inadequate and thus engineered an LV vector using a viral promoter (MND; a modified Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat with myeloproliferative sarcoma virus enhancer) containing microRNA126 target sequences to restrict perforin expression in HSCs. We show here that the MND-LV vector restored perforin expression to normal levels in a perforin-deficient human natural killer cell line and perforin gene-corrected Perforin1(-/-) transplant recipients, whereas cellular promoters drove only partial correction. On lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus challenge, the clinical scores and survival improved only with the MND-LV vector, but inflammatory markers and cytotoxicity were improved with all LV vectors. Our studies suggest that although moderate levels of expression can result in partial amelioration of the HLH phenotype, high levels of perforin expression per cell are required for complete correction of HLH.","['Tiwari, Swati', 'Hontz, Adrianne', 'Terrell, Catherine E', 'Arumugam, Paritha', 'Carmo, Marlene', 'Risma, Kimberly', 'Jordan, Michael', 'Malik, Punam']","['Tiwari S', 'Hontz A', 'Terrell CE', 'Arumugam P', 'Carmo M', 'Risma K', 'Jordan M', 'Malik P']","['1 Department of Molecular Genetics, Biochemistry, and Microbiology, University of Cincinnati , Cincinnati, Ohio.', ""2 Division of Experimental Hematology and Oncology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Cincinnati, Ohio."", '3 Division of Allergy/Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, CCHMC , Cincinnati, Ohio.', ""2 Division of Experimental Hematology and Oncology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Cincinnati, Ohio."", ""2 Division of Experimental Hematology and Oncology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Cincinnati, Ohio."", '4 Infection, Immunity, Inflammation, and Physiological Medicine Programme, Molecular and Cellular Immunology Section, UCL Institute of Child Health , London, United Kingdom.', '3 Division of Allergy/Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, CCHMC , Cincinnati, Ohio.', '5 Division of Immunobiology, CCHMC , Cincinnati, Ohio.', '6 Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency, CCHMC , Cincinnati, Ohio.', ""2 Division of Experimental Hematology and Oncology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Cincinnati, Ohio.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160729,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism/pathology', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/therapeutic use', 'Mutation', 'Perforin/*genetics/therapeutic use']",,,2016/07/30 06:00,2018/01/19 06:00,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2016/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2016.065 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2016 Oct;27(10):847-859. doi: 10.1089/hum.2016.065.

Their toxic/antitoxic, genotoxic/antigenotoxic, and chronic toxicity (lifespan assay) effects were determined in vivo using the Drosophila model. Their cytotoxic activities were determined using the HL-60 in vitro cancer model. In addition, clastogenic DNA toxicity was measured using internucleosomal fragmentation and SCGE assays. Their epigenetic effects were assessed on the HL-60 methylation status using some repetitive elements.

This, coupled with the concerning side effects of repeated purine analog exposure, has prompted the search for alternative targets and therapies that may provide deeper remissions. Novel strategies employing immune-mediated targeting via monoclonal antibody therapies and recombinant immunotoxins appear promising in HCL and are currently under investigation. More recently, the concept of targeted kinase inhibition using small-molecule inhibitors in HCL has emerged as another potentially viable option. As a deeper understanding of the aberrant molecular pathways contributing to the pathogenesis of HCL develops, the landscape of management for HCL, particularly in the relapse setting, may change significantly in the future as a result of these promising immunotargets and therapies.","['Basheer, Faisal', 'Bloxham, David M', 'Scott, Mike A', 'Follows, George A']","['Basheer F', 'Bloxham DM', 'Scott MA', 'Follows GA']","['Department of Haematology, Addenbrookes Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Addenbrookes Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Addenbrookes Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Addenbrookes Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140624,New Zealand,Immunotargets Ther,ImmunoTargets and therapy,101606565,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['hairy cell leukemia', 'immunotargets', 'therapies']",2014/01/01 00:00,2014/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/ITT.S31425 [doi]', 'itt-3-107 [pii]']",epublish,Immunotargets Ther. 2014 Jun 24;3:107-20. doi: 10.2147/ITT.S31425. eCollection 2014.,10.2147/ITT.S31425 [doi],,,,,PMC4918239,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In adults, these success rates have not been duplicated. However, the use of pediatric-intensive regimens in young adults has shown increasing success. The use of monoclonal antibodies conjugated to drugs, immunotoxins, and cells also has shown early success and promises to enhance the outcome of newly diagnosed patients. Blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engager antibody, brings a malignant B cell in proximity to a T cell with redirected lysis. This antibody construct has shown promising results in patients with relapsed and refractory disease and is entering randomized clinical trials in newly diagnosed patients. The addition of monoclonal antibody therapy to chemotherapy in adults promises to enhance outcomes while hopefully not increasing toxicity.

The current treatment paradigm involves the use of chemoimmunotherapy, when patients develop an indication for therapy. With this strategy, a majority of patients will obtain a remission, though cure remains elusive. While treatable, the majority of CLL patients will die of complications of their disease. Recent advances in the understanding of the importance of the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway in CLL have led to the development of a number of agents targeting this pathway. In this review, we discuss recent developments in the targeting of the BCR pathway, with a focus on CC-292. CC-292 covalently binds to Bruton's tyrosine kinase, a key mediator of BCR signaling, and has demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity in CLL, with acceptable tolerability. Based on the success of CC-292 and other inhibitors of the BCR pathway, these agents are being investigated in combination with standard therapy, with the hope that they will increase the depth and length of response, without significant toxicity.","['Arnason, Jon E', 'Brown, Jennifer R']","['Arnason JE', 'Brown JR']","['Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'CLL Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140124,New Zealand,Immunotargets Ther,ImmunoTargets and therapy,101606565,,,,['NOTNLM'],"[""Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor"", 'ibrutinib']",2014/01/01 00:00,2014/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/ITT.S37419 [doi]', 'itt-3-029 [pii]']",epublish,Immunotargets Ther. 2014 Jan 24;3:29-38. doi: 10.2147/ITT.S37419. eCollection 2014.,10.2147/ITT.S37419 [doi],,,,,PMC4918232,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These effects were related to translocation of Gram-positive bacteria during mucositis with subsequent induction of cytotoxic oxygen reactive species and tumor invasion by pathogenic Th17 cells. To assess these hypotheses in a clinical setting, we identified patients receiving cyclophosphamide for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and cisplatin for relapsed lymphoma. Data originated from the CLL8 trial (NCT00281918) and the Cologne Cohort of Neutropenic Patients (NCT01821456). Relevant antibiotics were defined as compounds with primary activity against Gram-positive bacteria. We evaluated their impact on response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) by Kaplan-Meier methodology and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Among 800 available CLL patients, those receiving anti-Gram-positive antibiotics (n = 45/800) achieved a significantly lower overall response rate (OR 74.3% vs. 90.2%, p = 0.007). Patients with anti-Gram-positive antibiotics progressed significantly earlier, had a reduced OS (median PFS 14.1 vs. 44.1 mo, p < 0.001; median OS 56.1 vs. 91.7 mo, p < 0.001) and multivariate analysis showed that administration of anti-Gram-positive antibiotic treatment was independently associated with reduced PFS (Hazard ratio (HR) 2.090, p = 0.001) and OS (HR 2.966, p < 0.001).

However, fear of broad immune suppression and subsequent dampening of beneficial graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) responses remains a challenge. To address this concern, we generated alloreactive induced Tregs (iTregs) from resting CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells and tested their ability to suppress GVH and maintain GVL responses. We utilized major mismatched and haploidentical murine models of HCT with host-derived lymphoma or leukemia cell lines to evaluate GVH and GVL responses simultaneously. Alloreactive CD4(+) iTregs were effective in preventing GVHD, but abrogated the GVL effect against aggressive leukemia. Alloreactive CD8(+) iTregs moderately attenuated GVHD while sparing the GVL effect. Hence, we reasoned that using a combination of CD4(+) and CD8(+) iTregs could achieve the optimal goal of Allo-HCT. Indeed, the combinational therapy was superior to CD4(+) or CD8(+) iTreg singular therapy in GVHD control; importantly, the combinational therapy maintained GVL responses. Cellular analysis uncovered potent suppression of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) effector T cells by the combinational therapy that resulted in effective prevention of GVHD, which could not be achieved by either singular therapy. Gene expression profiles revealed alloreactive CD8(+) iTregs possess elevated expression of multiple cytolytic molecules compared to CD4(+) iTregs, which likely contributes to GVL preservation. Our study uncovers unique differences between alloreactive CD4(+) and CD8(+) iTregs that can be harnessed to create an optimal iTreg therapy for GVHD prevention with maintained GVL responses.","['Heinrichs, Jessica', 'Li, Jun', 'Nguyen, Hung', 'Wu, Yongxia', 'Bastian, David', 'Daethanasanmak, Anusara', 'Sofi, M-Hanief', 'Schutt, Steven', 'Liu, Chen', 'Jin, Junfei', 'Betts, Brian', 'Anasetti, Claudio', 'Yu, Xue-Zhong']","['Heinrichs J', 'Li J', 'Nguyen H', 'Wu Y', 'Bastian D', 'Daethanasanmak A', 'Sofi MH', 'Schutt S', 'Liu C', 'Jin J', 'Betts B', 'Anasetti C', 'Yu XZ']","['Department of Pathology and Cell biology, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University , Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina , Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina , Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina , Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina , Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina , Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina , Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida , Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA; Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell biology, University of South Florida , Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Moffitt Cancer Center , Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA; Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160328,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cytolytic function', '*Foxp3', '*Treg therapy', '*graft-versus-host disease', '*graft-versus-leukemia', '*regulatory T cells']",2016/07/30 06:00,2016/07/30 06:01,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2015/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2016.1146842 [doi]', '1146842 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2016 Mar 28;5(6):e1146842. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2016.1146842. eCollection 2016 Jun.,10.1080/2162402X.2016.1146842 [doi],,,,,PMC4938369,,"['TL1 TR001451/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001450/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 GM103342/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103499/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An important source of morbidity and mortality in ALL are viral infections. Even though allogeneic transplantations, which are often applied also in ALL, carry a recognized risk for viral infections, there are multiple factors that make ALL patients susceptible to viral infections. The presence of those factors has an influence in the type and severity of infections. Currently available treatment options do not guarantee a positive outcome for every case of viral infection in ALL, without significant side effects. Side effects can have very serious consequences for the ALL patients, which include nephrotoxicity. For this reason a number of strategies for personalized intervention have been already clinically tested, and experimental approaches are being developed. Adoptive immunotherapy, which entails administration of ex vivo grown immune cells to a patient, is a promising approach in general, and for transplant recipients in particular. The ex vivo grown cells are aimed to strengthen the immune response to the virus that has been identified in the patients' blood and tissue samples. Even though many patients with weakened immune system can benefit from progress in novel approaches, a viral infection still poses a very significant risk for many patients. Therefore, preventive measures and supportive care are very important for ALL patients.","['Moschovi, Maria', 'Adamaki, Maria', 'Vlahopoulos, Spiros A']","['Moschovi M', 'Adamaki M', 'Vlahopoulos SA']","[""Hematology-Oncology Unit, First Department of Pediatrics, University of Athens, Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital , Athens, Greece."", ""Hematology-Oncology Unit, First Department of Pediatrics, University of Athens, Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital , Athens, Greece."", ""Hematology-Oncology Unit, First Department of Pediatrics, University of Athens, Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital , Athens, Greece.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160630,Italy,Oncol Rev,Oncology reviews,101519906,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Precursor cell', 'adoptive immunotherapy', 'antiviral agents', 'lymphoblastic leukemia-lymphoma', 'transplantation', 'viruses']",2016/07/30 06:00,2016/07/30 06:01,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2016/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4081/oncol.2016.300 [doi]'],epublish,Oncol Rev. 2016 Jun 30;10(1):300. doi: 10.4081/oncol.2016.300. eCollection 2016 Apr 15.,10.4081/oncol.2016.300 [doi],,,,,PMC4943096,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeted sequencing efforts have identified several mutations with diagnostic and prognostic values in KIT, NPM1, CEBPA and FLT3 in both adult and paediatric AML. In addition, massively parallel sequencing enabled the discovery of recurrent mutations (i.e. IDH1/2 and DNMT3A) in adult AML. In this study, whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 22 paediatric AML patients revealed mutations in components of the cohesin complex (RAD21 and SMC3), BCORL1 and ASXL2 in addition to previously known gene mutations. We also revealed intratumoural heterogeneities in many patients, implicating multiple clonal evolution events in the development of AML. Furthermore, targeted deep sequencing in 182 paediatric AML patients identified three major categories of recurrently mutated genes: cohesion complex genes [STAG2, RAD21 and SMC3 in 17 patients (8.3%)], epigenetic regulators [ASXL1/ASXL2 in 17 patients (8.3%), BCOR/BCORL1 in 7 patients (3.4%)] and signalling molecules. We also performed WES in four patients with relapsed AML. Relapsed AML evolved from one of the subclones at the initial phase and was accompanied by many additional mutations, including common driver mutations that were absent or existed only with lower allele frequency in the diagnostic samples, indicating a multistep process causing leukaemia recurrence.","['Shiba, Norio', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Shiraishi, Yuichi', 'Okuno, Yusuke', 'Yamato, Genki',

The management of hyperleukocytosis, when symptoms of leukostasis occur, includes intensive supportive care and interventions for rapid cytoreduction. Leukapheresis is a rapid and effective means of cytoreduction and has been used in AML patients. In the current study, we evaluated the outcomes of 68 newly diagnosed AML patients that underwent leukapheresis and the effects of leukapheresis on various laboratory parameters. A total of 127 leukapheresis cycles were performed. The median number of leukapheresis cycles was 2 (range, 1-8). The overall survival for all patients was 4.2 months (95% CI 1.2-9.7 months). The median overall survival for patients who achieved complete remission after induction chemotherapy was significantly higher (19.1 months [95% CI 12.1-41.8 months]) than patients that did not achieve complete remission (0.46 months [95% CI 0.33-0.99 months]). Stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that elevated number of peripheral blasts, low platelet count and elevated bilirubin at AML diagnosis were predictive of death within a week. Leukapheresis was effective in reducing the peripheral blood leukocytes and leukemia blasts and was a safe procedure with regard to organ function, coagulation parameters, red blood cells and platelet count. The high initial response rates in newly diagnosed AML patients fit to receive intensive chemotherapy suggest that leukapheresis could be beneficial in reducing the complications associated with hyperleukocytosis until systemic intensive chemotherapy commences.","['Villgran, Vipin', 'Agha, Mounzer', 'Raptis, Anastasios', 'Hou, Jing-Zhou', 'Farah, Rafic', 'Lim, Seah H', 'Redner, Robert L', 'Im, Annie', 'Sehgal, Alison', 'Dorritie, Kathleen A', 'Kiss, Joseph E', 'Normolle, Daniel', 'Boyiadzis, Michael']","['Villgran V', 'Agha M', 'Raptis A', 'Hou JZ', 'Farah R', 'Lim SH', 'Redner RL', 'Im A', 'Sehgal A', 'Dorritie KA', 'Kiss JE', 'Normolle D', 'Boyiadzis M']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, USA.

We investigated effect of age and Body Mass Index on toxicity and survival in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia. We studied all patients who completed first induction course of NOPHO-AML 2004 (n=318). Toxicity following induction and consolidation courses (n=6) was analyzed. The probabilities of toxicity and death were determined using time-to-event analyses with Cox multivariate proportional hazard regression for comparative analyses. Age 10-17 years was associated with sepsis with hypotension [hazard ratio 2.3 (95% confidence interval 1.1-4.6)]. Being overweight (>1 standard deviation) was associated with requiring supplemental oxygen [1.9 (1.0-3.5)]. The 5-year event-free and overall survival were 47% and 71%. Children aged 10-17 years showed a trend for inferior 5-year overall survival compared to children aged 2-9 (64% vs. 76%; P=0.07). Infants showed a trend for superior 5-year event-free survival (66% vs. 43%; P=0.06). Overweight children aged 10-17 years showed a trend for superior survival [5-year event-free survival 59% vs. 40% (P=0.09) and 5-year overall survival 78% vs. 56% (P=0.06)] compared to healthy weight children aged 10-17 years. In conclusion, children aged 10-17 years and overweight children had a higher risk of grade 3-4 toxicity. Children aged 10-17 years showed inferior survival, but, unexpectedly, in this age group overweight children tended to have increased survival. This suggests different pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutic drugs in adolescents and warrants further studies.","['Lohmann, Ditte J A', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Ha, Shau-Yin', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Koskenvuo, Minna', 'Lausen, Birgitte', 'Palle, Josefine', 'Zeller, Bernward', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Lohmann DJ', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Ha SY', 'Jonsson OG', 'Koskenvuo M', 'Lausen B', 'Palle J', 'Zeller B', 'Hasle H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Denmark dadolfsen@gmail.com.', ""Institution for Clinical Sciences, Department of Pediatrics, Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Queen Mary Hospital and Hong Kong Pediatric Hematology & Oncology Study Group (HKPHOSG), Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Landspitalinn, Reykjavik, Iceland.', ""Division of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Children's Hospital and Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Department of Woman's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Sweden."", 'Department of Pediatric Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Norway.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160728,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/11/02 06:00,2017/06/18 06:00,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2016/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.146175 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.146175 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Nov;101(11):1359-1367. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.146175.

We evaluated the prognostic significance of cytogenetics at complete remission in 258 adults with de novo acute myeloid leukemia and abnormal pre-treatment karyotypes, treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B front-line studies, with cytogenetic data at onset of morphological complete remission. Thirty-two patients had abnormal karyotypes at time of initial complete remission. Of these, 28 had at least 1 abnormality identified pre-treatment, and 4 acute myeloid leukemia-related abnormalities not detected pre-treatment. Two hundred and twenty-six patients had normal remission karyotypes. Patients with abnormal remission karyotypes were older (P<0.001), had lower pre-treatment white blood counts (P=0.002) and blood blast percentages (P=0.004), were less often classified as Favorable and more often as Adverse among European LeukemiaNet Genetic Groups (P<0.001), and had shorter disease-free survival (median 0.6 vs. 0.9 years; P<0.001) and overall survival (median 1.2 vs. 2.2 years; P<0.001) than patients with normal remission karyotypes. Sixteen patients with normal remission karyotypes also harbored non-clonal abnormalities unrelated to pre-treatment karyotypes. They had shorter overall survival than 210 patients with only normal metaphases (P=0.04). Forty-eight patients with any clonal or non-clonal chromosome abnormality at complete remission had worse disease-free survival (median 0.6 vs. 1.0 years; P<0.001) and overall survival (median 1.2 vs. 2.5 years; P<0.001) than 210 patients with exclusively normal metaphases. In multivariable analyses, after adjustment for age, the presence of any remission abnormality was associated with shorter disease-free survival (P=0.03) and overall survival (P=0.01).

This result was confirmed through multivariate analysis (OR: 0.475, 95%CI: 0.236-0.958; P=0.041). The prophylactic agents did not differ with regard to the microbiological findings (P=0.6, not significant). Of note, the use of ciprofloxacin was significantly associated with an increased rate of infections with pathogens that are resistant to the antibiotic used for prophylaxis (79.5% vs 9.5% in the colistin group; P<0.0001). The risk factors for higher infection rates were the presence of a central venous catheter (P<0.0001), mucositis grade III/IV (P=0.0039), and induction/relapse courses (vs consolidation; P<0.0001). In conclusion, ciprofloxacin prophylaxis appears to be of particular benefit during induction and relapse chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. To prevent and control drug resistance, it may be safely replaced by colistin during consolidation cycles of acute myeloid leukemia therapy.","['Pohlen, Michele', 'Marx, Julia', 'Mellmann, Alexander', 'Becker, Karsten', 'Mesters, Rolf M', 'Mikesch, Jan-Henrik', 'Schliemann, Christoph', 'Lenz, Georg', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Krug, Utz', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Karch, Helge', 'Peters, Georg', 'Gerth, Hans U', 'Gorlich, Dennis', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E']","['Pohlen M', 'Marx J', 'Mellmann A', 'Becker K', 'Mesters RM', 'Mikesch JH', 'Schliemann C', 'Lenz G', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Buchner T', 'Krug U', 'Stelljes M', 'Karch H', 'Peters G', 'Gerth HU', 'Gorlich D', 'Berdel WE']","['Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Germany michele.pohlen@ukmuenster.de.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Germany.', 'Institute of Hygiene, University Hospital Muenster, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Germany Translational Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Germany Cluster of Excellence EXC 1003, Cells in Motion, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Germany Department of Medicine IV, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Germany Department of Medicine 3, Klinikum Leverkusen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Germany.', 'Institute of Hygiene, University Hospital Muenster, Germany Cluster of Excellence EXC 1003, Cells in Motion, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Muenster, Germany Cluster of Excellence EXC 1003, Cells in Motion, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine D, Nephrology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Muenster, Germany.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, University Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Germany Cluster of Excellence EXC 1003, Cells in Motion, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20160728,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)', 'Z67X93HJG1 (Colistin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/*methods', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Central Venous Catheters/adverse effects', 'Ciprofloxacin/*administration & dosage', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colistin/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucositis/complications', 'Neutropenia/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/07/30 06:00,2017/06/18 06:00,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2016/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.147934 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.147934 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Oct;101(10):1208-1215. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.147934.

Independent confirmations are extremely important. We report an investigator-sponsored study of nilotinib 300 mg twice daily in 130 chronic myeloid leukemia patients in early chronic phase. A deep molecular response was achieved in 46% (MR(4.0)) and 17% (MR(4.5)) of patients at 2 years; 58% of the enrolled patients achieved a MR(4.0) at least once, with a sustained MR(4.0) in 52% of them. With a median observation of 29 months (range 24-37 months), 77% of patients were still on treatment with nilotinib. The reasons for permanent discontinuation were: 3% progression, 5% failure or suboptimal response, 8% adverse events, 1% treatment-free remission, and 5% other reasons. Thirteen thrombotic arterial events were reported in 12 patients. A prospective evaluation of metabolic effects showed an increase of fasting glucose without significant variations of glycated hemoglobin, an increase of total cholesterol (both low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein fractions) and a decrease of triglycerides. This study confirms a high and rapid efficacy of nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and provides detailed information on the type and incidence of non-hematologic and metabolic adverse events (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: 01535391).","['Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Martino, Bruno', ""D'Adda, Mariella"", 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Carella, Angelo Michele', 'Avanzini, Paolo', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Trabacchi, Elena', 'Visani, Giuseppe', 'Gobbi, Marco', 'Salvucci, Marzia', 'Levato, Luciano', 'Binotto, Gianni', 'Capalbo, Silvana Franca', 'Bochicchio, Maria Teresa', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Alimena, Giuliana', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Baccarani, Michele']","['Castagnetti F', 'Breccia M', 'Gugliotta G', 'Martino B', ""D'Adda M"", 'Stagno F', 'Carella AM', 'Avanzini P', 'Tiribelli M', 'Trabacchi E', 'Visani G', 'Gobbi M', 'Salvucci M', 'Levato L', 'Binotto G', 'Capalbo SF', 'Bochicchio MT', 'Soverini S', 'Cavo M', 'Martinelli G', 'Alimena G', 'Pane F', 'Saglio G', 'Rosti G', 'Baccarani M']","['Institute of Hematology ""L. and A.

The protein kinase, casein kinase 2, is overexpressed and hyperactivated in cancer, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Herein, we show that while interleukin-7 had a minor but significant positive effect on casein kinase 2 activity in leukemia T-cells, casein kinase 2 activity was mandatory for optimal interleukin-7/interleukin-7 receptor-mediated signaling. Casein kinase 2 pharmacological inhibition impaired signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/v-Akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 pathway activation triggered by interleukin-7 or by mutational activation of interleukin-7 receptor. By contrast, forced expression of casein kinase 2 augmented interleukin-7 signaling in human embryonic kidney 293T cells reconstituted with the interleukin-7 receptor machinery. Casein kinase 2 inactivation prevented interleukin-7-induced B-cell lymphoma 2 upregulation, maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis and viability of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia cells collected from patients at diagnosis. Casein kinase 2 inhibition further abrogated interleukin-7-mediated cell growth and upregulation of the transferrin receptor, and blocked cyclin A and E upregulation and cell cycle progression. Notably, casein kinase 2 was also required for the viability of mutant interleukin-7 receptor expressing leukemia T-cells. Overall, our study identifies casein kinase 2 as a major player in the effects of interleukin-7 and interleukin-7 receptor in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This further highlights the potential relevance of targeting casein kinase 2 in this malignancy.","['Melao, Alice', 'Spit, Maureen', 'Cardoso, Bruno A', 'Barata, Joao T']","['Melao A', 'Spit M', 'Cardoso BA', 'Barata JT']","['Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal joao_barata@medicina.ulisboa.pt.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160728,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (IL7 protein, human)', '0 (IL7R protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)']",IM,"['Casein Kinase II/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/physiology', 'Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit/*physiology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', '*Signal Transduction']",,,2016/11/02 06:00,2017/06/18 06:00,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2015/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2015.141143 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2015.141143 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Nov;101(11):1368-1379. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2015.141143.

To effectively treat AML, new molecular targets and therapeutic approaches must be identified. In silico analysis of several databases of AML patients demonstrated that the expression of alkaline ceramidase 3 (ACER3) significantly inversely correlates with the overall survival of AML patients. To determine whether ACER3 supports AML development, we employed an shRNA-encoding lentivirus system to inhibit acer3 expression in human AML cells including NB4, U937, and THP-1 cells. The ACER3 deficiency resulted in decreased cell growth and colony formation, elevated apoptosis, and lower AKT signaling of leukemia cells. Our study indicates that ACER3 contributes to AML pathogenesis, and suggests that alkaline ceramidase inhibition is an option to treat AML.","['Chen, Chen', 'Yin, Yancun', 'Li, Chunling', 'Chen, Jinliang', 'Xie, Jingjing', 'Lu, Zhigang', 'Li, Minjing', 'Wang, Yuesi', 'Zhang, Cheng Cheng']","['Chen C', 'Yin Y', 'Li C', 'Chen J', 'Xie J', 'Lu Z', 'Li M', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang CC']","['Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, Basic Science Institute, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, Shandong 264003, China.', 'Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, Basic Science Institute, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, Shandong 264003, China.', 'Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, Basic Science Institute, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, Shandong 264003, China.', 'Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, Basic Science Institute, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, Shandong 264003, China.', 'Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, Basic Science Institute, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, Shandong 264003, China; Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, Basic Science Institute, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, Shandong 264003, China.', 'Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, Basic Science Institute, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, Shandong 264003, China.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.

Immunoblot analysis clearly revealed the potential of EDS-TM in inducing apoptosis of cancer cells which could improve the anticancer efficacy in leukemia. Importantly, EDS-M and EDS-TM significantly prolonged the circulation profile of EDS throughout until 24h, indicating the potential of targeted nanoparticulate delivery system.

Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) berries, dog rose (Rosa canina) rosehips, and garden sage (Salvia officinalis) and oregano (Origanum vulgare) aerial parts are widely used in traditional medicine and exhibit antitumor effects in preclinical models. However, these plants remain scarcely tested for antileukemic activity. Here, we show that their water-ethanol leaf extracts reduced the growth and viability of AML cells and, at non-cytotoxic doses, potentiated cell differentiation induced by a low concentration of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the hormonal form of vitamin D, in a cell type-dependent manner. The latter effect was accompanied by upregulation of the vitamin D receptor protein components and its transcriptional activity. Furthermore, at minimally effective doses the extracts cooperated with one another to produce marked cytostatic effects associated with a partial S-phase arrest and a modest induction of apoptosis. In contrast, these combinations only slightly affected the growth and viability of proliferating normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, the extracts strongly inhibited microsomal lipid peroxidation and protected normal erythrocytes against hypoosmotic shock. Our results suggest that further exploration of the enhanced antileukemic effects of the combinations tested here may lead to the development of alternative therapeutic and preventive approaches against AML.","['Zhamanbayeva, Gulzhan T', 'Aralbayeva, Araylim N', 'Murzakhmetova, Maira K', 'Tuleukhanov, Sultan T', 'Danilenko, Michael']","['Zhamanbayeva GT', 'Aralbayeva AN', 'Murzakhmetova MK', 'Tuleukhanov ST', 'Danilenko M']","['Department of Biophysics and Biomedicine, Al-Farabi Kazakh National University, Almaty 480078, Kazakhstan.', 'Laboratory of Membrane Physiology, Institute of Human and Animal Physiology, Almaty 050060, Kazakhstan.', 'Laboratory of Membrane Physiology, Institute of Human and Animal Physiology, Almaty 050060, Kazakhstan.', 'Department of Biophysics and Biomedicine, Al-Farabi Kazakh National University, Almaty 480078, Kazakhstan.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel.

In this study, we compared the outcomes of patients undergoing RIC SCT who received fludarabine and melphalan (FluMel), the standard RIC regimen used by the Spanish Group of Transplantation, and fludarabine and busulfan (FluBu), the standard RIC regimen used by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women's Hospital. We analyzed 136 patients undergoing RIC SCT for lymphoma with either FluBu (n = 61) or FluMel (n = 75) conditioning between 2007 and 2014. Median follow-up was 36 months. The cumulative incidence of grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 13% with FluBu and 36% with FluMel (P = .002). The cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 1 year was 3.3% with FluBu and 31% with FluMel (P < .0001). The cumulative incidence of relapse at 1 year was 29% with FluBu and 10% with FluMel (P = .08). The 3-year disease-free survival rate was 47% with FluBu and 36% with FluMel (P = .24), and the 3-year overall survival rate was 62% with FluBu and 48% with FluMel (P = .01). In multivariable analysis, FluMel was associated with a higher risk of acute grades II to IV GVHD (HR, 7.45; 95% CI, 2.30 to 24.17; P = .001) and higher risk of NRM (HR, 4.87; 95% CI, 1.36 to 17.44; P = .015). The type of conditioning was not significantly associated with relapse or disease-free survival in multivariable models. However, conditioning regimen was the only factor significantly associated with overall survival: FluMel conditioning was associated with a hazard ratio for death of 2.78 (95% CI, 1.23 to 6.27; P = .014) compared with FluBu. In conclusion, the use of FluBu as conditioning for patients undergoing SCT for lymphoma was associated with a lower risk of acute GVHD and NRM and improved overall survival when compared with FluMel in our retrospective study. These results confirm the differences between these RIC regimens in terms of toxicity and efficacy and support the need for comparative prospective studies.","['Kekre, Natasha', 'Marquez-Malaver, Francisco J', 'Cabrero, Monica', 'Pinana, Jl', 'Esquirol, Albert', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Caballero, Dolores', 'Terol, M J', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Lopez-Corral, L', 'Solano, Carlos', 'Armand, Philippe', 'Perez-Simon, Jose A']","['Kekre N', 'Marquez-Malaver FJ', 'Cabrero M', 'Pinana J', 'Esquirol A', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Caballero D', 'Terol MJ', 'Martino R', 'Antin JH', 'Lopez-Corral L', 'Solano C', 'Armand P', 'Perez-Simon JA']","['Division of Hematology, The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBIS)/Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio/CSIC/Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital, Instituto Biosanitario de Salamanca (IBSAL), University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Valencia, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Jose Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital, Instituto Biosanitario de Salamanca (IBSAL), University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Valencia, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Jose Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital, Instituto Biosanitario de Salamanca (IBSAL), University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Valencia, Valencia, Spain.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Hematology, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBIS)/Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio/CSIC/Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain.

The first 10 patients received nonmyeloablative conditioning followed by planned granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) on days 35, 60, and 90. No patient developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but 90% had disease progression between 3 and 6 months. A subsequent 41 patients received myeloablative conditioning (MAC); the first 20 patients did not receive DLIs (MAC group) and the next 21 patients received G-CSF-mobilized DLIs (G-DLI) on days 21, 35, and 60 (MAC-DLI group). The incidence of disease progression and progression-free survival at 18 months were 66% and 25% in the MAC group compared with 21.4% and 61.9% in the MAC-DLI group (P = .01). Chronic GVHD but not acute GVHD was increased in the MAC-DLI group (41.2% versus 11%, P = .05). Natural killer cell alloreactive donor was associated with lower incidence of disease progression in the MAC but not in MAC-DLI group. The only factor favorably influencing disease progression and progression-free survival was administration of G-DLI after myeloablative conditioning. Our study shows that early administration of G-DLI is feasible after PTCy-based haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia and might be associated with improved survival after MAC.","['Jaiswal, Sarita Rani', 'Zaman, Shamsuz', 'Chakrabarti, Aditi', 'Sen, Subrata', 'Mukherjee, Shashwata', 'Bhargava, Sneh', 'Ray, Kunal', ""O'Donnell, Paul V"", 'Chakrabarti, Suparno']","['Jaiswal SR', 'Zaman S', 'Chakrabarti A', 'Sen S', 'Mukherjee S', 'Bhargava S', 'Ray K', ""O'Donnell PV"", 'Chakrabarti S']","['Manashi Chakrabarti Foundation, Kolkata, India; Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Dharamshila Hospital and Research Centre, New Delhi, India.

Therefore, we retrospectively studied the impact of latent or active CMV infections on the outcome and occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in 294 patients during the period from 2004 to 2010. CMV viral load was routinely monitored in plasma using a quantitative PCR. Preemptive antiviral therapy was initiated when the viral load in plasma exceeded a predefined threshold. In a proportional hazards model, a seropositive recipient was significantly associated with increased occurrence of acute GVHD. However the CMV serostatus of both recipient and donor and the presence of active CMV infection was not associated with the occurrence of relapses, chronic GVHD, or OS. We conclude that in the presence of viral load monitoring and preemptive treatment, latent or active CMV infection does not substantially affect the OS after T cell-replete RIC allogeneic SCT.","['Verduyn Lunel, Frans M', 'Raymakers, Reinier', 'van Dijk, Anette', 'van der Wagen, Lotte', 'Minnema, Monique C', 'Kuball, Jurgen']","['Verduyn Lunel FM', 'Raymakers R', 'van Dijk A', 'van der Wagen L', 'Minnema MC', 'Kuball J']","['Department of Medical Microbiology, Eijkman Winkler Institute for Microbiology, Infectious Diseases and Inflammation, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

Sixty-eight Dutch FA patients have been transplanted since 1972. In total, 63 (93%) patients engrafted, 54 after first SCT and 9 after second SCT. Fludarabine (FLU)-based conditioning was associated with decreased graft failure (odds ratio 0.21, P = 0.01), decreased early mortality (hazard ratio 0.25, P = 0.01) and improved 5-year overall survival (FLU 87.8% [standard error (SE) 5.1%] versus non-FLU 59.3% [SE 9.5%], P = 0.01). Late mortality was mainly caused by squamous cell carcinoma. Twenty-two patients were treated with the current Dutch FA conditioning regimen (FLU 150 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 30 mg/kg +/- anti-thymocyte globulin - no irradiation). Stem cell donors were matched related (n = 8) or alternative donors (n = 14). Stable engraftment after first SCT was achieved in 19 (86%) patients. At a median follow-up of 3.9 years 20 (91%) patients are alive. Our study provides a unique overview of a nation-wide SCT cohort illustrating the major improvements in treatment regimen and patient outcome in recent years. It shows that a non-irradiation and busulfan-free conditioning regimen can be used successfully, also in alternative donor SCT. Furthermore, it underlines the importance of late cancer screening and comprehensive care for this complex disorder.","['Smetsers, Stephanie E', 'Smiers, Frans J', 'Bresters, Dorine', 'Sonnevelt, Martine C', 'Bierings, Marc B']","['Smetsers SE', 'Smiers FJ', 'Bresters D', 'Sonnevelt MC', 'Bierings MB']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, Fanconi Anaemia Guideline Chair, The Hague, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160729,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fanconi Anemia/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Mortality', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Fanconi anaemia', '*bone marrow failure', '*chemosensitivity', '*leukaemia', '*stem cell transplantation']",2016/07/30 06:00,2017/05/16 06:00,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2016/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.14165 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Sep;174(6):952-61. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14165.

In order to better understand its cytotoxic action, we characterized its effects on signalling pathways important for the survival of CLL cells. We found that dinaciclib induced apoptosis through the activation of caspases 8 and 9, which was independent of the presence of cytokines to mimic the environment of proliferation centres or IGVH mutation status. Moreover, treatment with dinaciclib led to the inhibition of oncogenic pathways normally activated in stimulated CLL cells, such as STAT3, NF-kappaB, p38, PI3K/AKT and RAF/MEK/ERK. Dinaciclib was also able to block the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins of the BCL2 family such as MCL1 and BCL-xL (also termed BCL2L1). Finally, we showed that low concentrations of dinaciclib enhanced cell sensitivity to ibrutinib and the BCL2 inhibitor ABT-199, two drugs with known effects on CLL. Taken together, our data show that dinaciclib targets multiple pro-survival signalling pathways in CLL, which provides a mechanistic explanation for its potent induction of apoptosis. They also support a therapeutic application of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in CLL in combination with other relevant targeted therapies.","['Chen, Yixiang', 'Germano, Sandra', 'Clements, Chris', 'Samuel, Jesvin', 'Shelmani, Ghalia', 'Jayne, Sandrine', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Macip, Salvador']","['Chen Y', 'Germano S', 'Clements C', 'Samuel J', 'Shelmani G', 'Jayne S', 'Dyer MJ', 'Macip S']","['Mechanisms of Cancer and Ageing Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Mechanisms of Cancer and Ageing Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Mechanisms of Cancer and Ageing Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Mechanisms of Cancer and Ageing Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Mechanisms of Cancer and Ageing Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Studies, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Studies, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Mechanisms of Cancer and Ageing Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160729,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (Indolizines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridinium Compounds)', '4V8ECV0NBQ (dinaciclib)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclic N-Oxides', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Indolizines', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridinium Compounds/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CDK inhibitors', '*apoptosis', '*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*combination therapy', '*dinaciclib']",2016/07/30 06:00,2017/05/16 06:00,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2016/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14285 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Nov;175(4):641-651. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14285.

We found somatic non-synonymous mutations in 25 MBLs (52%) at the initial time point analyzed, including 12 (25%) with >1 mutated gene. In cases that subsequently progressed to CLL, mutations were detected 41 months (median) prior to progression. Excepting NOTCH1, TP53 and XPO1, which showed a lower incidence in MBL, genes were mutated with a similar prevalence to CLL, indicating the early origin of most driver mutations in the MBL/CLL continuum. MBLs with mutations at the initial time point analyzed were associated with shorter time-to-treatment (TTT). Furthermore, MBLs showing subclonal expansion of driver mutations on sequential evaluation had shorter progression time to CLL and shorter TTT.

Besides many organ complications, allo-HSCT may significantly affect quality of life (QOL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2011 and December 2012, five hundred and ninety patients (pts) from 6 transplant centers in the Czech Republic filled in the questionnaire for the quantitative measurement of QOL using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) version 4. Study cohort characteristics were as follows: 325 males, 340 pts received myeloablative conditioning, 383 pts received PBPC, representation of diagnoses; acute leukemia (n=270), bone marrow failure (n=36), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=74), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndrom (n=110), lymphoproliferative disease (n=93). The median age at allo-HSCT was 43 years (range: 1.7 - 71.0), the median time from allo-HSCT to questionnaire completing was 3.8 years (range: - 0.2 - 21.6). The earliest allo-HSCT was performed in November 1989, the last in September 2012. In this retrospective study, we investigated the impact of various factors on the QOL after allo-HSCT: age, gender, diagnosis, type of conditioning, time from diagnosis to allo-HSCT, disease stage, graft type, donor type, time from allo-HSCT to questionnaire completing, GVHD, relapse. Only data from patients who were more than 3 months after allo-HSCT were used for the multivariate analysis. The overall results of the total FACT-G score (median=85.0; range: 29-108) as well as the results of each specific dimension - PWB (median=23.0; range: 5-28), SWB (median=24.0; range: 7-28), EWB (median= 19.0; range: 4-24), FWB (mean=21.0; range: 2-28) showed a value in the highest quartile of the possible evaluation. In multivariate analysis, an inferior QOL score was reported for patients with aGVHD (p=0.002), cGVHD (p<0.001), QOL decreased with increasing age (p=0.048) and increased with time elapsed since allo-HSCT (p<0.001).Allogeneic HSCT represents an important intervention into the overall integrity of the organism. In particular, the development of GVHD can cause very serious organ, but also mental problems which can significantly reduce the QOL. The QOL is steadily increasing with increasing interval from allo-HSCT but improvement and disappearance of these complications may take many years, and sometimes these effects may probably persist permanently.","['Valkova, V', 'Jircikova, J', 'Trnkova, M', 'Steinerova, K', 'Keslova, P', 'Lanska, M', 'Koristek, Z', 'Raida, L', 'Krejci, M', 'Kruntoradova, K', 'Dolezal, T', 'Benesova, K', 'Cetkovsky, P', 'Trneny, M']","['Valkova V', 'Jircikova J', 'Trnkova M', 'Steinerova K', 'Keslova P', 'Lanska M', 'Koristek Z', 'Raida L', 'Krejci M', 'Kruntoradova K', 'Dolezal T', 'Benesova K', 'Cetkovsky P', 'Trneny M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Czech Republic', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",['NOTNLM'],"['*FACT-G.', '*QOL', '*allogeneic', '*transplantation']",2016/07/30 06:00,2019/01/29 06:00,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2016_511 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2016;63(5):743-51. doi: 10.4149/neo_2016_511.,10.4149/neo_2016_511 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Childhood leukemia is often determined by the presence of specific chromosomal translocation that entails the generation of preleukemic fusion genes (PFG). In the last two decades, several studies have reported observations that PFG are present in healthy population and not necessarily result in leukemia. The first such study by Limpens and colleagues on t(14/18)/ BCL2-JH [1] and next in line [2, 3] led to many questions regarding the significance of these chromosomal translocations in leukemogenesis. However, the data on the incidence of PFG are contradictive. This review aims to highlight the molecular genetic approaches used by various studies with regard to differences in diagnostics and incidence of PFG in healthy subjects. The focus is on the incidence and prevalence of the most common PFG such as TEL-AML1, MLL-AF4, BCR-ABL (p190), AML1-ETO, PML-RARA, and CBFB-MYH11 detected in umbilical cord blood, in neonatal blood spots (Guthrie cards (GC)), bone marrow, peripheral blood and tissues of amortized fetuses. We conclude that the incidence of PFG is significantly higher than incidence of leukemia and more sophisticated analysis of PFG in leukemogenic cell populations is warranted to relate the occurrence of PFG with leukemia. The emerging notion is that only those PFG may contribute to development of leukemia which arise in stem cells at specific time windows during development. Thus, screening of PFG in subpopulations of stem cells may be a challenge for assessment of predisposition to leukemia and for validation of cell transplant to minimize donor cell-derived leukemia.","['Kosik, P', 'Skorvaga, M', 'Belyaev, I']","['Kosik P', 'Skorvaga M', 'Belyaev I']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PML-RARa bcr1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/blood/genetics', 'Fetal Blood', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Mass Screening/methods', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/blood/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*blood/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/blood/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood leukemia', '*preleukemic fusion genes', '*stem cells.']",2016/07/30 06:00,2019/01/29 06:00,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2016_502 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2016;63(5):659-72. doi: 10.4149/neo_2016_502.,10.4149/neo_2016_502 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most MBL populations have a chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like (CLL-like) immunophenotype, but those that are CD5-negative (non-CLL-like) are also recognized and may represent a distinct diagnostic entity. To date, MBL studies have taken place in relatively homogenous populations, although risk of CLL varies across racial groups and geographic regions. We report flow cytometry data from 597 ethnically diverse 64-94-year-old women from across the USA who are participants in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Long-Life Study (LLS). Overall, MBL was detected in 26 % of the participants and included 20.9 % with a CLL-like immunophenotype, 5 % with a non-CLL-like immunophenotype, and 1.3 % with both. White and Hispanic women were more than twice as likely to have a CLL-like MBL population detected than African American women, corrected for age (P = 0.003). By contrast, detection of non-CLL-like MBL did not vary significantly by race, but did increase markedly with advancing age, being present in 12.7 % of those aged 85 and older. We provide new evidence that rates of detection of CLL-like MBL are lower in African Americans, and further suggest that non-CLL-like clonal expansions should be regarded as distinct from CLL-like MBL.","['Edlefsen, Kerstin L', 'Cherian, Sindhu', 'De Roos, Anneclaire J', 'Getaneh, Asqual', 'Lessin, Lawrence', 'Li, Wenjun', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Reiner, Alexander P']","['Edlefsen KL', 'Cherian S', 'De Roos AJ', 'Getaneh A', 'Lessin L', 'Li W', 'Wood BL', 'Reiner AP']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA. edlefsen@u.washington.edu.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Drexel University School of Public Health, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'MedStar Health Research Institute, Hyattsville, MD, USA.', 'Washington Cancer Institute at Medstar Washington Hospital Center, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, UK.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160729,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)']",IM,"['African Americans/statistics & numerical data', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hispanic or Latino/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Middle Aged', 'Observational Studies as Topic', 'Paraproteinemias/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Postmenopause', 'Sampling Studies', 'Smoking/epidemiology', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'Elderly', 'Monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL)', 'Race', 'Women']",2016/07/30 06:00,2017/01/28 06:00,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2016/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2760-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2760-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Oct;95(10):1695-704. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2760-5.

Here, we investigated the association of eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the BAFF (TNFSF13B) and BAFF-R (TNFRSF13C) genes with risk of sporadic CLL in a group of 439 CLL patients and 477 controls. We also examined the correlation between selected SNPs and CLL clinical parameters as well as BAFF plasma levels and intracellular BAFF expression. Our results point to a possible association between the rs9514828 (CT vs. CC + TT; OR = 0.74; CI 95 % = 0.57; 0.97; p = 0.022) and rs1041569 (AT vs. AA + TT; OR = 0.72; CI 95 % = 0.54; 0.95; p = 0.021) of BAFF gene and rs61756766 (CC vs. CT; OR = 2.03; CI 95 % = 1.03; 3.99; p = 0.03) of BAFF-R gene and CLL risk. Additionally, we observed that homozygotes rs1041569 AA and TT had a slightly higher risk (HR = 1.12) for the need of treatment in comparison to AT heterozygotes. In conclusion, our results indicate that SNPs in BAFF and BAFF-R genes may be considered as potential CLL risk factors.","['Jasek, Monika', 'Bojarska-Junak, Agnieszka', 'Wagner, Marta', 'Sobczynski, Maciej', 'Wolowiec, Dariusz', 'Rolinski, Jacek', 'Karabon, Lidia', 'Kusnierczyk, Piotr']","['Jasek M', 'Bojarska-Junak A', 'Wagner M', 'Sobczynski M', 'Wolowiec D', 'Rolinski J', 'Karabon L', 'Kusnierczyk P']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics and Tissue Immunology, Department of Clinical Immunology, Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, ul.

The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene was originally identified on a breakpoint of chromosomal translocation t(15;17) associated with acute PML. We have studied the role of PML protein during acute and regenerative phases after hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in brains of neonatal mice. We found that PML prevents tissue loss and apoptotic cell death selectively in subcortical regions of the brain at early stages after damage. In accordance with this, we revealed that PML is important for microglia activation and production of key inflammatory cytokines such as IL1alpha, IL1beta, IL1RN, CXCL10, CCL12 and TNFalpha. During the regenerative phase, PML-depleted mice were found to have impaired transformation of transit-amplifying precursors into migratory progenitors. This was accompanied by increased ratios of symmetric versus asymmetric neural progenitor cell divisions during tissue repair and a specific defect in tissue restoration within the striatum 42 days after HI. The data demonstrate a dual role of PML in protection and recovery after brain injury.","['Palibrk, Vuk', 'Suganthan, Rajikala', 'Scheffler, Katja', 'Wang, Wei', 'Bjoras, Magnar', 'Boe, Stig Ove']","['Palibrk V', 'Suganthan R', 'Scheffler K', 'Wang W', 'Bjoras M', 'Boe SO']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, Oslo University Hospital and University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Microbiology, Oslo University Hospital, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Oslo University Hospital and University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Oslo University Hospital and University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Oslo University Hospital and University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Microbiology, Oslo University Hospital, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Oslo University Hospital and University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160728,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Brain/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Gene Ontology', 'Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain/*immunology/*pathology', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microglia/metabolism/pathology', 'Neural Stem Cells/metabolism', '*Neuroprotection', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Regeneration', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA']",,,2016/07/30 06:00,2017/09/30 06:00,['2016/07/30 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2016223 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2016.223 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2016 Jul 28;7(7):e2320. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2016.223.,10.1038/cddis.2016.223 [doi],,,,,PMC4973360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) treatment induces PML-RARalpha degradation, restores PML-NB functions, and causes terminal cell differentiation of APL blasts. However, the precise role of the APL-associated PML-RARalpha oncoprotein and PML-NB integrity in the DSB response in APL leukemogenesis and tumor suppression is still lacking. Primary leukemia blasts isolated from APL patients showed high phosphorylation levels of H2AX (gamma-H2AX), an initial DSBs sensor. By addressing the consequences of ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DSB response in primary APL blasts and RA-responsive and -resistant myeloid cell lines carrying endogenous or ectopically expressed PML-RARalpha, before and after treatment with RA, we found that the disruption of PML-NBs is associated with delayed DSB response, as revealed by the impaired kinetic of disappearance of gamma-H2AX and 53BP1 foci and activation of ATM and of its substrates H2AX, NBN, and CHK2. The disruption of PML-NB integrity by PML-RARalpha also affects the IR-induced DSB response in a preleukemic mouse model of APL in vivo.

METHODS: K562 cells were treated with different concentrations of insulin. The proliferation activity was tested by CCK-8 assay, cytometry, and trypan blue exclusion. The alterations in glucose concentration of the culture media were monitored while the apoptosis of K562 cells was detected by flow cytometry. The effects of high concentration insulin on the proliferation of K562 cells were inhibited by varying concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and Suramin. RESULTS: Under the range of concentration (0.1-1 mU/mL), insulin facilitated the proliferation of K562 cells. In contrast, insulin at high concentrations (1.6-100 mU/mL) had the opposite effect, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Different concentrations of glucose in the culture medium had no significant influence on the inhibitory effect of high concentration insulin on the proliferation of human leukemia cell strain K562. At low concentration insulin inhibited the apoptosis of K562 cells, in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, insulin at high concentration had the opposite effect, in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, IGF-1 reversed the inhibitory effect of high concentration insulin on the proliferation of K562 cell in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Suramin, which is an IGF-1 receptor non-specific blocker, had the opposite effect on K562 cells, also in a dose- and time-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: These results indicate insulin has a dual effect on K562 cells. The dual effect is probably mediated by the binding of insulin and IGF-1R. Inhibitory effect of high concentration insulin on the proliferation of K562 cells is unrelated with the glucose metabolism in the culture media.","['Zhuang, Wei-huang', 'Huang, Mao-juan', 'Pan, Jing-xin']","['Zhuang WH', 'Huang MJ', 'Pan JX']",,['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

The understanding of the genome has significantly advanced cancer therapy, as well as prevention and earlier detection. This research highlight discusses a potential new type of cancer-targeting molecule, Sweet-P, which is the first of its kind. Sweet-P specifically targets the microRNA-144 binding site in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the human glucocorticoid receptor beta (GRbeta), which has been demonstrated to increase expression. GRbeta has been shown to be highly expressed in cells from solid tumors of uroepithelial carcinomas, gliomas, osteosarcomas, and hepatocellular carcinomas, as well as in liquid tumor cells from leukemia patients. In non-cancerous diseases, GRbeta has been shown to be highly expressed in glucocorticoid-resistant asthma. These maladies brought the need for the development of the Sweet-P anti-GRbeta molecule. Sweet-P was shown to repress the migration of bladder cancer cells, and may serve as a new therapeutic for GRbeta-related diseases.","['Nwaneri, Assumpta C', 'McBeth, Lucien', 'Hinds, Terry D Jr']","['Nwaneri AC', 'McBeth L', 'Hinds TD Jr']","['Center for Hypertension and Personalized Medicine, Department of Physiology & Pharmacology, University of Toledo College of Medicine, Toledo OH 43614, USA.', 'Center for Hypertension and Personalized Medicine, Department of Physiology & Pharmacology, University of Toledo College of Medicine, Toledo OH 43614, USA.', 'Center for Hypertension and Personalized Medicine, Department of Physiology & Pharmacology, University of Toledo College of Medicine, Toledo OH 43614, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160705,United States,Cancer Cell Microenviron,Cancer cell & microenvironment,101647794,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['GR', 'GR alpha', 'GR beta', 'Glucocorticoid receptor', 'Sweet-P', 'asthma', 'bladder cancer', 'cancer', 'glucocorticoids', 'growth', 'miRNA', 'microRNA', 'migration']",2016/07/29 06:00,2016/07/29 06:01,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/29 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Cancer Cell Microenviron. 2016;3(3).

One explanation may be variable adherence to dose-intense chemotherapy. However, little is known about risk factors for delays in therapy and their impact on survival. We conducted an analysis of ECOG 2993/UKALLXII trial to study delays in postremission chemotherapy in adults with newly diagnosed ALL. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for a very long delay (VLD, >4 weeks) in start of intensification therapy. Cox regression was used to evaluate the impact of delays on overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). We evaluated 1076 Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) patients who completed induction chemotherapy, achieved complete remission, and started intensification. Factors independently associated with VLD included duration of hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2, P < 0.001) during Phase I; thrombocytopenia during Phase I (OR = 1.16, P = 0.004) or Phase II (OR 1.13, P = 0.001); chemotherapy dose reductions during Induction Phase I (OR = 1.72, P < 0.014); female sex (OR = 1.53, P = 0.010); Black (OR = 3.24, P = 0.003) and Asian (OR = 2.26, P = 0.021) race; and increasing age (OR = 1.31, P < 0.001). In multivariate Cox regression, patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloHCT) had significantly worse OS (HR 1.4, P = 0.03) and EFS (HR 1.4, P = 0.02) after experiencing a VLD compared to alloHCT patients who experienced </=4 weeks delay. Specific populations (female, older, Black, and Asian patients) were more likely to experience delays in chemotherapy, as were those with significant toxicity during induction.

One of the technological shortcomings of translating therapies from animal models to clinical application is the inability to effectively and non-invasively track these cells after infusion in patients. We have optimized the nonradioactive isotope fluorine-19 ((19)F) as a means to label and track NK cells in preclinical models using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Human NK cells were expanded with interleukin (IL)-2 and labeled in vitro with increasing concentrations of (19)F. Doses as low as 2 mg/mL (19)F were detected by MRI. NK cell viability was only decreased at 8 mg/mL (19)F. No effects on NK cell cytotoxicity against K562 leukemia cells were observed with 2, 4 or 8 mg/mL (19)F. Higher doses of (19)F, 4 mg/mL and 8 mg/mL, led to an improved (19)F signal by MRI with 3 x 10(11) (19)F atoms per NK cell. The 4 mg/mL (19)F labeling had no effect on NK cell function via secretion of granzyme B or interferon gamma (IFNgamma), compared to NK cells exposed to vehicle alone. (19)F-labeled NK cells were detectable immediately by MRI after intratumoral injection in NSG mice and up to day 8. When (19)F-labeled NK cells were injected subcutaneously, we observed a loss of signal through time at the site of injection suggesting NK cell migration to distant organs. The (19)F perfluorocarbon is a safe and effective reagent for monitoring the persistence and trafficking of NK cell infusions in vivo, and may have potential for developing novel imaging techniques to monitor ACT for cancer.","['Bouchlaka, Myriam N', 'Ludwig, Kai D', 'Gordon, Jeremy W', 'Kutz, Matthew P', 'Bednarz, Bryan P', 'Fain, Sean B', 'Capitini, Christian M']","['Bouchlaka MN', 'Ludwig KD', 'Gordon JW', 'Kutz MP', 'Bednarz BP', 'Fain SB', 'Capitini CM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health , Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Medical Physics, Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health , Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Medical Physics, Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health , Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health , Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Medical Physics, Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health , Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Medical Physics, Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA; Department of Radiology, Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health , Madison, WI, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160218,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Fluorine 19 (19F)', 'in vivo imaging and adoptive cell therapy (ACT)', 'magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'natural killer cells (NKs)']",2016/07/29 06:00,2016/07/29 06:01,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2015/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2016.1143996 [doi]', '1143996 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2016 Feb 18;5(5):e1143996. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2016.1143996. eCollection 2016 May.,10.1080/2162402X.2016.1143996 [doi],,,,,PMC4910731,,"['K08 CA174750/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, CARs recognize all CD19 positive (pos) cells, and durable responses are linked to profound depletion of normal B cells. Here, we designed a strategy to specifically target patient B cells by utilizing the fact that T-cell receptors (TCRs), in contrast to CARs, are restricted by HLA. Two TCRs recognizing a peptide from CD20 (SLFLGILSV) in the context of foreign HLA-A*02:01 (CD20p/HLA-A2) were expressed as 2A-bicistronic constructs. T cells re-directed with the A23 and A94 TCR constructs efficiently recognized malignant HLA-A2(pos) B cells endogenously expressing CD20, including patient-derived follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. In contrast, a wide range of HLA-A2(pos)CD20(neg) cells representing different tissue origins, and HLA-A2(neg)CD20(pos) cells, were not recognized. Cytotoxic T cells re-directed with CD20p/HLA-A2-specific TCRs or CD19 CARs responded with similar potencies to cells endogenously expressing comparable levels of CD20 and CD19. The CD20p/HLA-A2-specific TCRs recognized CD20p bound to HLA-A2 with high functional avidity. The results show that T cells expressing CD20p/HLA-A2-specific TCRs efficiently and specifically target B cells. When used in context of an HLA-haploidentical allogeneic stem cell transplantation where the donor is HLA-A2(neg) and the patient HLA-A2(pos), these T cells would selectively kill patient-derived B cells and allow reconstitution of the B-cell compartment with HLA-A2(neg) donor cells. These results should pave the way for clinical testing of T cells genetically engineered to target malignant B cells without permanent depletion of normal B cells.","['Mensali, Nadia', 'Ying, Fan', 'Sheng, Vincent Oei Yi', 'Yang, Weiwen', 'Walseng, Even', 'Kumari, Shraddha', 'Fallang, Lars-Egil', 'Kolstad, Arne', 'Uckert, Wolfgang', 'Malmberg, Karl Johan', 'Walchli, Sebastien', 'Olweus, Johanna']","['Mensali N', 'Ying F', 'Sheng VO', 'Yang W', 'Walseng E', 'Kumari S', 'Fallang LE', 'Kolstad A', 'Uckert W', 'Malmberg KJ', 'Walchli S', 'Olweus J']","['Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway; K.G Jebsen Center for Cancer Immunotherapy, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway; K.G Jebsen Center for Cancer Immunotherapy, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway; K.G Jebsen Center for Cancer Immunotherapy, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway; K.G Jebsen Center for Cancer Immunotherapy, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet , Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway; K.G Jebsen Center for Cancer Immunotherapy, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet , Oslo, Norway.', 'K.G Jebsen Center for Cancer Immunotherapy, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine and Institute of Biology, Humboldt University , Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway; K.G Jebsen Center for Cancer Immunotherapy, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway; Department of Cell Therapy, Oslo University Hospital, Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway; K.G Jebsen Center for Cancer Immunotherapy, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160218,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell malignancies', '*CD20', '*T-cell receptor', '*gene therapy', '*haploidentical allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*immunotherapy']",2016/07/29 06:00,2016/07/29 06:01,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2015/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2015/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2016.1138199 [doi]', '1138199 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2016 Feb 18;5(5):e1138199. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2016.1138199. eCollection 2016 May.,10.1080/2162402X.2016.1138199 [doi],,,,,PMC4910751,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytolysis is considerably lower with fresh noncultured leukemia cells than with the leukemia cell lines K562 and Daudi. For therapeutic considerations it would be desirable to achieve as much cytolysis as possible. The current study revealed that incubating leukemia cells with cytotoxic drugs in vitro significantly augments their susceptibility to the lytic effect of LAK cells and, more importantly that exposing leukemia cells to anticancer agents in vivo during induction chemotherapy also increases their sensitivity to LAK-cell-mediated cytolysis.

The biology of MDS may relate to uncoupling of hemopoietic cellular differentiative and proliferative programs. The MDS provide a clinical setting for evaluating the evolution of relative benign hematologic disorders into frankly malignant diseases similar to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In vitro marrow hemopoietic cultures were utilized to evaluate the effect of granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) on proliferating differentiative and regenerative responsiveness of marrow cells from MDS patients. We determined possible differing effects of G-CSF and GM-CSF in morphological and cytogenetical subgroups of MDS patients. G-CSF was able to induce granulocytic differentiation of enriched hemopoietic precursors from MDS patients, generally without increased clonal self-generation. G-CSF has greater granulocytic differentiative and less proliferative activity for MDS marrow cells than GM-CSF in vitro, particularly for patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) and RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T) and those with normal cytogenetics. These findings provided a biologic rationale for in vivo clinical trials using G-CSF in MDS patients.

The leukemia developed following chemotherapy with Cyclophosphamide and Cisplatin (9 cycles), and then Cyclophosphamide and Carboplatin (6 cycles) resulting in a partial remission of the ovarian tumor. Survival from the onset of acute leukemia was extremely short and the cause of death was intracerebral bleeding. Cytogenetic analysis of the leukemic cells revealed a 9:11 translocation, a pattern usually occurring in de novo leukemias. The literature on the association of solid tumors, particularly ovarian cancer, with acute leukemia is reviewed; while systemic chemotherapy for ovarian cancer definitely increases the risk of secondary leukemia, especially if alkylating agents are administered, the occurrence of leukemia during the administration of chemotherapy for the solid tumor is distinctly unusual. Our patient seems to be an additional example of a recently described therapy-related variant of acute leukemia developing shortly after the onset of chemotherapy and characterized by a rapidly downhill clinical course, a monocytic lineage and a cytogenetic rearrangement t(9;11)(p22;q23). While the number of these newly described cases is still small, this additional example should increase the awareness of this potential association in Cisplatin-treated patients.","['Sulkes, A', 'Ruchlemer, R', 'Neria, S B', 'Leizerowitz, R', 'Abeliovich, D', 'Polliack, A']","['Sulkes A', 'Ruchlemer R', 'Neria SB', 'Leizerowitz R', 'Abeliovich D', 'Polliack A']","['a Sharett Institute of Oncology, Lymphoma-Leukemia Unit, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'b Department of Hematology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'c Department of Human Genetics, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'b Department of Hematology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'c Department of Human Genetics, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'b Department of Hematology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'monoblastic leukemia', 'ovarian cancer', 'secondary leukemia', 't(9:11)']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109068093 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;4(5-6):405-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199109068093.,10.3109/10428199109068093 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Healthy carriers of HTLV-1 had IgG antibodies to cytoskeletal systems as evidenced by an increased incidence of IgG antibodies to actin and vimentin. Decreased IgG antibody levels to Epstein-Barr virus nucleic acid (EBNA) were also evident. In patients with ATL, the titers of IgM antibodies to vimentin and cytokeratin showed a positive correlation with decreased serum levels of IgM, despite the fact that serum concentrations of IgM were significantly decreased in patients with ATL. The IgM antibody titer divided by the IgM concentration (the antibody ratio) was nigher than that of healthy carriers and healthy adults, suggesting that the IgM antibody response to cytoskeletal systems was preferentially preserved in these cases. There was also a suggestion of the presence of polyclonal as well as specific antibody responses to cytoskeletal systems in patients with infectious mononucleosis. As a result of these findings we suggest that there is some difference in the mechanisms responsible for the production of autoantibodies to cytoskeletal systems following HTLV-1 infection and Epstein-Barr virus infection.","['Yasuda, M', 'Nobunaga, M']","['Yasuda M', 'Nobunaga M']","['a Department of Clinical Immunology, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Beppu Oita, Japan.', 'a Department of Clinical Immunology, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Beppu Oita, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'Antibodies', 'EBV', 'HTLV-1', 'cytoskeletal systems', 'leukemia']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109068089 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;4(5-6):375-80. doi: 10.3109/10428199109068089.,10.3109/10428199109068089 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, phagocytic activity, activation of the metabolic burst and surface expression of CD11/CD18 molecules were within normal limits or moderately increased. The chemotactic defect was independent of age, sex, conditioning regimen and the time period after marrow infusion. The incidence of defective chemotaxis was much greater in patients receiving an autologous BMT (92% of the patients) than in those who had an allogeneic BMT (57% of the patients). Simultaneous bone marrow biopsy studies showed significant stromal alterations in most of our patients; since the bone marrow microenvironment plays an essential role in the process of blood cell formation and release, these observations suggest that defective neutrophil chemotaxis may well serve as a marker of abnormal post-transplant hematopoiesis.","['Capsoni, F', 'Minonzio, F', 'Ongari, A M', 'Soligo, D', 'Luksch, R', 'Mozzana, R', 'Volpe, A D', 'Deliliers, G L']","['Capsoni F', 'Minonzio F', 'Ongari AM', 'Soligo D', 'Luksch R', 'Mozzana R', 'Volpe AD', 'Deliliers GL']","['a Istituto di Medicina Interna, Malattie Infettive e Immunopatologia, University of Milano, Milano, Italy.', 'a Istituto di Medicina Interna, Malattie Infettive e Immunopatologia, University of Milano, Milano, Italy.', 'a Istituto di Medicina Interna, Malattie Infettive e Immunopatologia, University of Milano, Milano, Italy.', 'b Istituto di Scienze Mediche, University of Milano, Milano, Italy.', 'b Istituto di Scienze Mediche, University of Milano, Milano, Italy.', 'b Istituto di Scienze Mediche, University of Milano, Milano, Italy.', 'b Istituto di Scienze Mediche, University of Milano, Milano, Italy.', 'b Istituto di Scienze Mediche, University of Milano, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Neutrophils', 'bone marrow transplantation', 'chemotaxis']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109068083 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;4(5-6):335-41. doi: 10.3109/10428199109068083.,10.3109/10428199109068083 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HC proliferation of patient WB was shown to be dependent on the presence of autologous monocytes, but not of T cells. Investigation of other cases of HCL showed that allogeneic monocytes/macrophages from various sources stimulated HC proliferation in 3/4 cases. Neither supernatants from HC-monocyte/macrophage cultures nor tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) could replace the proliferative effect induced by monocytes/macrophages. The proliferative effect was dependent on monocyte viability and on cell contact between monocytes/macrophages and HCs. This proliferation was markedly inhibited by alpha interferon (alpha-IFN).

In the biochemical nomenclature these enzymes represent the ""carboxylesterases (EC 3.1.1.1)"" and are mostly visualized by a substrate-diazonium dye reaction using alpha-naphthyl acetate which led to the term ""alpha-naphthyl acetate esterases (ANAE)"". Separation of cell extracts by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) or isoelectric focusing (IEF) have demonstrated that the carboxylic esterase (system) comprises a number of distinct isoenzymes. Included among these is a distinct isoenzyme (group), defined by IEF with acidic isoelectric points (pI) of approximately 6.0, that is characterized by its strong staining intensity and inhibition by sodium fluoride (NaF). Due to its selective expression in normal and malignant monocytes and its unique plasmalemmal location as an ectoenzyme on monocytes, this isoenzyme (the ""monocyte esterase"") appears to be specific for cells of monocytic origin. While a number of studies have analyzed the biochemical features of the monocyte esterase, little is known about its physiological function. Examining purified normal cell populations and fresh or cultured leukemia cells, it was found that the expression of the monocyte esterase is, indeed, restricted to cells of monocytoid/macrophage differentiation. Expression of this protein can be induced in-vitro by physiological or pharmacological agents in responsive cell populations which can be triggered to differentiate along the monocyte/macrophage cell axis. Compared with the level of enzymatic activity in normal monocytes, there seems to be an overexpression of monocyte esterase in some leukemic cells. Molecular cloning of the gene encoding this protein, an emphasis on studies of function and further detailed characterization of the biochemistry are future avenues of research.","['Drexler, H G', 'Gignac, S M', 'Patel, D', 'Scott, C S']","['Drexler HG', 'Gignac SM', 'Patel D', 'Scott CS']","['a German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, FRG.', 'a German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, FRG.', 'b Cookridge Hospital, Yorkshire Leukaemia Diagnostic Unit, Department of Haematology, Leeds, England.', 'b Cookridge Hospital, Yorkshire Leukaemia Diagnostic Unit, Department of Haematology, Leeds, England.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Esterase', 'isoenzyme', 'leukemia', 'monocyte']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109068079 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;4(5-6):295-312. doi: 10.3109/10428199109068079.,10.3109/10428199109068079 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, heterogeneity remains within each cytogenetic group, especially in patients with concomitant cytogenetic aberrations. METHODS: A panel of DNA probes was used to detect cytogenetic aberrations, including RB1/D13S25 at 13q14, ATM at 11q22, TP53 at 17p13, CEP12 and IGH translocation at 14q32, by fluorescence in situ hybridization. A comprehensive method integrating the number of cytogenetic aberrations and intratumoral genetic heterogeneity was used to analyze the prognosis for patients with concomitant aberrations. RESULTS: Within the conventional favorable or neutral prognostic groups (i.e., with del 13q, trisomy 12, and/or t(14q32)), the coincidence of these three aberrations worsened survival in terms of time to first therapy, progression-free survival, and overall survival. However, within the conventional unfavorable prognostic group (i.e., del 11q or del 17p), patients with a minor unfavorable clone had an unexpected survival advantage compared with patients with a major unfavorable clone. A new cytogenetic prognostic system that integrates the number of cytogenetic aberrations and intratumoral genetic subclones was more precise than the conventional system. CONCLUSION: The number of cytogenetic aberrations and the size of intratumoral genetic subclones should be comprehensively considered to determine the prognosis for CLL.Genet Med 19 2, 182-191.","['Yi, Shuhua', 'Li, Zengjun', 'Zou, Dehui', 'An, Gang', 'Cui, Rui', 'Zhong, Shizhen', 'Li, Heng', 'Xiong, Wenjie', 'Li, Chenwen', 'Chen, Weiwei', 'Liu, Wei', 'Lv, Rui', 'Yu, Zhen', 'Wang, Huijun', 'Xu, Yan', 'Zhou, Keshu', 'Ru, Kun', 'Wang, Jianxiang', 'Cheng, Tao', 'Qiu, Lugui']","['Yi S', 'Li Z', 'Zou D', 'An G', 'Cui R', 'Zhong S', 'Li H', 'Xiong W', 'Li C', 'Chen W', 'Liu W', 'Lv R', 'Yu Z', 'Wang H', 'Xu Y', 'Zhou K', 'Ru K', 'Wang J', 'Cheng T', 'Qiu L']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, P.R.

Incidence and types of chromosomal aberrations were approximately the same as in myelodysplastic syndromes and in 191 patients with de novo AML studied in our laboratory during the same period.

In both these types of acute leukemia primary changes such as t(8;21), t(15;17) and inv (16) were not found; the frequency of AA-Karyotypes was high (70 and 66%) and the incidence of -5,5q- in AML post de novo MDS was more comparable with that found in t-AML/MDS than in de novo AML.

Using specific monoclonal antibodies directed against the IL-2 receptor, a soluble form of this receptor can be detected in the serum. This soluble part of the human IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) is released by T and B lymphocytes and plays a role in lymphoid cell growth regulation. We have measured the sIL-2R by ELISA in the serum of patients with solid tumors and with hematological malignancies (44 chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL), 5 hairy cell leukemias (HCL), 14 Hodgkin's diseases (HKD), 34 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and 19 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). The mean sIL-2R level in 40 normal subjects was 173 + 168 U/ml (mean {pminus} SD). It was considerably increased in HCL: 17938 {pminus} 23748 (P < 0.0003). In CLL, a significant increase was found which was particularly pronounced at clinical stage III and IV with a mean level of 1299 {pminus} 1127 U/ml. In HKD, sIL-2R was slightly but significantly increased 519 + 524 U/ml (P < 0.0004). In NHL, the sIL-2R level was 1015 {pminus} 1022 U/ml, but this increase did not correlate with the clinical stage or the histological grade of the disease. In ALL, sIL-2R levels were also significantly increased 1633 + 1046 U/ml (P < 0.00001). In 69 patients with solid tumors (including lung carcinomas, gynecological and digestive malignancies), 39% of the patients tested had slightly increased sIL-2R levels. However, this increase, when present, could not be related to the tumor histology. These results suggest that sIL-2R measurement is a poor diagnostic marker for solid tumors and some lymphoproliferative disorders. However, in patients with hematological malignancies, it could be a useful tool to monitor lymphoid neoplasias.","['Delforge, A', 'Bernier, M', 'Bosmans, E', 'Massy, M', 'Bron, D', 'Heyligen, H', 'Raus, J', 'Mendes Da Costa, P', 'Stryckmans, P']","['Delforge A', 'Bernier M', 'Bosmans E', 'Massy M', 'Bron D', 'Heyligen H', 'Raus J', 'Mendes Da Costa P', 'Stryckmans P']","['a Institut J.

For the M4-M5 subgroup, these results were 37% and 50% respectively with a plateau reached at 27 months. M4-M5 FAB types represented the most common leukemia at this age, and these usually correlated with translocation of the long arm of chromosome 11.

One hundred and twenty consecutive patients within the age range 15 to 60 years were randomized to one of three treatment groups. In two of these, remission induction treatment was performed with prednisolone, vincristine, ara-C and thioguanine combined with either doxorubicin or doxorubicin-DNA. Patients entering a complete remission received intensive consolidation during 16 months with 4 courses each of doxorubicin (+/ - DNA)/ara-C, doxorubicin (+/ - DNA)/azacytidine, ara-C and amsacrine. The third treatment group followed a protocol from a previous study with daunorubicin and ara-C for induction therapy and a less intensive maintenance therapy. No further patients were assigned to this ""control"" group after 3 years or to the two other groups after 6 years. This report is based on a follow-up 31 months thereafter. The overall rate of complete remission was 67% and the mean time to complete remission was 71 days, with no differences between the treatment groups. Patients treated with the doxorubicin-DNA conjugate had a significantly longer survival [median for all patients 27.2 months (p < 0.01) and for patients in CR 47.0 months (p < 0.025)] and longer duration of first remission (median 23.6 months, p < 0.025) than the other groups.

One particular isoenzyme with an isoelectric point at about pH 6.0, the Mono-band, can be selectively and completely inhibited by sodium fluoride; this isoenzyme comprises a number of closely related subcomponents and may appear in more than one band on the gel. We analyzed the expression of typical esterase isoenzyme patterns in cells from a large panel of leukemias which were tested under identical conditions by IEF on horizontal thin-layer polyacrylamide gels with an ampholyte of pH 2-11. The 442 cases of acute and chronic myeloid and lymphoid leukemia (AML/AMMoL, CML/CMML, ALL, CLL) were classified according to clinical, morpho-cytochemical and immunophenotyping criteria. While bands between pH 4.5-5.5 appeared not to be specific for lineage or stage of differentiation, isoenzymes between pH 6.6-7.7 provided information on the type of leukemia involved. Seven typical isoenzyme patterns termed Mono1/Mono2 (fo monocyte-associated), My1/My2 (myeloid), Lym1/Lym2 (lymphoid) and Und (undifferentiated) could be discerned. Lym and Und patterns are characterized by fewer bands with a weaker staining intensity than Mono and My patterns. Nearly all cases of lymphoid leukemias (acute and chronic) expressed only Lym or Und esterase isoenzyme patterns, but no Mono or My patterns. Cases of acute or chronic myeloid and (myelo)monocytic leukemia showed strong isoenzyme staining displaying predominantly Mono or My isoenzyme patterns. The isoenzyme patterns found in CML in lymphoid or myeloid blast crisis corresponded to those seen in the respective acute leukemias, ALL or AML. The Mono-band was found in most cases of leukemias with monocytic elements (AMMoL 80%, CML 44%, CMML 100%), in the occasional case of CML-myeloid blast crisis or AML, but in none of the cases of ALL or CLL. This isoenzyme is a distinctive, specific marker for leukemias of monocytic origin and is of discriminatory value for the differentiation of monocytic from non-monocytic leukemia variants. Esterase isoenzyme profiles can give additional evidence on the origin and stage of differentiation of leukemic cells.","['Drexler, H G', 'Gignac, S M', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Minowada, J']","['Drexler HG', 'Gignac SM', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Minowada J']","['a Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, Department of Haematology, London, UK.', 'a Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, Department of Haematology, London, UK.', 'a Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, Department of Haematology, London, UK.', 'b Fujisaki Cell Center, 675-1 Fujisaki, Okayama, Japan, 702.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Esterase', 'isoenzymes', 'leukemia']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109070278 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;3(5-6):343-54. doi: 10.3109/10428199109070278.,10.3109/10428199109070278 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the four siblings, one developed a spontaneous remission; one died secondary to subepiglotitis with sepsis; one died with prolymphocytoid transformation and one remains alive with splenomegalic CLL. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly were variable as was the clinical response to chemotherapy. Bone marrow morphology was initially nodular but progessed to diffuse patterns in both deceased siblings. Blood lymphocyte morphology was extremely variable as were cell doubling times and cytogenetic studies. ABO and HLA typing revealed no evidence of linkage. Immunophenotypic analysis of the B lymphocytes demonstrated a CD19 +, CD20-, CD5 +, Leu8-, Kappa + and a CD19 +, CD20 +, CD5 +, Leu8 +, Kappa + monoclonal lymphocytosis in two affected members. An unaffected sibling showed a CD4 lymphocytosis. VHV and VHII gene sequences were previously described in this kindred (PNAS 84: 8563, '87). We speculate that a CD5 B cell and CD4 T cell lymphocytosis may arise early in this disease followed by the development of a pleomorphic, monoclonal lymphocytosis. The subsequent oligomorphic, monoclonal lymphocytosis shows genotypic, immunophenotypic and some morphological heterogeneity consistent with ongoing differentiation. The longitudinal investigation of familial CLL offers a unique opportunity to study the sequence of events related to the natural history of B-CLL.","['Caporaso, N E', 'Whitehouse, J', 'Bertin, P', 'Amos, C', 'Papadopoulos, N', 'Muller, J', 'Whang-Peng, J', 'Tucker, M A', 'Fleisher, T A', 'Marti, G E']","['Caporaso NE', 'Whitehouse J', 'Bertin P', 'Amos C', 'Papadopoulos N', 'Muller J', 'Whang-Peng J', 'Tucker MA', 'Fleisher TA', 'Marti GE']","['a Family Studies Section, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, NCI, NIH, 439E Executive Plaza North, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'a Family Studies Section, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, NCI, NIH, 439E Executive Plaza North, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'b Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Division of Biochemistry and Biophysics, CBER, FDA, NIH Bdg 29, Rm 502, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'a Family Studies Section, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, NCI, NIH, 439E Executive Plaza North, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'c Clinical Chemistry, CPD, CC, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'd Division of Virology, CBER, FDA, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'e Cytogenetic Oncology, Medicine Branch, NCI, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'a Family Studies Section, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, NCI, NIH, 439E Executive Plaza North, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'f Immunology Service, CPD, CC, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'b Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Division of Biochemistry and Biophysics, CBER, FDA, NIH Bdg 29, Rm 502, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-CLL', 'CLL', 'Family studies', 'lymphocytic leukemia', 'single kindred']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109070277 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;3(5-6):331-42. doi: 10.3109/10428199109070277.,10.3109/10428199109070277 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is an increased incidence both of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), particularly acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia, often presenting with the clinical features of acute myelofibrosis. In addition neomates with Down's syndrome show a high incidence of polycythaemia and may also develope a syndrome simulating acute leukaemia, commonly designated transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM). Although TAM closely resembles acute leukaemia there are some subtle differences and infants who survive four to eight weeks usually show a complete remission. Subsequently a significant proportion of these infants develop AML usually around the age of 2 to 3 years. Cytogenetic evidence indicates that in at least some neonates with TAM the abnormal cells are monoclonal. The presence of a cytogenetically abnormal clone is not incompatible with subsequent complete remission with loss of the abnormal close and long survival. For these reasons it may be justifiable to regard TAM as transient acute myeloid leukaemia. Although other lineages are also involved in TAM the blast cells are usually predominantly megakaryoblasts. This, together with the predominance of megakaryoblastic leukaemia among cases of AML in Down's syndrome, suggests that abnormal proliferation of megakaryoblasts in specifically linked to the presence of a supernumerary chromosome 21. Further support for this hypothesis is provided by cases of TAM in subjects with mosaicism for trisomy 21 or for a related abnormality of chromosome 21; the abnormal proliferating cells are derived from the cytogenetically abnormal population. Additional factors are clearly necessary for the occurrence of TAM or AML in subjects with Down's syndrome but their nature is as yet unknown.","['Bain, B']",['Bain B'],"[""a Department of Haematology, St. Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"[""Down's syndrome"", 'abnormal myelopoiesis', 'acute leukemia']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109070274 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;3(5-6):309-17. doi: 10.3109/10428199109070274.,10.3109/10428199109070274 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung biopsy (BX) in the management of these patients is controversial. In this study, we evaluate the yield and safety of BAL and BX in children with leukemia. PROCEDURE: We reviewed the records of all children with leukemia who underwent either BAL or BX between 1997 and 2007 at the St Jude Children's Research Hospital. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were included, of whom 35 (55%) had BX and 29 (45%) had BAL. Positive results were obtained in 69% of BAL cohort and in 46% of BX cohort. Both procedures resulted in change in antimicrobial coverage (77% in BX, 83% in BAL). Pulmonary hemorrhage occurred in 2 patients, and transient hypoxia was the most frequent complication. All resolved without negatively impacting the clinical course.

Identification of those at risk for metastases is key to improved prognostication and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To review metastatic cSCC at the study institution. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen patients with metastatic cSCC were identified at the New York University Dermatologic Associates and Cancer Associates from 1998 to 2013. Patients were staged with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and modified Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) criteria and compared to 32 control subjects. RESULTS: Seven of 16 patients were identified as Stage T2 by AJCC criteria and Stage T2b by BWH criteria; two patients were on Stage T1, three patients were on more advanced T stages, and four patients lacked primary tumor data. Five patients had hematologic malignancy, and one patient had a solid-organ transplant. CONCLUSION: The modified BWH criteria aims to better prognosticate the large group of T2 AJCC tumors, resulting in the majority of mortality. In the experience of the authors, the majority of patients with metastatic disease were on T2, stratifying to stage T2b by BWH criteria, or more advanced T stages. The findings of this study support BWH stratification of T2 tumors and also indicate that hematologic malignancy is a significant comorbidity associated with a poor outcome.","['Stevenson, Mary L', 'Kim, Randie', 'Meehan, Shane A', 'Pavlick, Anna C', 'Carucci, John A']","['Stevenson ML', 'Kim R', 'Meehan SA', 'Pavlick AC', 'Carucci JA']","['*The Ronald O.

The aim of this study is to determine the effect of nilotinib, which is used routinely to treat chronic myeloid leukemia, on spermatogenesis and folliculogenesis by using histopathological parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten male and ten female mice were orally treated with nilotinib at 20 mg/kg body weight dissolved in drinking water daily for 2 months. RESULTS: When compared with the control group, a statistically significant decrease was demonstrated in the total follicle numbers of the female mice in the nilotinib group (268+/-110 vs. 170+/-60; p=0.03). Active spermatogenesis was observed in each tubule sample taken from the mice in the control and nilotinib groups. Spermatogenic activity was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that even though spermatogenesis is preserved, folliculogenesis is inhibited by the usage of a continuous nilotinib treatment dose in chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Cengiz Seval, Guldane', 'Ozkavukcu, Sinan', 'Seval, Murat', 'Ayli, Meltem']","['Cengiz Seval G', 'Ozkavukcu S', 'Seval M', 'Ayli M']","['Ufuk University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey E-mail: guldanecengiz@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160728,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Ovarian Follicle/metabolism/pathology', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Spermatogenesis/*drug effects']",,,2016/07/29 06:00,2018/02/09 06:00,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.4274/tjh.2016.0092 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2017 Jun 5;34(2):137-142. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2016.0092.

Performances took place in 2014 and 2015. The article argues that performances that are created through interdisciplinary collaboration can convey otherwise 'inaccessible' illness experiences in ways that audience members with personal experience recognise as familiar, and find emotionally affecting. In particular such performances are adept at interweaving 'objectivist' (objective, medical) and 'subjectivist' (subjective, emotional) perspectives of the illness experience, and indeed, at challenging such distinctions.

We performed an observational study in 337 prospectively collected, Binet stage A patients to validate the ability of the CLL-IPI to predict TTFT in an independent cohort of early stage CLL patients. The CLL-IPI score stratified Binet stage A patients into three subgroups with different outcome. Since the CLL-IPI was originally developed to predict survival, we next investigated the optimal cut-off score to predict TTFT in Binet stage A patients. Recursive partitioning analysis identified three subsets with scores of 0 (n = 139), 1 (n = 90), and >/= 2(n = 108). The probability of remaining free from therapy 5 years after diagnosis was 85%, 67% and 46% in these three categories (P < 0.0001.; C-statistic:c = 0.72; 95% CI:0.58-0.81). This optimized CLL-IPI scoring for TTFT was subsequently validated in an independent cohort of Binet A patients from the Mayo Clinic (n = 525). The ability of either original or optimized CLL-IPI to predict TTFT was equivalent to other prognostic models specifically designed for this endpoint (2011 MDACC score and O-CLL1 score). Although originally developed to predict suvival, the CLL-IPI is useful for predicting TTFT in early stage CLL patients. Am. J. Hematol. 91:1090-1095, 2016.

Myeloma cells usually express a range of the prosurvival BCL2 proteins. To define the hierarchy of their relative importance for maintaining the survival of myeloma cells, we targeted each of them in a large panel of cell lines, using pharmacological inhibitors or gene editing or by peptide-based approaches, alone or in combination. The majority of well-established immortalized cell lines (17/25) or low-passage myeloma cell lines (5/7) are readily killed when MCL1 is targeted, even including those cell lines sensitive to BCL2 inhibition. Targeting MCL1 also constrained the growth of myeloma in vivo. We also identified a previously unrecognized subset of myeloma that is highly BCLXL-dependent, and has the potential for cotargeting MCL1 and BCLXL. As MCL1 is pivotal for maintaining survival of most myelomas, it should be prioritized for targeting in the clinic once high-quality, validated inhibitors become available.","['Gong, Jia-Nan', 'Khong, Tiffany', 'Segal, David', 'Yao, Yuan', 'Riffkin, Chris D', 'Garnier, Jean-Marc', 'Khaw, Seong Lin', 'Lessene, Guillaume', 'Spencer, Andrew', 'Herold, Marco J', 'Roberts, Andrew W', 'Huang, David C S']","['Gong JN', 'Khong T', 'Segal D', 'Yao Y', 'Riffkin CD', 'Garnier JM', 'Khaw SL', 'Lessene G', 'Spencer A', 'Herold MJ', 'Roberts AW', 'Huang DCS']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Myeloma Research Group, Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University and the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', ""Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia."", 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Myeloma Research Group, Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University and the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia; and.', 'Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Parkville, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160727,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Editing', 'Humans', 'Ligands', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Small Molecule Libraries/pharmacology']",,,2016/07/29 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)34074-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-03-704908 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Oct 6;128(14):1834-1844. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-03-704908.

Pathogenetic CML events are closely linked with the Bcr-Abl protein with tyrosine kinase activity. TKIs block the ATP-binding site; therefore, the signal pathways leading to malignant transformation are no longer active. However, there is limited information about the impact of TKI treatment on the metabolome of CML patients. Using liquid chromatography mass spectrometric metabolite profiling and multivariate statistical methods, we analyzed plasma and leukocyte samples of patients newly diagnosed with CML, patients treated with hydroxyurea and TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib), and healthy controls. The global metabolic profiles clearly distinguished the newly diagnosed CML patients and the patients treated with hydroxyurea from those treated with TKIs and the healthy controls. The major changes were found in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and amino acid metabolism. We observed differences in the levels of amino acids and acylcarnitines between those patients responding to imatinib treatment and those who were resistant to it. According to our findings, the metabolic profiling may be potentially used as an additional tool for the assessment of response/resistance to imatinib.","['Karlikova, Radana', 'Siroka, Jitka', 'Friedecky, David', 'Faber, Edgar', 'Hrda, Marcela', 'Micova, Katerina', 'Fikarova, Iveta', 'Gardlo, Alzbeta', 'Janeckova, Hana', 'Vrobel, Ivo', 'Adam, Tomas']","['Karlikova R', 'Siroka J', 'Friedecky D', 'Faber E', 'Hrda M', 'Micova K', 'Fikarova I', 'Gardlo A', 'Janeckova H', 'Vrobel I', 'Adam T']","['Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc , Hnevotinska 5, 779 00 Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, University Hospital Olomouc , I.

Lymphoma is the fourth most common malignancy diagnosed in pregnancy; Hodgkin lymphoma is more frequent in pregnant women than non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The proportion of highly aggressive lymphomas in pregnant women is significantly higher than in non-pregnant women of reproductive age. Reproductive organ involvement is observed in almost half of pregnant women with NHL. The association of acute leukaemia and pregnancy is infrequent and it is assumed that pregnancy does not accelerate the disease course. Both cancer and pregnancy induce a procoagulant state which can lead to maternal venous thromboembolism (VTE) and placental occlusion. Pregnancy in woman with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) promotes thrombotic environment, associating with an augmented risk of placental thrombosis, intrauterine growth retardation or loss and maternal thrombotic events.Haematological malignancies during pregnancy often require urgent diagnosis and management and are associated with potential adverse fetal outcomes. Most chemotherapeutic agents are teratogenic and should be avoided during the first trimester. Their use during the second and third trimesters may cause intrauterine growth restriction, premature birth and intrauterine fetal death. All chemotherapeutic drugs should be administered only after a detailed discussion with the patient and with close fetal monitoring. Chemotherapy and biological agents might also augment thrombotic risk. Guidelines for VTE prophylaxis in pregnant women with hematologic malignancies, apart from MPN, are currently unavailable, and therefore, clinical judgment should be made in each case.","['Horowitz, Netanel A', 'Lavi, Noa', 'Nadir, Yona', 'Brenner, Benjamin']","['Horowitz NA', 'Lavi N', 'Nadir Y', 'Brenner B']","[""Benjamin Brenner, MD, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, 8, Ha'Aliya Street, Haifa 31096, Israel, Tel.: +972 4 777 2541, Fax: +972 4 777 2343, E-mail: b_brenner@rambam.health.gov.il.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160728,Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,,IM,"['Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic/*physiopathology', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*physiopathology', 'Risk', 'Thrombosis/*physiopathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Haematological malignancy', '*chemotherapy', '*hypercoagulability', '*pregnancy', '*venous thromboembolism']",2016/07/29 06:00,2018/03/30 06:00,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['16-02-0099 [pii]', '10.1160/TH16-02-0099 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 2016 Sep 27;116(4):613-7. doi: 10.1160/TH16-02-0099.

In addition to modulating circadian rhythms, it plays important roles in the health as an antioxidant. Melatonin has also the ability to induce apoptosis in cancer cells and to enhance the antitumoral activity of chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, the effect of melatonin on hyperthermia-induced apoptosis was explored using human leukemia cells. The results demonstrate that melatonin greatly improved the cytotoxicity of hyperthermia in U937 cells. The potentiation of cell death was achieved with 1 mmol/L concentrations of the indoleamine but not with concentrations close to physiological levels in blood (1 nmol/L). This effect was associated to an enhancement of the apoptotic response, revealed by an increase in cells with hypodiploid DNA content and activation of multiple caspases (caspase-2, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9). Melatonin also increased hyperthermia-induced Bid activation as well as translocation of Bax from the cytosol to mitochondria and cytochrome c release. Hyperthermia-provoked apoptosis and potentiation by melatonin were abrogated by a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) as well as by specific inhibitors against caspase-8 or caspase-3. In contrast, blocking of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis either with a caspase-9 inhibitor or overexpressing the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (U937/Bcl-2) reduced the number of apoptotic cells in response to hyperthermia but it was unable to suppress melatonin enhancement. Melatonin appears to modulate the apoptotic response triggered by hyperthermia in a cell type-specific manner as similar results were observed in HL-60 but not in K562 or MOLT-3 cells.","['Quintana, Carlos', 'Cabrera, Javier', 'Perdomo, Juan', 'Estevez, Francisco', 'Loro, Juan F', 'Reiter, Russel J', 'Quintana, Jose']","['Quintana C', 'Cabrera J', 'Perdomo J', 'Estevez F', 'Loro JF', 'Reiter RJ', 'Quintana J']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Fisiologia, Genetica e Inmunologia, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Clinicas, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Fisiologia, Genetica e Inmunologia, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Fisiologia, Genetica e Inmunologia, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Clinicas, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Department of Cellular and Structural Biology, The University of Texas Health Science at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Fisiologia, Genetica e Inmunologia, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain. jose.quintana@ulpgc.es.', 'Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain. jose.quintana@ulpgc.es.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160813,England,J Pineal Res,Journal of pineal research,8504412,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Hypothermia, Induced', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Melatonin/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'caspases', 'hyperthermia', 'leukemia', 'melatonin']",2016/07/29 06:00,2017/03/31 06:00,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jpi.12356 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pineal Res. 2016 Oct;61(3):381-95. doi: 10.1111/jpi.12356.

Xenograft transplantation studies have demonstrated a rare population of leukemia-initiating cells called leukemic stem cells (LSCs) capable of propagating leukemia that are enriched in the CD34+/CD38- fraction. LSCs are quiescent, resistant to chemotherapy and likely responsible for relapse and therefore represent an ideal target for effective therapy. LSCs are reported to overexpress the alpha subunit of the IL-3 receptor (CD123) compared to normal CD34+/CD38- hematopoietic stem cells. It has not been demonstrated whether CD123-positive (CD34+/CD38-) subpopulation is enriched for any clonal markers of AML or any LSC properties. The aims of this study were to investigate whether FMS-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3)/internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations are present at LSC level and whether FLT3/ITD mutation is confined to LSC as defined by CD34+/CD38-/CD123+ and not CD34+/CD38-/CD123-. METHODS: Thirty-four AML cases were analyzed by five-color flow cytometry and sequential gating strategy to characterize of CD34+/CD38-/CD123+ cells. These cells were sorted, analyzed by PCR, and sequenced for FLT3/ITD. RESULTS: In this study, we confirm significant expression of CD123 in 32/34 cases in the total blast population (median expression = 86 %). CD123 was also expressed in the CD34+/CD38- cells (96 +/- 2 % positive) from 28/32 for CD123+ AML. CD123 was not expressed/low in normal bone marrow CD34+/CD38- cells (median expression = 0 %, range (0-.004 %). AML samples were tested for FLT3/ITD (10 positive/25). FLT3/ITD+ AML cases were sorted into two putative LSC populations according to the expression of CD123 and analyzed for FLT3/ITD again in the stem cell fractions CD34+/CD38-/CD123+ and CD34+/CD38-/CD123-. Interestingly, FLT3/ITD was only detected in CD34+/CD38-/CD123+ (7/7) and not in CD34+/CD38-/CD123- subpopulation (6/7). CONCLUSIONS: This finding shows that FLT3/ITD are present at LSC level and may be a primary and not secondary event in leukemogenesis, and the oncogenic events of FLT3/ITD happen at a cell stage possessing CD123. It shows that CD123 immunoprofiling provides further delineation of FLT3+ LSC clone. This novel finding provides a rationale for treatment involving CD123-targeting antibodies with intracellular FLT3 inhibitors directed against CD34+/CD38-/CD123+. This may result in more effective anti-LSC eradication.","['Al-Mawali, Adhra', 'Gillis, David', 'Lewis, Ian']","['Al-Mawali A', 'Gillis D', 'Lewis I']","['Division of Human Immunology and Haematology, SA Pathology, Hanson Institute, Frome Road, Adelaide, SA, 5000, Australia. adhra.almawali@gmail.com.', 'Centre of Studies and Research, Ministry of Health, Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. adhra.almawali@gmail.com.', 'Division of Human Immunology and Haematology, SA Pathology, Hanson Institute, Frome Road, Adelaide, SA, 5000, Australia.', 'Division of Human Immunology and Haematology, SA Pathology, Hanson Institute, Frome Road, Adelaide, SA, 5000, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160727,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*CD34+/CD38-/CD123+', '*FLT3/ITD', '*Flow cytometry', '*Leukemic stem cells']",2016/07/29 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-016-0292-z [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-016-0292-z [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Jul 27;9(1):61. doi: 10.1186/s13045-016-0292-z.,10.1186/s13045-016-0292-z [doi],,,,,PMC4964068,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We quantified the incidence of this complication, which is a novel contribution to the field. From 2010 to 2014, 1849 patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and 41 (2 %) received radiation therapy afterward. Of these, two patients (5 %) developed graft-versus-host disease within the irradiated tissues during or immediately after radiation therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: The first patient is a 37-year-old white man who had Hodgkin lymphoma; he underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a matched unrelated donor and received radiation therapy for an abdominal and pelvic nodal recurrence. After 28.8 Gy, he developed grade 4 gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease, refractory to tacrolimus and steroids, but responsive to pentostatin and photopheresis. The other patient is a 24-year-old white man who had acute leukemia; he underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a matched related donor and received craniospinal irradiation for a central nervous system relapse. After 24 cobalt Gy equivalent, he developed severe cutaneous graft-versus-host disease, sharply delineated within the radiation therapy field, which was responsive to tacrolimus and methylprednisolone. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that graft-versus-host disease within irradiated tissues is an uncommon but potentially serious complication that may follow radiation therapy in patients who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Clinicians must be aware of this complication and prepared with strategies to mitigate risk. Patients who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation represent a unique population that may offer novel insight into the pathways involved in radiation-related inflammation.","['Milgrom, Sarah A', 'Nieto, Yago', 'Pinnix, Chelsea C', 'Smith, Grace L', 'Wogan, Christine F', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Dabaja, Bouthaina S']","['Milgrom SA', 'Nieto Y', 'Pinnix CC', 'Smith GL', 'Wogan CF', 'Rondon G', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Kebriaei P', 'Dabaja BS']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas, USA. samilgrom@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160728,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/*radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Photopheresis', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Tacrolimus/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Allogeneic stem cell transplant', '*GVHD', '*Graft-versus-host disease', '*RT', '*Radiation therapy']",2016/07/29 06:00,2017/05/18 06:00,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2015/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-016-0999-z [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-016-0999-z [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2016 Jul 28;10:209. doi: 10.1186/s13256-016-0999-z.,10.1186/s13256-016-0999-z [doi],,,,,PMC4964004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: PTFC was extracted from Citrus paradisi Macfad peel and was identified by high performance liquid chromatography. The effect of PTFC on the proliferation and apoptosis of leukemia cells were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively. The effect of PTFC on the expression levels of apoptosis-related regulators was determined by Western blot assay. RESULTS: Treatment with PTFC inhibited leukemia cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner and triggered Kasumi-1 cell apoptosis. Treatment with PTFC significantly increased the levels of activated poly adenosine diphosphate-ribosepolymerase and caspase-3/-9, but reduced the levels of Mcl-1 expression in Kasumi-1 cells. However, PTFC did not obviously induce HL-60 cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION: PTFC inhibited leukemia cell proliferation and induced their apoptosis by modulating apoptosisrelated regulator expression in leukemia cells in vitro.","['Dai, Tie-Ying', 'Wang, Bo', 'Lin, Sheng-Yun', 'Jiang, Jian-Ping', 'Wu, Li-Qiang', 'Qian, Wen-Bing']","['Dai TY', 'Wang B', 'Lin SY', 'Jiang JP', 'Wu LQ', 'Qian WB']","['Department of Hematology, the First Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China. lsyww2012@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160728,China,Chin J Integr Med,Chinese journal of integrative medicine,101181180,"['0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', 'E750O06Y6O (Hesperidin)', 'N7TD9J649B (naringin)', 'OA5C88H3L0 (neohesperidin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Citrus paradisi/*chemistry', 'Flavanones/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hesperidin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chinese medicine', 'apoptosis', 'growth inhibition', 'human myeloid leukemia cells', 'total flavonoids from Citrus paradisi Macfad']",2016/07/29 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2014/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11655-016-2593-z [doi]', '10.1007/s11655-016-2593-z [pii]']",ppublish,Chin J Integr Med. 2017 May;23(5):370-375. doi: 10.1007/s11655-016-2593-z.

The anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 expression has been reported as a resistance factor in various types of tumors. Here, we investigated the expression of Mcl-1 in hepatoma cells and HCC tissues and its relationship with p53, and analyzed the possibility of the gene as a molecular target for HCC therapy. HCC specimens of 30 patients were examined by immunohistochemistry for Mcl-1 and p53 expression. Mcl-1 expression in hepatoma cell lines was measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting. The suppression of Mcl-1 by RNA interference or specific phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002, was evaluated as monotherapy, and it was combined with mitomycin C (MMC) in treating hepatoma cell line HepG2. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by MTT and FACS analysis. Finally, changes of Mcl-1 or p53 expression in various hepatoma cell lines were examined after transfection with Mcl-1 siRNA, the Mcl-1 expression plasmid, or the wide-type p53 expression plasmid, respectively. Mcl-1 protein was remarkably enhanced in HCC tissues as compared with adjacent non-tumor liver tissues. In addition, Mcl-1 was prominently expressed in HepG2 and Hep3B cells, weakly in SMMC7721 cells, and not in L02 cells. P53 protein was also overexpressed in HCC tissues and there was a significant correlation between the expression of p53 and Mcl-1. Silencing Mcl-1 by RNAi or LY294002 downregulated Mcl-1 expression and led to decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis. Combination of MMC and Mcl-1 RNAi or LY294002 exhibited a significant chemosensitizing effect. The expression of p53 was not influenced by Mcl-1 siRNA in HepG2 cells or transfection with the Mcl-1 expression plasmid in L02 cells. Furthermore, the expression of Mcl-1 in Hep3B cells was also not significantly changed after transfection with the wild-type p53 expression plasmid. It is concluded that Mcl-1 is overexpressed in HCC tissues. The mechanisms by which silencing Mcl-1 sensitizes hepatoma cells towards chemotherapy may be not attributed to the upregulated expression of p53 but the dysfunction of p53 through Mcl-1/p53 interaction. Mcl-1 may be a potential target of gene therapy for HCC.","['Yu, Qin', 'Liu, Zhao-Yu', 'Chen, Qiong', 'Lin, Ju-Sheng']","['Yu Q', 'Liu ZY', 'Chen Q', 'Lin JS']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China. jslin@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160728,China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

As the aberrant distribution of proteins in hereditary spherocytosis (HS) generates deficiencies of proteins other than those codified by the mutated gene, we postulated that AQP1 expression might be impaired in spherocytes. AQP1 expression was evaluated through flow cytometry in 5 normal controls, 1 autoimmune hemolytic anemia, 10 HS (2 mild, 3 moderate, 2 severe, and 3 splenectomized), and 3 silent carriers. The effect of AQP1 inhibitors was evaluated through water flow-based tests: osmotic fragility and hypertonic cryohemolysis. Serum osmolality was measured in 20 normal controls and 13 HS. The effect of erythropoietin (Epo) on AQP1 expression was determined in cultures of erythroleukemia UT-7 cells, dependent on Epo to survive. Independent of erythrocyte size, HS patients showed a lower content of AQP1 in erythrocyte membranes which correlated with the severity of the disease. Accordingly, red blood cells from HS subjects were less sensitive to cryohemolysis than normal erythrocytes after inhibition of the AQP1 water channel. A lower serum osmolality in HS with respect to normal controls suggests alterations during reticulocyte remodeling. The decreased AQP1 expression could contribute to explain variable degrees of anemia in hereditary spherocytosis. The finding of AQP1 expression induced by Epo in a model of erythroid cells may be interpreted as a mechanism to restore the balance of red cell water fluxes.","['Crisp, Renee L', 'Maltaneri, Romina E', 'Vittori, Daniela C', 'Solari, Liliana', 'Gammella, Daniel', 'Schvartzman, Gabriel', 'Garcia, Eliana', 'Rapetti, Maria C', 'Donato, Hugo', 'Nesse, Alcira']","['Crisp RL', 'Maltaneri RE', 'Vittori DC', 'Solari L', 'Gammella D', 'Schvartzman G', 'Garcia E', 'Rapetti MC', 'Donato H', 'Nesse A']","['Division Hematologia Clinica, Departamento de Medicina, Hospital Nacional Alejandro Posadas, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Departamento de Quimica Biologica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Consultorios de Hematologia Infantil, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Departamento de Quimica Biologica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'IQUIBICEN-CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas), Pabellon II, Piso 4, Ciudad Universitaria, Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, C1428EHA, Argentina.', 'Departamento de Quimica Biologica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'IQUIBICEN-CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas), Pabellon II, Piso 4, Ciudad Universitaria, Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, C1428EHA, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Citometria, Departamento de Diagnostico, Hospital Nacional Alejandro Posadas, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Citometria, Departamento de Diagnostico, Hospital Nacional Alejandro Posadas, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Consultorios de Hematologia Infantil, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Servicio de Oncohematologia Pediatrica, Departamento de Pediatria, Hospital Nacional Alejandro Posadas, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Seccion Hematologia/Oncologia, Hospital Municipal del Nino de San Justo, San Justo, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Consultorios de Hematologia Infantil, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Seccion Hematologia/Oncologia, Hospital Municipal del Nino de San Justo, San Justo, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Departamento de Quimica Biologica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina. anesse@qb.fcen.uba.ar.', 'IQUIBICEN-CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas), Pabellon II, Piso 4, Ciudad Universitaria, Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, C1428EHA, Argentina. anesse@qb.fcen.uba.ar.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160728,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '146410-94-8 (Aquaporin 1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/blood/genetics', 'Aquaporin 1/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Biological Transport', 'Body Water', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hemolysis', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Osmotic Fragility', 'Spherocytosis, Hereditary/*blood/genetics/surgery', 'Splenectomy']",['NOTNLM'],"['Aquaporin-1', 'Erythropoietin', 'Serum osmolality', 'Spherocytosis']",2016/07/29 06:00,2017/01/28 06:00,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2015/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2757-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2757-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Oct;95(10):1595-601. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2757-0.

Among pollutant types, toxic heavy metals and metalloids are among the chemicals that pose the highest threat to biological systems (Jjemba 2004). Unlike organic pollutants, which are biodegradable, heavy metals are not degraded into less hazardous end products (Gupta et al. 2001). Low concentrations of some heavy metals are essential for life, but some of them like Hg, As, Pb and Cd are biologically non-essential and very toxic to living organisms. Even the essential metals may become toxic if they are present at a concentration above the permissible level (Puttaiah and Kiran 2008). For example, exposure to Zn and Fe oxides produce gastric disorder and vomiting, irritation of the skin and mucous membranes. Intake of Ni, Cr, Pb, Cd and Cu causes heart problems, leukemia and cancer, while Co and Mg can cause anemia and hypertension (Drasch et al. 2006). Similarly, various studies indicated that overexposure to heavy metals in air can cause cardiovascular disorders (Miller et al. 2007; Schwartz 2001), asthma (Wiwatanadate and Liwsrisakun 2011), bronchitis/emphysema (Pope 2000), and other respiratory diseases (Dominici et al. 2006).","['Shakir, Shakirullah Khan', 'Azizullah, Azizullah', 'Murad, Waheed', 'Daud, Muhammad K', 'Nabeela, Farhat', 'Rahman, Hazir', 'Ur Rehman, Shafiq', 'Hader, Donat-Peter']","['Shakir SK', 'Azizullah A', 'Murad W', 'Daud MK', 'Nabeela F', 'Rahman H', 'Ur Rehman S', 'Hader DP']","['Department of Botany, Kohat University of Sciences and Technology (KUST), 26000, Kohat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.', 'Department of Botany, Kohat University of Sciences and Technology (KUST), 26000, Kohat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. azizswabi@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Botany, Kohat University of Sciences and Technology (KUST), 26000, Kohat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Kohat University of Science and Technology, Kohat, 26000, Pakistan.', 'Department of Botany, Kohat University of Sciences and Technology (KUST), 26000, Kohat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kohat University of Science and Technology, Kohat, 26000, Pakistan.', 'Department of Botany, Kohat University of Sciences and Technology (KUST), 26000, Kohat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.', ', Neue Strasse 9, 91096, Mohrendorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Rev Environ Contam Toxicol,Reviews of environmental contamination and toxicology,8703602,"['0 (Metals, Heavy)']",IM,"['*Environmental Pollution', 'Humans', 'Metals, Heavy/*toxicity', 'Pakistan', '*Public Health', 'Risk Assessment']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Air pollution', '*Arsenic', '*Cadmium', '*Chromium', '*Cobalt', '*Copper', '*Hazard index', '*Hazard quotient', '*Health risk', '*Heavy metals', '*Industrial effluents', '*Iron', '*Lead', '*Manganese', '*Mercury', '*Municipal wastes', '*Nickel', '*Pakistan', '*Permissible limits', '*Reference dose', '*Risk assessment', '*Soil pollution', '*Vehicular emissions', '*Water pollution', '*Zinc']",2016/07/29 06:00,2017/06/07 06:00,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/398_2016_9 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Environ Contam Toxicol. 2017;242:1-60. doi: 10.1007/398_2016_9.,10.1007/398_2016_9 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This hexapeptide is a fragment of Human Leukaemia Differentiation Factor (HLDF). It displays a broad range of nootropic and neuroprotective activities. We showed, for the first time, that the peptide HLDF-6-amide has high anxiolytic activity. We used 'open field' and 'elevated plus maze' tests to demonstrate anxiolytic effects of HLDF-6-amide (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg intranasally), which were comparable to those of the reference drug diazepam (0.5 mg/kg). Five daily equipotent doses of HLDF-6-amide selectively mitigated anxiety and increased the density of NMDA receptors in the hippocampus of stress-susceptible BALB/c mice, and had no effect on stress-resilient C57BL/6 mice. The subchronic administration of HLDF-6-amide showed no effect on the density of GABAA and nicotine receptors but was accompanied by a nonselective decrease of the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor density in frontal cortex of both strains. The mechanism of the specific anxiolytic activity of HLDF-6-amide may include its action on the NMDA-glutamatergic receptor system of the hippocampus and on serotonin 5-HT2A-receptors in the prefrontal cortex. The psychotropic activity of HLDF-6-amide is promising for its introduction to medical practice as a highly effective anxiolytic medicine for mental and neurological diseases.","['Zolotarev, Yurii A', 'Kovalev, Georgii I', 'Kost, Natalya V', 'Voevodina, Margarita E', 'Sokolov, Oleg Y', 'Dadayan, Alexander K', 'Kondrakhin, Evgenii A', 'Vasileva, Ekaterina V', 'Bogachuk, Anna P', 'Azev, Vyacheslav N', 'Lipkin, Valery M', 'Myasoedov, Nikolai F']","['Zolotarev YA', 'Kovalev GI', 'Kost NV', 'Voevodina ME', 'Sokolov OY', 'Dadayan AK', 'Kondrakhin EA', 'Vasileva EV', 'Bogachuk AP', 'Azev VN', 'Lipkin VM', 'Myasoedov NF']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics of RAS, Moscow, Russia zolya@img.ras.ru.', 'Zakusov Research Institute of Pharmacology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Mental Health Research Centre, Moscow, Russia.', 'Mental Health Research Centre, Moscow, Russia.', 'Mental Health Research Centre, Moscow, Russia.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics of RAS, Moscow, Russia.', 'Zakusov Research Institute of Pharmacology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Zakusov Research Institute of Pharmacology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Shemyakin & Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Moscow, Russia.', 'Branch of Shemyakin & Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, RAS, Pushchino, Moscow Region, Russia.', 'Shemyakin & Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Moscow, Russia.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics of RAS, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160727,United States,J Psychopharmacol,"Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)",8907828,"['0 (Anti-Anxiety Agents)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A)', '0 (Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate)', '0 (threonyl-glycyl-glutamyl-asparaginyl-histidylarginine)', 'Q3JTX2Q7TU (Diazepam)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Anxiety Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Anxiety/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Brain/drug effects/metabolism', 'Diazepam/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hippocampus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Maze Learning/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligopeptides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Prefrontal Cortex/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A/metabolism', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Anxiolytics', '*HLDF-6', '*NMDA receptors', '*elevated plus maze', '*open field']",2016/07/29 06:00,2018/01/05 06:00,['2016/07/29 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['0269881116660705 [pii]', '10.1177/0269881116660705 [doi]']",ppublish,J Psychopharmacol. 2016 Sep;30(9):922-35. doi: 10.1177/0269881116660705.

Simultaneous analysis of codons 12 and 61 is also possible by the use of a multiprimer reaction mixture. Resistance of the amplified product to digestion indicates the presence of a mutation in the original template.

Expression of the cell surface antigen was determined with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated Campath-1, by ultraviolet microscopy and with a fluorescent activated cell sorter (FACS). The results indicate that there is a correlation between Campath-1 binding and the stage of lymphoid-cell differentiation. The null and T lines bound Campath-1 weakly and the fluorescence intensity was low. In the B lines there was a gradual increase in labelling correlating with the stage of differentiation. The redistribution pattern of Campath-1 on the membrane of null and T lines was in the form of rings and small caps whereas that on the B lines was that of moderate patches. Complement mediated cytolysis occurred with the majority of the cell lines, but did not correlate with the extent of surface antibody binding nor with the stage of lymphoid differentiation. The recovery and proliferative capacity of the residual cells after treatment with Campath-1 and complement was low for the null and T lines. This was variable for the B lines, but some did not regain proliferative capacity, whereas others recovered after treatment. The present results suggest that Campath-1 may have considerable utility in marrow depletion of residual. leukemic cells, more specifically of null and T-cell origin, prior to autologous transplantation. Determination of both the sensitivity of the patient's leukemic: cells to cytolysis and the recovery of proliferative capacity of Campath-1 resistant cells may contribute essential information concerning the possible efficacy of purging with this antibody in patients with significant marrow involvement prior to transplantation.","['Ben-Bassat, H', 'Weiss, L', 'Shlomai, Z', 'Slavin, S']","['Ben-Bassat H', 'Weiss L', 'Shlomai Z', 'Slavin S']","['a Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'a Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'a Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'a Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Campath-1', 'differentiation', 'leukemia lymphoma lines']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199009042487 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1990;1(3-4):249-55. doi: 10.3109/10428199009042487.,10.3109/10428199009042487 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a series of patients at the time of diagnosis and after 1-2 cycles of chemotherapy, the enzyme was assayed before the several times during chemotherapy. The derivation of 4 was based on evidence suggesting that the enzyme level correlates with the proliferating leukaemic blasts and their progenitors. Values psi>1 signify the presence of clonogenic leukaemic progenitor cells in the peripheral circulation. When these high (> 1) psi values were found during chemotherapy, in these cases it was possible to predict an increase of the peripheral blast pool, with 82% success, occurring 5-35 days before cytologic relapse. In the patients in whom at some stage during treatment, psi acquired values above unity or in whom psi increased progressively, survival time was in linear correlation with the time period from the initiation of treatment to the documentation of this high psi estimate.

Deoxycoformycin was administered by slow intravenous injection at a dose of 4 mg/m(2) weekly for 4 consecutive weeks and then 2-weekly for 4 doses followed by 4-weekly injections until a complete remission was achieved.

Only one evaluable patient, suffering from a variant form of HCL, failed to respond to DCF, whilst two other HCL-variant cases who had been resistant to alpha-IFN have achieved a PR and are still on treatment. DCF was generally well tolerated, the major toxicity being related to cytopenia and associated infection. Four patients developed severe infections, one of whom died of septicaemia before it was possible to evaluate the response to DCF. A group of 12 patients who had received alpha-IFN immediately prior to treatment with DCF and had obtained clinical and haematological benefit had fewer infections with DCF than the group who had either not received IFN immediately before or who had failed to respond to it. In view of the infections associated with DCF, we would now recommend initial therapy for HCL patients with alpha-IFN for 2-4 months to obtain clinical and haematological improvement, followed by DCF given 2-weekly, to eradicate residual disease. This approach may achieve a higher proportion of sustained CR with a short treatment time and minimal toxicity.","['Dearden, C', 'Catovsky, D']","['Dearden C', 'Catovsky D']","['a Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, The Royal Marsden Hospital, Fulham Road, London, UK.', 'a Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, The Royal Marsden Hospital, Fulham Road, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"[""2'-deoxycoforimycin"", 'Hairy cell leukemia', 'treatment']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199009042478 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1990;1(3-4):179-85. doi: 10.3109/10428199009042478.,10.3109/10428199009042478 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As this compartment is greatly expanded in chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL), it is suggested that the clinical efficacy of alphaIFN therapy in CGL derives from inhibition of late progenitor division and an attendant reduction in neutrophil production. Furthermore, the reduction in Philadelphia positive: (Ph +) metaphases and increase in Philadelphia negative (Ph -) metaphases seen in some patients on alphaIFN therapy may be due to there being proportionally more alphaIFN-sensitive cells within the Ph+ compartment. As the tumour bulk of the Ph+ clone decreases, the suppressive effect that it has over the Ph - compartment ma,y be eroded, allowing upgrowth of Ph- myelopoiesis and reconstitution of a normal karyotype.","['Galvani, D W']",['Galvani DW'],"['a University Department of Haematology, Duncan Building, Royal Liverpool Hospital, Prescot Street, PO Box 147, Liverpool L69 3RX, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['GGL', 'chronic granulocytic leukaemia', 'alpha-interferon, leukaemia']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199009042477 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1990;1(3-4):175-8. doi: 10.3109/10428199009042477.,10.3109/10428199009042477 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is hypothesised that the probability of B-cell mutation is increased in an enlarged pool of B-cells resulting from recurrent malaria and other infections. The greatest enhancement occurs in subjects of low SES, who are more exposed to infections, and in grandemultiparae, whose cell-mediated immunity has been depressed repeatedly during pregnancies.

Cells which acquire the multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype lose sensitivity to a spectrum of structurally unrelated chemotherapeutic drugs. Several distinct drug resistance mechanisms are now recognised which may be involved in clinically resistant leukaemia. It is possible that leukaemic cells may utilise one or more of these resistance processes as a survival mechanism and to maintain a proliferative advantage. If relevance of resistance mechanisms can be established, then the potential therapeutic benefit by circumvention of MDR is considerable with patients rendered chemosensitive and curable. There are many drugs which in vitro can reverse resistance processes, but their efficacy in vivo is yet to be fully demonstrated.

Representing less than 2% of adult leukemias, hairy cell leukemia has become the focus of intense interest over the past few years as a result of therapeutic advances. The malignant cell has characteristic irregular cytoplasmic projections visible on the peripheral blood smear and cytoplasmic vesicles staining positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. The origin of the hairy cell appears to be a preplasma cell B lymphocyte based on immunoglobulin gene rearrangements and B-cell-specific antigens, although very rare T-cell variants have been reported. While the diagnosis may be suspected from the clinical manifestations and examination of the peripheral smear, a bone-marrow biopsy is frequently necessary for definitive diagnosis. The typical patient is a middle-aged man with complaints of fatigue or weakness; symptoms of splenic pain, bleeding or bruising, or recurrent infections are less common at presentation(2). Splenomegaly without peripheral adenopathy occurs in 70-80 % of newly diagnosed patients(2).

To identify the latter subset of patients is important since in these patients treatment should be withhold until progression occurs. In the past few years, there have been several attempts to define ""smouldering"" CLL. Basically, patients in early stage (Binet's A) with: (a) moderate bone marrow infiltration (non-diffuse pattern in the biopsy or less than 80% lymphocytes in bone marrow aspirate), (b) low blood lymphocyte count (<30 x 10(9)/L), (c) Hb level in a non-anemic range (> 12 or 13 g/dL), and d) prolonged lymphocyte doubling time (> 12 months) are not likely to progress and have a life-expectancy not different from matched controls. In three different series analyzed so far, disease-progression rate is approximately 15% to 5 yrs, and survival is not different from that of controls. Approximately, 20 to 30% of all CLL patients with CLL fulfill ""smouldering"" criteria. Besides the above criteria, there are others that merit consideration. Thus, Rai's substages (AO vs AI + II) have been found to predict different outcomes within Binet's stage A. On the other hand, chromosome abnormalities may be useful to further assess the prognosis. Finally, the contribution of phenotypic studies to the definition of ""smouldering"" CLL remains uncertain, and a female sex has been associated with a better outcome. Whether or not patients with ""active"" stage A (e.g., those not fulfilling ""smouldering"" CLL criteria) should be treated is unknown. The morbidity associated to treatment (e.g. increase number of second neoplasms) and the lack of survival advantage found in recent randomized trials cast doubts on the real benefit of treating patients in early stage (Binet's A; Rai's 0). To answer this question, the separate analysis of patients with ""smouldering"" stage A and patients with ""active"" stage A included in recent trials could be of help. Moreover, prospective studies of patients in early stage followed-up with no treatment could be useful to refine the definition of ""smouldering"" CLL.","['Montserrat, E', 'Vinolas, N', 'Reverter, J C', 'Rovira, M', 'Rozman, C']","['Montserrat E', 'Vinolas N', 'Reverter JC', 'Rovira M', 'Rozman C']","['a Postgraduate School of Hematology ""Farreras Valenti"", University of Barcelona, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'a Postgraduate School of Hematology ""Farreras Valenti"", University of Barcelona, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'a Postgraduate School of Hematology ""Farreras Valenti"", University of Barcelona, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'a Postgraduate School of Hematology ""Farreras Valenti"", University of Barcelona, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'a Postgraduate School of Hematology ""Farreras Valenti"", University of Barcelona, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'early clinical stages', 'prognosis', '""smouldering"" chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109103403 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;5 Suppl 1:183-7. doi: 10.3109/10428199109103403.,10.3109/10428199109103403 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to investigate the natural history and prognosis of CLL in younger adults, information on 454 B-CLL patients less than 50 yrs old, from 13 different International groups was collected and analyzed. The male/female proportion is 1.46 (270/184) and the median age is 46 yrs (range, 20-49). Number of cases increases with age: nine patients (2%) are <30 yrs; 70 (14%) are 30 to 40 yrs; and 375 (84%) are 41 to 49 yrs. Clinical stages distribution is as follows: Rai O, 113 (25%), Rai I, 98 (21.5%), Rai II, 182 (40%), Rai III, 25 (5.5%), and Rai IV, 36 (8%); Binet's A, 235 (52%), Binet's B, 160 (35%), Binet's C 59 (13%). Bone marrow biopsy was available in 251 cases, being nodular in 46 (18.5%), interstitial in 76 (30%), mixed in 60 (24%), and diffuse in 69 (27.5%). Clinical characteristics of these patients do not differ from those described for entire series of CLL patients including all ages. The majority of patients (93%) were diagnosed between 1975 and 1989 and at the time of this analysis 138 (30.3%) have died. Infection accounts for the large majority of deaths (48%). Overall median survival is 12 yrs. Survival probability (+/-SD) is 73.55 +/- 2.47% at 5 yrs, 51.04 +/- 3.46% at 10 yrs, and 45.53 +/- 4.08% at 15 yrs. Prognostic parameter identified in whole series of patients with CLL are also useful when applied to this special subset. Thus, patients in stage A, B, and C have, at 10 yrs after diagnosis, survival probabilities of 72.4%, 33.7%, and 21.2%, respectively. Rai stages also discriminate different risk-groups with a survival probability at 10 yrs of 76% for patients in stage 0, 45% for those in stage I + II, and 24% for patient in Stage III + IV. Patients with non-diffuse bone marrow pattern have a survival probability of 76% at 10 yrs compared to 28% for those with a diffuse pattern. Further analysis will refine both the prognostic assessment and the optimal treatment approach for these patients.","['Pangalis, G A', 'Reverter, J C', 'Boussiotis, V A', 'Montserrat, E']","['Pangalis GA', 'Reverter JC', 'Boussiotis VA', 'Montserrat E']","['a Hellenic CLL Study Group, Italian Cooperative Group for CLL, Karolinska Institute Sweden, University of Rochester USA, Radcliffe Infirmary UK, Spanish Cooperative Group for CLL Study, Centre Henri Becquerel Rouen France, Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire de Rennes France, Centre Hospitalier Regional et Universitaire de Caen France, Centre Hospitalier Regional et Universitaire de Poitiers France, Hadassah University Hospital Jerusalem Israel, Rigshospitalet University Hospital Denmark.', 'a Hellenic CLL Study Group, Italian Cooperative Group for CLL, Karolinska Institute Sweden, University of Rochester USA, Radcliffe Infirmary UK, Spanish Cooperative Group for CLL Study, Centre Henri Becquerel Rouen France, Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire de Rennes France, Centre Hospitalier Regional et Universitaire de Caen France, Centre Hospitalier Regional et Universitaire de Poitiers France, Hadassah University Hospital Jerusalem Israel, Rigshospitalet University Hospital Denmark.', 'a Hellenic CLL Study Group, Italian Cooperative Group for CLL, Karolinska Institute Sweden, University of Rochester USA, Radcliffe Infirmary UK, Spanish Cooperative Group for CLL Study, Centre Henri Becquerel Rouen France, Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire de Rennes France, Centre Hospitalier Regional et Universitaire de Caen France, Centre Hospitalier Regional et Universitaire de Poitiers France, Hadassah University Hospital Jerusalem Israel, Rigshospitalet University Hospital Denmark.', 'a Hellenic CLL Study Group, Italian Cooperative Group for CLL, Karolinska Institute Sweden, University of Rochester USA, Radcliffe Infirmary UK, Spanish Cooperative Group for CLL Study, Centre Henri Becquerel Rouen France, Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire de Rennes France, Centre Hospitalier Regional et Universitaire de Caen France, Centre Hospitalier Regional et Universitaire de Poitiers France, Hadassah University Hospital Jerusalem Israel, Rigshospitalet University Hospital Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'lymphocytic leukemia', 'young adults']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109103401 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;5 Suppl 1:175-8. doi: 10.3109/10428199109103401.,10.3109/10428199109103401 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A strictly localized tumor (Ann Arbor stage I/IE) was seen in only 1.5% of the LP-IC patients who were successfully treated by local radiotherapy. In all other patients an expectative-palliative treatment concept was pursued. Long-term survival data analysis revealed significant differences between B-CLL and LP-IC and identified the pseudofollicular in B-CLL and the lymphoplasmacytic in LP-IC as the most favorable histological subtypes. The discriminative prognostic potential of clinical stage (Rai or Binet classification) for B-CLL and LP-IC varied and the pattern of prognostic risk factors obtained by multivariate analysis was not identical.

Among the chronic B-cell disorders, two main groups of diseases can be distinguished: primary leukaemias and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in leukaemic phase. Distinct differences in morphological and histopathological features together with characteristic immunophenotypic profiles constitute the best basis for their precise diagnosis and classification.

Using such an approach, which is feasible on an out-patients basis and devoid of significant side effects, a consistent control of the WBC count was achieved for 32 and 16 months, respectively.","['Pini, M', 'Foa, R']","['Pini M', 'Foa R']","['a Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche ed Oncologia Umana, Sezione Clinica and Centro CNR ""Immunogenetica ed Istocompatibilita"", University of Torino, Italy.', 'a Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche ed Oncologia Umana, Sezione Clinica and Centro CNR ""Immunogenetica ed Istocompatibilita"", University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Alpha 2b Interferon', 'B-CLL', 'chlorambucil']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109103396 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;5 Suppl 1:143-8. doi: 10.3109/10428199109103396.,10.3109/10428199109103396 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result treatment has been primarily palliative. One major obstacle in designing innovative therapies has been a lack of new and effective agents. Recent interest in clinical trials has been stimulated by the impressive activity in pts with CLL of three unique purine analogues; fludarabine (FLUDARA), 2'-deoxycoformycin (DCF) and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (CDA). Of the three, the largest experience in CLL is with FLUDARA. More than 1200 CLL patients have received FLUDARA either on clinical trials or through the NCI-Group C protocol mechanism. In contrast to the published data, preliminary analysis of the first 87 evaluable Group-C patients revealed only 2% complete and 37% partial responses; this discrepancy can be explained by the fact that most patients were still receiving treatment at the time of the analysis, and many were continuing to respond (9 of 12 patients who received treatment for > 6 cycles responded); there was no central pathology review to confirm the diagnosis, 89% were Rai ""high risk"", and most patients had received extensive prior therapy. An updated analysis of response in the first 300 cases is underway. Of 497 pts evaluable for toxicity, 41% developed infections which were serious in 17%, and there were episodes of serious neurotoxicity in 9%. Based on the high level of activity and relative tolerability of FLUDARA, a national U.S. phase III trial is underway comparing chlorambucil (CLB) vs FLUDARA vs CLB + FLUDARA in untreated patients with advanced disease. A comparison of FLUDARA vs CDA in relapsed/refractory pts is being planned. Combination regimens are being piloted in relapsed/refractory CLL including DCF + FLUDARA, DCF + CLB, FLUDARA + CDA, FLUDARA + interferon-alpha, FLUDARA + gallium, FLUDARA + cyclophosphamide. Since FLUDARA achieves true complete responses in a substantial number of previously untreated pts, it is being considered as part of an induction program prior to autologous bone marrow transplantation. FLUDARA has a high degree of bioavailability in dogs, and an oral preparation is being evaluated in clinical trials. Hopefully, new purine analogue-based combination regimens will improve the response rate and survival in patients with CLL.","['Cheson, B D', 'Vena, D A', 'Sorensen, J M', 'Fallavollita, A']","['Cheson BD', 'Vena DA', 'Sorensen JM', 'Fallavollita A']","['a Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda.

Their median follow-up time from initiation of treatment was 40 mo (12-108). They received Chl for a median period of 18 mo (12-24). The overall response rate of our patients at six and 18 mo was similar (approximately 90%). However, there was a significant increase of complete responders at 18 mo compared to those at six mo of therapy (14/67 or 21% and 6/81 or 7.4%, respectively) (p < 0.025). Overall survival from the initiation of therapy according to the stage was as follows: stage A 50 mo, stage B 51 mo and stage C 33 mo. No statistically significant differences in survival among the three stages was found. No toxicity or increased incidence of second malignancy was observed except for one patient who was extremely sensitive to Chl and in whom therapy had to be discontinued temporarily. We concluded that at 18 mo of Chl administration the highest response had been achieved and that overall survival of stage C patients was similar to that at stages A and B.","['Boussiotis, V A', 'Panayiotidis, P G', 'Pangalis, G A']","['Boussiotis VA', 'Panayiotidis PG', 'Pangalis GA']","['a Hematology Unit.

Results of the third interim analysis, based on the reference date of June 1, 1986, pointed out the complex action of chlorambucil, associating beneficial effects consisting in slowing down disease progression to stage B or C and favoring disease remission, with harmful effects given by a shorten survival and an excess of epithelial cancer, as compared with the no treatment group. However, the harmful effects of chlorambucil have not been yet observed in the CLL85 protocol, where 932 stages A were randomized between intermittent chlorambucil (n = 466) and no treatment (n = 466). Nevertheless, the potential harmful effects of the treatment raised out the question of therapeutical decision in stage A-CLL, and contributed to the design of the new protocol, CLL90, in which stage A-CLL are not treated until disease progression is observed. In stage C-CLL, the CLL80 protocol included 70 patients. It demonstrated that the polychemotherapy CHOP, i.e. COP + doxorubicin improved these patients (n = 34) as compared with those treated with COP (n = 36), in terms of disease remission as well as survival. The CLL85 protocol involved 90 stages C, and showed no benefit on survival from methotrexate when associated with CHOP. In stage B-CLL, the CLL80 protocol included 291 patients, who were randomized between daily chlorambucil (n = 150) and the COP polychemotherapy (n = 141). The interim analyses of this trial pointed out the closed results of these two treatments, either for disease remission or for survival. Thereafter, the protocol CLL85 randomized 287 stages B between two polychemotherapies, COP (n = 140) and CHOP (n = 147). However, although the follow-up of this latter trial is rather short considering the main endpoint (survival), no beneficial effect of the CHOP was observed in terms of overall survival, although a benefit was observed in terms of hematological response at the sixth month. Considering the poor prognosis of the stages B and C, the current protocol (CLL90) compares, in both stages B and C, the effect of three treatments, namely CHOP, CAP and Fludarabine.",['French Cooperative Group On Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia'],['French Cooperative Group On Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia'],"[""a Departement d'Hematologie, Groupe hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['(A, B, C) staging system', 'CLL', 'Controlled clinical trials']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109103384 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;5 Suppl 1:83-8. doi: 10.3109/10428199109103384.,10.3109/10428199109103384 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, B-CLL and related lymphomas generally may be considered malignancies of the CD5 B cell, a minor B cell subpopulation implicated in the production of autoantibodies. These malignancies are distinctive in that high proportions of patients have neoplastic B cells that express surface immunoglobulin (Ig) bearing one or more cross reactive idiotypes (CRIs) that commonly are present on monoclonal IgM autoantibodies. Molecular studies indicate that the frequent occurrence of these CRIs in CD5 B cell malignancies is secondary to the non-random rearrangement and use of highly conserved Ig variable region genes (V genes) expressed with little or no somatic hypermutation. In addition, studies with other neoplastic CD5 B-CLL cell populations, not selected for their expression of autoantibody-associated CRIs, reveal that they too may express a restricted set of V genes that have not substantially diversified from those present in the germline DNA. Consistent with the distinct clonal origin of each B-CLL, the Ig heavy chain sequence of each leukemia population is unique at the junction between the variable and constant regions of the Ig molecule in the third complementarity determining region (CDR3). Generated during the process of Ig VH gene rearrangement, the nucleic acid sequence encoding CDR3 is formed by possible N-terminal base insertions, one of several D minigenes and one of six JH gene segments. Despite the potential for great diversity in this region, there are structural similarities in the CDR3 of Ig heavy chains expressed by B-CLL bearing a major CRI, designated G6. This contrasts with the marked variation noted in the CDR3 of Ig heavy chains produced by normal non-malignant B cells that also bear the G6-CRI and use the same VH genes as G6-reactive B-CLL. Coupled with the observed potential bias in antibody light chain and heavy chain pairing in B-CLL, these data suggest that the autoantibodies expressed in this disease may be selected based on antigen binding activity. Collectively, these studies indicate that non-stochastic Ig V gene rearrangement and subsequent selection may influence the Ig repertoire expressed in this common B cell malignancy.","['Kipps, T J', 'Rassenti, L Z', 'Duffy, S', 'Kobayashi, R', 'Martin, T', 'Chen, P P', 'Carson, D A']","['Kipps TJ', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Duffy S', 'Kobayashi R', 'Martin T', 'Chen PP', 'Carson DA']","['a Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'a Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'a Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'a Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'a Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'a Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'a Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-CLL', 'Ig gene rearrangement']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109103377 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;5 Suppl 1:39-45. doi: 10.3109/10428199109103377.,10.3109/10428199109103377 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major clinical differences (extramedullary spread in CLL, bone marrow confinement in MM) may relate to distinctive tumor cell phenotypes and cytokine networks, explaining the frequent bone involvement and uncommon thrombocytopenia in advanced MM. Cytogenetically, CLL is characterized by relatively uniform chromosomal abnormalities with a predominance of trisomy 12 without further changes with disease progression, whereas complex and seemingly random numeric and structural chromosomal aberrations predominate in MM. Multilineage expression and the association with acute myelogenous leukemia suggest that MM may result from transformation of a pluripotent progenitor cell, whereas CLL is thought to develop from a transformed committed B-cell precursor compartment. Survival of patients with MM and CLL is shorter in the presence of higher tumor burden, reflected in increasing anemia in both diseases and in high levels of serum beta-2-microglobulin in MM. Both tumors respond to alkylating agents providing disease palliation but no cures. Glucocorticoids are highly effective in MM and control autoimmune disease associated more frequently with CLL.

Among them, CD40 antigen is likely to play a crucial role in the antigen-dependent maturation process. Recent studies performed in the laboratory have established that presentation of anti-CD40 mAbs in a crosslinked fashion by mouse Ltk(-) cells stably expressing human FcyRII/CDw32, allowed normal human B cells to enter into sustained proliferation. In their overwhelming majority, B-CLL cells are positive for CD40 expression. We have therefore examined the capacity of purified B-CLL cells to be stimulated by various cytokines for growth and differentiation, following crosslinking of slgs or CD40 antigen. In most B-CLL specimens studied, IL-2 was the sole factor, among a wide panel of cytokines tested, which reproducibly and significantly induced proliferation of leukemic B cells activated with anti-Ig reagents (SAC or anti-IgM antibodies). Unlike normal B cells, the great majority of anti-Ig activated B-CLL cells failed to proliferate in response to IL-4. In this activation system, IL-4 profoundly suppressed the IL-2 driven proliferation of B-CLL. An opposite pattern of growth-response was obtained following ligation of CD40 since IL-4 elicited proliferation of B-CLL whereas the growth-promoting effect of IL-2 was reduced. Under these culture conditions, IL-4 and IL-2 displayed additive effects on leukemic B cell growth. Surprisingly, IL-4 combined with anti-CD40 mAb allowed activation of certain leukemia specimens otherwise refractory to other stimulatory signals. Most B-CLL samples were induced for IgM synthesis upon SAC stimulation. This Ig response was potentiated by IL-2 and antagonized by IL-4. Anti-CD40 mAb used alone or in combination with cytokines (IL1-IL6, IFNgamma, TNFalpha, TGFbeta) failed to induce Ig secretion from B-CLL. No evidence for Ig isotype switching was obtained with the cytokines listed above, whatever the mode of B-CLL activation. Taken together, our results suggest that B-CLL can be released in vitro from their apparent maturation block, by IL-2 and anti-Ig reagents or by IL-4 and immobilized anti-CD40 mAb. Additionally, the data reported here suggest that development of the agonistic and antagonistic activities of IL-4 on B cell growth and differentiation may depend upon the nature of the activation signal provided.","['Defrance, T', 'Fluckiger, A C', 'Rossi, J F', 'Rousset, F', 'Banchereau, J']","['Defrance T', 'Fluckiger AC', 'Rossi JF', 'Rousset F', 'Banchereau J']","['a Schering-Plough, Laboratory for Immunological Research, 27 Chemin des Peupliers, PO Box 11, 69571, Dardilly Cedex, France.', 'a Schering-Plough, Laboratory for Immunological Research, 27 Chemin des Peupliers, PO Box 11, 69571, Dardilly Cedex, France.', ""b Institute of Cancer-Val d'Aurelle, Montpellier, France."", 'a Schering-Plough, Laboratory for Immunological Research, 27 Chemin des Peupliers, PO Box 11, 69571, Dardilly Cedex, France.', 'a Schering-Plough, Laboratory for Immunological Research, 27 Chemin des Peupliers, PO Box 11, 69571, Dardilly Cedex, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['IL-2', 'IL-4', 'In vitro activation of B-CLL', 'cytokines in CLL']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109103373 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;5 Suppl 1:13-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199109103373.,10.3109/10428199109103373 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also appears that transformation in CLL occurs in a progenitor-B-cell with considerable plasticity of phenotype expression and even genetic progression (albeit rarely).

In this study, we report the outcome of 295 children and adolescents treated at our institution, with stratification into four risk groups, and omission of cranial irradiation in all patients. PROCEDURE: Patients were diagnosed from January 2005 to December 2011 and classified and treated as low, standard, high, and very high risk groups. A delayed intensification phase was given twice for high and very high risk groups. None of the patients received cranial irradiation for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. RESULTS: The 10-year EFS and overall survival (OS) were 78.5 +/- 2.5% and 81.9 +/- 2.7%, respectively. EFS according to risk group was as follows: low risk 91.2 +/- 3.7%, standard risk 98.1 +/- 1.9%, high risk 81.5 +/- 4.3%, very high risk 59.4 +/- 5.3%. In a multivariate analysis, high hyperdiploidy and infant ALL were significant predictors of EFS. Cumulative incidence of any relapse, isolated CNS relapse, and any CNS relapse were 17.1 +/- 2.3%, 1.5 +/- 0.7%, and 2.3 +/- 0.9%, respectively. Other events included infection-related deaths during remission induction chemotherapy (3), primary refractory disease (2), and treatment-related deaths in first complete remission (8). CONCLUSIONS: In this single-institution study of Korean pediatric ALL patients, risk group based intensification with omission of cranial irradiation resulted in EFS comparable to previous studies, excellent survival of low- and standard-risk patients, and a low rate of CNS relapse.","['Lee, Jae Wook', 'Kim, Seong-Koo', 'Jang, Pil-Sang', 'Jeong, Dae-Chul', 'Chung, Nack-Gyun', 'Cho, Bin', 'Kim, Hack-Ki']","['Lee JW', 'Kim SK', 'Jang PS', 'Jeong DC', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B', 'Kim HK']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea. chobinkr@catholic.ac.kr.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160727,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/*prevention & control/secondary', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Dexamethasone/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*Korea', '*cranial irradiation', '*high hyperdiploidy', '*infant']",2016/07/28 06:00,2017/06/18 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.26136 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Nov;63(11):1966-73. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26136.

The expression of ND2 mRNA decreased in HL60 cells several hours after treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). However, the ND2 gene expression did not depend on the growth-state of HL60 cells because the steady-state level of its expression was observed during transitions of growth. These results suggest that ND2 mRNA is involved in the maturation of myeloid cells and in cellular differentiation, in a lineage-preferential manner. A comparison of the nucleotide sequence of this clone with the documented human mitochondrial DNA sequence revealed several single-base substitutions, insertions and a 39-bases insertion.","['Dohmen, K', 'Kudo, J', 'Shimamura, R', 'Kondo, H', 'Shibuya, T', 'Okamura, S', 'Ishibashi, H', 'Niho, Y']","['Dohmen K', 'Kudo J', 'Shimamura R', 'Kondo H', 'Shibuya T', 'Okamura S', 'Ishibashi H', 'Niho Y']","['a First Department of Internal Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'a First Department of Internal Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'a First Department of Internal Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'a First Department of Internal Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'a First Department of Internal Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'b Cancer Center, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'a First Department of Internal Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'a First Department of Internal Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HL60', 'ND2 gene', 'differential expression', 'leukemia', 'mitochondria']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109067635 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;5(5-6):397-406. doi: 10.3109/10428199109067635.,10.3109/10428199109067635 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The percentage of cells expressing P-gp varied considerably between different groups as well as different individuals (20-100%). Activation of peripheral blood lymphocytes from non-resistant CLL patients with phorbol myristic acetate (PMA) did not induce P-gp expression.

The expression of P-gp was evaluated by immunocyto- and histochemical methods, using three different Monoclonal Antibodies C219, JSB-1 and MRK16 directed against separate epitopes of P-gp. Comparable frequencies of cases positive for P-gp were found in low grade (6/40) and high grade (3/17) lymphomas. The pattern of staining was predominantly cytoplasmic, although a Golgi-associated dot like pattern of staining was also seen, mostly with JSB-1 MAb. Both cases of Hairy cell leukemia were P-gp positive. P-gp expression was also found in the endothelium of small capillaries and some high endothelial venules, as well as in macrophages, in both lymphomas and reactive lymphoid tissues.

Factors which predicted for CR were absence of bleeding at initial presentation and LDH < 300 Iu. The overall median duration of remission was 12 months with 19% of patients in continuous complete remission for 5 years or more. Among the poor prognostic factors for continuous complete remission were race (black patients) WCC > 30 x 10(9)/1, bleeding at presentation, splenomegaly at presentation, phenotype other than T and age > 35 years. The effect of adverse prognostic features was cumulative but race was the most significant factor overall with no black patients surviving for more than 24 months. There was a significantly higher rate of decreased compliance with maintenance therapy among black patients, which may have been responsible for the adverse influence of race.

Three main types of staining histogram were observed and, of these, the most commonly seen (348/432 and 176/252 of non-monocytic and monocytic AML histograms respectively) was characterised by an homogenous distribution of staining intensities which did not exceed two log decades of fluorescence (S-type).

Comparisons between the mean fluorescence staining intensities for the whole blast cell population and conventional positive versus negative delineations for each antigen studied further suggested that semi-quantitative measurements of fluorescent staining were more informative and potentially of greater relevance to the study and diagnostic assessment of acute myeloid leukaemia subtypes.","['Master, P S', 'Jones, R A', 'Richards, S J', 'Scott, C S']","['Master PS', 'Jones RA', 'Richards SJ', 'Scott CS']","['a Yorkshire Leukaemia Diagnostic Unit, Department of Haematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds, England.', 'a Yorkshire Leukaemia Diagnostic Unit, Department of Haematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds, England.', 'a Yorkshire Leukaemia Diagnostic Unit, Department of Haematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds, England.', 'a Yorkshire Leukaemia Diagnostic Unit, Department of Haematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds, England.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Antigen expression', 'Immunocytometry', 'Monoclonal Antibody']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109067624 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;5(5-6):317-25. doi: 10.3109/10428199109067624.,10.3109/10428199109067624 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the level of expression of the common fragile sites detected in each of the study patients was significantly elevated compared to the control population. Although the relationship between the level of expression of common fragile sites and the subsequent development of a malignant process is unknown, many of the agents that induce these sites are known mutagens, and the level of their expression may reflect a genetic susceptibility to mutagenic damage. Thus, it is possible that common exposure to an environmental mutagen may have contributed to the temporal clustering of malignancy in this family.","['Moormeier, J A', 'Neilly, M E', 'Vardiman, J W', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Golomb, H M']","['Moormeier JA', 'Neilly ME', 'Vardiman JW', 'Le Beau MM', 'Golomb HM']","['a Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, USA.', 'a Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, USA.', 'b Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, USA.', 'a Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, USA.', 'b Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, USA.', 'a Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chromosomal fragile sites', 'Familial lymphoid neoplasms', 'Hairy cell leukemia', 'Lymphoproliferative disorders', ""Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma""]",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109067623 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;5(5-6):311-6. doi: 10.3109/10428199109067623.,10.3109/10428199109067623 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One particular isoenzyme near the cathodal end of the gel could not be inhibited by tarirate, the so-called tartrate-resistant AcP (TRAP). Expression of the TRAP isoenzyme was found in nearly all cases of hairy cell leukemia, but also in a significant number of other B-cell or monocyte derived malignancies. TRAP appears to be an enzymatic parameter for activated B-cells and monocytes. The monocytic cell lineage was clearly documented by the detection of a unique triplet of strongly stained isoenzymes.

We performed a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of exercise in patients with AL. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL and PEDro were searched through November 2015. Three authors participated in the study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. The instrument used for quality assessment was derived from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Analyses were performed according to the recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration using Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS: Nine trials (8 randomized controlled trials and 1 quasi-experimental design trial) with 314 AL participants were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled standardized mean differences between the exercise and control groups were 0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.09 to 0.80, P value = 0.01, P for heterogeneity = 0.23, I2 = 28%) for cardiorespiratory fitness and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.28 to 1.06, P value = 0.0007, P for heterogeneity = 0.14, I2 = 43%) for muscle strength. Based on the data for fatigue, anxiety, and depression, there were no significant differences in these parameters between the exercise and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise has beneficial effects on cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength and functional mobility; however, no significant improvements in fatigue, anxiety, depression or quality of life were observed. Further large-scale randomized trials are needed to assess the safety, feasibility and efficacy of exercise programs for AL patients.","['Zhou, Yuan', 'Zhu, Jinjie', 'Gu, Zejuan', 'Yin, Xiangguang']","['Zhou Y', 'Zhu J', 'Gu Z', 'Yin X']","['The First Hospital Affiliated with Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PR China.', 'College of Aerospace Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PR China.', 'Department of Nursing, The First Hospital Affiliated with Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PR China.', 'College of Nursing, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20160727,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Exercise Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/rehabilitation/*therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",,,2016/07/28 06:00,2017/07/25 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0159966 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-03308 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jul 27;11(7):e0159966. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0159966. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0159966 [doi],,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1973-3223'],,,PMC4962985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These relapses are probably due to residual leukemic cells. Gene rearrangements are used as markers of clonality and thereby monoclonal leukemic lymphoid cells can be detected with high sensitivity. In this study, we have applied the analysis of gene rearrangements to detect minimal residual disease in patients considered to be in complete remission. Serial bone marrow samples were studied in 35 patients before and four weeks after initiation of a standardized induction chemotherapy. Gene probes for the joining regions of the human immunoglobulin heavy chain and the constant regions of the human T-cell receptor beta-chain were used. In five of the 35 patients, the same gene rearrangements found before therapy persisted and indicated residual disease. Four of them relapsed within a median time of 10 weeks. Six of the 30 other patients without detectable gene rearrangements after induction therapy also relapsed, but median time to relapse was 30 weeks. Two of them had a relapse in the central nervous system without detectable bone marrow infiltration. Our data suggest that minimal residual disease, detected by analysis of gene rearrangements, is associated with a high early relapse rate. Analysis of gene rearrangements at the time of assessing the response to primary therapy seems to be of prognostic value in ALL and may contribute to a stratification of further therapy.","['Knauf, W U', 'Ho, A D', 'Heger, G', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Hunstein, W', 'Thiel, E']","['Knauf WU', 'Ho AD', 'Heger G', 'Hoelzer D', 'Hunstein W', 'Thiel E']","['a Department of Internal Medicine, Free University of Berlin, Berlin, Federal Republic of Germany.', 'b Department of Internal Medicine V and Poliklinik, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany.', 'b Department of Internal Medicine V and Poliklinik, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany.', 'c Department of Internal Medicine, University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Federal Republic of Germany.', 'b Department of Internal Medicine V and Poliklinik, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine, Free University of Berlin, Berlin, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'gene rearrangements early relapses', 'minimal disease']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109068105 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;5(1):57-63. doi: 10.3109/10428199109068105.,10.3109/10428199109068105 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have sequentially evaluated the presence of CD5 antigen on a group of B-CLL cells using flow cytometry. Purified peripheral blood B cells from B-CLL patients were studied for the presence of both CD19 and CD5. This approach insured that the presence of CD5 antigen was only assessed on CD19 positive B cells. Our data suggests that there is considerable heterogeneity for presentation of CD5 antigen in clonal B cells in this disease. We define 3 B cell groups based on the presentation of CD5; low CD5, intermediate CD5 and high CD5 antigen positive B cells. In addition sequential analysis over several months of study indicates that the CD5 antigen is consistently present on these clonal B cells. Low CD5 B cells appear to have an excess of kappa phenotype. In conclusion CD5 antigen may be considerably more heterogeneous on clonal CLL B cells than previously thought.

METHODS: Peripheral blood or bone marrow samples from 293 patients with newly diagnosed AML were analyzed with targeted, amplicon-based, next-generation sequencing-based mutation analysis. RESULTS: TP53 mutations were identified in 53 patients (18%; 45 were missense mutations). In 13 of the 53 patients, the most common pattern of amino acid substitution was a substitution of arginine to histidine on different codons. The clinical characteristics, pattern of mutations, response to different therapies, and outcomes of patients with AML-TP53-mutated (n = 53) versus wild-type TP53 (n = 240) were compared. TP53 mutations were significantly more likely in patients who had a complex karyotype; abnormalities of chromosome 5, 7, and 17; and therapy-related AML. Patients who had TP53-mutated AML had significantly lower incidence of mutations in Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), rat sarcoma (RAS), and nucleophosmin (NPM1) and higher incidence of coexisting MPL mutations compared with those who had wild type TP53. The distribution of TP53 mutations was equal for both age groups (ages <60 years vs >/=60 years). TP53-mutated AML was associated with a lower complete remission rate (41% vs 57%; P = .04), a significantly inferior complete remission duration (at 2 years: 30% vs 55%; P = .001), and overall survival (at 2 years: 9% vs 24%; P </= .0001) irrespective of age or the type of treatment received (high-intensity vs low-intensity chemotherapy). CONCLUSIONS: The type of treatment received did not improve outcomes in younger or older patients with TP53-mutated AML. These data suggest that novel therapies are needed to improve the outcome of patients with AML who have TP53 mutations. Cancer 2016;122:3484-3491.

REH cells were cultured in either the absence or presence of 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Changes in surface phenotype were analyzed using monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. Cellular proteins were analyzed with two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) of [(3)H]leucine and [(32)P]orthophosphate labeled cells. Immunophenotype and 2D-PAGE studies were replicated three times on untreated (control) and TPA-treated cells on day 5. Immunophenotypic analysis showed that TPA induced further differentiation of REH cells along the B-cell lineage as indicated by significant decrease in the expression of CD10, induction of CD11c and increase in the expression of CD22. 2D-PAGE of [(3)H]leucine but not the [(32)P]orthophosphate showed that TPA induced the expression of a unique protein. The apparent relative molecular mass (Mr) of the resolved protein was ~23 kd with a ~6.2 isoelectric point (PI). Based on the morphologic and phenotypic findings, our data suggest that the new protein (p23-6.2) and the quantitative changes in protein synthesis induced by TPA are differentiation-related. Our study also indicates that 2D-PAGE analysis is a sensitive and complementary tool to phenotypic markers in the study of differentiation of malignant B-cells.","['Mohammad, R M', 'Clark, C R', 'Maloney, T M', 'Chen, B D', 'Al-Katib, A']","['Mohammad RM', 'Clark CR', 'Maloney TM', 'Chen BD', 'Al-Katib A']","['a Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University and the Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'a Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University and the Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'a Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University and the Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'a Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University and the Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'a Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University and the Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit, MI, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Differentiation', 'Metabolic radiolabeling', 'Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel', 'electrophoresis']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109068077 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;4(4):277-84. doi: 10.3109/10428199109068077.,10.3109/10428199109068077 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concentration of 6-thioguanine in plasma was determined with reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). After isolation of leukemic cells and erythrocytes by density centrifugation, HClO4 extraction of nucleotides and isolation of thiol containing substances on mercurial cellulose, the intracellular concentration of phosphorylated 6-thioguanine metabolites was measured by anion exchange HPLC. The plasma peak concentration of 6-thioguanine was significantly correlated (r(2) = 0.60) to the dose administered. In the leukemic cells, the 5'-mono-(TGMP) and 5'-triphosphates (TGTP) of 6-thioguanosine could be detected in nine of the patients. In one patient only TGMP was seen. The diphosphate could be detected in low concentrations in 6 patients. In all patients, the concentration of TGMP was higher than that of TGTP which was higher than the diphosphate. The interindividual variation in cellular TGMP and TGTP concentration was > 100-fold and independent of dose, while the variation in plasma 6-TG was < 15-fold. There was no correlation between dose or plasma area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of 6-TG and the cellular AUC of TGMP or TGTP. However, the AUC of TGMP and TGTP correlated significantly (r(2) = 0.64). The t1/2 of the intracellular metabolites and of 6-thioguanine in plasma were in the same order (4.4, 5.2 and 5.0 h for plasma 6-thioguanine, the intracellular mono- and triphosphate respectively). Phosphorylated metabolites of 6-thioguanine were detectable in erythrocytes from 8 patients. The kinetic pattern of the metabolites in erythrocytes was different from that in leukemic cells. While shortly after administration being eliminated according to first order kinetics in the leukemic cells, the concentration of intracellular metabolites in the erythrocytes was raising during the first 24 h after the treatment. The concentration of the metabolites were, however, much (100-fold) lower in erythrocytes compared to leukemic cells. Furthermore, the triphosphate was the predominant metabolite in the erythrocytes and considerable amounts of the diphosphate was seen while the concentration in the monophosphate was low. We conclude that there is a considerable interindividual variation in the cellular pharmacokinetics of TGMP and TGTP. The concentration of the phosphorylated metabolites in the leukemic cells cannot be predicted by determination of plasma 6-thioguanine concentration, nor by the concentration of the same metabolites in the erythrocytes.","['Liliemark, J', 'Pettersson, B', 'Jarnmark, M', 'Peterson, C']","['Liliemark J', 'Pettersson B', 'Jarnmark M', 'Peterson C']","['a Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute at Huddinge Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'b Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Karolinska Hospital Stockholm (B.P. and C.P.), Stockholm, Sweden.', 'c Department of Medicine, Region Hospital, Orebro, Sweden.', 'b Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Karolinska Hospital Stockholm (B.P. and C.P.), Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['6-Thioguanine', 'A.M.L.', 'acute myelogenous leukemia', 'intracellular', 'metabolites', 'nucleotides', 'pharmacokinetics']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109068076 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;4(4):271-6. doi: 10.3109/10428199109068076.,10.3109/10428199109068076 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From this experience it appears that invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic patients is potentially curable if treated early by amphotericin B, provided that the neutrophil count recovers.","['Shpilberg, O', 'Douer, D', 'Goldschmied-Reouven, A', 'Block, C', 'Ben-Bassat, I', 'Ramot, B']","['Shpilberg O', 'Douer D', 'Goldschmied-Reouven A', 'Block C', 'Ben-Bassat I', 'Ramot B']","['a Institute of Hematology, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, and The Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'a Institute of Hematology, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, and The Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'b Microbiology Laboratory, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, and The Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'b Microbiology Laboratory, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, and The Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'a Institute of Hematology, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, and The Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'a Institute of Hematology, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, and The Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Invasive aspergillosis', 'acute leukemia', 'aplastic anemia', 'neutropenia']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109068074 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;4(4):257-62. doi: 10.3109/10428199109068074.,10.3109/10428199109068074 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In protocol 1, patients received high dose daunorubicin (DNR) alone for induction, followed by regular reinduction courses and continuous maintenance therapy with 6 mercaptopurine (6 MP) and methotrexate (MTX) during 3 years. In protocol 2, induction with high dose DNR and Ara C was also followed by regular reinduction courses, but without continuous maintenance therapy. Protocol 3 randomized high dose Amsacrine (AMSA) or Rubidazone in association with Ara C, for induction and consolidation, this was followed by reinduction courses and continuous maintenance therapy with 6 MP and MTX. During the induction all patients received, prophylactic heparinization and platelet transfusions. Fifty six patients (80%) achieved complete remission (CR), 13 patients (18.5%) had early death (ED) or hypoplastic death (HD), and 1 patient had true resistant leukemia. Only two patients died of hemorrhage. Median actuarial disease free survival (DFS) was 16.5 months and a plateau at 29.1% was reached after 29 months. Patients with fever at diagnosis had a significantly lower CR rate while age below 20 years and circulating blasts above 0.5 x 10(9)/1 were associated with shorter DFS. The CR rate did not significantly differ between protocols 1, 2 and 3 (87.5%, 80% and 60% respectively) but 9 of the 30 patients on protocols 2 or 3 had ED or HD, compared to 4 of the 40 treated with protocol 1 (p < 0.05). DFS was significantly shorter in protocol 2, which included no continuous maintenance chemotherapy, than in protocols 1 and 3. Median actuarial survival was significantly shorter in patients treated with protocols 2 or 3, compared to protocol 1. These results suggest that high dose DNR alone, associated with adequate prophylaxis of disseminated intravascular coagulation, gives very high CR rates in APL, with short periods of aplasia and limited toxicity. Combinations of an anthracycline or AMSA at the doses used with regular dose Ara C may be too toxic. Although this was not a randomized trial, our findings also suggest a possible benefit of prolonged continuous maintenance therapy with 6 MP and MTX in APL.","['Fenaux, P', 'Pollet, J P', 'Vandenbossche-Simon, L', 'Morel, P', 'Zandecki, M', 'Jouet, J P', 'Bauters, F']","['Fenaux P', 'Pollet JP', 'Vandenbossche-Simon L', 'Morel P', 'Zandecki M', 'Jouet JP', 'Bauters F']","[""a Service des Maladies du Sang d'Hematologie Valenciennes, France."", ""c C.H.U.

A Review of Clinical and Biologic Features.,221-9,"Since 1985, the biological association of mediastinal germ cell tumors and certain hematologic malignancies has been recognized. Continued investigation of such patients and new cytogenetic information brings additional insights into the clinical aspects of this syndrome as well as hinting at the possible etiology. This syndrome only occurs in patients with non-seminomatous germ cell tumors arising within the mediastinum. The interval from the diagnosis of the germ cell tumor to the development of the hematologic malignancy is brief (usually less than 6 months). Careful characterization of the hematologic malignancies in this patient population suggests a predominance of abnormalities within the megakaryocytic lineage. Recent cytogenetic analysis in one patient identified the most common abnormality of germ cell cancers, isochromosome 12p, in the mediastinal germ cell tumor as well as in the subsequent leukemic blasts. i12p is not a cytogenetic abnormality associated with the development of leukemia. The clinical evidence as well as this new cytogenetic information suggest strongly that the two abnormalities are clonally related and that the hematologic malignancy may arise as a consequence of defferentiation of the multipotent malignant germ cell.","['Nichols, C R']",['Nichols CR'],"['a Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mediastinal germ cell tumors', 'malignant hematologic disorders']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109068070 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;4(4):221-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199109068070.,10.3109/10428199109068070 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical scale cultures (CSCs) have been used to expand BM-MSCs for their use in cell therapy protocols; however, little is known about the functionality of the expanded cells. The main goal of the present study was to evaluate the functional characteristics of BM-MSCs expanded from CSCs to determine the quality of the cells for cellular therapy protocols. To address this issue, we analyzed the morphology, immunophenotype, differentiation potential (adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic), hematopoietic support, and immunosuppressive capacity of BM-MSCs from short scale cultures (SSCs) and CSCs in a comparative manner. After 12 days of culture in CSCs (HYPERFlask System), BM-MSCs reached cell numbers of 125.52 x 10(6) +/- 25.6 x 10(6) MSCs, which corresponded to the number of cells required for transplantation ( approximately 1.7 x 10(6) MSCs/kg for a 70-kg patient). After expansion, BM-MSCs expressed the characteristic markers CD73, CD90, and CD105; however, expansion decreased their differentiation capacity toward the adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages and their ability to inhibit T-cell proliferation compared with SSCs-MSCs. Importantly, CSCs-MSCs maintained the ability to support the proliferation and expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells and the capacity to express the molecules, cytokines, and extracellular matrix proteins involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis. Our study highlights the need to evaluate the functional properties of the expanded BM-MSCs for verification of their quality for cell therapy protocols.","['Fajardo-Orduna, Guadalupe R', 'Mayani, Hector', 'Castro-Manrreza, Marta E', 'Flores-Figueroa, Eugenia', 'Flores-Guzman, Patricia', 'Arriaga-Pizano, Lourdes', 'Pina-Sanchez, Patricia', 'Hernandez-Estevez, Erika', 'Castell-Rodriguez, Andres E', 'Chavez-Rueda, Adriana K', 'Legorreta-Haquet, Maria V', 'Santiago-Osorio, Edelmiro', 'Montesinos, Juan J']","['Fajardo-Orduna GR', 'Mayani H', 'Castro-Manrreza ME', 'Flores-Figueroa E', 'Flores-Guzman P', 'Arriaga-Pizano L', 'Pina-Sanchez P', 'Hernandez-Estevez E', 'Castell-Rodriguez AE', 'Chavez-Rueda AK', 'Legorreta-Haquet MV', 'Santiago-Osorio E', 'Montesinos JJ']","['1 Mesenchymal Stem Cells Laboratory, Oncology Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, National Medical Center , IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico .', '2 Program in Biological Sciences of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) , Mexico City, Mexico .', '3 Hematopoietic Stem Cells Laboratory, Oncology Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, National Medical Center , IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico .', '4 CONACYT, Children Hospital of Mexico , Mexico City, Mexico .', '5 Niche and Hematopoietic Microenvironment Laboratory, Oncology Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, National Medical Center , IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico .', '3 Hematopoietic Stem Cells Laboratory, Oncology Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, National Medical Center , IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico .', '6 Immunochemistry Research Unit, National Medical Center , IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico .', '7 Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Oncology Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, National Medical Center , IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico .', '1 Mesenchymal Stem Cells Laboratory, Oncology Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, National Medical Center , IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico .', '8 Immunotherapy and Tissue Engineering Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, UNAM , Mexico City, Mexico .', '9 Immunology Research Unit, Pediatric Hospital, National Medical Center , IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico .', '9 Immunology Research Unit, Pediatric Hospital, National Medical Center , IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico .', '10 Hematopoiesis and Leukemia Laboratory, FES-Zaragoza, UNAM , Mexico City, Mexico .', '1 Mesenchymal Stem Cells Laboratory, Oncology Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, National Medical Center , IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Adipogenesis/genetics', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', '*Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cell Shape/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chondrogenesis/genetics', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism']",,,2016/07/28 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2016.0071 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2016 Sep 1;25(17):1299-310. doi: 10.1089/scd.2016.0071.,10.1089/scd.2016.0071 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, unstimulated stage 0 PBMC and B cells from these cases of stage 0 B CLL spontaneously released TNF in significant excess compared to normal PBMC controls while no TNF activity could be detected in supernatants from unstimulated stage IV PBMC or B cells. These data suggest a possible role for TNF in the progression of CLL.","['Hahn, T', 'Kusminsky, G', 'Bassous, L', 'Berrebi, A']","['Hahn T', 'Kusminsky G', 'Bassous L', 'Berrebi A']","['a Hematology Unit and Pediatric Research Institute, Kaplan Hospital, Rehovot, Israel.', 'a Hematology Unit and Pediatric Research Institute, Kaplan Hospital, Rehovot, Israel.', 'a Hematology Unit and Pediatric Research Institute, Kaplan Hospital, Rehovot, Israel.', 'a Hematology Unit and Pediatric Research Institute, Kaplan Hospital, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-CLL', 'TNF', 'cytokines']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109068054 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;4(2):117-21. doi: 10.3109/10428199109068054.,10.3109/10428199109068054 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, previous studies on the association of mTOR polymorphisms with predisposition to different cancer types are somewhat contradictory. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and updated meta-analysis of the available evidence regarding the relationship between mTOR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and cancer risk. Up to November 2015, 23 original publications were identified covering 20 mTOR SNPs, of which seven SNPs (rs2536, rs2295080, rs1883965, rs1034528, rs17036508, rs3806317 and rs1064261) were included in the final meta-analysis. We estimated the summary odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mTOR polymorphisms and cancer risk, and used the model-free approach to investigate the biological effect of each polymorphism. Our meta-analysis found that rs1883965, rs1034528, and rs17036508 were correlated with increased cancer risk in the complete over-dominant model (rs1883965 GA versus GG/AA: fixed-effects OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.02-1.29; rs1034528 GC versus GG/CC: fixed-effects OR=1.30, 95% CI 1.13-1.48; rs17036508 TC versus CC/TT: fixed-effects OR=1.23, 95% CI 1.06-1.43). Stratifying analyses by cancer type, we found that the rs2295080 G allele was associated with a significantly higher risk of acute leukemia in the recessive model (GG versus GT/TT: fixed-effects OR=2.08, 95% CI 1.34-3.22) and a lower risk of genitourinary cancers in the dominant model (TG/GG versus TT: fixed-effects OR=0.77, 95% CI 0.68-0.86). Interestingly, further expression analysis showed that homozygous variant genotype carriers of rs1883965, rs1034528 and rs17036508 had lower mTOR transcript levels, based on HapMap data.","['Zining, Jin', 'Lu, Xu', 'Caiyun, He', 'Yuan, Yuan']","['Zining J', 'Lu X', 'Caiyun H', 'Yuan Y']","['Tumor Etiology and Screening Department of Cancer Institute and General Surgery, Key Laboratory of Cancer Etiology and Prevention of Liaoning Provincial Education Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Tumor Etiology and Screening Department of Cancer Institute and General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, and Key Laboratory of Cancer Etiology and Prevention (China Medical University), Liaoning Provincial Education Department, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Molecular Diagnostics, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Tumor Etiology and Screening Department of Cancer Institute and General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, and Key Laboratory of Cancer Etiology and Prevention (China Medical University), Liaoning Provincial Education Department, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Computational Biology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['cancer risk', 'mTOR', 'meta-analysis', 'polymorphism', 'systematic review']",2016/07/28 06:00,2018/02/24 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10805 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10805 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 30;7(35):57464-57480. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10805.,10.18632/oncotarget.10805 [doi],,,,,PMC5302868,['There is no confict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this therapy is limited due to high rate of resistance and relapse. Recent research has revealed that the poor prognosis and resistance to Ara-C in AML were associated with its abnormally activated MAPK pathways. In this study, we showed a strong synergistic effect of Ara-C with either our Mnk inhibitor (MNKI-8e) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) mediated knockdown of Mnks in MV4-11 AML cells. We investigated the underlying mechanisms for this synergism. We showed that both MNKI-8e and Mnk shRNAs enhanced the ability of Ara-C to induce apoptosis. We found that Ara-C increased the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38 and eIF4E, which correlated with an enhanced level of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein. Inhibition of Mnk activity suppressed the Ara-C-induced MAPK activity, and thus enhanced apoptosis in MV4-11 cells. Taken together, our study suggests that MAPK-Mnk-eIF4E pathway plays a critical role in Ara-C-treated MV4-11 cells and targeting Mnk may be a promising therapeutic strategy for sensitizing leukemic cells to Ara-C therapy.","['Li, Peng', 'Diab, Sarah', 'Yu, Mingfeng', 'Adams, Julian', 'Islam, Saiful', 'Basnet, Sunita K C', 'Albrecht, Hugo', 'Milne, Robert', 'Wang, Shudong']","['Li P', 'Diab S', 'Yu M', 'Adams J', 'Islam S', 'Basnet SK', 'Albrecht H', 'Milne R', 'Wang S']","['Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5001, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 7.2.2.8 (ATP7A protein, human)', 'EC 7.2.2.8 (Copper-Transporting ATPases)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Copper-Transporting ATPases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['Mnk inhibitor', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'combination therapy', 'cytarabine']",2016/07/28 06:00,2018/02/21 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10796 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10796 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 30;7(35):56811-56825. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10796.,10.18632/oncotarget.10796 [doi],,,,,PMC5302954,['The authors declare no conflict of interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate molecular mechanisms underlying relapse, we performed whole-exome sequencing of diagnosis-relapse pairs and matched remission samples from 4 pediatric AML patients without recurrent cytogenetic alterations. Candidate driver mutations were selected for targeted deep sequencing at high coverage, suitable to detect small subclones (0.12%). BiCEBPalpha mutation was found to be stable and highly penetrant, representing a separate biological and clinical entity, unlike WT1 mutations, which were extremely unstable. Among the mutational patterns underlying relapse, we detected the acquisition of proliferative advantage by signaling activation (PTPN11 and FLT3-TKD mutations) and the increased resistance to apoptosis (hyperactivation of TYK2). We also found a previously undescribed feature of AML, consisting of a hypermutator phenotype caused by SETD2 inactivation. The consequent accumulation of new mutations promotes the adaptability of the leukemia, contributing to clonal selection. We report a novel ASXL3 mutation characterizing a very small subclone (<1%) present at diagnosis and undergoing expansion (60%) at relapse. Taken together, these findings provide molecular clues for designing optimal therapeutic strategies, in terms of target selection, adequate schedule design and reliable response-monitoring techniques.","['Masetti, Riccardo', 'Castelli, Ilaria', 'Astolfi, Annalisa', 'Bertuccio, Salvatore Nicola', 'Indio, Valentina', 'Togni, Marco', 'Belotti, Tamara', 'Serravalle, Salvatore', 'Tarantino, Giuseppe', 'Zecca, Marco', 'Pigazzi, Martina', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Locatelli, Franco']","['Masetti R', 'Castelli I', 'Astolfi A', 'Bertuccio SN', 'Indio V', 'Togni M', 'Belotti T', 'Serravalle S', 'Tarantino G', 'Zecca M', 'Pigazzi M', 'Basso G', 'Pession A', 'Locatelli F']","['Department of Pediatrics ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Hematology-Oncology Unit, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Hematology-Oncology Unit, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Interdepartmental Centre of Cancer Research ""G.

Every year, millions of individuals are diagnosed with cancer. But finding new drugs is a complex, expensive, and very time-consuming task. Over the past decade, the cancer research community has begun to address the in silico modeling approaches, such as Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR), as an important alternative tool for targeting potential anticancer drugs. With the compilation of a large dataset of nucleosides synthesized in our laboratories, or elsewhere, and tested in a single cytotoxic assay under the same experimental conditions, we recognized a unique opportunity to attempt to build predictive QSAR models. Early efforts with 2D classification models built from part of this dataset were very encouraging. Here we report a further detailed evaluation of classification models to flag potential anticancer activities derived from a variety of 3D molecular representations. A quantitative 3D-model model that discriminates anticancer compounds from the inactive ones was attained, which allowed the correct classification of 82 % of compounds in such a large and diverse dataset, with only 5 % of false inactives and 11 % of false actives. The model developed here was then used to select and design a new series of nucleosides, by classifying beforehand them as active/inactive anticancer compounds. From the compounds so designed, 22 were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory effects on the proliferation of murine leukemia cells (L1210/0), of which 86 % were well-classified as active or inactive, and only two were false actives, corroborating the good predictive ability of the present discriminant model. The results of this study thus provide a valuable tool for the design of novel potent anticancer nucleoside analogues.","['Helguera, Aliuska M', 'Rodriguez-Borges, J E', 'Caamano, Olga', 'Garcia-Mera, Xerardo', 'Gonzalez, Maykel Perez', 'Cordeiro, M Natalia D S']","['Helguera AM', 'Rodriguez-Borges JE', 'Caamano O', 'Garcia-Mera X', 'Gonzalez MP', 'Cordeiro MN']","['REQUIMTE, Chemistry Department, University of Porto, Rua do Campo Alegre 687, 4169-007 Porto, Portugal fax: +351 220402659.', 'CBQ, Department of Chemistry, Central University of Las Villas, Santa Clara, 54830, Villa Clara, Cuba.', 'Department of Chemistry, Central University of Las Villas, Santa Clara, 54830, Villa Clara, Cuba.', 'CIQ, Chemistry Department, University of Porto, Rua do Campo Alegre 687, 4169-007 Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Santiago de Compostela, 15706 Santiago de Compostela, Spain fax: +34 981594912.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Santiago de Compostela, 15706 Santiago de Compostela, Spain fax: +34 981594912. xerardo.garcia@usc.es.', 'CBQ, Department of Chemistry, Central University of Las Villas, Santa Clara, 54830, Villa Clara, Cuba.', 'REQUIMTE, Chemistry Department, University of Porto, Rua do Campo Alegre 687, 4169-007 Porto, Portugal fax: +351 220402659. ncordeir@fc.up.pt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100305,Germany,Mol Inform,Molecular informatics,101529315,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['3D-DRAGON descriptors', 'Antitumor agents', 'Leukemia', 'Nucleosides', 'QSAR']",2010/03/15 00:00,2010/03/15 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2009/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/15 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/minf.200900033 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Inform. 2010 Mar 15;29(3):213-31. doi: 10.1002/minf.200900033.

In the course of this study we tested the validity of the prognostic model described by Sokal and coworkers(3), the predictive value of histopathological variables, and determined the disease-specific loss in life expectancy. The median survival time was 35 months in our patients. By using Cox's proportional hazards model for covariate analysis of censored survival data(26)'(32) two prognostic models were derived. The first consisted of the following parameters-age, presence of pseudo-Gaucher cells in the marrow, spleen size and the product of myeloblasts and normoblasts in the peripheral blood. The second model included age, the presence of myelofibrosis, the number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and the liver size. Both models provided a risk status that showed an excellent predictive relationship to relative survival rates and life expectancy. Application of the Sokal model(3) to our subpopulation of CML patients failed to reveal a significant segregation of the intermediate group from the other risk groups, even when assessing the disease-specific loss in life expectancy.

These analyses showed that the main increase in HLA-ABC expression by normal CD4(+) CD8(-) blood lymphocytes (mean 490 to 760 FITC units) paralleled the loss of membrane 2H4 whilst the acquisition of UCHL1 was not associated with any significant change in HLA-ABC staining intensity. The sequence of 2H4 differentiation by normal thymocytes, based on the observed increasing levels of HLA-ABC staining intensity appeared to be (a) CD1a (+) 2H4(-) UCHL1(+) (25 HLA-ABC fluorescent units), (b)CD1a(-)2H4(int)UCHL1(+) (134 units), and (c) CD 1a(-) 2H4 (+) UCHL1 (-) (197 units). Quantitative estimates of membrane HLA-ABC expression by leukaemic T-cells revealed marked heterogeneity between individual cases irrespective of diagnostic subgroup. Based on the lower observed limits for normal CD4(+) 2H4(+) (318 units) and CD4 (+) 2H4(-) (478 units) fractions, 14% and 38% respectively of the leukaemic 2H4(+) and 2H4(-) components examined showed reduced HLA-ABC expression. Two cases showed very low membrane HLA-ABC levels that were within the range observed for normal CD1a(-) thymocytes. In contrast, HLA-ABC staining intensities exceeding that of corresponding normal CD4(+) 2H4(+) (710 units) and CD4(+) 2H4(-) (1286 units) subpopulations were seen in a high proportion (65%) of leukaemic 2H4 (+) components, with only 14% of 2H4(-) fractions showing raised levels and, in two cases, these staining intensities exceeded three times the normal observed limits. In addition to the quantitative differences in HLA-ABC expression, a remarkably consistent (81% of evaluable cases) feature of the leukaemic T-cells was that the 2H4(-)UCHL1(+) subpopulation in CD4(+) malignancies had a lower HLA-ABC level than the 2H4(+)UCHL1 subpopulation. This was in marked contrast to normal post-thymic T-cells where increasing HLA-ABC expression was seen with increasing UCHL1 (or decreasing 2H4) staining. These results suggest that leukaemic T-cells have an aberrant intra-thymic and post-thymic sequence of 2H4/UCHL1 expression which has become 'uncoupled' from CD1a/HLA-ABC expression.","['Scott, C S', 'Richards, S J', 'Jones, R A', 'Matutes, E', 'Roberts, B E']","['Scott CS', 'Richards SJ', 'Jones RA', 'Matutes E', 'Roberts BE']","['a Department of Haematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds, England.', 'a Department of Haematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds, England.', 'a Department of Haematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds, England.', 'b Academic Haematology and Cytogenetics, The Royal Marsden Hospital, London, England.', 'a Department of Haematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds, England.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD45RA', 'Differentiation', 'HLA-ABC', 'Leukaemia', 'T-cells']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109107056 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;4(1):39-47. doi: 10.3109/10428199109107056.,10.3109/10428199109107056 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These comprised cases of prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL, n = 5), adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma (ATLL, n = 2), Sezary Syndrome (SS, n = 4), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (T-CLL, n = 4), and lymphoproliferative disease of granular lymphocytes (LDGL, n = 5). Normal thymocyte fractions, of which a mean of 85% cells co-expressed membrane CD4 and CD8, were predominantly (mean 89%) 2H4(-)UCHL1(+) with the remaining cells consisting of 2H4(int)UCHL1(+) and 2H4(+)UCHL1(-) components. Further analysis showed that virtually all CDla(+) thymocytes were UCHL1(+) whereas the CD1a(-) fraction comprised similar proportions of both UCHL1(-) and UCHL1(+) subpopulations. Similarly, normal blood CD4(+), CD8(+) and CD8(dim+) lymphocytes showed reciprocal CD45RA/CD45RO expression and could be phenotypically grouped into 2H4(+)UCHL1(-) 2H4(int)UCHL1(+) and 2H4(-)UCHL1(+) subpopulations. Mean proportions of 48% and 68%, for CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes respectively, showed a composite 2H4(+)UCHL1(-) phenotype, whereas the percentage of NK-associated CD8(dim+) cells with this phenotypic pattern was considerably higher (mean, 85%). Normal lymphocyte subpopulations lacking both determinants (2H4(-)UCHL1(-)) were only rarely noted. Comparing normal patterns of CD45RA/CD45RO expression with those of the T-cell proliferations revealed diverse and abnormal patterns of staining for 3/6 of the CD4(+)CD8(-) SS and ATLL, and for 5/5 of the T-PLL (CD4(+)CD8(-), n = 2; CD4(+)CD8(+), n = 2; and CD4(-)CD8(+), n = 1) cases studied. In contrast, the nine cases of CD4(-)CD8(+) T-CLL and LDGL all showed CD45RA/CD45RO staining patterns similar to that of normal CD8(+)/CD8(dim+) blood lymphocytes (i.e. a predominance of 2H4(+)UCHL1(-) cells). Although the variant CD45RA/CD45RO pattern types of the CD4(+) proliferations did not appear to be related to either the diagnostic category or other phenotypic characteristics, the high proportion of abnormal patterns within this case group suggests that recognition of these abnormalities may be potentially relevant to the differentiation of benign and malignant CD4(+) proliferations and, in addition, may be of aetiological importance with respect to the diverse acquired defects in immunity commonly seen in patients with such disorders.","['Richards, S J', 'Jones, R A', 'Roberts, B E', 'Scott, C S']","['Richards SJ', 'Jones RA', 'Roberts BE', 'Scott CS']","['a Department of Haematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds, England.', 'a Department of Haematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds, England.', 'a Department of Haematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds, England.', 'a Department of Haematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds, England.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD45RA', 'CD45RO', 'Differentiation', 'Leukaemia', 'T-cells']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109107055 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;4(1):27-37. doi: 10.3109/10428199109107055.,10.3109/10428199109107055 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One or more TCR genes showed rearrangement and/or deletion in 11 patients, whereas rearrangement of IgH genes were seen in 3 patients only. TCR genes showed four distinct patterns: (a) rearrangement and/or deletion of each of the three TCR genes (7 patients), (b) re-arrangement of two TCR genes (3 patients), (c) rearrangement/deletion of one TCR gene only (1 patient), (d) germ-line state of all TCR genes (1 patient). These patterns had no demonstrable relationship with the clinical status either at the time of diagnosis or during the subsequent course of the disease. The findings provided unequivocal evidence of T-cell lineage of the leukaemic cells in 10 out of 12 patients. In one patient the lineage of leukaemic cells remained indeterminate. In the last patient the germ-line state of all TCR genes and rearrangement of both IgH alleles genes indicated that the leukaemia was of B-cell origin, even though the leukaemic cells had other features regarded as characteristic of T-lymphocytes. The different patterns of TCR genes, seen in the context of the hierarchical nature of the rearrangement process, suggest that the leukaemic transformation occurred at different stages of T-cell ontogeny and was followed by arrest of subsequent TCR gene rearrangement.","['Singh, A K', 'Laffan, M', 'Eridani, S', 'Luzzatto, L']","['Singh AK', 'Laffan M', 'Eridani S', 'Luzzatto L']","[""a Division of Haematology, UMDS St. Thomas's Campus, London, UK."", 'b Dept. of Haematology and MRC/LRF Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.', ""a Division of Haematology, UMDS St. Thomas's Campus, London, UK."", 'b Dept. of Haematology and MRC/LRF Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['T-cell chronic leukaemias', 'T-cell receptors', 'gene rearrangement']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109107054 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;4(1):17-25. doi: 10.3109/10428199109107054.,10.3109/10428199109107054 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In non lymphatic disorders, obvious modifications in mature neutrophil functions have been described. They predict susceptibility to infection and bad prognosis in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and in acute non lymphatic leukemia (ANLL) where the mature looking neutrophils represent the leukemic clone and function aberrantly. The defects in neutrophil function encountered in myeloproliferative diseases including chronic myeloid leukemia, are mostly of scientific interest, and usually do not alter the clinical course of the disease in these patients. The alterations in neutrophil function in the lymphoproliferative disorders result mostly from humoral defects, mainly immunoglobulin deficiency and a variety of neutrophil inhibitory substances, and are not due to primary cellular defects. Neutrophil dysfunction may also result from a protracted infectious course and various treatment modalities, includng splenectomy and chemo-radiotherapy. Neutrophil function studies in splenectomised patients and in selected cases with MDS and ANLL, and studies of serum immunoglobulins and neutrophil inhibitors in patients with lymphoid diseases, may be useful in screening those cases who are prone to infectious problems, and who might therefore benefit from increased infectious precautions.","['Matzner, Y']",['Matzner Y'],"['a Hematology Unit, Hadassah University Hospital Mount Scopus, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Neutrophil function', 'hematologic malignancies']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109107053 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;4(1):9-15. doi: 10.3109/10428199109107053.,10.3109/10428199109107053 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been widely used for over 60 years as both a low and high-dose therapy in chronic inflammatory diseases. The aim of this review was to analyze and summarize the available data specifically on the safety of this drug in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases. AREAS COVERED: A structured search of articles was conducted using the PubMed database up to April 2016. All articles in English with isolated or combined keywords were included according to their relevance to the aims of this study. EXPERT OPINION: Numerous of studies have established the efficacy of parenteral methotrexate in the management of steroid-dependent and steroid-resistant Crohn's disease, either for inducing or maintaining remission. However, its efficacy in ulcerative colitis has not been properly investigated. Additionally, methotrexate has been shown to reduce the effect of immunization with anti-TNF agents when combined. The drug has potential advantages over thiopurines such as its weekly administration, a possible shorter time of action, low cost, decreased risk for malignancy and overall a comparable safety profile.","['Gabbani, Tommaso', 'Deiana, Simona', 'Lunardi, Sarah', 'Manetti, Natalia', 'Annese, Vito']","['Gabbani T', 'Deiana S', 'Lunardi S', 'Manetti N', 'Annese V']","['a Division of Gastroenterology , AOU Careggi University Hospital , Florence , Italy.', 'a Division of Gastroenterology , AOU Careggi University Hospital , Florence , Italy.', 'b Division of Internal Medicine 4 , AOU Careggi University Hospital , Florence , Italy.', 'a Division of Gastroenterology , AOU Careggi University Hospital , Florence , Italy.', 'a Division of Gastroenterology , AOU Careggi University Hospital , Florence , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160808,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Steroids)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Colitis, Ulcerative/*drug therapy', 'Crohn Disease/*drug therapy', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Steroids/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"[""*Crohn's disease"", '*Methotrexate', '*inflammatory bowel disease', '*safety', '*side effects']",2016/07/28 06:00,2017/02/28 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/14740338.2016.1218468 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2016 Oct;15(10):1427-37. doi: 10.1080/14740338.2016.1218468.

However, its role in regulating global gene expression in MLLr cells, as well as its interplay with MLL1 fusion proteins remains unclear. Here we show that despite shared DNA-binding and cofactor interacting domains at the N terminus, MLL1 and MLL-AF9 are recruited to distinct chromatin regions and have divergent functions in regulating the leukemic transcription program. We demonstrate that MLL1, probably through C-terminal interaction with WDR5, is recruited to regulatory enhancers that are enriched for binding sites of E-twenty-six (ETS) family transcription factors, whereas MLL-AF9 binds to chromatin regions that have no H3K4me1 enrichment. Transcriptome-wide changes induced by different small molecule inhibitors also highlight the distinct functions of MLL1 and MLL-AF9. Taken together, our studies provide novel insights on how MLL1 and MLL fusion proteins contribute to leukemic gene expression, which have implications for developing effective therapies in the future.","['Xu, Jing', 'Li, Li', 'Xiong, Jie', 'denDekker, Aaron', 'Ye, Andrew', 'Karatas, Hacer', 'Liu, Liu', 'Wang, He', 'Qin, Zhaohui S', 'Wang, Shaomeng', 'Dou, Yali']","['Xu J', 'Li L', 'Xiong J', 'denDekker A', 'Ye A', 'Karatas H', 'Liu L', 'Wang H', 'Qin ZS', 'Wang S', 'Dou Y']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan , Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University , Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan , Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan , Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan , Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'China Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research , Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University , Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160517,England,Cell Discov,Cell discovery,101661034,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MLL fusion proteins', 'MLL1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'epigenetic therapeutics', 'menin']",2016/07/28 06:00,2016/07/28 06:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2015/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1038/celldisc.2016.8 [doi]'],epublish,Cell Discov. 2016 May 17;2:16008. doi: 10.1038/celldisc.2016.8. eCollection 2016.,10.1038/celldisc.2016.8 [doi],,,,,PMC4869169,,"['R01 CA177307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM082856/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007517/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proliferation of developing thymocytes is tightly controlled to prevent leukemic transformation of T cells. Here we examine Trib2 loss in murine hematopoiesis under steady state and proliferative stress conditions, including genotoxic and oncogenic stress. Trib2 (-/-) developing thymocytes show increased proliferation, and Trib2 (-/-) mice have significantly higher thymic cellularity at steady state. During stress hematopoiesis, Trib2 (-/-) developing thymocytes undergo accelerated proliferation and demonstrate hypersensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced cell death. Despite the increased cell death post 5-FU-induced proliferative stress, Trib2 (-/-) mice exhibit accelerated thymopoietic recovery post treatment due to increased cell division kinetics of developing thymocytes. The increased proliferation in Trib2 (-/-) thymocytes was exacerbated under oncogenic stress. In an experimental murine T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) model, Trib2 (-/-) mice had reduced latency in vivo, which associated with impaired MAP kinase (MAPK) activation. High and low expression levels of Trib2 correlate with immature and mature subtypes of human T-ALL, respectively, and associate with MAPK. Thus, TRIB2 emerges as a novel regulator of thymocyte cellular proliferation, important for the thymopoietic response to genotoxic and oncogenic stress, and possessing tumor suppressor function.","['Liang, Kai Ling', ""O'Connor, Caitriona"", 'Veiga, J Pedro', 'McCarthy, Tommie V', 'Keeshan, Karen']","['Liang KL', ""O'Connor C"", 'Veiga JP', 'McCarthy TV', 'Keeshan K']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK; School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow , Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow , Glasgow, UK."", 'School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University College Cork , Cork, Ireland.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow , Glasgow, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160315,England,Cell Discov,Cell discovery,101661034,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cell cycle', 'genotoxic stress', 'oncogenic stress', 'proliferation', 'pseudokinase']",2016/07/28 06:00,2016/07/28 06:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2015/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1038/celldisc.2015.50 [doi]'],epublish,Cell Discov. 2016 Mar 15;2:15050. doi: 10.1038/celldisc.2015.50. eCollection 2016.,10.1038/celldisc.2015.50 [doi],,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7266-0890'],,,PMC4860960,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had splenomegaly and lymphocytosis (lymphocyte count of 11.6 x 10(9)/l), with remarkably abnormal appearing morphology. Her hemoglobin and platelet counts were normal. Peripheral blood flow cytometry revealed a monoclonal B-cell population expressing CD11c, CD25, CD19, CD20, and CD103. An initial diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) was made, and the patient was treated with a standard 5-day course of cladribine. However, her lymphocytosis improved transiently, with a relapse 4 months later. There was no improvement in her splenomegaly. An HCL variant (HCL-v) was considered based on her resistance to treatment with a purine nucleoside analog. A subsequent splenectomy improved symptoms. Two years after, the patient suffered a relapse and underwent 6 cycles of CHOP-R (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, oncovin, prednisone, and rituximab), achieving partial remission. While under observation, she progressed with lymphocytosis 6 months later and was treated with pentostatin. There was no significant improvement in her disease, and she died 8 weeks following treatment initiation. HCL-v is a clinically more aggressive mature B-cell lymphoma than HCL with worse splenomegaly, higher lymphocyte counts, and resistance to typical HCL therapy with purine nucleoside analogs. Early recognition of HCL-v in the history, physical examination, and investigations with morphology and flow cytometry is key to patient management. Further, as in our case of HCL-v, cell morphology can be distinctly atypical, with large nucleoli and extremely convoluted nuclei. The distinction between HCL and HCL-v is important as HCL-v patients require more aggressive therapy and closer follow-up.","['Jian, Charles', 'Hsia, Cyrus C']","['Jian C', 'Hsia CC']","['Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ont., Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ont., Canada.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20160610,Switzerland,Case Rep Oncol,Case reports in oncology,101517601,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoid leukemia', 'Hairy cell leukemia variant']",2016/07/28 06:00,2016/07/28 06:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000446696 [doi]', 'cro-0009-0312 [pii]']",epublish,Case Rep Oncol. 2016 Jun 10;9(2):312-6. doi: 10.1159/000446696. eCollection 2016 May-Aug.,10.1159/000446696 [doi],,,,,PMC4939668,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, several reports have suggested that CaN is also associated with schizophrenia. However, little data are currently available on the direct effect of tacrolimus on the human brain. CASE: A 23-year-old Japanese female experienced severe delusion of persecution, delusional mood, suspiciousness, aggression, and excitement. She visited our hospital and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. When she was 27 years old, she had severe general fatigue, persistent fever, systemic joint pain, gingival bleeding, and breathlessness and was diagnosed with acute myelomonocytic leukemia. Later she underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT), she was administered methotrexate and cyclosporin A to prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD). Three weeks after BMT, she showed initial symptoms of GVHD and was prescribed tacrolimus instead of cyclosporin A. Seven months after BMT at the age of 31 years, she died of progression of GVHD. Pathological anatomy was examined after her death, including immunohistochemical analysis of her brain using anti-CaN antibodies. For comparison, we used our previous data from both a schizophrenia group and a healthy control group. No significant differences were observed in the percentage of CaN-immunoreactive neurons among the schizophrenia group, healthy control group, and the tacrolimus case (all P>0.5, analysis of covariance). Compared with the healthy control group and schizophrenia group, the percentages of CaN-immunoreactive neurons in layers III-VI of the BA46 and the putamen tended to be lower in the tacrolimus case. CONCLUSION: Tacrolimus may decrease CaN immunoreactivity in some regions of the human brain. Thus, tacrolimus may introduce side effects such as cognitive dysfunction and extrapyramidal symptoms. In addition, we also found that the effect of tacrolimus on CaN immunore-activity in human brain was stronger than the effect of schizophrenia.","['Wada, Akira', 'Kunii, Yasuto', 'Matsumoto, Jyunya', 'Hino, Mizuki', 'Nagaoka, Atsuko', 'Niwa, Shin-Ichi', 'Yabe, Hirooki']","['Wada A', 'Kunii Y', 'Matsumoto J', 'Hino M', 'Nagaoka A', 'Niwa S', 'Yabe H']","['Department of Neuropsychiatry, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima City, Fukushima; Department of Neuropsychiatry, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo.', 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima City, Fukushima.', 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima City, Fukushima.', 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima City, Fukushima.', 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima City, Fukushima.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Aizu Medical Center, Fukushima Medical University, Aizuwakamatsu City, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Neuropsychiatry, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima City, Fukushima.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20160706,New Zealand,Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,101240304,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['calcineurin', 'calcineurin inhibitors', 'immunohistochemistry', 'postmortem brain', 'schizophrenia']",2016/07/28 06:00,2016/07/28 06:01,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/NDT.S106371 [doi]', 'ndt-12-1645 [pii]']",epublish,Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat. 2016 Jul 6;12:1645-50. doi: 10.2147/NDT.S106371. eCollection 2016.,10.2147/NDT.S106371 [doi],,,,,PMC4940021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could represent an alternative treatment option for aGVHD. However, FMT for SCT patients carries a potential risk of infection by infused microbiota because of the severely immunosuppressed status. We therefore conducted a pilot study to evaluate the safety of FMT in SCT. A total of 4 patients with steroid-resistant (n = 3) or steroid-dependent gut aGVHD (n = 1) received FMT. No severe adverse events attributed to FMT were observed. All patients responded to FMT, with 3 complete responses and 1 partial response.

Patient history, and clinical and laboratory examination results were taken, including complete blood count, serum LDH, bone marrow aspiration with cytochemistry, immunophenotyping, Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization technique for detection of t(9;22) and Flow cytometery for estimation of Prominin-1 expression on blast cells. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed between Prominin-1 positive and negative patients regarding age, sex and clinical presentation at diagnosis. No statistically significant differences between Prominin-1 positive and negative patients were observed regarding white blood cells and platelet counts, peripheral blood and bone marrow blast cells percentage while there were significantly higher hemoglobin and LDH levels in Prominin-1 positive patients. There were no significant differences between Prominin-1 positive and negative patients regarding immunophenotyping and t(9;22). There were statistically significant differences in disease outcome between Prominin-1 positive and negative expression with higher rate of relapse and death and lower rate of complete remission in patients with Prominin-1 positive expression (14 cases with Prominin-1 positive relapsed versus 2 cases with Prominin-1 negative, 12 cases with Prominin-1 positive died versus 2 cases with Prominin-1 negative and complete remission occurred in 20 cases with Prominin-1 positive versus 30 cases with Prominin-1 negative) (P =0.017). There was statistically significant difference in disease-free survival (P = 0.0072) and overall survival (P = 0.0424) between ALL patients with Prominin-1 positive and Prominin--1 negative expression. CONCLUSION: Prominin-1 is a helpful prognostic marker in patients with ALL; therefore, it should be routinely assessed at diagnosis in ALL patients for better prognostic assessment and should be taken in consideration in designing future therapeutic strategies based on patient-specific risk factors.","['Hagag, Adel A', 'Elmashad, Ghada M', 'Abd El-Bar, Enaam S']","['Hagag AA', 'Elmashad GM', 'Abd El-Bar ES']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.', 'Department of Pediatric, Faculty of Medicine, Elmenofia University, Elsadat, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,J Cancer Res Ther,Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,101249598,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*mortality', 'Prognosis']",,,2016/07/28 06:00,2017/02/14 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['JCanResTher_2016_12_2_627_148717 [pii]', '10.4103/0973-1482.148717 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Ther. 2016 Apr-Jun;12(2):627-33. doi: 10.4103/0973-1482.148717.,10.4103/0973-1482.148717 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(MRD). Flow cytometry (FCM) is an important tool in identifying aberrant phenotypes. Incidence of aberrant phenotypes varies considerably in independent studies and its association with prognostic factors is still debatable. AIM: To identify the prevalence of aberrant phenotypes on immunophenotyping in a large series of de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and to evaluate any association with initial clinical and hematological features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the current study, 303 patients of de novo ALL were included from the Department of Hematology, PGIMER, Chandigarh during the time period (July 2010 to June 2012). The immunophenotype of all cases of ALL was studied using FCM. RESULTS: Aberrant myeloid antigen expression was seen in 42.5% cases. Most frequent aberrant myeloid antigen was CD13 (32.2% cases), followed by CD33 (27.2% cases) and CD117 (18.5% cases). The expression of CD117 was relatively frequent in comparison to earlier reports which describe its rare expression. Adult T- ALL showed higher expression of CD33 and CD117 than pediatric T-ALL (P = 0.032 and 0.043, respectively). Myeloid antigen expression in ALL was associated with lower WBC count (P < 0.05) and lower number of peripheral blasts (P < 0.05). Expression of CD34 was higher in My + ALL group (P < 0.05) than My- ALL group. CONCLUSION: In summary, CD117 is a relatively frequently expressed myeloid marker contrary to earlier reports which describes its rare expression. Pediatric and adult ALL cases with low blast count and CD34 positivity are more likely to express aberrant myeloid markers. Current study also supports that myeloid antigen expression in both adult and pediatric ALL is not associated with adverse presenting clinical and biological features.","['Sharma, Manupriya', 'Sachdeva, Man Updesh Singh', 'Varma, Neelam', 'Varma, Subhash', 'Marwaha, R K']","['Sharma M', 'Sachdeva MU', 'Varma N', 'Varma S', 'Marwaha RK']","['Department of Pathology, Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College Kangra at Tanda (Himachal Pradesh); Department of Hematology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,J Cancer Res Ther,Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,101249598,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/analysis', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/analysis']",,,2016/07/28 06:00,2017/02/14 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['JCanResTher_2016_12_2_620_147716 [pii]', '10.4103/0973-1482.147716 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Ther. 2016 Apr-Jun;12(2):620-6. doi: 10.4103/0973-1482.147716.,10.4103/0973-1482.147716 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to oxidative stress, a state that has been observed in several hematopoietic malignancies, including acute and chronic myeloid leukemias. The importance of the association between oxidative stress and malignancy is not currently clear; however, there is evidence that tumor.derived ROS may promote cell survival, migration and metastasis, proliferation and even drug.resistance depending on the origin of the cancer. Increased oxidative stress in leukemic cells may represent a potential therapeutic target, although there are differing opinions on whether therapeutic strategies should aim to antagonize or further promote oxidative stress in leukemic cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of PL alone (5, 15, 30 muM) and in combination (30 mu M) with ALA (200 mu M) on Jurkat, NB4 and MEC1 leukemia cell lines were investigated through MTT, caspase-3 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activities. RESULTS: Inhibition of COX-2 and the induction of caspase.3 cleavage in Nb4 (acute promyelocytic leukemia) cells were found to be significant following PL application and synergistic effects with combination of ALA (inhibition of COX-2 as 23.74% and 3.55-fold increase of caspase-3).

At clinically achievable concentration of CYC202 (15 microM), combination therapy resulted in significant reduction in cell proliferation (IC50 = 3.67 +/- 0.80 microM, p < 0.05) compared with PXD101 alone (IC50 = 6.56 +/- 0.42 microM) in p53 wild-type A549 cells. Significant increase in apoptosis that occurred independently of cell cycle arrest was observed after concurrent treatment. This result was corroborated by greater formation of cleaved caspase-8, caspase-3 and PARP. Up-regulation of p53 and truncated BID protein levels was seen while Mcl-1 and XIAP protein levels were down-regulated upon combined treatment. Further analysis of apoptotic pathways revealed that caspase inhibitors, but not p53 silencing, significantly abrogated the cytotoxic enhancement.

PF-04449913 (PF-913) is a selective, small-molecule inhibitor of Smoothened, a membrane protein that regulates the Hedgehog pathway. However, details of the proof-of-concept and mechanism of action of PF-913 following administration to patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are unclear. This study examined the role of the Hedgehog signaling pathway in AML cells, and evaluated the in vitro and in vivo effects of the Smoothened inhibitor PF-913. In primary AML cells, activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway was more pronounced in CD34(+) cells than CD34(-) cells. In vitro treatment with PF-913 induced a decrease in the quiescent cell population accompanied by minimal cell death. In vivo treatment with PF-913 attenuated the leukemia-initiation potential of AML cells in a serial transplantation mouse model, while limiting reduction of tumor burden in a primary xenotransplant system. Comprehensive gene set enrichment analysis revealed that PF-913 modulated self-renewal signatures and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, PF-913 sensitized AML cells to cytosine arabinoside, and abrogated resistance to cytosine arabinoside in AML cells cocultured with HS-5 stromal cells. These findings imply that pharmacologic inhibition of Hedgehog signaling attenuates the leukemia-initiation potential, and also enhanced AML therapy by sensitizing dormant leukemia stem cells to chemotherapy and overcoming resistance in the bone marrow microenvironment.","['Fukushima, Nobuaki', 'Minami, Yosuke', 'Kakiuchi, Seiji', 'Kuwatsuka, Yachiyo', 'Hayakawa, Fumihiko', 'Jamieson, Catoriona', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Fukushima N', 'Minami Y', 'Kakiuchi S', 'Kuwatsuka Y', 'Hayakawa F', 'Jamieson C', 'Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Japan. minamiy@med.kobe-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Center for Advanced Medicine and Clinical Research, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160902,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Self Renewal/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Hedgehog', 'Smoothened', 'leukemia stem cells', 'self-renewal']",2016/10/30 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13019 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2016 Oct;107(10):1422-1429. doi: 10.1111/cas.13019.

A bone marrow study was performed, showing complete remission of chronic myeloid leukemia and numerous Leishmania amastigotes within the macrophages. He used pentavalent antimonials replaced by amphotericin B due to acute cardiac toxicity. After 3 months, imatinib was restarted, and he again showed adequate control of the disease. The last polymerase chain reaction assessment showed a deep molecular response.

When developing educational models, care teams should consider approaches that (a) objectively identify families in need of extensive teaching, (b) designate allotted teaching time by nursing staff during clinic visits, and (c) maintain the variation and dynamism that informs a successful provider-patient relationship.","['Kahn, Justine M', 'Athale, Uma H', 'Clavell, Luis A', 'Cole, Peter D', 'Leclerc, Jean-Marie', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Schorin, Marshall A', 'Welch, Jennifer J G', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Kelly, Kara M']","['Kahn JM', 'Athale UH', 'Clavell LA', 'Cole PD', 'Leclerc JM', 'Laverdiere C', 'Michon B', 'Schorin MA', 'Welch JJ', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB', 'Kelly KM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160725,United States,J Pediatr Health Care,Journal of pediatric health care : official publication of National Association of Pediatric Nurse Associates & Practitioners,8709735,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Boston', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Drug Dosage Calculations', 'Guideline Adherence/*statistics & numerical data', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Health Literacy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Medication Adherence/*statistics & numerical data', 'Nurse-Patient Relations', 'Parents/*education/psychology', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Pediatric', '*adherence', '*cancer care delivery', '*leukemia', '*patient education']",2016/07/28 06:00,2018/02/01 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/08 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0891-5245(16)30134-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pedhc.2016.06.004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Health Care. 2017 Jan - Feb;31(1):e1-e6. doi: 10.1016/j.pedhc.2016.06.004.

The functional significance of hypermethylation is well studied, but that of hypomethylation remains limited. Here, with paired expression and methylation samples gathered from a patient/control cohort, we attempt to better characterize the gene expression and methylation changes that take place in cancer from B cell chronic lymphocyte leukemia (B-CLL) samples. RESULTS: Across the dataset, we found that consistent differentially hypomethylated regions (C-DMRs) across samples were relatively few compared to the many poorly consistent hypo- and highly conserved hyper-DMRs. However, genes in the hypo-C-DMRs tended to be associated with functions antagonistic to those in the hyper-C-DMRs, like differentiation, cell-cycle regulation and proliferation, suggesting coordinated regulation of methylation changes. Hypo-C-DMRs in B-CLL were found enriched in key signaling pathways like B cell receptor and p53 pathways and genes/motifs essential for B lymphopoiesis. Hypo-C-DMRs tended to be proximal to genes with elevated expression in contrast to the transcription silencing-mechanism imposed by hypermethylation. Hypo-C-DMRs tended to be enriched in the regions of activating H4K4me1/2/3, H3K79me2, and H3K27ac histone modifications. In comparison, the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) signature, marked by EZH2, SUZ12, CTCF binding-sites, repressive H3K27me3 marks, and ""repressed/poised promoter"" states were associated with hyper-C-DMRs. Most hypo-C-DMRs were found in introns (36 %), 3' untranslated regions (29 %), and intergenic regions (24 %). Many of these genic regions also overlapped with enhancers. The methylation of CpGs from 3'UTR exons was found to have weak but positive correlation with gene expression. In contrast, methylation in the 5'UTR was negatively correlated with expression. To better characterize the overlap between methylation and expression changes, we identified correlation modules that associate with ""apoptosis"" and ""leukocyte activation"". CONCLUSIONS: Despite clinical heterogeneity in disease presentation, a number of methylation changes, both hypo and hyper, appear to be common in B-CLL. Hypomethylation appears to play an active, targeted, and complementary role in cancer progression, and it interplays with hypermethylation in a coordinated fashion in the cancer process.","['Kushwaha, Garima', 'Dozmorov, Mikhail', 'Wren, Jonathan D', 'Qiu, Jing', 'Shi, Huidong', 'Xu, Dong']","['Kushwaha G', 'Dozmorov M', 'Wren JD', 'Qiu J', 'Shi H', 'Xu D']","['Christopher S.

Since CRC comprises heterogeneous tumors with predominant hypoxic components, we investigated effects of an inhibitor of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (ABT-737) in combination with an mTOR inhibitor (AZD8055)-collectively referred to as combo-Rx, in hypoxic CRC cell lines. METHODS: Cell viability measures, expression of proteins implicated in apoptosis and MAPK/PI3K-AKT/mTOR pathway signaling, and profiling of composite kinase activities were undertaken in a panel of 14 cell lines. RESULTS: In hypoxic conditions, combo-Rx suppressed viability of 13 of the cell lines, albeit ABT-737 did not significantly potentiate the inhibitory effect of single-agent AZD8055 in six of the models. Hypoxic KRAS/PIK3CA-mutant HCT-116 and HCT-15 cell lines (both with low endogenous expression of the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein and showing augmented inhibition of viability following the addition of ABT-737 to AZD8055) responded to combo-Rx by induction of apoptosis but with the simultaneous strong Mcl-1 up-regulation and activation of MAPK/PI3K-conducted signaling. In contrast, in hypoxic KRAS-mutant LoVo (devoid of PIK3CA mutation), BRAF/PIK3CA-mutant RKO, and wild-type Colo320DM cell lines (all with high endogenous Mcl-1 expression and being resistant to the additional effect of ABT-737 to AZD8055), combo-Rx did not elicit apoptotic or pro-survival responses. CONCLUSIONS: The concurrent inhibition of anti-apoptotic proteins and mTOR-mediated signaling in hypoxic KRAS/PIK3CA-mutant CRC cell lines resulted in pro-survival responses in parallel with the intended anti-proliferative effects, a finding that should be of note if considering combinatory targeting of multiple pathways in this CRC entity.","['Risberg, Karianne', 'Redalen, Kathrine Roe', 'Sonstevold, Linda', 'Bjornetro, Tonje', 'Solvernes, Janne', 'Ree, Anne Hansen']","['Risberg K', 'Redalen KR', 'Sonstevold L', 'Bjornetro T', 'Solvernes J', 'Ree AH']","['Department of Oncology, Akershus University Hospital, 1478, Lorenskog, Norway.', 'Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Akershus University Hospital, 1478, Lorenskog, Norway.', 'Department of Oncology, Akershus University Hospital, 1478, Lorenskog, Norway.', 'Department of Oncology, Akershus University Hospital, 1478, Lorenskog, Norway.', 'Department of Oncology, Akershus University Hospital, 1478, Lorenskog, Norway.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, 0318, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Oncology, Akershus University Hospital, 1478, Lorenskog, Norway.', 'Department of Oncology, Akershus University Hospital, 1478, Lorenskog, Norway. a.h.ree@medisin.uio.no.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, 0318, Oslo, Norway. a.h.ree@medisin.uio.no.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160726,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '970JJ37FPW', '((5-(2,4-bis((3S)-3-methylmorpholin-4-yl)pyrido(2,3-d)pyrimidin-7-yl)-2-methoxyph', 'enyl)methanol)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Hypoxia', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ABT-737', '*AZD8055', '*Apoptosis', '*Colorectal cancer', '*Hypoxia', '*KRAS', '*Kinase activity', '*Mcl-1', '*PIK3CA']",2016/07/28 06:00,2017/10/03 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2015/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-016-2600-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-016-2600-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2016 Jul 26;16:531. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2600-y.,10.1186/s12885-016-2600-y [doi],,,,,PMC4962454,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CCY-1a-E2 was also shown to have efficacious antileukemic activity in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism of action of CCY1aE2 attributed to its anticancer effect remains poorly understood. In the present study, CCY1aE2 suppressed cell viability in multiple leukemia cell lines (HL60, K562, KG1 and KG1a) via inhibition of cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. CCY1aE2 exhibited a marked toxic effect on HL60 cells and displayed low cytotoxicity in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results from flow cytometric analysis indicated that CCY1aE2 promoted G2/M phase arrest and promoted apoptosis in the HL60 cells. CCY1aE2 treatment upregulated cyclin B, cyclindependent kinase 1 (CDK1), cell division cycle 25C (cdc25C) and p21 protein expression. CCY1aE2 caused apoptotic cell death and DNA fragmentation as determined by 4',6diamidino2phenylindole (DAPI) staining and DNA gel electrophoresis. Elevated activities of caspase8, 9 and 3 were observed during CCY1aE2induced cell apoptosis; their specific inhibitors were found to block CCY1aE2induced apoptosis, respectively. Moreover, CCY1aE2 timedependently disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), and it enhanced the protein levels of Fas/CD95, cytochrome c, Bax, cleaved PARP, as well as attenuated Bcl2 expression in the HL60 cells.

The aberration of apoptosis-related genes in CLL cells results in defective apoptosis of CLL cells in response to traditional therapeutic medicine. Plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1, 4-naphthoquinone), a natural compound from Plumbago zeylinica, has been shown to exhibit pro-apoptotic activities in tumor cells. In the present study, we report that plumbagin effectively inhibited CLL cell viability with a lower dose compared to fludarabine, and inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, plumbagin promoted accumulation of MEC-1 cells in the S phase, and blocked cell cycle transition of HG3 cells from G0/G1 to S phase. Molecularly, plumbagin markedly induced CLL cell apoptosis through reduction of Bcl-2, but through an increase in the Bax protein level.

TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL patients typically benefit from chemotherapy; however, many relapse and subsequently develop resistant disease with few effective treatment options. Mechanisms driving disease progression and therapy resistance have not been studied in TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL. Here, we aimed to identify novel treatment options for TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL by profiling leukemia cells from a relapsed patient, and determine molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis and progression. By drug-sensitivity testing of leukemic blasts from the index patient, control samples and TCF3-PBX1 positive and negative BCP-ALL cell lines, we identified the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase delta (p110delta) inhibitor idelalisib as an effective treatment for TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL. This was further supported by evidence showing TCF3-PBX1 directly regulates expression of PIK3CD, the gene encoding p110delta. Other somatic mutations to TP53 and MTOR, as well as aberrant expression of CXCR4, may influence additional drug sensitivities specific to the index patient and accompanied progression of the disease. Our results suggest that idelalisib is a promising treatment option for patients with TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL, whereas other drugs could be useful depending on the genetic context of individual patients.","['Eldfors, S', 'Kuusanmaki, H', 'Kontro, M', 'Majumder, M M', 'Parsons, A', 'Edgren, H', 'Pemovska, T', 'Kallioniemi, O', 'Wennerberg, K', 'Gokbuget, N', 'Burmeister, T', 'Porkka, K', 'Heckman, C A']","['Eldfors S', 'Kuusanmaki H', 'Kontro M', 'Majumder MM', 'Parsons A', 'Edgren H', 'Pemovska T', 'Kallioniemi O', 'Wennerberg K', 'Gokbuget N', 'Burmeister T', 'Porkka K', 'Heckman CA']","['Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Hematology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Hematology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'MediSapiens Ltd., Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Medicine II, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Charite Universtatsmedizin Berlin, Med.

Sphingolipids have a major impact on the determination of cell fate by contributing to either cell survival or death. Although ceramide and sphingosine are usually considered to induce cell death, S1P promotes survival of cells. Sphingosine kinases (SPHKs) are the enzymes that catalyze the conversion of sphingosine to S1P. There are two isoforms, SPHK1 and SPHK2, which are encoded by different genes. SPHK1 has recently been implicated in contributing to cell transformation, tumor angiogenesis and metastatic spread, as well as cancer cell multidrug-resistance. More recent findings suggest that SPHK2 also has a role in cancer progression. This review is an overview of our understanding of the role of SPHKs and S1P in hematopoietic malignancies and provides information on the current status of SPHK inhibitors with respect to their therapeutic potential in the treatment of hematological cancers.","['Evangelisti, C', 'Evangelisti, C', 'Buontempo, F', 'Lonetti, A', 'Orsini, E', 'Chiarini, F', 'Barata, J T', 'Pyne, S', 'Pyne, N J', 'Martelli, A M']","['Evangelisti C', 'Evangelisti C', 'Buontempo F', 'Lonetti A', 'Orsini E', 'Chiarini F', 'Barata JT', 'Pyne S', 'Pyne NJ', 'Martelli AM']","['Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council-Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute and Muscoloskeletal Cell Biology Laboratory, IOR, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council-Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute and Muscoloskeletal Cell Biology Laboratory, IOR, Bologna, Italy.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland, UK.', 'Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland, UK.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160727,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.91 (sphingosine kinase 2, human)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Lysophospholipids/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2016/11/03 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016208 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.208 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Nov;30(11):2142-2151. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.208.

Radio-detector high-performance liquid chromatography (radio-HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) showed two main radioactive peaks in plasma, unchanged quizartinib and mono-oxidative metabolite, AC886. Five additional metabolites in plasma were identified by LC-MS, but low levels prevented radio-HPLC detection. Although unchanged quizartinib was the main radioactive component in faeces (mean, 4.0% of administered dose), 15 metabolites representing a mean of 1.0-3.5% of administered dose were found. Quizartinib was predominantly metabolized by phase I biotransformations (oxidation, reduction, dealkylation, deamination, hydrolysis and combinations thereof). 4. This study indicated that quizartinib was rapidly and orally bioavailable, extensively metabolized, with AC886 as the major circulating metabolite, and predominantly eliminated in faeces.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed and constructed HOXA5-specific siRNA, and using liposomes we transfected Jurkat cells with this siRNA. The experiment was designed for three groups: (i) experimental group with Jurkat cells transfected with HOXA5-specific siRNA (siRNA transfection group), (ii) negative control group (irrelevant siRNA transfection) with Jurkat cells transfected with pRNAT-U6.1-siD and (iii) normal control group (untransfected Jurkat cells, only with equivalent amounts of cells and medium). We used FQ-PCR and Western blot to detect the relative expression levels of HOXA5 mRNA and protein in each group separately. The Western blot was also used to detect Livin and Smac protein levels in Jurkat cells. RESULTS: Expression levels of HOXA5 mRNA and protein were significantly reduced in the group with Jurkat cells transfected with HOXA5 siRNA (p<0.05). The expression of Livin protein was significantly down-regulated (p<0.05) while the expression of Smac protein was significantly up-regulated (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: HOXA5-specific siRNA effectively silenced the HOXA5 gene expression and down-regulation of HOXA5 induced the down-regulation of Livin protein expression and up-regulation of Smac protein. We suggest the HOXA5 gene to be considered as the new target for acute leukemia gene therapy.","['Yang, Y', 'Liu, W-J', 'Huang, H-P', 'Guo, Q-L']","['Yang Y', 'Liu WJ', 'Huang HP', 'Guo QL']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, China. lwjlyfy@sina.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BIRC7 protein, human)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (HOXA5 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Gene Silencing', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*genetics', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Transfection']",,,2016/07/28 06:00,2017/07/27 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2016 Jul;20(14):3101-11.,11184 [pii],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 38 patients, the TKI used was changed from imatinib to a second-generation TKI (nilotinib: 32; dasatinib: 6) for various reasons. We observed statistically significant (p < 0.05) amelioration in mean levels of sCrn and values of eGFR after only 1 month following the changes to second-generation TKIs. These results suggest that imatinib has adverse effects on renal function and that changes from imatinib to a second-generation TKI should be considered as a therapeutic option in cases of renal impairment due to imatinib.","['Hino, Akihisa', 'Yoshida, Hitoshi', 'Tada, Yuma', 'Koike, Midori', 'Minami, Ryota', 'Masaie, Hiroaki', 'Ishikawa, Jun']","['Hino A', 'Yoshida H', 'Tada Y', 'Koike M', 'Minami R', 'Masaie H', 'Ishikawa J']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases, 1-3-3 Nakamichi, Higashinari-ku, Osaka, 537-8511, Japan. hino-ak@mc.pref.osaka.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases, 1-3-3 Nakamichi, Higashinari-ku, Osaka, 537-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases, 1-3-3 Nakamichi, Higashinari-ku, Osaka, 537-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases, 1-3-3 Nakamichi, Higashinari-ku, Osaka, 537-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases, 1-3-3 Nakamichi, Higashinari-ku, Osaka, 537-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases, 1-3-3 Nakamichi, Higashinari-ku, Osaka, 537-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases, 1-3-3 Nakamichi, Higashinari-ku, Osaka, 537-8511, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160726,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'MU72812GK0 (Creatine)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Creatine/blood', 'Dasatinib/therapeutic use', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Renal Insufficiency/chemically induced']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myelogenous leukemia', '*Imatinib', '*Renal impairment']",2016/10/26 06:00,2017/03/24 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-016-2071-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-016-2071-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2016 Nov;104(5):605-611. doi: 10.1007/s12185-016-2071-6.

Pre-B ALL originates from a committed pre-B cell or an earlier progenitor, with potential to reprogram into other hematopoietic lineages. Here we report changes in lineage markers including myeloid conversion in patients following CD19 CAR therapy. Using murine ALL models we study the long-term effects of CD19 CAR-T cells and demonstrate partial or complete lineage switch as a consistent mechanism of CAR resistance depending on the underlying genetic oncogenic driver. Deletion of Pax5 or Ebf1 recapitulates lineage reprogramming occurring during CD19 CAR pressure. Our findings establish lineage switch as a mechanism of CAR resistance exposing inherent plasticity in genetic subtypes of pre-B-cell ALL.","['Jacoby, Elad', 'Nguyen, Sang M', 'Fountaine, Thomas J', 'Welp, Kathryn', 'Gryder, Berkley', 'Qin, Haiying', 'Yang, Yinmeng', 'Chien, Christopher D', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Lei, Haiyan', 'Song, Young K', 'Khan, Javed', 'Lee, Daniel W', 'Mackall, Crystal L', 'Gardner, Rebecca A', 'Jensen, Michael C', 'Shern, Jack F', 'Fry, Terry J']","['Jacoby E', 'Nguyen SM', 'Fountaine TJ', 'Welp K', 'Gryder B', 'Qin H', 'Yang Y', 'Chien CD', 'Seif AE', 'Lei H', 'Song YK', 'Khan J', 'Lee DW', 'Mackall CL', 'Gardner RA', 'Jensen MC', 'Shern JF', 'Fry TJ']","['Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'Genetics Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA."", 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'Genetics Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'Genetics Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', ""Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Seattle Children's Hospital, and Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98105, USA."", ""Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Seattle Children's Hospital, and Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98105, USA."", 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20160727,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Lineage', '*Cell Plasticity', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Editing', 'Genome', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Recurrence']",,,2016/07/28 06:00,2018/09/06 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms12320 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms12320 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2016 Jul 27;7:12320. doi: 10.1038/ncomms12320.,10.1038/ncomms12320 [doi],,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4871-5262'],,,PMC4974466,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our previous study, we showed that APP is highly expressed and regulates leukemia cell migration in AML1ETO-positive (AE) leukemia. Whether APP is involved in the regulation of AE leukemia cell proliferation or apoptosis is unclear. In the present study we focused on the correlation of APP with c-KIT mutation/overexpression and cell proliferation and apoptosis in AE leukemia. APP and c-KIT expression detected by quantitative real-time (qPCR) method, and c-KIT mutations screened using PCR in bone marrow cells from 65 patients with AE leukemia before their first chemotherapy, were simultaneously assessed. Furthermore, the Kasumi-1 cell line was chosen as the cell model, and the APP gene was knocked down using siRNA technology. The correlation of cell cycle distribution and apoptosis and c-Kit expression with APP expression levels, as well as the regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by APP were analyzed in the Kasumi-1 cell line. The results showed that peripheral white blood cell counts (P=0.008) and bone marrow cellularity (P=0.031), but not bone marrow blasts, were correlated with APP expression. Moreover, the patients with APP high expression had a significantly higher incidence of c-KIT mutations (P<0.001) and increased levels of c-KIT expression (P=0.001) and poorer disease outcome. In the Kasumi-1 cell line, as compared with the wild-type and negative control cells, cell apoptosis, both early (P<0.001) and late (P<0.001), was significantly increased when the APP gene was knocked down, concomitant with reduced levels of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and increased levels of caspase-3 and -9, however, no apparent change was observed in the cell cycle distribution (P>0.05). Moreover, the knockdown of APP markedly decreased c-KIT expression at both the transcription (as evidenced by qPCR analysis) and translation (as confirmed by CD117 assay and western blot analysis) levels, as well as p-AKT and its downstream targets including NF-kappaB, p53 and Bcl-2. In conclusion, APP may cooperate with c-KIT mutation/overexpression in the regulation of cell apoptosis but not proliferation in AE leukemia via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.","['Yu, Guopan', 'Yin, Changxin', 'Jiang, Ling', 'Zheng, Zhongxin', 'Wang, Zhixiang', 'Wang, Chunli', 'Zhou, Hongsheng', 'Jiang, Xuejie', 'Liu, Qifa', 'Meng, Fanyi']","['Yu G', 'Yin C', 'Jiang L', 'Zheng Z', 'Wang Z', 'Wang C', 'Zhou H', 'Jiang X', 'Liu Q', 'Meng F']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, P.R.

The FISH-IS approach evaluated by IFC enables the evaluation of tens to hundreds of thousands of cells in suspension and the analysis can be automated and standardized diminishing operator bias from the analysis. The high cell number throughput of FISH-IS improves the detection of rare events compared to conventional FISH.

Since 2006, BCR-ABL1 IS standardization is propagated along reference laboratories by calculating a laboratory-specific conversion factor (CF), co-ordinated in Europe through the European Treatment and Outcome Study project. Although this process has proven successful to some extent, it has not been achievable for all laboratories due to the complexity of the process and the stringent requirements in terms of numbers of samples to be exchanged. In addition, several BCR-ABL1 IS quantification methods and secondary reference materials became commercially available. However, it was observed that different IS methods generate consistently different results. METHODS: To overcome these difficulties, we have developed an alternative and simple approach of CF calculation, based on the retrospective analysis of existing external quality assessment (EQA) data. Our approach does not depend on the exchange of samples and is solely based on the mathematical CF calculation using EQA results. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated by thorough statistical validation that this approach performs well in converting BCR-ABL1 measurements to improve IS estimation.

However, NGS technology has provided a possibility to obtain a large amount of mutation data. We analyzed DNA samples from 20 childhood (cAML) and 20 adult AML (aAML) patients, using NGS targeted sequencing. The average coverage of high-quality sequences was 2981 x per amplicon. A total of 412 (207 cAML, 205 aAML) variants in the coding regions were detected; out of which, only 122 (62 cAML and 60 aAML) were potentially protein-changing. Our results confirmed that AML contains small number of genetic alterations (median 3 mutations/patient in both groups). The prevalence of the most frequent single gene AML associated mutations differed in cAML and aAML patient cohorts: IDH1 (0 % cAML, 5 % aAML), IDH2 (0 % cAML, 10 % aAML), NPM1 (10 % cAML, 35 % aAML). Additionally, potentially protein-changing variants were found in tyrosine kinase genes or genes encoding tyrosine kinase associated proteins (JAK3, ABL1, GNAQ, and EGFR) in cAML, while among aAML, the prevalence is directed towards variants in the methylation and histone modifying genes (IDH1, IDH2, and SMARCB1).

However, the rates of apoptosis induced by 2DG-ABT were lower in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-deficient cancer cells. The re-expression of VHL protein in these cells lowered IGF1R expression in a manner independent of oxygen concentration. Lowering IGF1R expression via small interfering RNA (siRNA) sensitized the cells to 2DG-ABT, suggesting that IGF1R interfered with the activation of apoptosis by the mitochondria. To determine which of the two pathways activated by IGF1R, the Ras-ERK pathway or the PI3K-AKT pathway, was involved in the impairment of mitochondria activation, the cells were treated with a specific inhibitor of either PI3K or ERK, and 2DG-ABT was added to activate the mitochondria. The apoptotic rates resulting from 2DG-ABT treatment were higher in the cells treated with the PI3K inhibitor, while the rates remained approximately the same in the cells treated with the ERK inhibitor. In 2DG-ABT-sensitive cells, a 4-h 2DG treatment caused the dissociation of Mcl-1 from Bak, while ABT treatment alone caused the dissociation of Bcl-xL from Bak without substantially reducing Mcl-1 levels. In 2DG-ABT-resistant cells, Mcl-1 dissociated from Bak only when AKT activity was inhibited during the 4-h 2DG treatment. Thus, in VHL-deficient cells, IGF1R activated AKT and stabilized the Bak-Mcl-1 complex, thereby conferring cell resistance to apoptosis.","['Yamaguchi, Ryuji', 'Harada, Hiroshi', 'Hirota, Kiichi']","['Yamaguchi R', 'Harada H', 'Hirota K']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Kansai Medical University, 2-5-1 Shinmachi, Hirakata, Osaka, 573-1010, Japan. rudy.yamaguchi@hushmail.com.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology and Image-applied Therapy, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PREST), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Saitama, 332-0012, Japan.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Kansai Medical University, 2-5-1 Shinmachi, Hirakata, Osaka, 573-1010, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160726,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (IGF1R protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Somatomedin)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/genetics/metabolism', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1', 'Receptors, Somatomedin/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein/*genetics', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['2-deoxyglucose', 'ABT-263', 'AKT', 'Apoptosis', 'ERK1/2', 'PI3K', 'Ras']",2016/07/28 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13277-016-5260-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-016-5260-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2016 Oct;37(10):13295-13306. doi: 10.1007/s13277-016-5260-2.

NanoString nCounter system is a novel probe-based gene expression platform capable of measuring up to 800 targets with advantages of reproducibility, accuracy, and sample type flexibility. To study the potential application of NanoString in leukemia at clinic, we used this technology to detect AML leukemogenic fusion transcripts and compared the performances with clinical molecular assays. METHODS: We developed a NanoString assay to detect seven leukemogenic fusion transcripts, namely RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (e5e12), PML-RARA (bcr1, bcr2, and bcr3), and CBFB-MYH11 (e5e12, e5e8, and e5e7). We set up the cut-off value for each fusion transcript and tested 42 de novo AML samples. We compared the results with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and TaqMan reverse quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR), the molecular methods standardly used at clinic. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the NanoString and RT-PCR results correlate well (P < 0.0001) and are highly concordant (95.2%). Using TaqMan RQ-PCR as a validation method and gold standard, we demonstrated superior accuracy and sensitivity of NanoString compared to RT-PCR and comparable specificity. Furthermore, we showed that NanoString is not as sensitive as TaqMan RQ-PCR in detecting very low level of fusion transcripts. CONCLUSIONS: NanoString can serve as a reliable and alternative molecular method to multiplexed RT-PCR for diagnosis of de novo AML with the perspective of screening/quantitation of a large number of leukemogenic fusion transcripts and prognostic genes. However, NanoString may not be an alternative method for monitoring minimal residual disease in AML.","['Hu, D', 'Zhou, W', 'Wang, F', 'Shu, S M', 'Fan, L L', 'He, J', 'Wang, P', 'He, Y L', 'Du, W', 'Zhang, J H', 'Duan, J X', 'Sun, L', 'Zheng, J', 'Li, X Q', 'Li, H Y', 'Feng, X L', 'Huang, S A']","['Hu D', 'Zhou W', 'Wang F', 'Shu SM', 'Fan LL', 'He J', 'Wang P', 'He YL', 'Du W', 'Zhang JH', 'Duan JX', 'Sun L', 'Zheng J', 'Li XQ', 'Li HY', 'Feng XL', 'Huang SA']","['Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Kindstar Diagnostics, Wuhan, China.', 'Kindstar Diagnostics, Wuhan, China.', 'Kindstar Diagnostics, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Kindstar Diagnostics, Wuhan, China.', 'Kindstar Diagnostics, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver Island Cancer Center, Victoria, BC, Canada.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160727,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Nanostring nCounter technology', '*leukemogenic fusion transcripts', '*minimal residual disease', '*molecular diagnosis']",2016/07/28 06:00,2017/02/28 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2016/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12555 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2016 Dec;38(6):663-673. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12555.

Additional chromosomal abnormalities are reported in only 23-43 % of cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report the case of a 46-year-old Syrian Alawis woman with acute promyelocytic leukemia with the typical t(15;17) translocation, but with a second clone presenting a t(1;2)(q42~43;q11.2~12) translocation as an additional abnormality. To the best of our knowledge, an association between these chromosomal abnormalities has not previously been described in the literature. Our patient started treatment with all-trans retinoic acid 10 days after diagnosis but died the same day of treatment initiation due to hemolysis, intracranial hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. CONCLUSION: The here reported combination of aberrations in a case of acute promyelocytic leukemia seems to indicate an adverse prognosis, and possibly shows that all-trans retinoic acid treatment may be contraindicated in such cases.","['Wafa, Abdulsamad', 'Moassass, Faten', 'Liehr, Thomas', 'Al-Ablog, Ayman', 'Al-Achkar, Walid']","['Wafa A', 'Moassass F', 'Liehr T', 'Al-Ablog A', 'Al-Achkar W']","['Human Genetics Division, Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, PO Box 6091, Damascus, Syria.', 'Human Genetics Division, Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, PO Box 6091, Damascus, Syria.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Kollegiengasse 10, D-07743, Jena, Germany.', 'Human Genetics Division, Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, PO Box 6091, Damascus, Syria.', 'Human Genetics Division, Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, PO Box 6091, Damascus, Syria. ascientific@aec.org.sy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160726,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/*genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Syria', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)', '*All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)', '*Prognostic factors', '*t(1;2)']",2016/07/28 06:00,2017/05/18 06:00,['2016/07/28 06:00'],"['2015/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-016-0982-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-016-0982-8 [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2016 Jul 26;10:203. doi: 10.1186/s13256-016-0982-8.,10.1186/s13256-016-0982-8 [doi],,,,,PMC4962467,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The prospective study enrolled 72 patients (37 men and 35 women; mean age, 47 years) with hemoblastosis that was complicated by the development of one of the following forms of PI: abscess, infiltrate, multiple ulcers. Different clinical and laboratory characteristics of the patients were examined to identify risk factors for PI. The species-specific concordance of microorganisms isolated from the anus and blood in the development of PI was assessed to record the latter as a source of sepsis. Treatment policy was defined according to the clinical form of PI. RESULTS: Acute myeloid leukemias and lymphomas were the most common background diseases in 30 (41.7%) and 22 (30.6%) patients, respectively. During induction chemotherapy cycles, perianal tissue infection occurred twice more frequently (66%) than totally at the onset of hemoblastosis (13%) and after achievement of remission (during consolidation and maintenance therapy) (21%; Fisher's exact test; p=0.01). PI in agranulocytosis was more than twice as common as in its absence: 69.4% vs 30.6% (p=0.01) and was responsible for sepsis in 9 (18%) of 50 patients. The main source of perianal tissue infection in patients with granulocytopenia was anal fissures and fistulas and ulcers of the anal canal: 44 (88%) cases of the 50 cases. In PI as an abscess, the average white blood cell count was 5 times higher (p=0.01) than that in PI as an infiltrate (or multiple ulcers): 6.6.109/l and 1.2.109 g/l. Abscess formation was observed in 16 (22.2%) patients and an indication for surgical drain. The inflammatory infiltrate was found to develop in 48 (66.7%) patients; multiple ulcers were seen in 8 (11.1%); in this group, parenteral antimicrobial therapy proved to be effective in 36 (78%) patients. 29 patients were operated on for anal fissures and fistulas at intercycle intervals. After continuing CT, PI recurrences were observed in 4 (9.1%) patients. In the operated versus medically treated patients, the risk of complications associated with abnormalities in the perianal area during continued CT was 5 times statistically significantly lower (odds ratio=0.2; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 0.5; p=0.04; Cochran-Mantel test). CONCLUSION: Induction CT cycles, the status of granulocytopenia, and the presence of infection sources in the anal canal as an anal fissure, skin ulcerations, or a fistula should be considered as independent statistically significant prognostic risk factors for PI. The number of granulocytes determines the form of inflammation, the course of infection, and the chance of developing sepsis. The effective prevention encompassing surgical treatment for anal canal diseases reduces the risk of septic complications and the number of paraproctitis recurrences, contributing to the implementation of a planned CT program in patients with hemoblastosis.","['Shtyrkova, S V', 'Klyasova, G A', 'Ntanishyan, K I', 'Gemdzhian, E G', 'Troitskaya, V V', 'Karagyulyan, S R']","['Shtyrkova SV', 'Klyasova GA', 'Ntanishyan KI', 'Gemdzhian EG', 'Troitskaya VV', 'Karagyulyan SR']","['National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russian Federation.']",['rus'],['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,,IM,"['Abscess/*etiology/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Adult', 'Agranulocytosis/*complications', 'Anus Diseases/*etiology/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Fissure in Ano/etiology/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Lymphoma/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rectal Fistula/etiology/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis/*etiology/prevention & control']",,,2016/07/28 06:00,2017/01/04 06:00,['2016/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.17116/terarkh201688772-77 [doi]'],ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2016;88(7):72-77. doi: 10.17116/terarkh201688772-77.,10.17116/terarkh201688772-77 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Perianal'naya infektsiya u bol'nykh gemoblastozami: faktory riska i vozmozhnosti profilaktiki.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The data of 57 AML patients aged 20 to 79 years were analyzed. The methylation status of the genes was studied by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The signs of the AM of >/=1 gene were detected in 52 (91.2%) of the 57 patients. The most common finding was AM of simultaneously 2 or 3 genes: in 29.8 and 21.1% of the patients, respectively. Concurrent methylation of 3-5 genes proved to be a more frequent finding in AML patients with myelodysplasia: in 7 (70%) of 10 patients. The proportion of patients with methylation of 5 genes was considerably higher in a group of patients with a complex karyotype: 50% versus 8.3% among other patients (odds ratio: 11.0; 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 61.6; p=0.01). There were no differences in the median overall and relapse-free survival rates in patients with a normal karyotype and without FLT3 and NPM mutations, who received induction therapy, in relation to the number of genes with AM. CONCLUSION: AM of the p15NK4b and SOX7 genes and Wnt signaling pathway antagonists is detected in the majority of patients with AML, which allows hypomethylating agents to be recommended for the treatment of patients who cannot use intensive cytostatic therapy for different reasons. The detection of a large number of genes with the aberrant methylation status in most AML patients with myelodysplasia or a complex karyotype serves as the basis for initiating trials to evaluate the efficiency of a combination of 5-azacytidine and cytostatics.","['Kostroma, I I', 'Gritsaev, S V', 'Sidorova, Zh Yu', 'Tiranova, S A', 'Svitina, S P', 'Drizhun, Yu S', 'Chubukina, Zh V', 'Martynkevich, I S', 'Kapustin, S I', 'Bessmeltsev, S S']","['Kostroma II', 'Gritsaev SV', 'Sidorova ZY', 'Tiranova SA', 'Svitina SP', 'Drizhun YS', 'Chubukina ZV', 'Martynkevich IS', 'Kapustin SI', 'Bessmeltsev SS']","['Russian Research Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology, Federal Biomedical Agency of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Russian Research Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology, Federal Biomedical Agency of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Russian Research Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology, Federal Biomedical Agency of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Russian Research Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology, Federal Biomedical Agency of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Russian Research Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology, Federal Biomedical Agency of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Russian Research Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology, Federal Biomedical Agency of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Russian Research Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology, Federal Biomedical Agency of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Russian Research Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology, Federal Biomedical Agency of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Russian Research Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology, Federal Biomedical Agency of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Russian Research Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology, Federal Biomedical Agency of Russia, Moscow, Russia.']",['rus'],['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (SOX7 protein, human)', '0 (SOXF Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'SOXF Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/07/28 06:00,2017/01/04 06:00,['2016/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.17116/terarkh201688731-36 [doi]'],ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2016;88(7):31-36. doi: 10.17116/terarkh201688731-36.,10.17116/terarkh201688731-36 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aberrantnoe metilirovanie promotornykh oblastei genov SOX7, p15INK4b i antagonistov signal'nogo puti Wnt u bol'nykh ostrymi mieloidnymi leikozami.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The protocol covered 298 patients (137 women (including 13 pregnant women) and 161 men) aged 15 to 55 years (median age 28 years) with Ph-negative ALL. The phenotype was unknown in 6 patients. Three (1%) were ascertained to have a biphenotypic variant. 182 (62.4%) patients were found to have B-cell ALL (early pre-B ALL (n=51); common ALL (n=92), and pre-B ALL (n=39); 107 (36.6%) patients had T-cell ALL (early T-ALL (n=56); thymic T-ALL (n=41), and mature T-ALL (n=10). According to the baseline clinical and laboratory parameters (leukocytosis of 30.109/l and more for B-ALL; and that of 100.109/l and more for T-ALL; phenotype capital VE, Cyrillic-I for B-ALL, phenotype capital TE, Cyrillic-I-II-IV for T-ALL; LDH activity was more than twice the normal values; the presence of translocation t(4;11)), the high-risk group included most patients with B-ALL (n=110 (72.8%)) and T-ALL (n=76 (76%)). Thirty-five patients with T-ALL underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Allogeneic BMT was performed in 18 (7%) of the 258 patients who had undergone an induction phase. RESULTS: Five-year overall survival for all the patients included in the investigation was 59%; relapse-free survival was 65%, which was significantly different in the patients with B-ALL and in those with T-ALL: the overall survival rates were 53.3 and 67.5% (p=0.1); the relapse-free survival was 56 and 79% (p=0.005), respectively. Multivariate analysis including the well-known RFs demonstrated that the latter for T-ALL were of no independent prognostic value and only the patient's age was identified for B-ALL (p=0.013). CONCLUSION: A lower chemotherapeutic load and a small number of allogeneic BMTs did not affect total positive treatment results in adult patients with ALL, by complying with the principle achieving the continuity of cytostatic effects and by preserving the total cytostatic loading dose. The results of the Russian investigation casts some doubt on the necessity of using very intensive consolidation cycles and performing a large number of allogeneic BMTs in adult patients with ALL.","['Parovichnikova, E N', 'Sokolov, A N', 'Troitskaya, V V', 'Klyasova, G A', 'Rusinov, M A', 'Akhmerzaeva, Z Kh', 'Kuzmina, L A', 'Bondarenko, S N', 'Baranova, O Yu', 'Kaporskaya, T S', 'Zotina, E N', 'Zinina, E E', 'Samoilova, O S', 'Gavrilova, L V', 'Kaplanov, K D', 'Konstantinova, T S', 'Lapin, V A', 'Kravchenko, S K', 'Gribanova, E O', 'Zvonkov, E E', 'Gavrilina, O A', 'Baskhaeva, G A', 'Galstyan, G M', 'Obukhova, T N', 'Galtseva, I V', 'Kulikov, S M', 'Savchenko, V G']","['Parovichnikova EN', 'Sokolov AN', 'Troitskaya VV', 'Klyasova GA', 'Rusinov MA', 'Akhmerzaeva ZK', 'Kuzmina LA', 'Bondarenko SN', 'Baranova OY', 'Kaporskaya TS', 'Zotina EN', 'Zinina EE', 'Samoilova OS', 'Gavrilova LV', 'Kaplanov KD', 'Konstantinova TS', 'Lapin VA', 'Kravchenko SK', 'Gribanova EO', 'Zvonkov EE', 'Gavrilina OA', 'Baskhaeva GA', 'Galstyan GM', 'Obukhova TN', 'Galtseva IV', 'Kulikov SM', 'Savchenko VG']","['National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Research Institute of Pediatric Hematology and Transplantology, I.P.

HDAC8, a class I HDAC family member, has been shown to have low deacetylation activity compared to other HDACs in vitro. Recent studies showed that several sirtuins, with low deacetylase activities, can actually hydrolyze other acyl lysine modifications more efficiently. Inspired by this, we tested the activity of HDAC8 using a variety of different acyl lysine peptides. Screening a panel of peptides with different acyl lysine modifications, we found that HDAC8 can catalyze the removal of acyl groups with 2-16 carbons from lysine 9 of the histone H3 peptide (H3K9). Interestingly, the catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) of HDAC8 on octanoyl, dodecanoyl, and myristoyl lysine are several-fold better than that on acetyl lysine. The increased catalytic efficiencies of HDAC8 on larger fatty acyl groups are due to the much lower Km values. T-cell leukemia Jurkat cells treated with a HDAC8 specific inhibitor, PCI-34051, exhibited an increase in global fatty acylation compared to control treatment. Thus, the de-fatty-acylation activity of HDAC8 is likely physiologically relevant. This is the first report of a zinc-dependent HDAC with de-fatty-acylation activity, and identification of HDAC8 de-fatty-acylation targets will help to further understand the function of HDAC8 and protein lysine fatty acylation.","['Aramsangtienchai, Pornpun', 'Spiegelman, Nicole A', 'He, Bin', 'Miller, Seth P', 'Dai, Lunzhi', 'Zhao, Yingming', 'Lin, Hening']","['Aramsangtienchai P', 'Spiegelman NA', 'He B', 'Miller SP', 'Dai L', 'Zhao Y', 'Lin H']","['Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University , Ithaca, New York 14853, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University , Ithaca, New York 14853, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University , Ithaca, New York 14853, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University , Ithaca, New York 14853, United States.', 'Ben May Department of Cancer Research, The University of Chicago , Chicago, Illinois 60637, United States.', 'Ben May Department of Cancer Research, The University of Chicago , Chicago, Illinois 60637, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University , Ithaca, New York 14853, United States.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Cornell University , Ithaca, New York 14853, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160805,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biocatalysis', 'Fatty Acids/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']",,,2016/10/22 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2016/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acschembio.6b00396 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2016 Oct 21;11(10):2685-2692. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.6b00396.

The genes encoding TET2, IDH1 and IDH2 are among the most commonly mutated genes, and cause defective conversion of 5-methylcytosine into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), impairing demethylation of DNA, and presumably serving as driver mutations in leukaemogenesis. The aim of this study was to correlate 5hmC immunohistochemical loss with the mutation status of genes involved in epigenetic pathways in AML. METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining with an anti-5hmC antibody was performed on 41 decalcified, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) bone marrow biopsies from patients with AML. Archived DNA was subjected to next-generation sequencing for analysis of a panel of genes, including TET2, IDH1, IDH2, WT1 and DNMT3A. TET2, IDH1, IDH2, WT1 and DNMT3A mutations were found in 46% (19/41) of the cases. Ten of 15 cases (67%) with TET2, IDH1, IDH2 or WT1 mutations showed deficient 5hmC staining, whereas nine of 26 cases (35%) without a mutation in these genes showed loss of 5hmC. It is of note that all four cases with TET2 mutations showed deficient 5hmC staining. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, somatic mutations in TET2, IDH1, IDH2, WT1 and DNMT3A were common in our cohort of AML cases. Immunohistochemical staining for 5hmC was lost in the majority of cases harbouring mutations in these genes, reflecting the proposed relationship between dysfunctional epigenetic pathways and leukaemogenesis.","['Magotra, Minoti', 'Sakhdari, Ali', 'Lee, Paul J', 'Tomaszewicz, Keith', 'Dresser, Karen', 'Hutchinson, Lloyd M', 'Woda, Bruce A', 'Chen, Benjamin J']","['Magotra M', 'Sakhdari A', 'Lee PJ', 'Tomaszewicz K', 'Dresser K', 'Hutchinson LM', 'Woda BA', 'Chen BJ']","['Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center and University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center and University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center and University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center and University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center and University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center and University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center and University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center and University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",20160923,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '1123-95-1 (5-hydroxymethylcytosine)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)']",IM,"['5-Methylcytosine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'History, 17th Century', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation']",['NOTNLM'],"['IDH', '5-hydroxymethylcytosine', 'TET2', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'epigenetics', 'immunohistochemistry']",2016/07/28 06:00,2017/06/14 06:00,['2016/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/his.13046 [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2016 Dec;69(6):1055-1065. doi: 10.1111/his.13046.

We studied a panel of fifteen T-ALL and fifteen T-LL because of their cell surface expression of the CD3-TcR molecules. The results indicated that TcR gammadelta is more frequently expressed in T-ALL (10 out of the 15 patients tested) than TcR alphabeta. This is in contrast to the results obtained with T-LL where the vast majority showed TcR alphabeta (13 out of the 15 patients). We discuss the significance of these findings which may imply that the leukemic cells are of a different origin in these two diseases. In addition analysis of TcR variable regions expressed by the leukemic blasts showed that in most cases they had rearranged functional Vdelta1 gene to Jdelta1 or Jdelta2 segments (8 out of 11 patients) whereas in a unique case Vdelta2 gene segment was evident. Taken together these results and those showing that T-ALL cells coexpress the CD1a, b and c molecules strengthen the possibility that despite the fact that these leukemic cells express the CD3-TcR complex at their surface their normal counterparts are not found in peripheral blood.","['Boumsell, L', 'Gouttefangeas, C', 'Dastot, H', 'Schmid, M', 'Gelin, C', 'Bensussan, A']","['Boumsell L', 'Gouttefangeas C', 'Dastot H', 'Schmid M', 'Gelin C', 'Bensussan A']","['a INSERM U93, Institut de Recherche sur les Maladies du Sang,@ Hopital Saint-Louis, 75475, Paris Cedex, France, 10.', 'a INSERM U93, Institut de Recherche sur les Maladies du Sang,@ Hopital Saint-Louis, 75475, Paris Cedex, France, 10.', 'a INSERM U93, Institut de Recherche sur les Maladies du Sang,@ Hopital Saint-Louis, 75475, Paris Cedex, France, 10.', 'a INSERM U93, Institut de Recherche sur les Maladies du Sang,@ Hopital Saint-Louis, 75475, Paris Cedex, France, 10.', 'a INSERM U93, Institut de Recherche sur les Maladies du Sang,@ Hopital Saint-Louis, 75475, Paris Cedex, France, 10.', 'a INSERM U93, Institut de Recherche sur les Maladies du Sang,@ Hopital Saint-Louis, 75475, Paris Cedex, France, 10.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD3', 'T-ALL', 'TCR', 'or Lymphoblastic lymphoma']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109068064 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;4(3):187-92. doi: 10.3109/10428199109068064.,10.3109/10428199109068064 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Higher platelet and leukocyte counts were related to hemorrhage (H and TH), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin times and high LDH levels to H while elevated FDP levels were more frequently linked to T. Increased spontaneous platelet aggregation (SPA) was noted in 80.3% of the entire group, independent of whether there was a tendency for thrombohemorrhagic events or not. Bleeding time, as measured by the Duke method, and hemoglobin levels were not different in the various subgroups. Transformation occurred in 11 patients (1.9% per year); seven developed acute leukemia (myeloblastic 4, lymphoblastic 2, megakaryoblastic 1) at a rate of 1.2% per year; and 4 developed other types of chronic myeloproliferative disorders. Nineteen patients died (3.3% per year), six from leukemia (32%), 4 from bleeding (21%) and 9 from unrelated diseases (47%). Survival was estimated to be 65% at ten years, and was significantly longer in females, younger individuals, and the groups with lower leukocyte counts, but did not differ between the subgroups when platelet count and hemoglobin level were considered. Survival was similar in patients with platelet counts between 700-1000 x 10(9)/L and in those with an even higher platelet count. These findings suggest that (1) young female patients with low leukocyte counts may survive longer, (2) SPA is not indicative of either a thrombotic or an hemorrhagic tendency and (3) the limit of the platelet count for establishing the diagnosis of this disorder could perhaps be lowered to 700 x 10(9)/L.","['Hattori, A', 'Nagayama, R', 'Kishi, K', 'Fuse, I', 'Hanano, M', 'Takizawa, S', 'Takeshige, T', 'Shibata, A']","['Hattori A', 'Nagayama R', 'Kishi K', 'Fuse I', 'Hanano M', 'Takizawa S', 'Takeshige T', 'Shibata A']","['a The First Department of Internal Medicine, Niigata University School of Medicine, Niigata, Japan.', 'a The First Department of Internal Medicine, Niigata University School of Medicine, Niigata, Japan.', 'a The First Department of Internal Medicine, Niigata University School of Medicine, Niigata, Japan.', 'a The First Department of Internal Medicine, Niigata University School of Medicine, Niigata, Japan.', 'a The First Department of Internal Medicine, Niigata University School of Medicine, Niigata, Japan.', 'a The First Department of Internal Medicine, Niigata University School of Medicine, Niigata, Japan.', 'a The First Department of Internal Medicine, Niigata University School of Medicine, Niigata, Japan.', 'a The First Department of Internal Medicine, Niigata University School of Medicine, Niigata, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Primary thrombocythemia', 'hemorrhage', 'leukemic transformation', 'survival', 'thrombosis']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199109068063 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1991;4(3):177-86. doi: 10.3109/10428199109068063.,10.3109/10428199109068063 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This GEF increases active Ras as it catalyzes the removal of GDP from Ras so that GTP can bind and activate Ras. This study aims to study the mechanism of action of Rasgrf-1 in B-cell malignancies. METHODS: N-terminus truncated Rasgrf-1 variants have a higher GEF activity as compared to the full-length transcript therefore a MCL cell line with stable over-expression of truncated Rasgrf-1 was established. The B-cell receptor (BCR) and chemokine signaling pathways were compared in the Rasgrf-1 over-expressing and a control transfected cell line. RESULTS: Cells over-expressing truncated form of Rasgrf-1 have a higher proliferative rate as compared to control transfected cells. BCR was activated by lower concentrations of anti-IgM antibody in Rasgrf-1 over-expressing cells as compared to control cells indicating that these cells are more sensitive to BCR signaling. BCR signaling also phosphorylates Rasgrf-1 that further increases its GEF function and amplifies BCR signaling. This activation of Rasgrf-1 in over-expressing cells resulted in a higher expression of phospho-ERK, AKT, BTK and PKC-alpha as compared to control cells. Besides BCR, Rasgrf-1 over-expressing cells were also more sensitive to microenvironment stimuli as determined by resistance to apoptosis, chemotaxis and ERK pathway activation. CONCLUSIONS: This GEF protein sensitizes B-cells to BCR and chemokine mediated signaling and also upregulates a number of other signaling pathways which promotes growth and survival of these cells.","['Liao, Wei', 'Sharma, Sanjai']","['Liao W', 'Sharma S']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Greater Los Angeles VA Healthcare Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90073, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Greater Los Angeles VA Healthcare Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90073, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Cancer Biol Med,Cancer biology & medicine,101588850,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell malignancies', 'B-cell receptor', 'ERK pathway', 'Rasgrf-1', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'guanine exchange factor', 'mantle cell lymphoma']",2016/07/28 06:00,2016/07/28 06:01,['2016/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2016.0026 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Med. 2016 Jun;13(2):277-85. doi: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2016.0026.,10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2016.0026 [doi],,,,,PMC4944547,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accumulating evidence shows the bone marrow (BM) niche is critical to the maintenance and retention of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), including leukemia stem cells (LSC), and an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that crosstalk between LSC and the stromal cells associated with this niche greatly influences leukemia initiation, progression, and response to therapy. Undeniably, stromal cells in the BM niche provide a sanctuary in which LSC can acquire a drug-resistant phenotype and thereby evade chemotherapy-induced death. Yin and Yang, the ancient Chinese philosophical concept, vividly portrays the intricate and dynamic interactions between LSC and the BM niche. In fact, LSC-induced microenvironmental reprogramming contributes significantly to leukemogenesis. Thus, identifying the critical signaling pathways involved in these interactions will contribute to target optimization and combinatorial drug treatment strategies to overcome acquired drug resistance and prevent relapse following therapy. In this review, we describe some of the critical signaling pathways mediating BM niche-LSC interaction, including SDF1/CXCL12, Wnt/beta-catenin, VCAM/VLA-4/NF-kappaB, CD44, and hypoxia as a newly-recognized physical determinant of resistance, and outline therapeutic strategies for overcoming these resistance factors.","['Zhou, Hong-Sheng', 'Carter, Bing Z', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Zhou HS', 'Carter BZ', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Cancer Biol Med,Cancer biology & medicine,101588850,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow niche', 'Yin and Yang', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'leukemia stem cell']",2016/07/28 06:00,2016/07/28 06:01,['2016/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2016.0023 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Med. 2016 Jun;13(2):248-59. doi: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2016.0023.,10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2016.0023 [doi],,,,,PMC4944541,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FLT3 inhibitors display promising results in a clinical setting, but patients relapse after short-term treatment due to the development of resistant disease. Therefore, a better understanding of FLT3 downstream signal transduction pathways will help to identify an alternative target for the treatment of AML patients carrying oncogenic FLT3. Activation of FLT3 results in phosphorylation of FLT3 on several tyrosine residues that recruit SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins. We screened a panel of SH2 domain-containing proteins and identified SLAP2 as a potent interacting partner of FLT3. We demonstrated that interaction occurs when FLT3 is activated, and also, an intact SH2 domain of SLAP2 is required for binding. SLAP2 binding sites in FLT3 mainly overlap with those of SRC. SLAP2 over expression in murine proB cells or myeloid cells inhibited oncogenic FLT3-ITD-mediated cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro, and tumor formation in vivo. Microarray analysis suggests that higher SLAP2 expression correlates with a gene signature similar to that of loss of oncogene function. Furthermore, FLT3-ITD positive AML patients with higher SLAP2 expression displayed better prognosis compared to those with lower expression of SLAP2. Expression of SLAP2 blocked FLT3 downstream signaling cascades including AKT, ERK, p38 and STAT5. Finally, SLAP2 accelerated FLT3 degradation through enhanced ubiquitination. Collectively, our data suggest that SLAP2 acts as a negative regulator of FLT3 signaling and therefore, modulation of SLAP2 expression levels may provide an alternative therapeutic approach for FLT3-ITD positive AML.","['Moharram, Sausan A', 'Chougule, Rohit A', 'Su, Xianwei', 'Li, Tianfeng', 'Sun, Jianmin', 'Zhao, Hui', 'Ronnstrand, Lars', 'Kazi, Julhash U']","['Moharram SA', 'Chougule RA', 'Su X', 'Li T', 'Sun J', 'Zhao H', 'Ronnstrand L', 'Kazi JU']","['Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, P.

Recently, many studies showed both a high incidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and high levels of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)(Treg cells) in children with B-ALL. In our study, we investigated the possible relationship between EBV infection and the onset of B-ALL, and its relation to expression of CD4(+), CD25(high+)Foxp3+ T regulatory cells. SUBJECT AND METHODS: We analysed expression and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of Treg cells in peripheral blood of 45 children with B-ALL and in 40 apparently healthy children as a control, using flow cytometry. Serum anti-EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG, anti-EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) IgG (for latent infection) and anti-EBV VCA IgM (for acute infection) were investigated using ELISA. RESULTS: Analysis of the Treg cells population in patients and controls revealed that expression of CD4(+) CD25(high+) T lymphocytes was higher in patients than in controls (mean+/-SD 15.7+/-4.1 and 10.61+/-2.6 in patients and controls, respectively, and MFI of Foxp3 was 30.1+/-7.1 and 16.7+/-3.7 in patients and controls, respectively (p<0.001)). There was a high incidence of latent EBV infection in patients (31%) compared with controls (10%) while the incidence of acute infection was 12% in patients and 0% in the control group. To study the role of latent EBV infection in the pathogenesis of acute B-ALL, OR was calculated (OR=4.06, coefficient index 1.2-13.6). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a possible role for Treg cells and EBV in the pathogenesis of B-ALL. Further studies are needed on the possible mechanisms of tumour genesis related to Treg cells and EBV in children with B-ALL.","['Ateyah, Mohamed E', 'Hashem, Mona E', 'Abdelsalam, Mohamed']","['Ateyah ME', 'Hashem ME', 'Abdelsalam M']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Sharkia, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Sharkia, Egypt.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Sharkia, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160725,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,['0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)'],IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Egypt', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/immunology', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/pathology/virology']",['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'EBV', 'LEUKAEMIA']",2016/07/28 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2016/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['jclinpath-2016-203803 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2016-203803 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2017 Feb;70(2):120-125. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2016-203803.

Recently, increased expression of CREB was frequently found in various tumors, indicating that CREB is implicated in the process of tumorigenesis. However, the effects of CREB on Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) remain unknown. To clarify the role of CREB in HL, we performed knockdown experiments in HL. We found that downregulation of CREB by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) resulted in enhancement of cell proliferation and promotion of G1/S phase transition, and these effects can be rescued by expression of shRNA-resistant CREB. Meanwhile, the expression level of cell cycle-related proteins, such as cyclin D1, cyclin E1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), and CDK4, was elevated in response to depletion of CREB. Furthermore, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and confirmed that CREB directly bound to the promoter regions of these genes, which consequently contributed to the regulation of cell cycle. Consistent with our results, a clinical database showed that high expression of CREB correlates with favorable prognosis in B-cell lymphoma patients, which is totally different from the function of CREB in other cancers such as colorectal cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and some endocrine cancers. Taken together, all of these features of CREB in HL strongly support its role as a tumor suppressor gene that can decelerate cell proliferation by inhibiting the expression of several cell cycle-related genes. Our results provide new evidence for prognosis prediction of HL and a promising therapeutic strategy for HL patients.","['Lu, Fangjin', 'Zheng, Ying', 'Donkor, Paul Owusu', 'Zou, Peng', 'Mu, Ping']","['Lu F', 'Zheng Y', 'Donkor PO', 'Zou P', 'Mu P']","['Tianjin State Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hodgkin Disease/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Position-Specific Scoring Matrices', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA Interference']",,,2016/07/28 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00,['2016/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3727/096504016X14634208142987 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2016;24(3):171-9. doi: 10.3727/096504016X14634208142987.,10.3727/096504016X14634208142987 [doi],,,,,PMC7838744,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we decided to investigate the effects and mechanisms of HPIP in HNSCC. Our results demonstrated that HPIP is highly expressed in human HNSCC cell lines and provides the first evidence that knockdown of HPIP obviously inhibits proliferation and migration/invasion in HNSCC cells in vitro, as well as inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, knockdown of HPIP significantly inhibits the expression of p-PI3K and p-Akt in human HNSCC cells. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that knockdown of HPIP significantly inhibits the proliferation and migration/invasion of HNSCC cells by suppressing the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

Only studies reporting complete results were included. We assessed study quality using the QUADAS-2 tool. For each study, we extracted informations regarding study population, technical details about sample preparation, data analysis, and results. Twenty-seven studies were included. A great heterogeneity regarding study populations and analytical procedures was observed among studies. Percentages of samples giving a positive result with both FCM and CM range from 0.3% to 42.9% among studies, whereas double negative samples go from 0% to 96.3%. Samples with positive FCM but negative CM are reported by 89% (24/27) of the studies with rates ranging from 3.5% to 61.5% of total specimens. On the contrary, samples with positive CM and negative FCM are found in 48% (13/27) of the studies with percentages ranging from 0.5% to 10%.
