Ten patients had undergone autologous BMT (six of them peripheral blood stem cell transplantation) and 10 allogeneic BMT. A total of 60 samples were examined by two different protocols. Of the eight patients studied just before conditioning, five showed PML-RAR alpha transcript prior to transplantation. Three of them were in CR and became PCR negative early post-transplantation. The other two patients, that were not in CR before transplant, remained PCR positive, relapsed early post-transplant and died. In the remaining patients no PML-RAR alpha transcripts were visible throughout their post-BMT courses. Our data show that long-term remission after BMT in APL patients is associated with eradication of cells carrying the PML-RAR alpha transcript, and that continued positivity of this test predicts subsequent relapse. The fact of the disappearance of PML-RAR alpha transcript early after BMT in patients previously positive suggest that transplant is capable of curing APL mainly through antileukemic action of the conditioning regimen and therefore, transplantation must be indicated in CR patients if a positive RT-PCR remains after treatment with ATRA plus chemotherapy.","['Roman, J', 'Martin, C', 'Torres, A', 'Jimenez, M A', 'Andres, P', 'Flores, R', 'de la Torre, M J', 'Sanchez, J', 'Serrano, J', 'Falcon, M']","['Roman J', 'Martin C', 'Torres A', 'Jimenez MA', 'Andres P', 'Flores R', 'de la Torre MJ', 'Sanchez J', 'Serrano J', 'Falcon M']","['Department of Hematology, Reina Sofia Hospital, Cordoba, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700712 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Apr;19(7):679-83. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700712.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several published HDC regimens have become relatively widely used. The purpose of this analysis was to determine treatment-related mortality (TRM) following administration of five different HDC regimens in community cancer centers. A retrospective evaluation of 1000 consecutive patients with leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, sarcoma, ovarian cancer, or breast cancer who received one of five published HDC regimens followed by PBPC infusion over a 5-year period in community cancer centers was performed to determine TRM. Fifty-nine patients (5.9%) died within 100 days of PBPC infusion. Twenty-five patients (2.5%) died predominantly of causes related to disease progression. Thirty-four patients (3.4%) died of TRM, 15 patients (1.5%) died from infection and 19 (1.9%) died from regimen-related toxicities (RRT). In a logistic model, increasing age (P = 0.001) and lower numbers of CD34+ cells/kg (P = 0.003) were associated with an increased risk of 100-day TRM. High-dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin was associated with a lower risk of mortality than other regimens (P = 0.0001). High-dose chemotherapy and autologous PBPC support can be performed in community cancer centers with relative safety. Patient age, the type of preparative regimen and the number of CD34+ cells infused were important determinates of mortality.","['Weaver, C H', 'Schwartzberg, L S', 'Hainsworth, J', 'Greco, F A', 'Li, W', 'Buckner, C D', 'West, W H']","['Weaver CH', 'Schwartzberg LS', 'Hainsworth J', 'Greco FA', 'Li W', 'Buckner CD', 'West WH']","['Clinical Research Division of Response Oncology Inc, Memphis, TN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy/mortality', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700713 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Apr;19(7):671-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700713.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its pharmacological application is reported to shorten chemotherapy-induced neutropenia as well as time to engraftment in patients after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). In order possibly to establish further rationale for G-CSF treatment strategies in patients undergoing BMT, we evaluated G-CSF plasma levels of 89 patients after allogeneic BMT for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). EDTA anti-coagulated plasma samples were collected starting on day -1 (before grafting) and thereafter twice weekly for four consecutive weeks. G-CSF levels were estimated by enzyme immunoassay. Patients with late (> 30 days) bone marrow engraftment had consistently higher G-CSF levels at day +1 (after grafting) compared to patients with early (< or = 30 days) engraftment, while all patients had low plasma levels on day -1/0. Mean G-CSF plasma levels and time to engraftment were correlated (r = 0.79). In univariate analyses, high G-CSF levels at days +1, +4, +7, +10 and several clinical variables (such as TBI, unrelated donor transplant, state of disease) were predictive of late engraftment. Further analysis by multivariate Cox regression resulted in the following predictive model: high G-CSF plasma levels at day +7 and +10 (after grafting), in combination with a blastic phase of the disease were highly predictive of late engraftment. The significantly higher G-CSF levels in patients with impaired engraftment may reflect early compensating mechanisms of the hemopoietic system, which should be investigated further.","['Busch, F W', 'Pilgrim, T B', 'Kramer, A', 'Ehninger, G']","['Busch FW', 'Pilgrim TB', 'Kramer A', 'Ehninger G']","['Medizinische Universitatsklinik, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Graft Survival', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Sex Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700722 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Apr;19(7):653-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700722.,['Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Mar;21(5):533-4.

METHODS: Work histories were obtained for cases and controls together with detailed information on the distribution sites. For each job in the work history, an estimate of exposure (parts per million (ppm)) was obtained by multiplying a measure derived from exposure data by modifying factors to reflect the differences between the conditions that existed at the time of measurement and those at the time of interest. The modifying factors used related to job activity, the number of road tankers loaded, the benzene content of the gasoline, the mixture of products handled, temperature, and loading technology. Cumulative exposures for each case and control were obtained by multiplying the exposure estimates for each job by the duration of time in the respective jobs, and summing these over all jobs in the work history. Peak exposure and exposure through dermal contact were quantitatively classified for each job. RESULTS: Measured exposures were obtained for 30 job categories, and ranged from 0.003 to 8.20 ppm. 40% of work histories were assigned background exposures, with a further 34% assigned the exposure estimate for a driver carrying out top submerged loading of motor fuel into road tankers. Cumulative exposures ranged from < 1 to > 200 ppm-years, although 81% were < 5 ppm-years. Comparison of the exposure estimates for selected jobs with data from sources not used in the study showed similar results.

METHODS: From the cohort of distribution workers, 91 cases were identified as having leukaemia on either a death certificate or on cancer registration. These cases were compared with controls (four per case) randomly selected from the cohort, who were from the same company as the respective case, matched for age, and alive and under follow up at the time of case occurrence. Work histories were collected for the cases and controls, together with information about the terminals at which they had worked, fuel compositions, and occupational hygiene measurements of benzene. These data were used to derive quantitative estimates of personal exposure to benzene. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated conditional on the matching, to identify those variables in the study which were associated with risk of leukaemia. Examination of the potential effects of confounding and other variables was carried out with conditional logistic regression. Analyses were carried out for all leukaemia and separately for acute lymphoblastic, chronic lymphocytic, acute myeloid and monocytic, and chronic myeloid leukaemias. RESULTS: There was no significant increase in the overall risk of all leukaemias with higher cumulative exposure to benzene or with intensity of exposure, but risk was consistently doubled in subjects employed in the industry for > 10 years. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia tended to occur in workers employed after 1950, who started work after the age of 30, worked for a short duration, and experienced low cumulative exposure with few peaks. The ORs did not increase with increasing cumulative exposure. The risk of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia seemed to be related most closely to duration of employment and the highest risk occurred in white collar workers with long service. These workers had only background levels of benzene exposure. There was no evidence of an association of risk with any exposure variables, and no evidence of an increasing risk with increasing cumulative exposure, mean intensity, or maximum intensity of exposure. The patterns of risk for acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia were different from those of the lymphoid subgroups, in which duration of employment was the variable most closely related to risk. Risk was increased to an OR of 2.8 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.8 to 9.4) for a cumulative exposure between 4.5 and 45 ppm-years compared with < 0.45 ppm-years. For mean intensity between 0.2 and 0.4 ppm an OR of 2.8 (95% CI 0.9 to 8.5) was found compared with < 0.02 ppm. Risk did not increase with cumulative exposure, maximum intensity, or mean intensity of exposure when treated as continuous variables. Cases of acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia were more often classified as having peaked exposures than controls, and when variables characterising peaks, particularly daily and weekly peaks, were included in the analysis these tended to dominate the other exposure variables. However, because of the small numbers it is not possible to distinguish the relative influence of peaked and unpeaked exposures on risk of acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia. There was no evidence of an increased risk of chronic myeloid leukaemia with increases in cumulative exposure, maximum intensity, mean intensity, and duration of employment, either as continuous or categorical variables. Analyses exploring the sensitivity of the results to the source and quality of the work histories showed similar patterns in general. However, no increases in ORs for categories of cumulative exposure were found for acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia in the data set which included work histories obtained from personnel records still in existence, although numbers were reduced. Analyses excluding the last five and 10 years of exposure showed a tendency for ORs to reduce for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia, and to increase for acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia. Limitations of the study include uncertainties and gaps in the information collected, and small numbers in subcategories of exposure which can lead to wide CIs around the risk estimates and poor fit of the mathematical models. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence in this study of an association between exposure to benzene and lymphoid leukaemia, either acute or chronic. There is some suggestion of a relation between exposure to benzene and myeloid leukaemia, in particular for acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia. Peaked exposures seemed to be experienced for this disease. However, in view of the limitations of the study, doubt remains as to whether the risk of acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia is increased by cumulative exposures of < 45 ppm-years. Further work is recommended to review the work histories and redefine their quality, to explore the discrepancies between results for categorical and continuous variables, and to develop ranges around the expose estimates to enable further sensitivity analyses to be carried out.","['Rushton, L', 'Romaniuk, H']","['Rushton L', 'Romaniuk H']","[""Department of Public Health Medicine and Epidemiology, University of Nottingham, Queen's Medical Centre.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Petroleum)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Death Certificates', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Odds Ratio', '*Petroleum', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Transportation', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.54.3.152 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1997 Mar;54(3):152-66. doi: 10.1136/oem.54.3.152.,['Occup Environ Med. 1998 May;55(5):360-1.

Ewes treated with oestradiol alone showed lower concentrations of immunoreactive LIF in the endometrium in comparison to ovariectomized, control animals, while treatment of ovariectomized animals with both oestradiol and progesterone had a greater inhibitory effect on LIF immunolocalization. These studies demonstrate the presence of mRNA encoding LIF and protein throughout the oestrous cycle and early pregnancy and suggest that steroid hormones may be involved in their regulation.","['Vogiagis, D', 'Fry, R C', 'Sandeman, R M', 'Salamonsen, L A']","['Vogiagis D', 'Fry RC', 'Sandeman RM', 'Salamonsen LA']","[""Prince Henry's Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Reprod Fertil,Journal of reproduction and fertility,0376367,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Endometrium/*immunology', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Estrus/*immunology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ovariectomy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Animal/*immunology', 'Progesterone/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Sheep/*physiology']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1530/jrf.0.1090279 [doi]'],ppublish,J Reprod Fertil. 1997 Mar;109(2):279-88. doi: 10.1530/jrf.0.1090279.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The in situ end-labelling (ISEL) technique was used for the demonstration of programmed cell death, in combination with the monoclonal antibody PG-M1 to identify macrophages. Cell proliferation was evaluated by employing the monoclonal antibody PC10 directed against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In CML (48 patients), significantly higher rates of apoptosis were observed than in normal bone marrow (smears, frozen sections, and paraffin-embedded samples) of 15 patients. In contrast, the PCNA labelling index of CML was not different from controls. In bone marrow tissue derived from CML patients, about 36 per cent of apoptotic bodies were ingested with CD68-positive macrophages. Study of the histotopographical distribution of labelled cells revealed that in CML, in contrast to the normal bone marrow, programmed cell death and PCNA activity were concentrated along the paratrabecular generation zone. In 28 patients with CML treated with interferon (IFN), sequential trephine biopsies displayed a significant enhancement of apoptosis which was associated with a decrease in PCNA reactivity. In contrast to this finding, no such alterations could be observed in 24 patients who received busulfan (BU) monotherapy. This study furthers the understanding of cell kinetics in CML. IFN therapy induces apoptosis and suppresses cell proliferation. The rate of programmed cell death prior to therapy and the extent of IFN-triggered apoptosis exert a significant predictive impact on survival. In this study, ISEL-positive (apoptotic) cells and bodies do not correspond to unscheduled cell repair as detected by PCNA immunoreactivity.","['Thiele, J', 'Zirbes, T K', 'Lorenzen, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Dresbach, S', 'Manich, B', 'Leder, L D', 'Niederle, N', 'Diehl, V', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Zirbes TK', 'Lorenzen J', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Dresbach S', 'Manich B', 'Leder LD', 'Niederle N', 'Diehl V', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Busulfan/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Interferons/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/analysis', 'Survival Rate']",1997/03/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199703)181:3<316::AID-PATH771>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199703)181:3<316::AID-PATH771>3.0.CO;2-I [doi]']",ppublish,J Pathol. 1997 Mar;181(3):316-22. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199703)181:3<316::AID-PATH771>3.0.CO;2-I.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: CSF PAI-1 concentrations were measured in 51 patients with neurological disease and 20 reference subjects using an ELISA. The patient group comprised three patients with viral meningitis, 20 with encephalitis, nine with acute lymphoblastic (n = 7) and myeloid (n = 2) leukaemia (with central nervous system involvement), and 19 with multiple sclerosis. RESULTS: Raised PAI-1 concentrations were observed in patients with leukaemia, encephalitis and multiple sclerosis. There was no difference in the mean concentrations of PAI-1 in patients with meningitis when compared with the reference subjects. The highest mean (SEM) PAI-1 concentration was found in patients with leukaemia (1.28 (0.36) ng/ml), and the next highest in those with encephalitis (1.19 (0.20) ng/ml). these values were much higher than those in patients with viral meningitis. In a previous report, raised CSF tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) activities were detected in patients with multiple sclerosis, leukaemia and encephalitis, with mean activities in decreasing order. PAI-1 concentrations in the same patients were the reverse of their corresponding tPA activities, being higher in those with leukaemia and encephalitis, than in patients with multiple sclerosis. There was no association between CSF PAI-1 concentrations and age in either patients or controls. Similarly, there was no association between CSF PAI-1 concentrations and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). CONCLUSIONS: Raised CSF PAI-1 concentrations may be used as a non-specific marker of neurological disease. Moreover, PAI-1 may play an important role in regulating the functions tPA, and probably uPA, in CSF.","['Akenami, F O', 'Koskiniemi, M', 'Farkkila, M', 'Vaheri, A']","['Akenami FO', 'Koskiniemi M', 'Farkkila M', 'Vaheri A']","['Haartman Institute, Department of Virology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,['0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Encephalitis/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/cerebrospinal fluid/complications', 'Meningitis, Viral/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Sclerosis/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Nervous System Diseases/*cerebrospinal fluid/complications', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1/*cerebrospinal fluid']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.50.2.157 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1997 Feb;50(2):157-60. doi: 10.1136/jcp.50.2.157.,,,PMC499743,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sections of biopsy specimens from all cases entered into the trial were stained with Giemsa and haematoxylin and eosin. All cases were stained immunohistochemically for CD45, CD3, CD45RO, CD20, and CD30. Sections were stained with either naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase or KP1 (CD68) to identify granulocytic tumours. In a minority of cases, additional immunohistochemical stains were performed when necessary to establish the diagnosis. The sections were reviewed by three pathologists. RESULTS: Of 308 cases analysed, 293 were categorised as NHL. There was only one case of low grade lymphoma in the series. Over 80% of the cases fell into the categories Burkitt lymphoma (42.2%), lymphoblastic lymphoma (27.2%) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (15.1%). Cases of Burkitt lymphoma presented most often with abdominal tumours mainly of the ileocaecal region. Tumours of the oropharynx and nasopharynx were also common in this group. Of the 84 lymphoblastic lymphomas, 56 were of the T-cell phenotype, 12 of the B-cell phenotype and 16 of indeterminate lineage. Most of the T-lymphoblastic lymphomas showed mediastinal or pleural involvement. Infiltration of the skin and soft tissues was seen in 25% of lymphoblastic lymphoma of B or indeterminate phenotype. Forty six children were diagnosed as having anaplastic large cell lymphoma, the majority being of T or indeterminate lineage. Most patients presented with lymphadenopathy but involvement of the bones, soft tissues or skin was seen in seven patients and of the mediastinum and lungs in five. CONCLUSION: Childhood non-Hodgkin lymphomas are almost all high grade and frequently extranodal. They fall mainly into the categories Burkitt lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The separation of these subcategories can be made on the basis of morphology and immunohistochemical features. The anatomical distribution of these different categories of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is distinctive.","['Wright, D', 'McKeever, P', 'Carter, R']","['Wright D', 'McKeever P', 'Carter R']","['University Department of Pathology, Southampton General Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.1.- (Naphthol AS D Esterase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Male', 'Naphthol AS D Esterase/analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Sex Distribution', 'United Kingdom']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.50.2.128 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1997 Feb;50(2):128-34. doi: 10.1136/jcp.50.2.128.,['J Clin Pathol. 1997 Aug;50(8):709.

It also suppressed the retrovirus-induced, excessive production of cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10) by Th2 cells. The highest dose of DHEAS reduced IL-6 production by splenocytes from uninfected old mice by 75% while increasing their IL-2 secretion by nearly 50%.

In solution, the actions of the singlet-oxygen quenchers, methionine, azide, disodium [N,N'-ethylenebis (5-sulfosalicylideneimminato)]nickelate(II) (Ni-chelate 1) and disodium [(N,N'-2,3-propionic acid)bis(5-sulfosal-icylideneimminato)] nickelate(II) (Ni-chelate 2) could be explained quantitatively by assuming their only mechanism of action was to quench singlet oxygen. The singlet oxygen quenchers, azide, Ni-chelate 1 and Ni-chelate 2, caused smaller inhibitions in the rate of singlet oxygen-mediated inactivation of ACE on K562 cells than ACE in solution. The effects of these quenchers and of deuterium oxide were interpreted using a mathematical model of singlet-oxygen quenching and diffusion to estimate the lifetime of singlet oxygen near the cell surface.

This study was designed to investigate the effect of RA on the sensitivity of SC-M1 cells to lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity. RA at the concentration range of 0.001-10 microM was shown to induce SC-M1 cells to exhibit resistance to LAK activity in a dose-dependent manner. A kinetics study indicated that a significantly increased resistance was detected after 2 days of co-culturing SC-M1 cells with RA and reached a maximum after 6 days of culture. Similar results were obtained from two other cancer cell lines: promyelocytic leukaemia HL-60 and hepatic cancer Hep 3B. A binding assay demonstrated that the binding efficacy between target SC-M1 cells and effector LAK cells was not altered by RA. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that RA exhibited no effect on the expression of cell surface molecules, including HLA class I and class II antigens, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and -2, and lymphocyte function antigen-3. Cell cycle analysis revealed that culture of SC-M1 cells with RA resulted in an increase in G0/G1 phase and a decrease in S phase, accompanied by a decrease in cyclin A and cyclin B1 mRNA as determined by Northern blot analysis. Additionally, RA was shown to enhance the expression of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) in SC-M1 cells, and to have no effect on the expression of RARbeta or RARgamma. Taken together, these results indicate that RA can significantly increase gastric cancer cells SC-M1 to resist LAK cytotoxicity by means of a cytostatic effect through a mechanism relating to cell cycle regulation. The prevailing ideas, such as a decrease in effector to target cell binding, a reduced MHC class I antigen expression or an altered RARbeta expression, are not involved.","['Chao, T Y', 'Jiang, S Y', 'Shyu, R Y', 'Yeh, M Y', 'Chu, T M']","['Chao TY', 'Jiang SY', 'Shyu RY', 'Yeh MY', 'Chu TM']","['Department of Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1997.218 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1997;75(9):1284-90. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1997.218.,,,PMC2228218,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Drosophila, this is achieved by a 2-fold enhancement of X-linked gene transcription in males, relative to females. The enhancement of transcription is mediated by the activity of a group of regulatory genes characterized by the male-specific lethality of their loss-of-function alleles. The products of these genes form a complex that is preferentially associated with numerous sites on the X chromosome in somatic cells of males but not of females. Binding of the dosage compensation complex is correlated with a significant increase in the presence of a specific histone isoform, histone 4 acetylated at Lys16, on this chromosome. Experimental results and sequence analysis suggest that an additional gene, males-absent on the first (mof), encodes a putative acetyl transferase that plays a direct role in the specific histone acetylation associated with dosage compensation.

So far, simple retroviral vectors based on Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) have been the main delivery vehicles for the transfer of corrective genes into primary hematopoietic cells. While the gene transfer efficiency of progenitor cells has been very efficient using these vectors, it has been much more problematic to obtain efficient gene transfer into repopulating human hematopoietic stem cells. The main reason for this is due to the quiescent nature of these cells and the fact that MLV-based vectors require dividing target cells. It may be that efficient gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells can be accomplished by stimulating the cells to divide in vitro or by developing new vector systems that can isolate transduced cells or that can deliver genes permanently into nondividing target cells.

Enlarged MKs with multilobulated nuclei and cell clustering in close proximity are the hallmark of all the Ph negative MPDs. Clonality of haematopoietic cells, based on X chromosome inactivation, can now be studied in a majority of female patients in all nucleated cell fractions as well as in platelets. Cytofluorometric studies have demonstrated a shift towards higher ploidy classes in PV and ET MKs which may be useful in discriminating between both primary and reactive thrombocytosis and CML patients which show a significant shift to lower MK ploidy values. The role of MK proliferation on the evolution of myelofibrosis common to MPDs has been firmly established. Implication of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in myelofibrosis has already been demonstrated. More recently transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) synthesized and secreted by MK has been implicated in fibroblasts stimulation. A significant increase in circulating colony-forming units of MKs (CFU-MK) has been repeatedly observed in MPDs as well as a spontaneous MK colony formation in a majority of ET patients. Hypersensitivity to thrombopoietin (TPO) in relation to a functional defect of the TPO-MPL pathway may play a major role in spontaneous MK growth. There is no currently available test of platelet functions able to predict the risk of occurrence of thrombotic or haemorrhagic complications in MPD patients. However, the role of platelet activation in the pathogenesis of ischaemic erythromelalgia has been established and a correlation between presenting haemorrhagic manifestations and platelet counts in excess of 1000 x 10(9)/l has been found.","['Briere, J', 'Kiladjian, J J', 'Peynaud-Debayle, E']","['Briere J', 'Kiladjian JJ', 'Peynaud-Debayle E']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Beaujon, Clichy, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,,IM,"['Blood Platelets/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/pathology']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(97)80051-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1997 Feb;10(1):65-88. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(97)80051-0.,,103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A DNA synthesis inhibitor, hydroxyurea (HU), has been successfully combined with IFN-alpha to improve the efficiency of IFN therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). To understand the mechanism of this combination effect, expression of IFN-alpha receptors on the CML cell line, K562, was studied before and after treatment with HU. METHODS: Cells were treated with HU at a dose of 0, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mmol/L for 48 hours. Binding assays were performed using 125I-labeled IFN-alpha at 4 degrees C. Cell cycle analysis was carried out using flow cytometer following staining cellular DNA with propidium iodide. Northern blot analysis was performed to evaluate the inducibility of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene expression by IFN-alpha. RESULTS: Hydroxyurea-treated cells showed a dose- and time-dependent increase in binding of 125I-labeled IFN-alpha (maximal 2.5-fold). The increase of binding was caused by an increase in the number of binding sites with a constant receptor affinity. Similar results were obtained in the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, Daudi. Cell cycle analyses suggested that upregulation of the IFN receptor may have occurred as a result of the alteration in the cell cycle distribution. Furthermore, IFN-alpha induction of the IFN-inducible gene IRF-1 mRNA in HU-treated K562 cells was 2-fold higher than that in untreated cells. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, HU may have an ability to enhance the response to IFN-alpha probably because of its ability to upregulate the IFN-alpha receptors, suggesting that this may be involved in the mechanism of effective combination therapy of IFN-alpha with HU.","['Tamura, T', 'Matsuzaki, M', 'Harada, H', 'Ogawa, K', 'Mohri, H', 'Okubo, T']","['Tamura T', 'Matsuzaki M', 'Harada H', 'Ogawa K', 'Mohri H', 'Okubo T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Interferon-alpha/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interferon/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Investig Med. 1997 Apr;45(4):160-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, while the patterns of DNA alkylation were broadly similar, the compounds were considerably more cytotoxic than analogous untargeted mustards.

The literature review reveals that treatment methods for whole-body irradiation are highly heterogeneous. Standardization would be desirable. Fractionated and single-dose, whole-body irradiation are probably of equal value when the dose and technique are optimal. Cataracts seem to be more common following a single dose. Fractionated treatment is more resource intensive, but less burdensome for patients. For advanced-stage leukemia and some other diseases, eg, myeloma, international experience has shown that a combined treatment strategy (high-dose cyclophosphamide and whole-body irradiation) is probably superior to chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and busulfan) alone. For many other hematological malignancies at less advanced stages, conditioning methods are probably of equal value.","['Alvegard, T']",['Alvegard T'],"['Department of Oncology, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/02841869609101674 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 1996;35 Suppl 7:137-40. doi: 10.3109/02841869609101674.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further understand the mechanisms by which cleavable complex-forming topoisomerase II inhibitors interfere with DNA replication, we examined the effects of VM-26 on this process in human leukemia CEM cells. Both the inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell survival were directly related to the total amount of drug-stabilized cleavable complexes formed in VM-26-treated cells. DNA chain elongation was also inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion in these cells, which suggested that VM-26-stabilized cleavable complexes interfered with the movement of DNA replication forks. To test this hypothesis directly, we monitored replication fork progression at a specific site of VM-26-induced DNA cleavage. A topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage site was detected in the first exon of the c-myc gene in VM-26-treated cells. This cleavage site was downstream of a putative replication origin located in the 5' flanking region of the gene. Replication forks, which moved through this region of the c-myc gene in the 5' to 3' direction, were specifically arrested at this site in VM-26-treated cells, but not in untreated or aphidicolin-treated cells. These studies provide the first direct evidence that a VM-26-stabilized topoisomerase II-DNA cleavable complex acts as a replication fork barrier at a specific genomic site in mammalian cells. Furthermore, the data support the hypothesis that the replication fork arrest induced by cleavable complex-forming topoisomerase II inhibitors leads to the generation of irreversible DNA damage and cytotoxicity in proliferating cells.","['Catapano, C V', 'Carbone, G M', 'Pisani, F', 'Qiu, J', 'Fernandes, D J']","['Catapano CV', 'Carbone GM', 'Pisani F', 'Qiu J', 'Fernandes DJ']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['*DNA Damage', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Stability/drug effects', 'Genes, myc/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Teniposide/*pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/13 00:00,1997/05/13 00:01,['1997/05/13 00:00'],"['1997/05/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/13 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi963101b [doi]', 'bi963101b [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1997 May 13;36(19):5739-48. doi: 10.1021/bi963101b.,,,,,['CA44597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, transgenic mice expressing pituitary-directed LIF driven by the rat growth hormone (GH) promoter were generated to evaluate the impact of LIF on pituitary development. Three founders were established with diminished linear growth and body weight (57-65% of wild type [WT]), and intense anterior pituitary LIF immunoreactivity. Cystic cavities observed in pituitary anterior lobes were lined by cuboidal, ciliated epithelial cells, focally immunopositive for cytokeratin and S-100 protein and immunonegative for adenohypophyseal hormones. Transgenic pituitaries showed decreased GH (40%) and prolactin (PRL) (26%) cells, and decreased GH and PRL mRNAs by in situ hybridization. ACTH cells increased 2.2-fold, whereas gonadotrophs and thyrotrophs were unchanged.

Arrested murine pituitary maturation with formation of pituitary Rathke's cleft cysts, GH deficiency, and short stature provide a model to study human Rathke's cyst pathogenesis.","['Akita, S', 'Readhead, C', 'Stefaneanu, L', 'Fine, J', 'Tampanaru-Sarmesiu, A', 'Kovacs, K', 'Melmed, S']","['Akita S', 'Readhead C', 'Stefaneanu L', 'Fine J', 'Tampanaru-Sarmesiu A', 'Kovacs K', 'Melmed S']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Craniopharyngioma/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Growth Hormone/biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior/cytology/*physiology', 'Pituitary Gland, Posterior/cytology/*physiology', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Prolactin/biosynthesis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1997/05/15 00:00,1997/05/15 00:01,['1997/05/15 00:00'],"['1997/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI119430 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1997 May 15;99(10):2462-9. doi: 10.1172/JCI119430.,,,PMC508087,,['DK-50238/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that SHIP was tyrosine-phosphorylated after high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) aggregation in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. The tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP was an early event after receptor aggregation and was present in cells deficient in the protein-tyrosine kinase Syk. Furthermore it was not secondary to the increase of intracellular calcium or the activation of protein kinase C. SHIP was precipitated by immobilized phosphorylated synthetic peptides based on the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) of the beta but not the gamma subunit of the high affinity IgE receptor. Tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP and its association with the tyrosine-phosphorylated beta subunit of FcepsilonRI could play an important role in down-regulating receptor-mediated signal transduction in mast cells. Thus, whereas the activation molecule Syk associates with the gamma subunit ITAM, the beta subunit ITAM binds the negative signaling molecule SHIP. Therefore, unlike B cells where the antigen receptor and coreceptors such as FcgammaRIIB or CD22 each recruits molecules with opposite effects, the FcepsilonRI contains subunits which recruit molecules that activate and inhibit signal transduction.","['Kimura, T', 'Sakamoto, H', 'Appella, E', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Kimura T', 'Sakamoto H', 'Appella E', 'Siraganian RP']","['Laboratory of Immunology, NIDR, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1188, USA. tk51w@nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPPL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', '*src Homology Domains']",1997/05/23 00:00,1997/05/23 00:01,['1997/05/23 00:00'],"['1997/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.21.13991 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)40404-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 May 23;272(21):13991-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.21.13991.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, L-selectin was found to be phosphorylated in lymphoblastoid cell lines, and phosphorylation was enhanced by phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)) treatment. Interactions between L-selectin and chemoattractant receptors were therefore examined using transfected rat basophilic leukemia cell lines (RBL-2H3) that expressed human L-selectin along with human leukocyte chemoattractant receptors. L-selectin was rapidly phosphorylated in cells treated with chemoattractants, thrombin, IgE receptor agonists, or PMA. Pertussis toxin or the protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine, completely blocked chemoattractant receptor-induced phosphorylation of L-selectin. PMA-induced phosphorylation was on serine residues within the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin that have been well conserved during recent evolution. Although L-selectin phosphorylation was not essential for basal levels of adhesion through L-selectin in transformed cell lines, the rapid increase in ligand binding activity of L-selectin that occurs following leukocyte activation was blocked by staurosporine. These results demonstrate that L-selectin can be phosphorylated following engagement of chemoattractant receptors and suggest that this may be a physiologically relevant mechanism for the synergistic regulation of these receptors during leukocyte migration.","['Haribabu, B', 'Steeber, D A', 'Ali, H', 'Richardson, R M', 'Snyderman, R', 'Tedder, T F']","['Haribabu B', 'Steeber DA', 'Ali H', 'Richardson RM', 'Snyderman R', 'Tedder TF']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'L-Selectin/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Peptide/*metabolism', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1997/05/23 00:00,1997/05/23 00:01,['1997/05/23 00:00'],"['1997/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.21.13961 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)40399-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 May 23;272(21):13961-5. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.21.13961.,,,,,"['AI-26872/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-54464/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-50985/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Initial investigations of the cerebellum and frontal lobes are presented using MRI and neuropsychological measures. Planimetric measures of the cerebellar vermis (lobuli I-V and VI-VII) and pons, and neuropsychological frontal lobe measures were obtained from high functioning individuals with autism (A), survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with brain sequelae following radiation and chemotherapy, and from rigorously selected healthy controls (C). The neuropsychological results were clustered according to functions commonly related to frontal brain, posterior brain, and left and right hemispheres. The A and ALL groups, as compared to C, yielded modest but consistently reduced MRI measures for vermal lobuli I-V and VI-VII. Hypoplasia of lobuli VI-VII was more marked than I-V. Performance on neuropsychological tests for frontal lobe functions was generally depressed in both groups, with more severe deficits in A. Between-group differences in verbal, visual-spatial, and emotional-social skills are discussed. The cerebellar and frontal brain deficits that are present in both clinical groups (A and ALL) may be common to other developmental and acquired disorders of early childhood. Such joint manifestation of cerebellar and frontal lobe abnormalities is in agreement with the concept of cerebellar significance for the development of higher cognitive functions.","['Ciesielski, K T', 'Harris, R J', 'Hart, B L', 'Pabst, H F']","['Ciesielski KT', 'Harris RJ', 'Hart BL', 'Pabst HF']","['Department of Psychology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, USA. ciesiels@unm.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Neuropsychologia,Neuropsychologia,0020713,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Autistic Disorder/physiopathology/psychology', 'Brain Damage, Chronic/*congenital/etiology/physiopathology', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cerebellum/*abnormalities/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/*physiopathology/psychology', 'Female', 'Frontal Lobe/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/physiopathology/radiotherapy', 'Social Isolation', 'Thinking/physiology']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0028-3932(96)00119-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0028-3932(96)00119-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuropsychologia. 1997 May;35(5):643-55. doi: 10.1016/s0028-3932(96)00119-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different PBMC samples were exposed to HTLV-I by cocultivation with MT-2 (a chronically infected cell line) in the presence of 20 U/ml of human recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2) and graded concentrations of AZT. Control and drug-treated cultures, of both infected and uninfected PBMCs, were then grown for several weeks and monitored for virological and immunological parameters. The results showed a concentration-dependent anti-proliferative effect of AZT in both infected and non-infected cultures. Production of both proviral DNA and viral RNA was inhibited not only at the higher concentrations of AZT (8 microM and 32 microM) but also at concentrations as low as 0.1-2 microM. These results were confirmed by PCR and by flow cytometry analysis for the viral core protein p19. Moreover, treatment with AZT resulted in a decreased expression of CD25 in cultures exposed to HTLV-I as well as in non-infected PBMCs.

A number of gene therapy strategies have been designed with the intent of inhibiting HIV replication in mature T cells. As T cells are products of hematolymphoid differentiation, insertion of antiviral genes into hematopoietic stem cells could serve as a vehicle to confer long-term protection in progeny T cells derived from transduced stem cells. One such ""cellular immunization"" strategy utilizes the gene coding for the HIV-1 rev trans-dominant mutant protein RevM10 which has been demonstrated to inhibit HIV-1 replication in T-cell lines and in primary T cells. In this study, we used a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retrovirus encoding a bicistronic message coexpressing RevM10 and the murine CD8-alpha' chain (Lyt2). This vector allows rapid selection of transgene-expressing cells as well as quantitation of transgene expression. We demonstrate that RevM10-transduced CD34-enriched hematopoietic progenitor-stem cells (HPSC) isolated from human umbilical cord blood or from granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood can give rise to mature thymocytes in the SCID-hu thymus/liver mouse model. The phenotypic distribution of HPSC-derived thymocytes is normal, and expression of the transgene can be detected by flow cytometric analysis. Moreover, we demonstrate that RevM10 can inhibit HIV replication in T cells derived from transduced HPSC after expansion in vitro.

We have examined the intranuclear localization pattern of both the IE1 and IE2 proteins in virus-infected and DNA-transfected cells. When HCMV-infected human diploid fibroblast (HF) cells were stained with specific monoclonal antibodies, IE1 localized as a mixture of nuclear diffuse and punctate patterns at very early times (2 h) but changed to an exclusively nuclear diffuse pattern at later times. In contrast, IE2 was distributed predominantly in nuclear punctate structures continuously from 2 to at least 12 h after infection. These punctate structures resembled the preexisting PML-associated nuclear bodies (ND10 or PML oncogenic domains [PODs]) that are disrupted and dispersed by the IE110 protein as a very early event in herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. However, HCMV differed from HSV by leading instead to a change in both the PML and SP100 protein distribution from punctate bodies to uniform diffuse patterns, a process that was complete in 50% of the cells at 2 h and in 90% of the cells by 4 h after infection. Confocal double-label indirect immunofluorescence assay analysis confirmed that both IE1 and IE2 colocalized transiently with PML in punctate bodies at very early times after infection. In transient expression assays, introduction of IE1-encoding plasmid DNA alone into Vero or HF cells produced the typical total redistribution of PML into a uniform nuclear diffuse pattern together with the IE1 protein, whereas introduction of IE2-encoding plasmid DNA alone resulted in stable colocalization of the IE2 protein with PML in the PODs. A truncated mutant form of IE1 gave large nuclear aggregates and failed to redistribute PML, and similarly a deleted mutant form of IE2 failed to colocalize with the punctate PML bodies, confirming the specificity of these effects. Furthermore, both Vero and U373 cell lines constitutively expressing IE1 also showed total PML relocalization together with the IE1 protein into a nuclear diffuse pattern, although a very small percentage of the cells which failed to express IE1 reverted to a punctate PML pattern. Finally, the PML redistribution activity of IE1 and the direct association of IE2 with PML punctate bodies were both confirmed by infection with E1A-negative recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing either IE1 or IE2 alone. These results confirm that transient colocalization with and disruption of PML-associated nuclear bodies by IE1 and continuous targeting to PML-associated nuclear bodies by IE2 are intrinsic properties of these two MIE regulatory proteins, which we suggest may represent critical initial events for efficient lytic cycle infection by HCMV.","['Ahn, J H', 'Hayward, G S']","['Ahn JH', 'Hayward GS']","['Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (IE2 protein, Cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (UL115 protein, Human herpesvirus 5)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein H, Cytomegalovirus)', '0 (glycoprotein H, Human cytomegalovirus)', '0 (glycoprotein O, cytomegalovirus)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytomegalovirus/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*metabolism', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Microscopy, Confocal', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Time Factors', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Vero Cells', '*Viral Envelope Proteins', '*Viral Proteins']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.6.4599-4613.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Jun;71(6):4599-613. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.6.4599-4613.1997.,,,PMC191682,,['R01 AI24576/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the expression of the human receptor for the amphotropic MuLV (GLVR-2, newly termed Pit2), we determined its mRNA levels in several cell lines and found them to vary significantly. Induction of increased levels of mRNA after removal of phosphate from the media was observed in two osteosarcoma cell lines.

On a molecular level, exactly how viruses are down-regulated in vivo remains unresolved. We described here the possibility that down-regulation results from the presence of inhibitory elements within the gag-env region of the provirus in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells from carriers. In vitro experiments then revealed that potent cis-acting inhibitory elements (CIEs) are indeed contained in two discrete fragments from the pol region and weaker ones in the env region. The effect of CIEs is relieved by the HTLV-1 posttranscriptional regulator Rex through binding to the Rex-responsive element (RxRE), suggesting that Rex might interfere with pre-mRNA degradation and/or activate the export of mRNA molecules harboring both of the inhibitory elements and RxRE on the same RNA molecule. Thus, we propose the hypothesis that such functions of CIEs may be involved in HTLV-1 persistence.","['Saiga, A', 'Orita, S', 'Minoura-Tada, N', 'Maeda, M', 'Aono, Y', 'Asakawa, M', 'Nakahara, K', 'Kubota, R', 'Osame, M', 'Igarashi, H']","['Saiga A', 'Orita S', 'Minoura-Tada N', 'Maeda M', 'Aono Y', 'Asakawa M', 'Nakahara K', 'Kubota R', 'Osame M', 'Igarashi H']","['Shionogi Institute for Medical Science, Settsu, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Defective Viruses/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, rex/physiology', '*Genes, env', '*Genes, pol', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Virus Latency']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.6.4485-4494.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Jun;71(6):4485-94. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.6.4485-4494.1997.,,,PMC191668,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their involvement in the transformation of rat fibroblasts by Tax was examined by colony formation of Rat-1 cells in soft agar and Ras cooperative focus formation of rat embryo fibroblasts (REF). Among Tax mutants, those retaining activity for the CArG box transformed REF like wild-type Tax, while those inactive for the CArG box did not. Thus, the activation of the CArG box pathway is essential for the transformation of REF by Tax. In contrast, activation of the kappaB element correlated with the transformation of Rat-1 by Tax.

We sought to determine if 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), the primary treatment for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, increases the retrovirus mutation rate. Two assays were used to determine the effects of AZT on retrovirus mutation rates. The strategy of the first assay involved measuring the in vivo rate of inactivation of the lacZ gene in one replication cycle of SNV- and murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vectors. We observed 7- and 10-fold increases in the SNV mutant frequency following treatment of target cells with 0.1 and 0.5 microM AZT, respectively. The murine leukemia virus mutant frequency increased two- and threefold following treatment of target cells with 0.5 and 1.0 microM AZT, respectively. The second assay used an SNV-based shuttle vector containing the lacZ alpha gene. Proviruses were recovered as plasmids in Escherichia coli, and the rate of inactivation of lacZ alpha was measured. The results indicated that treatment of target cells increased the overall mutation rate two- to threefold. DNA sequence analysis of mutant proviruses indicated that AZT increased both the deletion and substitution rates. These results suggest that AZT treatment of HIV-1 infection may increase the degree of viral variation and alter virus evolution or pathogenesis.","['Julias, J G', 'Kim, T', 'Arnold, G', 'Pathak, V K']","['Julias JG', 'Kim T', 'Arnold G', 'Pathak VK']","['Department of Biochemistry, Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, West Virginia University, Morgantown 26506, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis/*drug effects', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Reticuloendotheliosis virus/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Virus Replication', 'Zidovudine/*pharmacology']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.6.4254-4263.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Jun;71(6):4254-63. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.6.4254-4263.1997.,,,PMC191640,,['CA58875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We have now used patch-clamp techniques to demonstrate reversible inhibition of whole cell KCa2+ currents in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells by submicromolar concentrations of CLT. Inhibition was equivalent whether currents were elicited by bath application of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 or by dialyzing cells with a pipette solution containing micromolar concentrations of free Ca2+. The extent of inhibition of whole cell MEL KCa2+ currents was voltage-dependent, decreasing with increasing test potential. We also determined the single channel basis of the CLT inhibition in MEL cells by demonstrating the inhibition of a calcium-activated, ChTX-sensitive K channel by CLT in outside-out patches. The channel was also blocked by the des-imidazolyl metabolite of CLT, 2-chlorophenyl-bisphenyl-methanol (MET II) [15], thus demonstrating that the imidazole ring is not required for the inhibitory action of CLT. Single KCa2+ channels were also evident in inside-out patches of MEL cells. Block of K current by CLT was not unique to MEL cells. CLT also inhibited a component of the whole cell K current in PC12 cells. Channel specificity of block by CLT was determined by examining its effects on other types of voltage-sensitive currents. CLT block showed the following rank order of potency: K currents in PC12 cells > Ca2+ currents in PC12 cells >> Na currents in sympathetic neurons. These results demonstrate that direct inhibition of single KCa2+ by CLT can be dissociated from inhibition of cytochrome P-450 in MEL cells.","['Rittenhouse, A R', 'Vandorpe, D H', 'Brugnara, C', 'Alper, S L']","['Rittenhouse AR', 'Vandorpe DH', 'Brugnara C', 'Alper SL']","['Molecular Medicine & Renal Units, Beth Israel Hospital, 330 Brookline Ave., Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'G07GZ97H65 (Clotrimazole)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antifungal Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Clotrimazole/*pharmacology', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'PC12 Cells/metabolism', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Potassium Channels/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/cytology/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/15 00:00,1997/05/15 00:01,['1997/05/15 00:00'],"['1997/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002329900227 [doi]'],ppublish,J Membr Biol. 1997 May 15;157(2):177-91. doi: 10.1007/s002329900227.,,,,,['HL 15157/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

These data, and the data reported by others in in vivo models, where LIF administration to experimental animals did not change the values of erythropoietic parameters, demonstrate that this inflammatory cytokine itself is not involved in the pathogenesis of ACD.","['Ratajczak, J', 'Machalinski, B', 'Marlicz, W', 'Halasa, M', 'Ratajczak, M Z']","['Ratajczak J', 'Machalinski B', 'Marlicz W', 'Halasa M', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Department of Cell Pathology, Pomeranian School of Medicine, Szczecin, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Poland,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,8502651,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Blood', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 1997;35(2):63-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HIV-1 encodes several regulatory proteins, including two essential trans-activations for viral replication, Rev and Tat. Both Rev and Tat have a nucleolar targeting signal and are actually located predominantly in the nucleoli. Within the nucleoli, Rev is localized to the combined regions of the dense fibrillar (DFC) and the granular (GC) components. Tat does not colocalize precisely with any nucleolar component tested, but partly overlaps regions of the DFC and the GC. Regions of both Rev and Tat are overlapped by the distribution of the major nucleolar protein B23. Overexpression of Rev causes nucleolar ballooning and general structural deformity with aberrant accumulation of rRNAs, whereas Tat does not have that effect. B23 is markedly accumulated in those nucleoli deformed by Rev. Components of the nucleolar DFC, GC, and fibrillar center domains are not accumulated but dispersed in a few small spots or larger patches within the enlarged nucleoli. Cytophotometric DNA determinations revealed that transient expression of Rev results in accumulation of G2, prophase, and mitotic cells which have failed cytokinesis, suggesting that Rev is capable of preventing or slowing the progression through mitosis. Tat, in contrast, does not affect the cell cycle. We speculate, based on these results, that Rev represses cell growth inhibiting the transport of ribosomal proteins and preribosomal particles across the nuclear envelope and affecting the cell cycle, both of which may be related to the proposed functions of B23.","['Miyazaki, Y', 'Nosaka, T', 'Hatanaka, M']","['Miyazaki Y', 'Nosaka T', 'Hatanaka M']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Biochimie,Biochimie,1264604,"['0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Products, rev/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tat/analysis/metabolism', 'HIV-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Nucleolus Organizer Region', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0300-9084(97)86733-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0300-9084(97)86733-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochimie. 1996;78(11-12):1081-6. doi: 10.1016/s0300-9084(97)86733-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of HL-60 cells to 100-300 microM MX resulted in increased levels of DNA single-strand breaks and/or alkali-labile sites (SSBs) as detected by alkaline filter elution. When adding inhibitors of DNA break repair (AraC plus hydroxyurea), increased levels of DNA SSBs were observed at very low concentrations (1-3 microM) of MX, as observed by both alkaline filter elution and the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay. Increased DNA SSBs could also be observed if DNA repair inhibitors were added immediately after exposure to 10 microM MX, indicating that low concentrations of MX cause a relatively stable modification of DNA that may be recognized and incised by DNA repair enzyme activities. Further studies with DNA break repair inhibitors indicated that HL-60 cells exposed to 10 microM MX for 1 h repaired 50% of their initial DNA damage during a 2-h period and the repair appeared to be complete at 22 h. Analysis of MX-treated DNA by sequencing methods indicated that MX preferentially reacts with guanines in DNA.","['Marsteinstredet, U', 'Brunborg, G', 'Bjoras, M', 'Soderlund, E', 'Seeberg, E', 'Kronberg, L', 'Holme, J A']","['Marsteinstredet U', 'Brunborg G', 'Bjoras M', 'Soderlund E', 'Seeberg E', 'Kronberg L', 'Holme JA']","['Department of Environmental Medicine, National Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Mutagens)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '77439-76-0 (3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA/*chemistry/drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/chemistry/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis/methods', 'Filtration', 'Furans/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Guanine/chemistry/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Mutagens/toxicity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",1997/04/24 00:00,1997/04/24 00:01,['1997/04/24 00:00'],"['1997/04/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/24 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-1218(97)00016-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-1218(97)00016-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1997 Apr 24;390(1-2):171-8. doi: 10.1016/s0165-1218(97)00016-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The granules can be classified as azurophil (primary), developed first, followed in time by specific (secondary) granules gelatinase granules, and secretory vesicles. Stage- and tissue-specific transcription factors govern the successive expression of genes for granule proteins to allow storage of the gene products in these organelle categories whose packaging is separated in time. Many of the granule proteins, in particular those of the heterogeneous lysosome-like azurophil granules, are subject to extensive post-translational proteolytic processing into mature proteins, most commonly as a post-sorting event. A selective aggregation of proteins destined for storage in granules, as discussed in this review, would facilitate their retention and eliminate a need for distinct sorting motifs on each granule protein. Aggregation of granule proteins, that are often cationic, would be assisted by the anionic serglycin proteoglycans present in neutrophils. The antibacterial granule proteins can serve as models for antibiotics and some of them possess a potentially useful therapeutic ability to bind and neutralize endotoxin. Because aberrant expression of transcription factors regulating the synthesis of granule proteins is often found in leukemia, the clarification of mechanisms regulating the timed expression of granule proteins will shed light on the maturation block in myeloid leukemias.","['Gullberg, U', 'Andersson, E', 'Garwicz, D', 'Lindmark, A', 'Olsson, I']","['Gullberg U', 'Andersson E', 'Garwicz D', 'Lindmark A', 'Olsson I']","['Department of Medicine, Research Department 2, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Neutrophil Activation', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism/ultrastructure', '*Protein Biosynthesis']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1997.tb00940.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1997 Mar;58(3):137-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1997.tb00940.x.,,134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 5637 cell line-conditioned medium (5637 CM) stimulated proliferation of human growth factor-dependent leukemia cell lines in a dose-dependent fashion. Quantitation by specific ELISA and by bioassays detected high amounts of G-CSF and GM-CSF and smaller quantities of IL-1beta, M-CSF and SCF in 5637 CM; the concentration of IL-3 was below the detection level of the ELISA, if present at all. The G-CSF and GM-CSF activities secreted by 5637 cells could be inhibited specifically by neutralizing anti-G-CSF and anti-GM-CSF antibodies. In conclusion, 5637 bladder carcinoma cells constitutively produce and secrete several functionally active cytokines; 5637 CM is a valuable, reliable and inexpensive source for cytokines, for instance for the culture of growth factor-responsive or -dependent hematopoietic primary cells and cell lines.","['Quentmeier, H', 'Zaborski, M', 'Drexler, H G']","['Quentmeier H', 'Zaborski M', 'Drexler HG']","['German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany. hqu@gbf-braunschweig.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Cytokines)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Carcinoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212696001324 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00132-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 Apr;21(4):343-50. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00132-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoreactivity for the mdr1 gene product was positive in 27 out of 81 (33%) patients. Immunoreactivity with the anti-mdr3 P-gp MoAb was positive in 20 out of 81 (25%) patients. Of 54 patients with acute leukemia, 17 (31%) were positive for mdr1 P-gp and 8 (15%) for mdr3 P-gp. A high proportion (60%) of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were mdr3 P-gp positive. Of the patients with granular-lymphocyte proliferative disorder (GLPD), a chronic T-cell or natural killer cell leukemia, 8/17 (47%) were positive for mdr1 P-gp and 6/17 (35%) for mdr3 P-gp. Of 23 patients with chronic leukemia (CLL and GLPD), 10 (37%) were positive for mdr1 P-gp and 12 (44%) for mdr3 P-gp. To clarify the function of the mdr3 P-gp, we examined the intracellular rhodamine123 (Rh123) levels of mdr1 P-gp-negative and mdr3 P-gp-positive leukemic cells from patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia, on the addition of 10 microM cyclosporin A (CyA). The addition of CyA led to significant increases in intracellular Rh123 levels in mdr1 P-gp-negative and mdr3 P-gp-positive leukemic cells. Results of the assay for dye efflux suggested that the mdr3 P-gp has a role in drug resistance, and functional drug-efflux capacity. In 31 acute leukemia patients at initial diagnosis, mdr1 or mdr3 P-gp expression correlated significantly to an outcome of complete remission (CR). In 54 acute leukemia patients, exposure to precytotoxic agents correlated significantly to expression, with a significant higher number of patients mdr1 or mdr3 P-gp positive than negative. In the 54 patients with acute leukemia, mdr1 P-gp expression correlated to mdr3 P-gp expression significantly (p=0.0007). In the 27 patients with chronic leukemia (CLL and GLPD), mdr1 and mdr3 P-gp expression did not correlate to exposure to precytotoxic agents, nor did mdr1 P-gp expression correlate to mdr3 P-gp expression. It may be speculated that precytotoxic agents induced mdr1 and mdr3 P-gp expression in acute leukemia; however, in chronic leukemia, both P-gps were expressed independently of exposure to precytotoxic agents.","['Arai, Y', 'Masuda, M', 'Sugawara, I', 'Arai, T', 'Motoji, T', 'Tsuruo, T', 'Oshimi, K', 'Mizoguchi, H']","['Arai Y', 'Masuda M', 'Sugawara I', 'Arai T', 'Motoji T', 'Tsuruo T', 'Oshimi K', 'Mizoguchi H']","[""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical College, Shinjuku-ku, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '9EI49ZU76O (multidrug resistance protein 3)']",IM,"['*ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212696001300 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00130-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 Apr;21(4):313-9. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00130-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

G-CSF was the most powerful stimulator of leukemic colony formation in five out of 10 patients, but was neither the major stimulant of self-renewal of the blast stem cells nor an inducer of maturation. In contrast, ATRA was highly effective in inducing morphological maturation of leukemic promyelocytes, but variable results were obtained in regard to its effects on the growth of blast stem cells: ATRA suppressed both clonal growth and self-renewal in some patients, but was inactive or even had stimulating effects in the other patients.

In addition, we demonstrate that the recently characterized histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) interacts with Sin3A and SMRT to form a multisubunit repressor complex.

This work establishes a convergence of repression pathways for bHLH-Zip proteins and nuclear receptors and suggests this type of regulation may be more widely conserved than previously suspected.","['Nagy, L', 'Kao, H Y', 'Chakravarti, D', 'Lin, R J', 'Hassig, C A', 'Ayer, D E', 'Schreiber, S L', 'Evans, R M']","['Nagy L', 'Kao HY', 'Chakravarti D', 'Lin RJ', 'Hassig CA', 'Ayer DE', 'Schreiber SL', 'Evans RM']","['The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SIN3A transcription factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1997/05/02 00:00,1997/05/02 00:01,['1997/05/02 00:00'],"['1997/05/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/02 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0092-8674(00)80218-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0092-8674(00)80218-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1997 May 2;89(3):373-80. doi: 10.1016/s0092-8674(00)80218-4.,,,,,"['GM26444/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD27183/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

These diseases are characterized by threat to life and particularly by chronic, painful and debilitating courses that warrant aggressive therapy. Selection of patients will be difficult because of the variable disease course and the necessity to choose patients who still have reversible disease. The safety of both autologous and allogeneic stem cell grafting has progressed to the point where, in many cases, the risks of the disease far outweigh those of transplantation. In my opinion the data presented at this symposium show that we should proceed cautiously with both autologous and allogeneic stem cell grafts. Purified stem cells, which have the advantage of being free of lymphocytes, should be used for the first series of autologous studies. These studies are attractive because of the low risk of transplant related complications but are less likely to be curative. Allogeneic grafts from perfectly matched donors have the advantage of providing a completely new immunological environment. For this reason, I believe that curative results are most probable after allogeneic stem cell engraftment. Emphasis should be on the identification of patients with HLA matched siblings. Initially, these studies will be carried out in patients with advanced disease, as was the case in the early days of transplantation for leukemia. In considering more aggressive treatment for autoimmune diseases it appears there are 3 possible approaches. First, and most conservative, is to store peripheral blood stem cells for possible future marrow rescue and then to give higher doses of immunosuppressive agents, especially in combination, to see whether there is an improvement over conventional doses. Second, for those who prefer a conservative approach to stem cell transplantation, is to give myeloablative and lymphoablative chemotherapy followed by purified (lymphocyte-free) hematopoietic stem cells. Third, and most likely to be curative, is myeloablative and lymphoablative therapy followed by stem cells from an HLA matched family member with subsequent short methotrexate and cyclosporine treatment to control GVHD. As we have heard, there are differences of opinion about whether the preparative regimen should include irradiation. It should be pointed out that total body irradiation is the most effective way to destroy lymphoid cells throughout the body. Careful monitoring of accumulating clinical results will pilot future investigation.","['Thomas, E D']",['Thomas ED'],"['University of Washington, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Canada,J Rheumatol Suppl,The Journal of rheumatology.

They may be derived from an HLA matched individual (allogeneic) or from the patient (autologous). Allogeneic BMT is associated with a 15 to 35% mortality, largely due to graft versus host disease. Autologous HSC are used to rescue the patient after severe immunosuppression, and the transplant related mortality is 3 to 5%. The opportunity to ablate severe autoimmune disease with increased safety is particularly attractive for necrotizing vasculitides, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, primary Sjogren's syndrome, systemic juvenile arthritis, relapsing polychondritis, and Behcet's disease, where correct selection of cases would ensure an acceptable benefit/risk ratio. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis associated arthritis (PsA) and some non-rheumatic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus may also be candidates, but careful selection of patients with a poor prognosis is necessary. There are allogeneic BMT data from patients with aplastic anemia or leukemia and concurrent RA, PsA, and IBD and also autologous HSC BMT data from animal models to support the concept of cure.

This procedure may be appropriate for patients with severe combined immunodeficiency disease, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and after lethal myeloablation for treatment of leukemia. Preclinical studies in experimental mice with autoimmune disorders indicate that BMT may successfully prevent the development or induce remission of disease. In some experimental models both marrow and stroma must be transplanted for a successful outcome. Allogeneic, rather than syngeneic, transplants are required for successful outcome in these genetically based spontaneous models of autoimmune disease. However, remissions of relapsing forms of demyelinating autoimmune (acquired) central nervous system diseases can be achieved with both syngeneic and allogeneic marrow transplantation. These preclinical studies form part of the rationale for considering BMT as treatment for severe autoimmune diseases.","['Good, R A', 'Ikehara, S']","['Good RA', 'Ikehara S']","['University of South Florida, St. Petersburg, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Canada,J Rheumatol Suppl,The Journal of rheumatology.

Analysis was carried out at diagnosis, during clinical response induced by interferon alfa-2h/prednisone therapy, and later at relapse. Our results show that together with the CD117 and IgE characteristic markers, at diagnosis BM MC showed strong expression of CD11c, CD13, CD29, CD33, CD44, CD45, CD63, and CD71, and they were also positive for CD2, CD22, CD25, and CD54 although at a lower level. PB MC displayed similar immunophenotypic characteristics although they had a lower expression of CD11c, CD25, CD33, CD63, CD69, and CD71 with a higher reactivity for CD117. Unlike BM MC, PB MC were weakly positive for CD41a and CD61. Sequential studies showed decreased numbers of both BM and PB MC during clinical response associated with a higher expression of the CD29 and CD54 adhesion molecules. In turn, clinical relapse was related to increased numbers of PB and BM MC together with lower CD2, CD11c, CD45, and and CD54 expression and a higher reactivity for the CD117 and CD25 antigens. CD2 had become negative at the last follow-up study. In addition, an increased proportion of S-phase MC was observed at relapse.

Two different forms of OSM were observed, one of M(r) 22,000 and the other of M(r) 36,000. In the prepubertal rat testis [19 days post coitum, 8 days post partum (dpp), and 15 dpp], the form with the higher molecular weight prevailed, whereas in the maturing testis (30 dpp, 45 dpp, and 12 weeks post partum), a shift toward the lower molecular weight form was observed, as well as a decrease in its relative amount. By immunohistochemistry on testicular sections, OSM-specific immunostaining was observed in the interstitial tissue at every age studied. In contrast, OSM immunoreaction was localized in the Sertoli cells exclusively around the start of spermatogenesis, being strongest at 3 dpp. In vitro studies revealed that neonatal Sertoli cells produce OSM. The possible role of OSM at the start of spermatogenesis was investigated by using a coculture of Sertoli cells and gonocytes isolated from newborn rats. OSM significantly increased the survival of both Sertoli cells and gonocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The proliferative activity of the Sertoli cells was not affected by OSM, whereas that of gonocytes was increased by almost 60% after 6 days of culture. Comparison of the effect of OSM on these cocultures with other members of the interleukin 6 family of cytokines demonstrated that this factor is more potent than leukemia inhibitory factor or ciliary neurotrophic factor. On the basis of these findings, it can be concluded that OSM is present in the rat testis, and it is likely to play an important role at the start of spermatogenesis.","['de Miguel, M P', 'de Boer-Brouwer, M', 'de Rooij, D G', 'Paniagua, R', 'van Dissel-Emiliani, F M']","['de Miguel MP', 'de Boer-Brouwer M', 'de Rooij DG', 'Paniagua R', 'van Dissel-Emiliani FM']","['Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, University of Alcala, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Peptides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytokines/analysis/metabolism', 'Male', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/analysis/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', '*Spermatogenesis', 'Testis/cytology/growth & development/*metabolism']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1997 May;8(5):611-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy six clones gave detectable immunofluorescence staining on LCLs. Five independent monoclonal antibodies detected a group of apparently novel, high M(r) (> 200,000) proteins that shared common features of subcellular distribution. In LCLs, these proteins were preferentially associated with vimentin filaments in the cytoplasm and with distinct nuclear foci. The appearance of the latter differed from the premyelocytic leukemia-associated protein, EBV nuclear antigen #5, and retinoblastoma-protein-positive bodies that were used for immunization. They seemed to be connected to the cytoplasmic filaments through thin fibrillar nuclear structures. In mitotic cells, these complex structures rearranged into a perichromosomal basket that was associated with vimentin filaments. The target proteins, operationally designated as proteins associated with nuclear dots and cytoplasmic filaments (pNDCFs), were not present in resting human B cells or were expressed at a low level. The level increased considerably after EBV infection or mitogenic stimulation by interleukin 4 and anti-CD40 antibodies. In Burkitt lymphoma (BL) type I lines phenotypically representative of the in vivo tumors, the pNDCFs were either absent or exclusively localized to the nucleus, usually to well-defined nuclear foci. EBV-positive type I BLs often shift to a more LCL-like (type III) phenotype during prolonged in vitro propagation. Type I cells express only EBV nuclear antigen 1 and the surface markers CD10 and CD77, whereas type III express all nine growth-associated EBV-encoded proteins and a gamut of B-cell activation markers. Most of the type III BL cell lines contained increased amounts of pNDCFs bound to cytoplasmic filaments, as seen in the LCLs. We propose that the expression of vimentin-associated pNDCFs should be included in the definition of type III BL phenotype.","['Szekely, L', 'Pokrovskaja, K', 'Klein, G']","['Szekely L', 'Pokrovskaja K', 'Klein G']","['Microbiology and Tumor Biology Center, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,['0 (Nuclear Proteins)'],IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', '*Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1997 May;8(5):599-609.,,,,,['2 RO1 CA14054-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

TNF-alpha release peaked at 24 h and decreased thereafter, and it was dose dependent and preceded by an increase of TNF-alpha mRNA detectable after 3 h of stimulation with mAb L243. Secreted TNF-alpha mediated the enhancement of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding activity; in fact, the triggering of HLA-DR antigens in the presence of antihuman TNF-alpha-neutralizing antibodies did not upregulate NF-kappa B and AP-1. In contrast, released TNF-alpha was not responsible for the homotypic aggregation of Ri-I, Ci-I, Sc-I, and Raji cells induced by mAb L243, and it did not affect the proliferation of B cells investigated. Altogether, our data demonstrate that: (a) the ability of B cells to release TNF-alpha after triggering of HLA-DR antigens depends on their stage of differentiation; (b) levels of released TNF-alpha seem to correlate with the stage of B-cell maturation but do not correlate with the amounts of cell surface HLA-DR antigens; (c) secreted TNF-alpha regulates the levels of expression of NF-kappa B and AP-1 by an autocrine loop; and (d) intracellular signals mediating TNF-alpha release by B cells are distinct from those regulating homotypic aggregation and proliferation.","['Coral, S', 'Pucillo, C', 'Leonardi, A', 'Fonsatti, E', 'Altomonte, M', 'Maio, M']","['Coral S', 'Pucillo C', 'Leonardi A', 'Fonsatti E', 'Altomonte M', 'Maio M']","['Advanced Immunotherapy Unit, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'NF-kappa B/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*immunology']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1997 May;8(5):581-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effects of various BMT regimens on children's growth and development have been poorly documented to date. Twins serve as ideal subjects to study the impact of medical treatment, since they control for nonmedical (genetic and environmental) influences upon neurodevelopmental outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two cases of monozygotic twins are presented to illustrate the impact of BMT regimens. Growth data and neurocognitive testing are presented for each patient (affected twin) in relation to his/her syngeneic BMT donor and case control (control twin). RESULTS: These two cases illustrate the growth retardation that has been reported after BMT. However, changes in growth trends across twins appear to have begun after diagnosis, rather than after BMT per se. Comparisons of cognitive test results within these twin pairs illustrate learning problems in the affected twins. However, there was also evidence of learning anomalies in the unaffected twins. CONCLUSIONS: Results underscore the importance of longitudinal assessment in order to identify the side effects of BMT regimens for children. Differences across the two cases highlight important research questions regarding variables associated with patients, disease, and treatment (e.g., age at the time of BMT, previous neurotoxic treatments, underlying disease) and emphasize the importance of controls in this line of research.","['McCabe, M A', 'Crowe, H', 'Quinones, R']","['McCabe MA', 'Crowe H', 'Quinones R']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, D.C., USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Developmental Disabilities/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neuroblastoma/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Twins']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199703000-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1997 Mar-Apr;19(2):145-50. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199703000-00010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Within a cohort of 15 children, two patients had DS. Transplantation of CD34+ cells from haploidentical parents was performed after the children were conditioned with fractionated total body irradiation, cyclophosphamide, and antithymocyte globulin (ATG). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and a short course of methotrexate. RESULTS: The preparative regimen was well tolerated, and engraftment of polymorphonuclear cells and platelets took place promptly (by day 20) in both patients with DS. However, both patients with DS experienced severe grade IV GVHD that was limited to the skin and was refractory to salvage with high-dose methylprednisolone therapy. In one patient, GVHD responded to second-line salvage therapy with ATG, but the patient died on day 234 from leukemic relapse. The second patient had GVHD that did not respond to ATG and died of multisystem organ failure and refractory GVHD on day 44. Two of two DS patients had steroid refractory severe acute GVHD of the skin, while only one of 11 evaluated and identically treated non-DS patients had severe GVHD (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These observations in patients who underwent mismatched bone marrow transplantation suggests that patients with DS have an increased risk of severe acute GVHD of the skin in this context.","['Mogul, M J', 'Forte, K J', 'Holland, H K', 'Turner, C W', 'Benyunes, M C', 'Yeager, A M']","['Mogul MJ', 'Forte KJ', 'Holland HK', 'Turner CW', 'Benyunes MC', 'Yeager AM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Steroids)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Down Syndrome', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Skin Diseases/*etiology/immunology', 'Steroids/pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199703000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1997 Mar-Apr;19(2):142-4. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199703000-00009.,,,,,"['R01 CA40282/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS24097/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA 20549/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO).,102-9,"PURPOSE: To study the risk of non-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) relapse in relation to the routines of administration of oral methotrexate (MTX) and 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and to the erythrocyte (E) levels of the intracellular cytotoxic metabolites, that is, MTX polyglutamates and 6-thioguanine nucleotides (E-MTX and E-6TGN). PATIENTS AND METHODS: E-MTX and E-6TGN levels were measured at least three times (medians, eight and nine) in 294 children with non-B-cell ALL during oral MTX and 6MP therapy. For each patient, we registered (a) the individual circadian schedule of drug administration and (b) the coadministration of food, and (c) calculated a mean (m) of all E-MTX and E-6TGN measurements and (d) the product of mE-MTX and mE-6TGN (mE-MTX*6TGN), due to their synergistic action. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients were on a morning schedule, 219 were on an evening schedule, and 33 had miscellaneous routines. A total of 149 patients took the drugs with meals, 106 took the drugs between meals, and 39 had varying routines. With a median follow-up of 78 months, ALL has recurred in 66 patients. The patients on an evening schedule had a superior outcome [probability of event-free survival (pEFS) = 0.82 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.57 +/- 0.08; p = 0.0002], whereas the coadministration of food did not significantly influence outcome. Patients with a mE-MTX*6TGN < 813 [product of median mE-MTX (4.7 nmol/mmol Hb) and mE-6TGN (173 nmol/mmol Hb)] had an inferior outcome (pEFS = 0.70 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.85 +/- 0.03; p = 0.003), even if only patients on an evening schedule were analyzed. Thus, 109 patients on the MTX/6MP evening schedule with an mE-MTX*6TGN < or = 813 (nmol/mmol Hb)2 had a pEFS of 0.89 +/- 0.03 and a probability of continuous hematopoietic remission of 0.91 +/- 0.03. CONCLUSIONS: An evening schedule should be recommended for oral MTX/6MP maintenance therapy. The value of individual dose adjustments by E-MTX and E-6TGN remains to be determined in prospective randomized trials.","['Schmiegelow, K', 'Glomstein, A', 'Kristinsson, J', 'Salmi, T', 'Schroder, H', 'Bjork, O']","['Schmiegelow K', 'Glomstein A', 'Kristinsson J', 'Salmi T', 'Schroder H', 'Bjork O']","['Section of Clinical Hematology and Oncology, Juliane Marie Center, University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Recurrence']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199703000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1997 Mar-Apr;19(2):102-9. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199703000-00002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This discrepancy, coupled with the geographic and temporal variations in the incidence of childhood ALL, have led to speculation that factors associated with socioeconomic status (SES) may play an important role in its etiology. Because most of the variation is accounted for by the occurrence of a peak in incidence between the ages of 2 and 5 years, the purpose of this study was to compare the SES of children diagnosed with ALL between the peak ages of 2-5 years with those children diagnosed at other ages (birth-1 year and 6-14 years). METHODS: Patients included 4210 children who were diagnosed with ALL between January 1, 1989 and December 31, 1991 by a member institution of the Children's Cancer Group or the Pediatric Oncology Group. Of these children, 3614 were white and 596 were African American. The SES of a case was defined as the SES of the child's zip code of residence at the time of diagnosis. Five sociodemographic variable categories for each zip code were obtained from the 1990 U.S. Census including per capita income, number of housing units by household income, number of housing units by level of urbanization, number of persons older than 25 years by educational attainment, and number of persons by occupation. Mean values were compared for white children versus African American children, and peak ages (2-5 years) versus nonpeak ages (birth-1 year and 6-14 years) for both whites and African Americans. In addition, Wilcoxon's rank sum tests were performed. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences between the means in each of the socioeconomic categories when African Americans were compared with whites. However, within race, the means of the SES variables for white children diagnosed during the peak ages (2-5 years) were not significantly different from children diagnosed at other ages (birth-1 year and 6-14 years). Similarly, all but one of the comparisons for African American children yielded nonstatistically significant results. Similar results were obtained from the Wilcoxon's rank sum tests. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this analysis suggest that age differences in childhood ALL incidence may not be solely accounted for by SES differences.","['Swensen, A R', 'Ross, J A', 'Severson, R K', 'Pollock, B H', 'Robison, L L']","['Swensen AR', 'Ross JA', 'Severson RK', 'Pollock BH', 'Robison LL']","['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology and Clinical Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'African Americans/statistics & numerical data', 'Age Factors', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Occupations/statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Residence Characteristics', '*Social Class', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Urban Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data']",1997/05/15 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/05/15 00:00'],"['1997/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19970515)79:10<2045::AID-CNCR28>3.0.CO;2-T [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19970515)79:10<2045::aid-cncr28>3.0.co;2-t [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1997 May 15;79(10):2045-51. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19970515)79:10<2045::aid-cncr28>3.0.co;2-t.,,,,,"['CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 09607/PHS HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Using a monoclonal antibody raised against the rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells, we identified that platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1 or CD31) was tyrosine phosphorylated in these cells. Aggregation of PECAM-1 did not induce a detectable increase in its tyrosine phosphorylation, nor did it result in degranulation. However, the minimal tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 in nonstimulated cells was dramatically increased after FcepsilonRI aggregation. This receptor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 was an early event, independent of Ca2+ influx or of the activation of protein kinase C and of cell adhesion. PECAM-1 is an adhesion molecule that is required for the transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelium into sites of inflammation. Therefore tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 may modulate its interaction with other molecules, thereby regulating the migration of basophils into inflammatory sites.","['Sagawa, K', 'Swaim, W', 'Zhang, J', 'Unsworth, E', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Sagawa K', 'Swaim W', 'Zhang J', 'Unsworth E', 'Siraganian RP']","['Laboratory of Immunology, NIDR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*metabolism', 'Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1997/05/16 00:00,1997/05/16 00:01,['1997/05/16 00:00'],"['1997/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.20.13412 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)56943-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 May 16;272(20):13412-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.20.13412.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alterations of both pathways contribute to a clonal expansion of cancer cells. Bcl-2 and its family play an important role in the regulation of the apoptotic pathway. Apoptosis or programmed cell death is an active form of cell suicide that is characterized by specific morphological and biochemical events. These include cleavege of genomic DNA into oligonucleosome-length DNA fragments by endonucleases, chromatin condensation and marginalization, nuclear fragmentation, plasma membrane blebbing, and cell shrinkage. Though the role of apoptosis is clearly defined in the maintaining of physiological tissue homeostasis, several pathological conditions and external factors cause apoptosis. Anticancer drugs and radiation, two of the most important tools in the cancer treatment, cause apoptotic cell death. The understanding of the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the apoptosis in response to different types of DNA damage might provide relevant information to improve cancer treatment.

To recognise the clinico-biological profile of a group of patients diagnosed of polycythaemia vera (PV) in our centre in the last 30 years. 2. To identify the evolutive patterns of haematological transformation. 3. To evaluate the effect of therapy on the survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical records of 74 patients (median age 62 years, male/female = 0.94, followed-up for 6-357 months, median 64 months) were reviewed. Clinico-biological data at diagnosis, therapy, complications and evolution of the haematological picture were evaluated in each case. The actuarial survival in the series was compared to that of the normal population. RESULTS: The clinico-analytical data and diagnostic features were identical to other series reported. Mild increases of bone marrow reticulin was present in two thirds of the cases, overt myelofibrosis being found in only 10% of the patients. Abnormal karyotype was seen in 9% of the patients (11q-, -Y). Phlebotomy was the only treatment in eight cases, without increased incidence of thrombotic phenomena. The remainders received myelosuppressive therapy (32P, busulphan, pipobroman, hydroxyurea, etc.), thrombotic complications appearing in 8 cases and haemorrhagic complications in 4 others. One of these latter patients developed oesophageal carcinoma. The haematological picture evolved into toxic aplastic anaemia in 2 cases; myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MF/MM) in 8; myelodysplastic sindromes (MDS) in 5, three of them RAEB; and acute myelogenous leukaemia in 3 cases, two of them as the final stage of previous MF/MM and MDS/ RAEB. The actuarial survival was 71% at ten years and 46% at fifteen years, and the median survival as a whole was 13.5 years. CONCLUSIONS: 1: The treatment, mostly myelosuppressive, given to these patients attained a survival similar to that of the general population. 2: Of the cases with known evolution, 15.6% developed MF/MM, its incidence being higher in patients treated only with phlebotomy (37%). 3: The incidence of malignant evolution, i.e., to RAEB/AML, amongst those patients followed-up was 10.6%.","['Sanchez Fayos, J', 'Prieto, E', 'Roman, A', 'Soto de Ozaeta, C', 'Nevado, I', 'Richart, A', 'Chica, E', 'Loscertales, J', 'Calabuig, T', 'Benitez, J', 'Outeirino, J']","['Sanchez Fayos J', 'Prieto E', 'Roman A', 'Soto de Ozaeta C', 'Nevado I', 'Richart A', 'Chica E', 'Loscertales J', 'Calabuig T', 'Benitez J', 'Outeirino J']","['Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autonoma, Madrid.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1996 Dec;41(6):447-57.,,55,,,,,"La policitemia vera como panmielopatia clonal multifasica: perfil diagnostico, evolucion patocronica y efecto de la terapeutica sobre la supervivencia de 74 casos.",,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two breast cancers as positive samples were used and 34 samples of mononucleated blood cells as negative controls: 18 peripheral blood samples from normal subjects, 14 from different types of leukaemias (M3, M4Eo, M2, etc.) and two from two patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma. The method studied is a nested RT-PCR that amplifies the CK19 expression from the sample RNA extracted following the method of phenol-chloroform. RESULTS: The right performance of the method is demonstrated by observing the detection of CK19 transcripts in the breast cancer RNA and by obtaining good blank results both with non transcribed RNA and with DNA. Moreover, the method has an excellent sensitivity such as to allow the detection of CK19 transcripts in a 10(-6) dilution of cDNA reverse transcribed from 1 microgram of breast cancer RNA. The CK19 transcripts were also detected in the 64% of RNA obtained from the mononucleated blood cells controls, although the percentage of positivities was lower (47%) in the RNA from peripheral blood samples. Nevertheless it should be remarked that the levels of CK19 expression in the blood mononucleated cells is almost negligible since it used to extinguish at 1:5 cDNA dilution. CONCLUSIONS: The method studied is specific and has a high sensitivity that explains the detection of CK19 illegitimate expression approximately a half in mononucleated blood cells negative controls. However, the levels of CK19 expression in mononucleated blood cells were almost negligible and it used to extinguish at 1:5 cDNA dilution, therefore it could be concluded that the method might be useful to detect breast cancer occult tumours cells in mononucleated blood cell collection, always provided that a lower amount of cDNA is taken, thus decreasing to nil almost the false positive samples and keeping always a good sensitivity.","['Lopez Guerrero, J A', 'Bolufer, P', 'Barragan, E', 'Sanz Alonso, M', 'Palau, J', 'Sempere, A', 'De la Rubia, J', 'Bonanad, S', 'Torregrosa, M D']","['Lopez Guerrero JA', 'Bolufer P', 'Barragan E', 'Sanz Alonso M', 'Palau J', 'Sempere A', 'De la Rubia J', 'Bonanad S', 'Torregrosa MD']","['Departmento de Biopatologia Clinica, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/blood/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Keratins/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1996 Dec;41(6):441-6.,,,,,,,Niveles de expresion de la citoqueratina CK19 en celulas sanguineas mononucleadas evaluada mediante un metodo de PCR reversa (RT-PCR).,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to establish growth and pubertal development in the group of children who had been previously successfully treated for ALL. METHODS AND RESULTS: 58 children (30 F, 28 M, age 8-18 y.) in complete initial remission lasting 4-15 y. (m 8 y.) after standard antileukemic therapy (including cranial irradiation) completed 2-9 y. ago (m 3 including y.) were studied. Standard deviation score (SDS) of standing height (SH) to chronological age (CA) and to genetic target height (GTH), index of body proportionality and timing of puberty were followed up. The final height attained 21 girls and 3 boys. The height of the boys differed neither from the average for our men, nor from their GTH. Girls: SH 148 cm-169 cm, SH of 7 girls > or = -1.5 SDS, 8 girls > or = -1.5 SDS to their GTH. The final height didn't reach yet 23 boys and 9 girls. Their SH to CA as well as SH to GTH didn't substantially differ from average. Index of body proportionality > or = 1.5 SDS in 12/30 girls and 6/28 boys. Menarche was already reached in 25 girls in age ranging from 10-15 y. (mean 11.3 y.), what was less than average for our population (13.3 y.). CONCLUSION: Even the height of prepubertal children under study didn't differ from average, the final height of girls (boys could not be evaluated because of small numbers) was significantly lower as could be expected. We suppose the early ending of puberty as a contributing factor of short stature in girls. Clear tendency to obesity especially among older girls was observed.

The maximum dose tolerated by the patient is limited by the toxicity to normal tissue, hematopoiesis being frequently the most sensitive system. Transfer of drug resistance genes to hematopoietic cells could protect them against chemotherapy-related toxicity and thus could be a way of gene therapy in cancer. Methylating and chloroethylating derivatives of nitrosourea are effective anticancer drugs, however, acute hematopoietic toxicity and late risk of leukemia are serious side effects. The major lesion responsible for toxic and mutagenic effects of alkylnitrosoureas is O6-alkylation of guanine in DNA. This lesion is specifically repaired by O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase and hematopoietic cells can be protected against toxic and mutagenic effect of nitrosoureas by alkyltransferase gene transfer. Endogenous alkyltransferase in tumor tissue could be inactivated by administration of O6-benzylguanine, while hematopoietic cells could still be chemoprotected by inhibitor-resistant alkyltransferase gene transfer. This approach could increase the therapeutic efficacy of nitrosoureas in gene therapy augmented cancer treatment.","['Jelinek, J', 'Fairbairn, L J', 'Dexter, T M', 'Rafferty, J A', 'Stocking, C', 'Baum, C', 'Ostertag, W', 'Margison, G P']","['Jelinek J', 'Fairbairn LJ', 'Dexter TM', 'Rafferty JA', 'Stocking C', 'Baum C', 'Ostertag W', 'Margison GP']","['Ustav hematologie a krevni transfuze, Praha.']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/physiopathology/*therapy']",1997/01/08 00:00,1997/01/08 00:01,['1997/01/08 00:00'],"['1997/01/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/08 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 1997 Jan 8;136(1):22-6.,,,,,,,Pomuze prenos genu pro rezistenci k cytostatikum zvysit odolnost krvetvorby pri lecbe zhoubnych nadoru?,,,,,,,,,

To further study this specific virus-astrocyte interaction in a homogenous population, several immortal astrocyte lines were established from neonatal FVB/N mice using the temperature-sensitive SV40 tsA58 T antigen. These cells expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin and T antigen; appeared nontransformed; were star-shape with long processes. They were susceptible to ts1 infection and suffered a cytopathic effect similar to that caused by ts1 infection of primary astrocytes. This cytopathic effect was characterized by growth inhibition, loss of cell processes and syncytium formation. Some cells also rounded up, formed mini cells and became detached from the culture dish. As in primary astrocytes, the processing of gPr80env in the immortalized astrocytes was inefficient. Since the envelope proteins interact with the ecotropic MuLV receptor both intracellularly and on the cell surface and since the receptor has been shown to be an arginine transporter, we attempted to determine the effect of ts1 on arginine uptake by these cells. Our results showed that in both immortalized and primary astrocytes, ts1 infection reduced the uptake of arginine more than did wild-type virus infection. Since arginine localizes predominantly in astrocytes in the CNS and has diverse functions, the decrease of arginine uptake in ts1-infected astrocytes may alter the metabolism of these cells, leading to impairment of their functions.","['Lin, Y C', 'Chow, C W', 'Yuen, P H', 'Wong, P K']","['Lin YC', 'Chow CW', 'Yuen PH', 'Wong PK']","['University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park-Research Division, Smithville 78957, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurovirol,Journal of neurovirology,9508123,"['0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (p15E protein, Murine leukemia virus)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Arginine/metabolism', 'Astrocytes/metabolism/ultrastructure/*virology', 'Brain Stem/cytology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cerebral Cortex/cytology', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/growth & development/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/biosynthesis', 'Simian virus 40/genetics/physiology', 'Temperature', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Virulence', 'Virus Cultivation', 'Virus Replication']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/13550289709015790 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurovirol. 1997 Feb;3(1):28-37. doi: 10.3109/13550289709015790.,,,,,"['AI 28283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 45124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The HTLV-1 genome encodes a protein, tax1, an autoregulator of enhanced viral RNA transcription, that also transactivates/represses certain cellular gene promoters. Enkephalins are opioid peptides that function as neurotransmitters and neuroimmunomodulators. We earlier reported that the proenkephalin gene is transactivated by tax1 protein in glial cells. The nucleotide sequence upstream of -190 base pairs in the proenkephalin gene promoter is necessary for maximal transactivation by tax1 while the sequence downstream of -190 bp confers modest activation by tax1. We investigated the cellular transcription factors in tax1 expressing glial cells that associate with the proenkephalin promoter and herein demonstrate the enhanced interaction and involvement of c-Fos/c-Jun proteins in the complexes formed at the AP-1 site. The HTLV-1 tax1 expressing stable glial cell lines produced functional tax1 protein that increased the expression of endogenous proenkephalin gene. The comparative electrophoretic mobility shift and 'supershift' analysis using specific antibodies indicated the enhanced presence of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins in the DNA: protein complex formed at the AP-1 site. The c-Fos protein expression significantly increased in the tax1 expressing glial cells. The tax1 induced c-Fos protein levels and the concurrently increased association of c-Fos/c-Jun transcription factors at the AP-1 site imply a strong functional significance in the activation of proenkephalin gene expression in tax1 expressing glial cells.","['Fu, W', 'Shah, S R', 'Jiang, H', 'Hilt, D C', 'Dave, H P', 'Joshi, J B']","['Fu W', 'Shah SR', 'Jiang H', 'Hilt DC', 'Dave HP', 'Joshi JB']","['Laboratories of Molecular Biology/Gene Regulation Research, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Washington DC 20422, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurovirol,Journal of neurovirology,9508123,"['0 (Enkephalins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (proenkephalin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Brain Neoplasms/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enkephalins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, pX', 'Glioma/pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Neuroglia/metabolism/*virology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Precursors/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/physiology', 'Rats', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*physiology', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/13550289709015789 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurovirol. 1997 Feb;3(1):16-27. doi: 10.3109/13550289709015789.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A geographical analysis of cancers was conducted via two methods of spatial autocorrelation (SA). Many cancer sites (i.e., breast, lung, stomach) show a positive SA (p < 0.05), indicating an aggregation of cases. Several aggregation schemes observed in Quebec resemble those observed in Ontario. In women, the highest incidence rate increases are in leukemia and lung cancer; in men, prostate cancer and leukemia show the highest increase of rates (p < 0.01).

The drug (10 mg/m2) was given in a randomized cross-over design as 3 min and 2 h infusions for three consecutive days. Cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C, 1 g/m2) was given on days 1-4. The plasma concentration time course of Ida was most properly described by the three-compartment pharmacokinetic model, independent of administration time. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of Ida was reduced by a factor of 3 by increasing the infusion time from 3 min to 2 h. The pharmacokinetic pattern of the active metabolite idarubicinol (IdaOH) was only to a minor extent affected by the longer infusion time. The time course of IdaOH following each dose of Ida was accurately described by the one-compartment model with a first-order formation phase. The are under the plasma concentration versus time curves (AUC) of Ida and IdaOH were not affected by the administration time. Following Ida in combination with Ara-C, the medial duration of leukopenia (< 1.0 x 10(9)/l) was 14 days (range 5-56) and of thrombocytopenia (< 50 x 10(9)/l) was 22 days (range 7-120). The large majority of patients developed infectious complications. Two patients with MDS-AML showed a good response. The results of the present study give no evidence of reduced hematologic toxicity by increasing the administration time of Ida from 3 min to 2 h. However, minimizing Cmax, by administration of Ida as prolonged infusion during a 3 day course, might be clinically important in order to reduce cardiotoxicity and hopefully to increase anti-tumor efficacy through an increased accumulation of Ida and IdaOH in leukemic cells.","['Eksborg, S', 'Bjorkholm, M', 'Hast, R', 'Fagerlund, E']","['Eksborg S', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Hast R', 'Fagerlund E']","['Department of Medicine, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '86189-66-4 (idarubicinol)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-199701000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1997 Jan;8(1):42-7. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199701000-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The considered data are arranged in a two-way table by age group and calendar period, which are mostly subdivided into 5- or 10-year intervals. The disadvantage of this approach is the loss of information by data aggregation and the problems of estimating interactions in the two-way layout without replications. In this article we show how splines can be useful when yearly data, i.e., 1-year age groups and 1-year periods, are given. The estimated spline curves are still smooth and represent yearly changes in the time trends. Further, it is straightforward to include interaction terms by the tensor product of the spline functions. If the data are given in a nonrectangular table, e.g., 5-year age groups and 1-year periods, the period and cohort variables can be parameterized by splines, while the age variable is parameterized as fixed effect levels, which leads to a semiparametric apc model. An important methodological issue in developing the nonparametric and semiparametric models is stability of the estimated spline curve at the boundaries. Here cubic regression splines will be used, which are constrained to be linear in the tails. Another point of importance is the nonidentifiability problem due to the linear dependency of the three time variables. This will be handled by decomposing the basis of each spline by orthogonal projection into constant, linear, and nonlinear terms, as suggested by Holford (1983, Biometrics 39, 311-324) for the traditional apc model. The advantage of using splines for yearly data compared to the traditional approach for aggregated data is the more accurate curve estimation for the nonlinear trend changes and the simple way of modeling interactions between the time variables. The method will be demonstrated with hypothetical data as well as with cancer mortality data.","['Heuer, C']",['Heuer C'],"['Department of Biometry, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,,IM,"['Age Factors', '*Biometry', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Male', '*Models, Statistical', '*Regression Analysis', 'Time Factors']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biometrics. 1997 Mar;53(1):161-77.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rats were exposed briefly by inhalation to graded levels of monodisperse aerosols of 244Cm2O3 heat-treated at 1150 degrees C. The initial lung burden (ILB) of each animal was determined by the use of the gamma-ray-emitting radionuclide 243Cm in the aerosols. Seven groups of 84-day-old F344/Crl rats (a total of 637 males and 645 females) were exposed once to 244Cm2O3 or sham-exposed to filtered ambient air. Mean ILBs of all rats per group ranged from 0.51 +/- 0.17 (+/-SD) to 240 +/- 82 kBq kg-1 body weight. Mean lifetime alpha-particle doses to the lungs per group ranged from 0.20 +/- 0.069 (+/-SD) to 36 +/- 6.5 Gy. After death, each rat was radiographed and necropsied. Dose-related increases occurred in incidences of benign and malignant lung neoplasms, except for the groups of rats with higher mean ILBs that were examined histologically (98 +/- 18 and 240 +/- 77 kBq kg-1 body weight) in which survival was markedly decreased. Also, average alpha-particle doses of 0.0014 +/- 0.00058 (+/-SD) to 0.17 +/- 0.091 Gy and 0.18 +/- 0.007 to 1.6 +/- 1.1 Gy were also absorbed by the liver and skeleton, respectively, in the rats in the different exposure groups. Primary liver neoplasms occurred in several rats. However, the incidence of these lesions was not related to dose. Increased incidences of bone neoplasms occurred only in rats receiving higher doses to the skeleton. Excess numbers of rats with lung neoplasms per 10(4) Gy to the lung per group ranged from 760 +/- 430 (+/- SE) at a mean dose of 0.48 Gy to 84 +/- 16 at a mean dose of 37 Gy. Risk factors for the lowest and highest ILB kg-1 body weight groups were not considered reliable because of large errors associated with these calculations and the life-span shortening in the highest ILB kg-1 group. Inhaled 244Cm2O3 appeared to be about 50% less effective as a lung carcinogen in rats compared to 239PuO2 at similar doses.","['Lundgren, D L', 'Hahn, F F', 'Carlton, W W', 'Griffith, W C', 'Guilmette, R A', 'Gillett, N A']","['Lundgren DL', 'Hahn FF', 'Carlton WW', 'Griffith WC', 'Guilmette RA', 'Gillett NA']","['Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute, Lovelace Biomedical and Environmental Research Institute, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (Aerosols)', '53023GN24M (Plutonium)', 'M5LL84MZ2W (Curium)']",IM,"['Aerosols', 'Animals', 'Body Burden', 'Bone Neoplasms/etiology', 'Bone and Bones/*radiation effects', '*Curium/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', 'Liver/*radiation effects', 'Liver Neoplasms/etiology', 'Lung/*radiation effects', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Osteosarcoma/diagnostic imaging/etiology', '*Plutonium', 'Radiography', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1997 May;147(5):598-612.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The narrated interviews, tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim, were interpreted based on the following three questions: Why are there differences in these individuals' description of QOL? What are they talking about? Which phenomenon are they describing? The findings were interpreted, ""a feeling of uncertainty,"" which made the difference to their experience of QOL. This uncertainty was expressed in different forms and could be seen in different degrees. Uncertainty is an important factor affecting the QOL of these adults.

TRAP is an excellent cell marker for osteoclasts and macrophages and is being investigated as a serum marker for osteoclast activity in diseases of bone destruction. For decades, TRAP has also been used as a marker for hairy cell leukemia. Immunoassays for TRAP are sought to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the TRAP test for bone and hairy cells. Our laboratory recently developed a monoclonal antibody to TRAP (9C5) useful for immunohistochemical identification of TRAP-positive cells in paraffin sections. Herein, we characterize 9C5 in greater detail and report production of another anti-TRAP monoclonal antibody antibody (14G6) reactive with native, active enzyme antigen. Enzyme immunoassay, immunoprecipitation, western blot, and immunohistochemical analyses revealed the contrasting properties of 9C5 and 14G6. Antibody 9C5 reacts with a heat-denatured epitope and is suitable for denaturing western blot analysis and for immunohistochemistry. Antibody 14G6 reacts with a conformational determinant destroyed by heat and is suitable for immunoprecipitation of active TRAP, although 20% to 30% of activity is inhibited in the immune complexes. Having characterized several properties of these anti-TRAP antibodies, 9C5 and 14G6 may be useful for development of TRAP-specific immunoassays in bone pathology and hematology.

Two patients are presented illustrating some differences between enteral and parenteral feedings in children receiving intensive chemotherapy. Nasogastric glutamine-supplemented tube feedings were well tolerated both in the hospital and at home. The cost of care for the enterally supported child was less than one third of the TPN-supported child. Although TPN appears to be beneficial in some patients with cancer, it is expensive and is associated with several significant disadvantages. Among these are an increased incidence of both gram-positive and gram-negative infections and an increased incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Enteral nutrition is less costly than TPN and maintains the structural and functional integrity of the intestinal mucosa. The addition of certain substrates such as glutamine, arginine and omega-3 fatty acids may improve the body's immune response as well. We hypothesize that early glutamine supplemented tube feedings in children receiving intensive chemotherapy alone or in combination with bone marrow transplantation will result in improved nutrition with fewer infections and lower cost than TPN-supplemented patients.

Overexpression of IL-6 has been implicated in the pathology of a number of diseases including multiple myeloma, rheumatoid arthritis, Castleman's disease, psoriasis, and post-menopausal osteoporosis. Hence, selective antagonists of IL-6 action may offer therapeutic benefits. IL-6 is a member of the family of cytokines that includes interleukin-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, cardiotrophin-1, and ciliary neurotrophic factor. Like the other members of this family, IL-6 induces growth or differentiation via a receptor-system that involves a specific receptor and the use of a shared signaling subunit, gp130. Identification of the regions of IL-6 that are involved in the interactions with the IL-6 receptor, and gp130 is an important first step in the rational manipulation of the effects of this cytokine for therapeutic benefit. In this review, we focus on the sites on IL-6 which interact with its low-affinity specific receptor, the IL-6 receptor, and the high-affinity converter gp130. A tentative model for the IL-6 hexameric receptor ligand complex is presented and discussed with respect to the mechanism of action of the other members of the IL-6 family of cytokines.","['Simpson, R J', 'Hammacher, A', 'Smith, D K', 'Matthews, J M', 'Ward, L D']","['Simpson RJ', 'Hammacher A', 'Smith DK', 'Matthews JM', 'Ward LD']","['Joint Protein Structure Laboratory, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, (Melbourne Tumour Biology Branch), Parkville, Victoria, Australia. simpson@licre.ludwig.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Protein Sci,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,9211750,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Somatotropin)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*chemistry/*physiology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/immunology', 'Castleman Disease/immunology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Female', 'Growth Hormone/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/*chemistry/*physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Structural', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology', 'Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal/immunology', '*Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Psoriasis/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*chemistry/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Receptors, Somatotropin/chemistry', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pro.5560060501 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Sci. 1997 May;6(5):929-55. doi: 10.1002/pro.5560060501.,,338,PMC2143693,"['GENBANK/D13227', 'GENBANK/L26028', 'GENBANK/L26032', 'GENBANK/L34165', 'GENBANK/L46802', 'GENBANK/L46803', 'GENBANK/L46804', 'GENBANK/M24221', 'GENBANK/M26744', 'GENBANK/M80258', 'GENBANK/U12234', 'GENBANK/X57317', 'GENBANK/X68723', 'GENBANK/Y00081']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The stimulation of the inward rectifier by GTP gamma S was abolished by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. The inhibitory phase of the GTP gamma S-induced response was pertussis toxin-insensitive. Stimulation of the m1-muscarinic receptor expressed in the RBL cell after stable transfection, induced an inhibition of the inwardly rectifying currents. Application of protein kinase C activators such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, resulted in a strong inhibition of the currents. Application of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activator 8-bromo cAMP also induced an inhibition of the inward rectifier. It is concluded that the inward rectifier of the RBL-2H3 cell may be inhibited both by activation of protein kinase C and by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. As this type of inward rectifier is widely expressed in the nervous system, these data imply that the channel can be inhibited by receptors that stimulate phospholipase C and/or stimulate adenylyl cyclase, and can be activated by receptors that inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity.","['Jones, S V']",['Jones SV'],"['Department of Psychiatry, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington 05405, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Neuropharmacology,Neuropharmacology,0236217,"['0 (Muscarinic Agonists)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Receptors, Muscarinic)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Electrophysiology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/*pharmacology"", 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Muscarinic Agonists/pharmacology', 'Oocytes/metabolism', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Potassium Channels/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Muscarinic/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenopus laevis']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0028390896001426 [pii]', '10.1016/s0028-3908(96)00142-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuropharmacology. 1997 Feb;36(2):209-15. doi: 10.1016/s0028-3908(96)00142-6.,,,,,['NS 29634/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting fusion genes encode the two structurally unique PML/RARalpha and RARalpha/PML fusion proteins as well as aberrant PML gene products, the respective pathogenetic roles of which have not been elucidated. We have generated transgenic mice in which the PML/RARalpha fusion protein is specifically expressed in the myeloid-promyelocytic lineage. During their first year of life, all the PML/RARalpha transgenic mice have an abnormal hematopoiesis that can best be described as a myeloproliferative disorder. Between 12 and 14 months of age, 10% of them develop a form of acute leukemia with a differentiation block at the promyelocytic stage that closely mimics human APL even in its response to retinoic acid.

For this purpose, HLA-G1 and HLA-G2 cDNAs were transfected into the HLA class I-negative human K562 cell line, a known reference target for NK lysis. The HLA-G1 protein, encoded by a full-length mRNA, presents a structure similar to that of classical HLA class I antigens. The HLA-G2 protein, deduced from an alternatively spliced transcript, consists of the alpha1 domain linked to the alpha3 domain. In this study we demonstrate that (i) HLA-G2 is present at the cell surface as a truncated class I molecule associated with beta2-microglobulin; (ii) NK cytolysis, observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in polyclonal CD3(-) CD16(+) CD56(+) NK cells obtained from 20 donors, is inhibited by both HLA-G1 and HLA-G2; this HLA-G-mediated inhibition is reversed by blocking HLA-G with a specific mAb; this led us to the conjecture that HLA-G is the public ligand for NK inhibitory receptors (NKIR) present in all individuals; (iii) the alpha1 domain common to HLA-G1 and HLA-G2 could mediate this protection from NK lysis; and (iv) when transfected into the K562 cell line, both HLA-G1 and HLA-G2 abolish lysis by the T cell leukemia NK-like YT2C2 clone due to interaction between the HLA-G isoform on the target cell surface and a membrane receptor on YT2C2.

In order to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of CSF cytology results, the value of using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Tdt) and high-power (1,000x) light microscopy, together with conventional cytologic examination was assessed. In 33 CSF samples from ten multiply examined Tdt-positive ALL patients, original cytologic interpretations were compared to Tdt results. Cytology samples were reviewed by two pathologists (one with hematopathologic expertise). The cases in which cytologic interpretation did not correlate with Tdt result were first reviewed via 1,000x microscopy without knowledge of Tdt result, then re-reviewed with knowledge of Tdt result. Conventional cytology alone diagnosed 64% of cases accurately (Tdt representing the comparative standard). High-power microscopy increased the correlation to 82%. Use of high-power microscopy and knowledge of Tdt result together produced a total of 85% of cases with correlation of results. High-power microscopic examination therefore contributes significantly to the accurate diagnosis of ALL, and knowledge of the Tdt result at the time of cytologic examination produces an additional advantage in providing an objective measure for CSF involvement by leukemia. Using all three methods in conjunction is recommended in order to increase the overall accuracy of CSF examination for the detection of leukemic involvement in ALL patients.","['Desai, K', 'Fallon, M A', 'Willard-Smith, D', 'Wilbur, D C']","['Desai K', 'Fallon MA', 'Willard-Smith D', 'Wilbur DC']","['Cytopathology Laboratory, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington 06030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Diagn Cytopathol,Diagnostic cytopathology,8506895,['EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cytodiagnosis', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Humans', 'Microscopy/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis/enzymology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1997/05/01 00:00,2000/06/22 10:00,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/22 10:00 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0339(199705)16:5<413::AID-DC6>3.0.CO;2-C [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0339(199705)16:5<413::aid-dc6>3.0.co;2-c [doi]']",ppublish,Diagn Cytopathol. 1997 May;16(5):413-9. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0339(199705)16:5<413::aid-dc6>3.0.co;2-c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These molecules form multichain receptor complexes in order to exhibit high-affinity binding to, and mediate biological functions of, their respective cytokines. In most cases, these functional receptor complexes share common signal transducing receptor components that are also in the class I cytokine receptor family, i.e. gp130, common beta, and common gamma molecules. Interleukin-6 and related cytokines, interleukin-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1 are all pleiotropic and exhibit overlapping biological functions. Functional receptor complexes for this interleukin-6 family of cytokines share gp130 as a component critical for signal transduction. Unlike cytokines sharing common beta and common gamma chains that mainly function in hematopoietic and lymphoid cell systems, the interleukin-6 family of cytokines function extensively outside these systems as well, e.g. from the cardiovascular to the nervous system, owing to ubiquitously expressed gp130. Stimulation of cells with the interleukin-6 family of cytokines triggers homo- or hetero-dimerization of gp130. Although gp130 and its dimer partners possess no intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain, the dimerization of gp130 leads to activation of associated cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases and subsequent modification of transcription factors.

Oxidative stress can elicit positive responses such as cellular proliferation or activation, as well as negative responses such as growth inhibition or cell death. Cellular redox status is maintained by intracellular redox-regulating molecules, including thioredoxin (TRX). TRX is a small multifunctional protein that has a redox-active disulfide/dithiol within the conserved active site sequence: Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys. Adult T cell leukemia-derived factor (ADF), which we originally defined as an IL-2 receptor alpha-chain/Tac inducer produced by human T cell lymphotrophic virus-I (HTLV-I)-transformed T cells, has been identified as human TRX. TRX/ADF is a stress-inducible protein secreted from cells. TRX/ADF has both intracellular and extracellular functions as one of the key regulators of signaling in the cellular responses against various stresses. Extracellularly, TRX/ADF shows a cytoprotective activity against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and a growth-promoting effect as an autocrine growth factor. Intracellularly, TRX/ADF is involved in the regulation of protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions through the reduction/oxidation of protein cysteine residues. For example, TRX/ADF translocates from the cytosol into the nucleus by a variety of cellular stresses, to regulate the expression of various genes through the redox factor-1 (Ref-1)/APEX. Further studies to clarify the regulatory roles of TRX/ADF and its target molecules may elucidate the intracellular signaling pathways in the responses against various stresses. The concept of ""redox regulation"" is emerging as an understanding of the novel mechanisms in the pathogenesis of several disorders, including viral infections, immunodeficiency, malignant transformation, and degenerative disease.","['Nakamura, H', 'Nakamura, K', 'Yodoi, J']","['Nakamura H', 'Nakamura K', 'Yodoi J']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Immunol,Annual review of immunology,8309206,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thioredoxins/*metabolism']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1146/annurev.immunol.15.1.351 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Immunol. 1997;15:351-69. doi: 10.1146/annurev.immunol.15.1.351.,,93,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax protein of HTLV-I, which is considered oncogenic, binds to transcription factors or other cytoplasmic cellular molecules involved in the fundamental cell function and thereby induces cellular changes. The interaction between HTLV-I-infected cells with dysregulated function and different kinds of cells in the host, such as lymphocytes and vascular endothelial cells through viral peptides, antigen receptors cell adhesion molecules, and cytokines, appears to be one of the basic mechanisms underlying the development of HTLV-I-associated diseases. This interaction may play a major role in determining tumorigenicity and in forming clinical features of the diseases. The in vivo cell proliferation model of HTLV-I-infected cells using severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice can differentiate tumorigenicity from cell immortalization in vitro. The OX40 and its ligand gp34, which are induced by HTLV-I infection and directly mediate the adhesion between HTLV-I-infected T cells and vascular endothelial cells, may be critically involved in the localization and proliferation of HTLV-I-infected cells in vivo.","['Uchiyama, T']",['Uchiyama T'],"['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan. tuchiyam@virus1.virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Immunol,Annual review of immunology,8309206,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Infectious/etiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division', 'Endothelium, Vascular/pathology', 'Gene Products, tax/physiology', 'Genome, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/*etiology/pathology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/etiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Uveitis/etiology', 'Viral Proteins/physiology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1146/annurev.immunol.15.1.15 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Immunol. 1997;15:15-37. doi: 10.1146/annurev.immunol.15.1.15.,,134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventeen comparison subjects were selected from the admissions roster if they matched for disease and stage, type of transplant, pretransplant conditioning regimen, and age, but did not have SA. The medical records of all 34 patients were then reviewed by expert substance abuse clinicians for confirmation of SA and course of transplant. Survival time was calculated from the date of BMT admission to the date of last contact. Survival data were analyzed through Kaplan Meier survival curves and log rank tests for association of survival time with lifetime SA, both before and after stratification for history of cigarette smoking and type of transplant. The patients with and without SA were well matched for all clinical factors. Substance abuse or dependence was confirmed in all 17 patients, with alcohol (71%), marijuana (30%), and opiates (30%) identified as the principal substances of abuse. Survival analysis demonstrated reduced survival times for patients with SA, p = .0022. This difference persisted after stratifying for type of transplant and cigarette smoking. Trends in different survival times by type of transplant (p = .054) and by history of cigarette smoking (p = .07) were also identified.

Exposure of mice to 100 and 200 ppm benzene reduced the number of total bone marrow cells, progenitor cells, differentiating hematopoietic cells, and most blood parameters. Replication of primitive progenitor cells in the bone marrow was increased during the exposure period as a compensation for the cytotoxicity induced by 100 and 200 ppm benzene. In mice exposed to 200 ppm benzene, the primitive progenitor cells maintained an increased percentage of cells in S-phase through 25 days of recovery compared with controls. The increased replication of primitive progenitor cells in concert with the reported genotoxicity induced by benzene provides the components necessary for producing an increased incidence of lymphoma in mice.

Part I: Neuroradiological findings in long-term survivors of childhood ALL--an evaluation of the interferences between morphology and neuropsychological performance. The German Late Effects Working Group.,387-400,"The effect of cranial irradiation on possible therapy-induced morphological central nervous system (CNS) side effects of children cured from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is controversially discussed. In a retrospective multicenter study, 118 former ALL patients in first continuous remission were investigated using cranial computerised tomography (CCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to evaluate CNS related impairments. Corresponding to the different kinds of CNS prophylaxis, the patient sample was divided: group A (n = 39) receiving intrathecal methotrexate (ITMTX) and systemical medium-high-dose methotrexate (SMHDMTX), group B (n = 41) cranial irradiated (in mean 16.8 Gy) and administering ITMTX and SMHDMTX, group C (n = 38) irradiated (in mean 17.1 Gy) and getting ITMTX. Pathologic scans showed atrophy, leukoencephalopathy, calcifications or grey matter changes. These findings were compared with the neuropsychological test results. Abnormal MRI or CCI scans were found in 61/118 patients (51.7%). Fifteen belonged to group A (38.5%), 23 to B (56.1%) and 23 to C (60.5%). Patients with definite CNS changes show reduced neuropsychological test results. The prevalence of brain alterations seems to appear twice increased after lengthening the posttherapeutic interval in irradiated patients as in nonirradiated patients. Irradiated patients as an age younger than 2 years at diagnosis may show a lower prevalence for developing CNS alterations. CNS alterations are not sex-related. Children treated with cranial irradiation in combination with SMHDMTX and/or ITMTX were at greater risk of developing morphological brain alterations than patients with chemotherapy alone. These alterations are partly correlated with reduced neuropsychological performances and seem to stay with a longer posttherapeutic interval.","['Hertzberg, H', 'Huk, W J', 'Ueberall, M A', 'Langer, T', 'Meier, W', 'Dopfer, R', 'Skalej, M', 'Lackner, H', 'Bode, U', 'Janssen, G', 'Zintl, F', 'Beck, J D']","['Hertzberg H', 'Huk WJ', 'Ueberall MA', 'Langer T', 'Meier W', 'Dopfer R', 'Skalej M', 'Lackner H', 'Bode U', 'Janssen G', 'Zintl F', 'Beck JD']","['Department of Pediatric Immunology and Oncology, University Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Austria', 'Brain/blood supply/diagnostic imaging/*pathology/*radiation effects', 'Brain Diseases/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Demyelinating Diseases/etiology', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Vascular Diseases/etiology']",1997/06/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199706)28:6<387::AID-MPO1>3.0.CO;2-C [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199706)28:6<387::aid-mpo1>3.0.co;2-c [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1997 Jun;28(6):387-400. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199706)28:6<387::aid-mpo1>3.0.co;2-c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the expression of adhesion and major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules on circulating lymphocytes from BLV-infected cows with persistent lymphocytosis and the ability of monoclonal antibodies to these molecules to modulate spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation. The integrin molecule, CD11c, and both MHC class I and MHC class II molecules were upregulated on B and T lymphocytes from PL cows. Anti-CD11c antibody was stimulatory to lymphocyte proliferation regardless of BLV status and had a greater stimulatory effect on spontaneously proliferating lymphocytes from persistently lymphocytotic cows than on normal bovine lymphocytes. Antibodies to bovine class I and class II inhibited spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation.

Treatment of permeabilized cells with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) strongly potentiated GTP gamma S-dependent PLD activity at free Ca2+ < 100 nM. In the absence of GTP gamma S, PMA stimulated only minor PLD activity. This suggested synergistic interaction between regulatory G-proteins and a protein kinase C (PKC) family kinase. The potential role of PKC was evaluated by testing two mechanistically distinct PKC inhibitors, bisindolylmaleimide (BIM) and calphostin. BIM inhibits PKC enzymes via competition with ATP for binding to the catalytic domain, while calphostin competes with PMA or diglyceride for binding to the regulatory domain. The ability of PMA to potentiate the GTP gamma S-dependent PLD was not inhibited by BIM. In contrast, calphostin strongly inhibited the GTP gamma S-dependent PLD activity, both in the presence and absence of PMA as a potentiating agent. Calphostin also produced complete inhibition of a GTP gamma S-dependent PLD activity, present in solubilized membrane extracts, which was assayed using phospholipid vesicles of defined composition. Treatment of reconstituted membrane/cytosol mixtures with calphostin also produced complete inhibition of the GTP gamma S-induced translocation of Rho A from cytosol to membrane. In contrast to its effects on the U937 cell PLD, calphostin did not inhibit the activity of purified PLD from cabbage. These results suggest that the assembly of active RhoA/PLD signaling complexes on membranes involves a phorbol ester/calphostin-binding protein, but is not dependent on PKC-type catalytic activity.","['Dubyak, G R', 'Kertesy, S B']","['Dubyak GR', 'Kertesy SB']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA. gxd3@po.cwru.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (calphostin complex)', '0 (rho GTPase-activating protein)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'MBK3OO5K8T (bisindolylmaleimide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', '*GTPase-Activating Proteins', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/*pharmacology"", 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia', 'Liposomes/metabolism', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Naphthalenes/*pharmacology', 'Permeability', 'Phospholipase D/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Plants/enzymology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(97)99946-X [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1997.9946 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1997 May 1;341(1):129-39. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1997.9946.,,,,,['GM36387/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that Tax represses transcription of the human bax gene, a gene whose protein product accelerates apoptosis. This repression is mediated through a 27-bp sequence in the bax promoter that contains a putative basic helix-loop-helix binding site. Deletion of this sequence abolishes Tax-mediated repression of bax. Repression of the bax gene may be biologically significant, as we also show that HTLV-I-infected cell lines are resistant to a variety of physical, chemical, and biological stimuli which induce apoptosis in uninfected T-cells. The repression of genes involved in promoting apoptosis, including the bax gene, may contribute to retroviral survival, and initiate a pathway toward malignant transformation.","['Brauweiler, A', 'Garrus, J E', 'Reed, J C', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Brauweiler A', 'Garrus JE', 'Reed JC', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1997/04/28 00:00,1997/04/28 00:01,['1997/04/28 00:00'],"['1997/04/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/28 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682297985093 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1997.8509 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1997 Apr 28;231(1):135-40. doi: 10.1006/viro.1997.8509.,,,,,['CA 55035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We have reported that a consistent type of point mutation. A-->T transversion at the second base in codon 61 of the N-ras gene, was present in this leukemia and that this mutation appeared in bone marrow cells as early as 48 h after a single dose of DMBA. In addition, two leukemia cell lines with the N-ras mutation had no wild-type N-ras allele. Therefore, we examined whether these alterations were essential to the DMBA-induced leukemias. In the study reported here, we confirmed the occurrence of this N-ras mutation in 18 (86%) of 21 primary leukemias and loss of the N-ras wild-type allele in 12 (67%) of 18 leukemias with the mutated N-ras. By using microsatellite markers on chromosome 2, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the N-ras locus was observed in eight leukemias, all of which were shown to have lost the wild-type N-ras allele by mutant-allele-specific amplification. These results suggest that LOH related to loss of the wild-type N-ras allele reproducibly occurs in leukemias with the N-ras mutation. Considering the timing of the N-ras mutation and LOH, it is likely that the N-ras mutation is induced early, and cells that have lost the wild-type N-ras allele seem to develop into leukemia. We believe that this system provides a suitable model for studying a series of genetic alterations from the earliest stage of carcinogenesis that cannot be approached in human malignancies.","['Osaka, M', 'Matsuo, S', 'Koh, T', 'Sugiyama, T']","['Osaka M', 'Matsuo S', 'Koh T', 'Sugiyama T']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene', 'Animals', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, ras', 'Heterozygote', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2744(199704)18:4<206::AID-MC4>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 1997 Apr;18(4):206-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated whether a day 7 marrow biopsy may be used to more accurately assess therapeutic reduction of leukemia tumor burden. Studied were 76 children with ALL enrolled on CCG protocols at B.C's Children's Hospital who received both a day 7 aspirate and biopsy and were in remission by day 28. Evaluation for the correlation of the percentage aspirate blasts on day 7 with the biopsy demonstrated a moderate correlation with the percentage biopsy blasts (R = 61), but not correlation with the biopsy cellularity. We saw a similar prediction of outcome by the percentage blasts on day 7 marrow aspirate in the study as reported previously although it was not significant. Outcome analysis was done using leukemia burden as measured by the day 7 absolute blast index-aspirate (ABI-aspirate) calculated as the product of the biopsy cellularity with the percentage blasts on the aspirate.

Few studies have explored these associations specifically in infants. METHODS: The Children's Cancer Group (CCG) conducted three separate case-control studies of childhood leukemia that involved similar methodologies and data collection. Data from interviews of the mothers of a total of 303 children diagnosed with leukemia at 1 year of age or younger and their matched controls (n = 468) were available from the three studies. These data included maternal reproductive history (stillbirths, abortions, and miscarriages) and certain birth characteristics of the index child. RESULTS: Compared with controls, cases were significantly more likely to be female (P < 0.01) and were more often heavier at birth (particularly cases diagnosed after 6 months of age (odds ratio, 4.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.75-10.02)). Overall, there were no statistically significant differences between cases and controls in regard to maternal report of any type of previous fetal loss. Finally, being a later-born child was associated with an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia but not of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The relationships among birthweight, prior fetal loss, and risk of infant leukemia appear to be complex. Further studies of infant leukemia that incorporate molecular as well as epidemiologic data may help to elucidate these differences.","['Ross, J A', 'Potter, J D', 'Shu, X O', 'Reaman, G H', 'Lampkin, B', 'Robison, L L']","['Ross JA', 'Potter JD', 'Shu XO', 'Reaman GH', 'Lampkin B', 'Robison LL']","['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology and Clinical Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Epidemiol,Annals of epidemiology,9100013,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Birth Order', '*Birth Weight', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Maternal Age', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Reproductive History', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1047279797000124 [pii]', '10.1016/s1047-2797(97)00012-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Epidemiol. 1997 Apr;7(3):172-9. doi: 10.1016/s1047-2797(97)00012-4.,,,,,"['CA42479/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer Res. 1995;55:691-697], and that the apoptotic induction by both PMA and sphingosine is accompanied by down-regulation of bcl-2, a gene which acts to prevent apoptotic cell death [Sakakura et al. FEBS Lett. 1996;397:177-180]. In this study, we examined the sphingosine-induced apoptosis of the androgen-independent human prostatic carcinoma cell line DU-145, which expresses bcl-X(L) and Bax but not bcl-2, and found that treatment of DU-145 cells with sphingosine suppressed bcl-X(L) in both mRNA and protein levels but did not change bax expression at all. In contrast, in apoptotic cells treated with a PKC inhibitor, staurosporine, no effect on bcl-X(L) or bax expression was observed. The initial metabolites of sphingosine in the cells, ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate, failed to induce apoptosis. These results indicate that, in DU-145 cells, sphingosine, but not its metabolites, induces apoptosis through down-regulation of bcl-X(L), independently of PKC inhibition. Our present results, together with previous observations, strongly suggest that apoptosis regulatory genes differ according to cell type and apoptosis induction through sphingosine is accompanied by inhibition of either bcl-2 or bcl-X(L) activity in these cells.","['Shirahama, T', 'Sakakura, C', 'Sweeney, E A', 'Ozawa, M', 'Takemoto, M', 'Nishiyama, K', 'Ohi, Y', 'Igarashi, Y']","['Shirahama T', 'Sakakura C', 'Sweeney EA', 'Ozawa M', 'Takemoto M', 'Nishiyama K', 'Ohi Y', 'Igarashi Y']","['Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Androgens)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Androgens/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Carcinoma/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', '*Lysophospholipids', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1997/04/21 00:00,1997/04/21 00:01,['1997/04/21 00:00'],"['1997/04/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/21 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(97)00304-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(97)00304-9 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1997 Apr 21;407(1):97-100. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(97)00304-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their use, however, has been limited by a serious and potentially irreversible cardiotoxicity. The medical records of pediatric patients with malignancies who received ATC at the Department of Pediatrics, Kyushu University, from January 1985 to December 1994 were reviewed. Among the 120 children with malignancies who received ATC, six patients (5%) developed congestive heart failure, 33 (28%) had subclinical cardiac dysfunction, whereas 81 (66%) showed no evidence of cardiac dysfunction. The incidence of ATC cardiotoxicity increased at higher cumulative doses. The earliest cardiotoxicity, however, was observed in a patient who received 180 mg/m2 unassociated with other risk factors, showing the marked individual variations in its development. Children younger than 4 years had a higher incidence of cardiotoxicity compared with those older than 4 years (P < 0.01) and are therefore more vulnerable to ATC cardiotoxicity. Because serial myocardial biopsies and stress testing are not practical in younger children, and radionuclide angiogram is rather costly and not appropriate for frequent evaluation, non-invasive tests such as echocardiography and electrocardiography (ECG) still play the main role for serial cardiac monitoring in these age groups. Radionuclide angiogram should be added as the confirmatory test modality.","['Godoy, L Y', 'Fukushige, J', 'Igarashi, H', 'Matsuzaki, A', 'Ueda, K']","['Godoy LY', 'Fukushige J', 'Igarashi H', 'Matsuzaki A', 'Ueda K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Acta Paediatr Jpn,Acta paediatrica Japonica : Overseas edition,0370357,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cardiomyopathies/chemically induced', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1442-200x.1997.tb03579.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr Jpn. 1997 Apr;39(2):188-93. doi: 10.1111/j.1442-200x.1997.tb03579.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute lymphocytic leukemia accounted for a large part of childhood leukemia. There was no increase in the incidence of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, but its familial occurrence and accumulation were observed. The rate of first complete remission and the number of long-term survivors increased with the improvement of treatment for acute leukemia. The influence of the atomic bomb was not clear when the incidence of disease types was compared between areas.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of this population of cells and to identify features that can be used to differentiate them from T lymphoblasts. DESIGN: All specimens submitted to the clinical flow cytometry laboratory from August 1, 1994, through July 31, 1995, were analyzed for CD4 and CD8 coexpression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Percentage of lymphocytes coexpressing the CD4 and CD8 antigens. RESULTS: Four percent (22/526) of all specimens contained a population of CD4/CD8 coexpressing cells. Five cases represented CD4 and CD8 antigen expression on neoplastic cells. In 17 cases, the CD4/CD8 coexpressing cells appeared to represent a population of mature lymphocytes with a normal phenotype. The immature cells of T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma represented a dominant uniform population of cells demonstrating strong staining with both the CD4 and CD8 antigens. Cases containing a mature population of CD4/CD8 coexpressing cells were characterized by fewer coexpressing cells and variable expression of CD8. There were cases where distinction of this population of mature CD4/CD8 coexpressing lymphoid cells from a blastic malignancy was not possible using immunophenotyping alone. CONCLUSION: Correlation of clinical, morphologic, and immunophenotypic data is recommended to prevent the misdiagnosis of subtle involvement by a blastic T-cell malignancy.","['Nah, E H', 'King, D E', 'Craig, F E']","['Nah EH', 'King DE', 'Craig FE']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Chonnam University Hospital, Kwangju, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)']",IM,"['Ascitic Fluid/immunology/pathology', 'Body Fluids/immunology/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'CD4 Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'CD8 Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Eyelids/immunology/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/pathology', 'Pleural Effusion/immunology/pathology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1997 Apr;121(4):381-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early myeloid precursors, however, may be cytochemically negative for myeloperoxidase enzymatic activity or protein, but positive for myeloperoxidase mRNA. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the expression of the myeloperoxidase gene in leukemic blasts at the mRNA level and correlate the expression with blast cytochemistry and immunophenotyping. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen cases of acute myelogenous leukemia and six cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia were studied retrospectively using cellular material from Wright-stained and unstained archival smears of peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate and a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction procedure for detection of myeloperoxidase mRNA. RESULTS: Positivity in leukemic blasts was found in all acute myelogenous leukemia cases, including cases of M0, M1, and M5 that were cytochemically negative, equivocal, or weakly positive for the enzyme. None of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases showed positivity for myeloperoxidase mRNA.

TZT-1027, a dolastatin 10 derivative, is a newly synthesized antitumor compound. We evaluated its antitumor activity against a variety of transplantable tumors in mice. Intermittent injections of TZT-1027 were more effective than single or repeated injections in mice with P388 leukemia and B16 melanoma. Consequently, TZT-1027 shows schedule dependency. TZT-1027 was effective against P388 leukemia not only when administered i.p., but also when given i.v. However, although TZT-1027 given i.v. was active against murine solid tumors, TZT-1027 administered i.p. was ineffective against all the tumors tested with the exception of colon 26 adenocarcinoma. The i.v. injection of TZT-1027 at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg remarkably inhibited the growth of three murine solid tumors; colon 26 adenocarcinoma, B16 melanoma and M5076 sarcoma, with T/C values of less than 6%. The antitumor activities of TZT-1027 against these tumors were superior or comparable to those of the reference agents; dolastatin 10, cisplatin, vincristine, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and E7010. In experiments with drug-resistant P388 leukemia, TZT-1027 showed good activity against cisplatin-resistant P388 and moderate activity against vincristine- and 5-fluorouracil-resistant P388, but no activity against adriamycin-resistant P388. TZT-1027 was also effective against human xenografts, that is, tumor regression was observed in mice bearing MX-1 breast and LX-1 lung carcinomas. TZT-1027 at 10 microM almost completely inhibited the assembly of porcine brain microtubules. Therefore, its mechanism of antitumor action seems to be, at least in part, ascribable to the inhibition of microtubule assembly.

We developed a simple diagnostic method that in one step and within 5 hr determines the mutational status of any of the 3 ras genes in a given tumor sample. The method combines polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and allows simultaneous mutation scanning of 6 regions covering ""hot-spot"" codons 12, 13 and 61 of the 3 ras genes. The sensitivity of the assay was demonstrated by the analysis of control mutations, either naturally occurring or created by site-directed mutagenesis. We further demonstrate that unambiguous identification of ras mutations can be achieved by heteroduplex analysis in denaturing gradient gels, circumventing sequence analysis. We applied the method to establish the mutational status of all 3 ras genes in 123 samples of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Altogether, one diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and one B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) harbored a mutation (G12S and G12A, respectively) in the K-ras gene, and one B-CLL harbored a mutation (Q61R) in the N-ras gene.

In KG1a, KG1, TF-1 and HEL cells, which express the early differentiation marker CD34, DNR was distributed in perinuclear vesicles which could be associated with the Golgi apparatus, as suggested by the distribution of fluorescent probes specific for intracellular organelles. In contrast, U937 and HL-60 cells, which display a more mature phenotype, exhibited nuclear and diffuse cytoplasmic DNR fluorescence. DNR sequestration was not correlated with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or multidrug resistance protein expression. Furthermore, PSC833, a potent P-gp blocker, had little effect on drug sequestration in CD34+ AML cells. We also tested the effect of metabolic inhibitors, cytoskeleton inhibitors and carboxy-ionophores on DNR distribution in both CD34- and CD34+ AML cells. However, only non-specific metabolic inhibitors restored nucleic/cytoplasmic distribution in CD34+ cells. In these cells, the intracellular distribution of doxorubicin and idarubicin was very similar to that of DNR, while the distribution of methoxymorpholinyl-doxorubicin was nuclear and diffusely cytoplasmic. In fresh AML cells, DNR was also concentrated in the perinuclear region in CD34+ but not in CD34- cells. However, DNR sequestration was not observed in normal CD34+ cells. Finally, our results show that DNR is sequestered in organelles in CD34+ AML cells via an active mechanism which appears to be different from P-gp-mediated transport. Abnormal DNR distribution may account for the natural resistance of immature AML cells to anthracyclines.","['Lautier, D', 'Bailly, J D', 'Demur, C', 'Herbert, J M', 'Bousquet, C', 'Laurent, G']","['Lautier D', 'Bailly JD', 'Demur C', 'Herbert JM', 'Bousquet C', 'Laurent G']","['CJF INSERM 9503, Center Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France. lautier@regaud-tlse.fnclcc.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Azides)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', '968JJ8C9DV (Sodium Azide)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'RRU6GY95IS (Nigericin)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Azides/pharmacology', 'Blood Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism', 'Deoxyglucose/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Nigericin/pharmacology', 'Sodium Azide', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/10 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/04/10 00:00'],"['1997/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19970410)71:2<292::AID-IJC26>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970410)71:2<292::aid-ijc26>3.0.co;2-i [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1997 Apr 10;71(2):292-9. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970410)71:2<292::aid-ijc26>3.0.co;2-i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A plasmid (pGEX-Tof) was constructed to express Tof recombinant protein (RP) in Escherichia coli. Serum samples from 50 asymptomatic carriers (ACs), 50 adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and 50 HTLV-I-associated myelopathyltropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) patients were assayed for reactivity with different RPs by Western immunoblotting. The results showed that 2% of ACs, 4% of ATL patients and 6% of HAM/TSP patients had anti-p53 antibody. Therefore, anti-p53 antibody is not a useful serological marker for clinical management of HTLV-I infected people. Only 1 HAM/TSP patient had anti-Tof antibody whose specificity was further confirmed by antibody competition enzyme immunoassay. This study demonstrates that Tof protein is immunogenic in vivo, suggesting that it plays a role in the life cycle and pathogenesis of HTLV-I. The rate of anti-Rex antibody among HAM/TSP patients was significantly higher than that of ACs or ATL patients. In addition, 50% of ACs, 42% of ATL and 98% of HAM/TSP patients had anti-Tax antibody. McNemar's test showed that the presence of anti-p53 antibody did not have any correlation with the anti-Tax antibody in HTLV-I-infected people, while the correlation between anti-p53 and anti-Rex antibodies or anti-p53 and anti-Tof antibodies cannot be ruled out in this study.","['Chen, Y M', 'Chen, S H', 'Fu, C Y', 'Chen, J Y', 'Osame, M']","['Chen YM', 'Chen SH', 'Fu CY', 'Chen JY', 'Osame M']","['Institute of Public Health, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China. arthur@ym.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (tof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantibodies/*analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Gene Products, rex/*immunology', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*analysis', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rabbits', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*immunology']",1997/04/10 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/04/10 00:00'],"['1997/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19970410)71:2<196::AID-IJC12>3.0.CO;2-G [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970410)71:2<196::aid-ijc12>3.0.co;2-g [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1997 Apr 10;71(2):196-202. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970410)71:2<196::aid-ijc12>3.0.co;2-g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has a high helical content in its predicated secondary structure, which is also indicated in its CD spectrum. The cloned LysoPLA I was purified to homogeneity from the transformed E. coli cells by a gel filtration column and an ion exchange column. The specific activity of the purified protein is 1. 47 micromol/min.mg toward 1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine at pH 8.0 and 40 degrees C, corresponding to the reported value of 1.3-1.7 micromol/min.mg for the protein purified from the P388D1 cells. In addition, the cloned protein cross-reacted with an antibody raised against LysoPLA I also purified from the P388D1 cells. The deduced LysoPLA I sequence contains a well conserved GXSXG motif found in the active site of many serine enzymes, and the activity of the LysoPLA I was irreversibly inhibited by the classical serine protease inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to change Ser-119 in the GXSXG motif to an Ala. The resulting mutant protein lost all of its lysophospholipase activity, even though it had the same overall protein conformation as that of the wild-type LysoPLA I.

Electron paramagnetic resonance evidence.,12328-41,"We studied protective effects of NO against tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BuOOH)-induced oxidations in a subline of human erythroleukemia K562 cells with different intracellular hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations. t-BuOOH-induced formation of oxoferryl-Hb-derived free radical species in cells was demonstrated by low temperature EPR spectroscopy. Intensity of the signals was proportional to Hb concentrations and was correlated with cell viability. Peroxidation of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and cardiolipin metabolically labeled with oxidation-sensitive cis-parinaric acid was induced by t-BuOOH. An NO donor, (Z)-1-[N-(3-ammoniopropyl)-N-(n-propyl)amino]-diazen-1-iu m-1, 2-diolate], produced non-heme iron dinitrosyl complexes and hexa- and pentacoordinated Hb-nitrosyl complexes in the cells.

Since NO did not inhibit peroxidation induced by an azo-initiator of peroxyl radicals, 2, 2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile), protective effects of NO were due to formation of iron-nitrosyl complexes whose redox interactions with t-BuOOH prevented generation of oxoferryl-Hb-derived free radical species.","['Gorbunov, N V', 'Yalowich, J C', 'Gaddam, A', 'Thampatty, P', 'Ritov, V B', 'Kisin, E R', 'Elsayed, N M', 'Kagan, V E']","['Gorbunov NV', 'Yalowich JC', 'Gaddam A', 'Thampatty P', 'Ritov VB', 'Kisin ER', 'Elsayed NM', 'Kagan VE']","['Department of Respiratory Research, Division of Medicine, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington, D.

In particular, no clear causal mechanism has been identified by which EMFs may promote cancers. Nevertheless, the concerns raised by the positive epidemiological studies have led to increasing efforts to reduce EMFs from a number of sources. One source of EMFs are home grounding systems that are connected through water pipes in homes to water mains. This paper analyzes whether home owners who are concerned about electromagnetic fields exposure from home grounding systems should take any action to reduce fields. Assuming that the grounding system produces elevated magnetic fields (e.g., 2-3 mG or higher), this study investigates several readily available alternatives and evaluates them with respect to five criteria: risk reduction, cost, fire risk increase, worker risk, and electrical shock risk. Because of the lack of conclusive evidence about an EMF-cancer relationship, this study uses a parameterized approach that makes conditional estimates of health risk depending on future research outcomes and on the nature of the EMF/health effects relationship. This type of analysis, which is called predecision analysis because of its preliminary nature, is therefore highly dependent on a set of assumptions. Nevertheless, this predecision analysis had some fairly clear results. First, waiting for more research or taking a fairly inexpensive corrective action (insulating the water pipe to reduce ground current flow) seem to be the main contenders for the best decision for many different assumptions and parameters. Second, the choice between these two actions is very sensitive to variations in assumptions and parameters. Homeowners who accept the base-case assumptions and parameters of this study should prefer to wait. If any of the base-case parameters are changed to more pessimistic estimates or if psychological concerns (like worry and regret) are considered, then the best action is to insulate the pipe to reduce the current flow through the water pipes.","['von Winterfeldt, D', 'Trauger, T']","['von Winterfeldt D', 'Trauger T']","['University of Southern California, Institute of Safety and Systems Management, University Park, Los Angeles, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,,IM,"['Construction Materials', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Electric Injuries/prevention & control', 'Electricity', 'Electrodes', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Fires/prevention & control', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/prevention & control', 'Probability', 'Risk Factors', 'Sanitary Engineering', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1996/01/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1521-186X(1996)17:2<71::AID-BEM1>3.0.CO;2-2 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1521-186X(1996)17:2<71::AID-BEM1>3.0.CO;2-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 1996;17(2):71-84. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1521-186X(1996)17:2<71::AID-BEM1>3.0.CO;2-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inactivating delayed rectifier K+ currents, IDR, present in almost all undifferentiated THP-1 monocytes, were absent from PMA-differentiated macrophages. Two K+ channels were observed in THP-1 cells only after differentiation into macrophages, an inwardly rectifying K+ channel (IIR) and a Ca2+-activated maxi-K channel (IBK). IIR was a classical inward rectifier, conducting large inward currents negative to EK and very small outward currents. IIR was blocked in a voltage-dependent manner by Cs+, Na+, and Ba2+, block increasing with hyperpolarization. Block by Na+ and Ba2+ was time-dependent, whereas Cs+ block was too fast to resolve. Rb+ was sparingly permeant. In cell-attached patches with high [K+] in the pipette, the single IIR channel conductance was approximately 30 pS and no outward current could be detected. IBK channels were observed in cell-attached or inside-out patches and in whole-cell configuration. In cell-attached patches the conductance was approximately 200-250 pS and at potentials positive to approximately 100 mV a negative slope conductance of the unitary current was observed, suggesting block by intracellular Na+. IBK was activated at large positive potentials in cell-attached patches; in inside-out patches the voltage-activation relationship was shifted to more negative potentials by increased [Ca2+]. Macroscopic IBK was blocked by external TEA+ with half block at 0.35 mM. THP-1 cells were found to contain mRNA for Kv1.3 and IRK1.

Fitted by a single exponential following a delay, the activation time constant, tauact was roughly 10 sec at threshold potentials, decreasing at more positive potentials. Tail currents upon repolarization decayed mono-exponentially at all potentials. The tail current time constant, tautail, was voltage dependent, decreasing with hyperpolarization from 2-3 sec at 0 mV to approximately 200 msec at -100 mV. Surprisingly, although tauact depended strongly on pHo, tautail was completely independent of pHo. H+ currents were inhibited by Zn2+. Increasing pHo or decreasing pHi shifted the voltage-activation relationship to more negative potentials, tending to activate the gH at any given voltage. Studied in excised, inside-out membrane patches, H+ currents were larger and activated much more rapidly at lower bath pH (i.e., pHi). In THP-1 cells differentiated into macrophages, the H+ current density was reduced by one-half, and tauact was slower by about twofold.

DNA polymorphisms are used to monitor engraftment after transplantation from a related or unrelated donor. DNA polymorphisms are not useful after autologous BMT or if the donor is an identical twin. The most valuable polymorphism for this purpose is caused by variation in certain repeated sequences that are known as variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR). The VNTRs are valuable because they each have several alleles increasing the probability of finding one that is useful in a given case. This method can be used to sensitively detect small amounts of residual recipient hematopoiesis. To accomplish this the laboratory must first find a polymorphic allele that is unique in the recipient. Detection of the unique allele in peripheral blood or bone marrow after BMT is tantamount to finding recipient hematopoiesis. The presence of both donor and recipient hematopoiesis can result in a state of stable mixed chimerism and not necessarily presage a relapse after BMT for leukemia; however, the presence of residual recipient cells in some cases may indicate an increased probability of relapse, particularly in chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Rothberg, P G', 'Gamis, A S', 'Baker, D']","['Rothberg PG', 'Gamis AS', 'Baker D']","[""Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, Missouri, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Lab Med,Clinics in laboratory medicine,8100174,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chimera', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Lab Med. 1997 Mar;17(1):109-18.,,50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In neural tissue, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is an important trophic cytokine. In this investigation, we determined if LIF was present in human and guinea-pig airways and examined the role of this cytokine in modulating airway responses to endogenous and exogenous tachykinins as well as muscarinic receptor and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. 2. The presence of LIF in both human and guinea-pig airways was determined by immunohistochemistry. Guinea-pig tracheal explants were incubated in CRML-1066 media containing LIF (0.5, 5 or 50 ng ml-1) for periods of 3, 6, 24 and 48 h. Tracheal rings were then transferred to organ baths for measurement of isometric force in response to carbachol, capsaicin, the neurokinin1 (NK1) receptor agonist [Sar9,Met(O2)11]-substance P (SP), the NK2 receptor agonist neurokinin A (NKA) and isoprenaline. 3. LIF immunoreactivity was observed primarily in basally situated cells in the airway epithelium of both large and small airways. Less intense immunoreactivity was observed in vascular endothelium and glandular epithelium. 4. Treatment with LIF (0.5 ng ml-1) for 3 and 6 h significantly increased contractile responses to capsaicin by 42% and 43%, respectively, compared to time controls, whereas higher concentrations of LIF (5 and 50 ng ml-1) enhanced capsaicin-induced contractions only after 6 h. After 24 h, responses to capsaicin were not significantly different from 0 h control. Contractile responses to capsaicin following exposure to LIF at any concentration for 24 h were not significantly different from relative time control values. 5. Responses to [Sar9,Met(O2)11]-SP, carbachol and isoprenaline were not influenced by time in culture or by exposure to LIF for up to 48 h. Contractile responses induced by NKA were not influenced by 3 or 6 h exposure to LIF, but at 24 and 48 h the mean maximum contractile responses to NKA were significantly increased by 33% and 35%, respectively, compared to control. 6. These results demonstrate that LIF is present in guinea-pig and human airway epithelium, and modulates airway responses to tachykinins. In the acute setting LIF augments the capsaicin-induced release of endogenous tachykinins, whilst in the longer term (> 24 h), LIF increases airway smooth muscle responses to tachykinins via an NK2 receptor selective mechanism. We conclude that LIF may be an important effector molecule in the response of airways to injury or inflammation.","['Knight, D', 'McKay, K', 'Wiggs, B', 'Schellenberg, R R', 'Bai, T']","['Knight D', 'McKay K', 'Wiggs B', 'Schellenberg RR', 'Bai T']","[""University of British Columbia Pulmonary Research Laboratory, St Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '110880-55-2 (substance P, Sar(9)-Met(O2)(11)-)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', '86933-74-6 (Neurokinin A)', '8Y164V895Y (Carbachol)', 'L628TT009W (Isoproterenol)', 'S07O44R1ZM (Capsaicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Capsaicin/pharmacology', 'Carbachol/pharmacology', 'Epithelium/drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Interleukin-6', 'Isoproterenol/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Muscle Contraction/drug effects', 'Neurokinin A/*pharmacology', 'Substance P/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Trachea/drug effects/*metabolism/physiology']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjp.0700965 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 1997 Mar;120(5):883-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0700965.,,,PMC1564531,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Metal salts can inhibit cell activity through direct toxicity to critical cellular molecules and structures. On the other hand, they can also change cell behaviour by inducing specific genes (including genes encoding members of the metallothionein [MT] gene family). Therefore, transition metals may affect cell functions either by acting as a toxin, or by transmitting or influencing signals controlling gene expression. 2. To explore the latter possibility, we measured the ability of low, non-toxic metal pretreatment to alter immune cell behaviour. We previously found that pretreatment of human monocytes with zinc induces metallothionein gene expression and alters their capacity to undergo a bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced respiratory burst. We showed here that cadmium and mercury salts, at concentrations that exert no discernible toxicity, inhibit activation of human monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cells. CdCl2 1 microM, ZnCl2 20-40 microM or HgCl2 2 microM pretreatment for 20 h induced MT-2 mRNA and total MT protein accumulation and had no effect on proliferation potential or metabolic activity, but significantly inhibited the ability of subsequent lipopolysaccharide treatment to induce the oxidative burst, increased adhesion to plastic, and MT-2 and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) mRNA accumulation. 3. The phenomenon of metal-induced suppression of monocyte activation, at metal concentrations that have no effect on cell viability, has important implications for assessment of acceptable levels of human exposure to cadmium, zinc and mercury.","['Koropatnick, J', 'Zalups, R K']","['Koropatnick J', 'Zalups RK']","['London Regional Cancer Centre, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)', 'FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Cadmium/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-1/genetics', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mercury/*pharmacology', 'Metallothionein/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Respiratory Burst', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc/*pharmacology']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjp.0700975 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 1997 Mar;120(5):797-806. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0700975.,,,PMC1564538,,['ES05157/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The deleterious effects of radiation therapy on neurocognitive functions is now well documented (Meadows et al, 1981) but, apart from rare acute toxicities (Sasazaki et al, 1992), reports on those following high-dose methotrexate are scarce, and sometimes discordant (Jannoun and Chessels, 1987; Robertson et al, 1992). Longer follow-up evaluation is warranted before definitive conclusions concerning the relationship between computed tomography scan findings and clinical outcome can be reached. The reproductive function of males is much more severely altered than that of females (Jaffe et al, 1988). Several reports have demonstrated the major dose-dependent toxicity of alkylating agents on male fertility. Male patients receiving more than 9 g/m2 of cyclophosphamide have a particularly high risk of sterility (Aubier et al, 1989) and children with less than 4 g/m2 of cyclophosphamide, a very low risk Patte et al, 1996a). Women treated before the age of 20 who do not receive abdominal irradiation usually have normal reproductive function, although early puberty (Quigley et al, 1989) and early menopause (Byrne et al, 1992) have been documented. The risk of a second malignancy is not as great as in children with a solid tumour or Hodgkin's disease (Anderson et al, 1993). The risk is higher in patients treated with alkylating agents (Lemerle et al, 1989). With the increasing cure rate, a social problem may arise for adults who ""have had cancer'. The increased awareness by politicians and health insurance companies should help to solve, at least partially, this new problem (Monaco, 1987). As cure rates increase, emerging concerns involve the familial repercussions of this heavy treatment (Lansky et al, 1978; Cairns et al, 1979). At this stage, there is no demonstrated deleterious effect from treatment for the progeny of cured children (Mulvihill et al, 1987; Stein, 1993). Cure of children with lymphoma is a reality, and one should think in terms of ""complete cure' when facing a distressed child with a heavy tumour burden arriving for diagnosis (Schweisguth, 1979). Since 1980, the progress of molecular biology techniques has permitted the precise molecular characterization of gene alterations (oncogenes, immunoglobulins, and T-cell receptor genes) involved in the process of malignant transformation of normal lymphocytes (Bhatia et al, 1996; Williams et al, 1996). In parallel, treatment of malignant NHL of childhood has improved dramatically. The progress in molecular biology has not led to a modification of the clinical management of NHL of childhood which remains mainly empirical. Precise cytohistological classification of lymphomas has resulted in the characterization of low- and high-risk patients requiring distinct therapeutic approaches. The major goals of the next few years will be to increase the cure rates of those patients with CNS and bone marrow involvement at diagnosis, probably through an intensification of chemotherapy (increase in the dose or intensity of the chemotherapy); to define precisely subgroups of good-prognosis patients requiring less aggressive treatment that would decrease the risk of long-term events; and to salvage previously heavily treated patients at relapse. The precise analysis of gene alterations in lymphoma cells of a given patient may have important clinical applications in this respect (Bhatia et al, 1996).","['Philip, T', 'Bergeron, C', 'Frappaz, D']","['Philip T', 'Bergeron C', 'Frappaz D']","['Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology/therapy', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/etiology/pathology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/therapy']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(96)80053-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1996 Dec;9(4):769-97. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(96)80053-9.,,156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that PO-B DNA-binding is progressively induced during differentiation of promyelomonocytic leukemic HL-60 cells to the macrophage-like lineage (with phorbol esters). We now report that PO-B DNA-binding in HL-60 cells is similarly induced during differentiation to the granulocytic lineage (with either retinoic acid or dimethylsulfoxide). Either a genetic or pharmacologic blockade of HL-60 differentiation prohibited these inductive effects. These studies have prompted our interest in the dynamics of other transcription factor changes during HL-60 differentiation. Of these, we observed that another transcription factor (AP-1) is also robustly induced at the DNA-binding level during macrophage-like HL-60 differentiation, but not during granulocytic differentiation. Conversely, the DNA-binding of the transcription factor AP-2 was slightly reduced by TPA-induced HL-60 differentiation but unchanged during granulocyte differentiation. From these data, we conclude that the induction of PO-B DNA binding is a general marker of HL-60 myelomonocytic differentiation, but that qualitative aspects of the induction of additional distinct transcription factors, such as AP-1, may contribute to lineage-specific determinants of cell fate.","['Davis, A F', 'Meighan-Mantha, R L', 'Riegel, A T']","['Davis AF', 'Meighan-Mantha RL', 'Riegel AT']","['Department of Pharmacology, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, DC 20007, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bryostatins', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Macrolides', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1997/06/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(19970601)65:3<308::AID-JCB2>3.0.CO;2-W [pii]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1997 Jun 1;65(3):308-24.,,,,,"['DK02141/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK43127/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'MH10114/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Both subtypes were present at very low levels or absent from mouse embryonic stem cells maintained in an undifferentiated state by growth in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor.

The present study shows that BAL-1 specifically recognizes the MHC class I (MHC-I). The apoptotic response was not dependent on the epitope specificity, since other anti-MHC-I antibodies, reacting with different monomorphic determinants of the alpha chain or beta 2-microglobulin, also induced apoptosis in these cells. However, external cross-linking of antibodies was strictly required for the apoptotic effect. Among cells originating from mature peripheral blood B cells, anti-CD40-stimulated cells were susceptible to anti-MHC-I-induced apoptosis, whereas B cells activated with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) or with the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) were non-responsive. Mature SEA-activated T cells were also resistant to MHC-I-induced apoptosis. In situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase staining of apoptotic cells at various stages during MHC-I-induced cell death revealed that apoptosis occurred predominantly in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, with the first apoptotic cells appearing after approximately 12 h of incubation.

It has been suggested that the ratio of deletion/inversion is determined by the combined effect of two factors: (i) the relative strengths of 5' and 3' recombination signal sequences (RSS) of a DH segment, and (ii) the efficiency with which the deletional product (one joint) forms relative to the inversional product (two joints). In this study, we analyzed for the first time the effect of factor 1 alone on the biased 3' RSS utilization in DH-JH joining by using deletional plasmids in an extrachromosomal substrate V(D)J recombination assay. It was found that the 3' RSS and associated coding end (12 bp) mediate recombination more efficiently than the 5' RSS/coding end DH-JH plasmids. These results demonstrate that the effect of the RSS/coding end alone can account, at least partially, for the predominant deletion in DH-JH recombination. The potential effect of the relative strength of RSS and associated coding end on the ordered rearrangement of DH-JH followed by VH to DH-JH was also assessed. When recombination frequencies of D-->J (3' DH to J3) were compared with frequencies of V-->D (VHPJ14 to 3' DH or VHOX2 to 3' DH), it was found that V-->D joining was, if anything, more efficient than D-->J joining.

The main use has been in the B and T lymphoproliferative disorders. The early significant activity with a high remission rate reported in hairy cell leukemia (HCL) has been confirmed within our group. Data from a large phase II study, which comprised 165 evaluable patients with HCL treated with DCF 4mg/m2 every 2 weeks until maximal response collected over a ten-year period, shows a very long disease-free interval with 76% of the complete responders still in remission at 6 years. Some activity has been reported in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and an outline of a phase II study with low dose DCF given over five days every month is summarised. DCF has been shown to be active in mature T-cell malignancies, chiefly T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) and the cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, Sezary syndrome. Its efficacy in other forms of T-cell lymphoma has been less consistent but, bearing in mind the poor outlook of these disorders, the data suggest that DCF should be considered as part of the treatment strategy. In T-PLL, for example, partial remitters (and non-responders) to DCF have received the monoclonal antibody CAMPATH-1H with excellent results.","['Catovsky, D']",['Catovsky D'],"['Academic Department of Haematology, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Pentostatin/*therapeutic use', 'Sezary Syndrome/*drug therapy']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1996 Dec;38 Suppl 2:S103-7.,,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although inactive in solid tumors, Fludara has marked activity in indolent lymphoproliferative disorders. The exact mechanism of action of Fludara is uncertain. Fludara has been established as the most active single agent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in single arm and comparative clinical trials. The activity has been demonstrated in both previously treated and initially treated patients. Marked activity has been noted in patients with low grade lymphoma, in particular, those with a follicular morphology and in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Combinations of fludarabine with alkylating agents, anthracyclines, and anthraquinones have led to clinically useful combination approaches. The ability of fludarabine to modulate the levels of the triphosphate form of cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) in acute leukemia cells has led to the development of combinations of fludarabine and ara-C. These combinations have demonstrated marked activity in treatment of relapsed and previously untreated patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The ability to modulate the activity of pyrimidines and to inhibit repair of DNA damage caused by alkylating agents, anthracyclines, and other DNA active drugs suggest that the future of fludarabine will be in combination approaches to modulate the activity of other agents.

They should thus play a major role in the treatment of low grade lymphoid malignancies. These drugs have been shown to have strong effect in DNA synthesis on actively dividing cells, mainly through interference with DNA polymerases and ribonucleotide reductase. However, the cell cycle kinetics of low grade lymphocytic lymphomas is characterized by the presence of very low growth fractions. Hence, the action of these drugs in slowly progressing lymphoid malignancies cannot be accounted by the same mechanism observed in actively proliferating tumors and needs to be explained through activity against quiescent resting lymphocytes. Recent work has stressed the role of purine analogues in inducing programmed cell death of quiescent lymphocytes, which could be explained through the induction of accelerated DNA strand breaks. This process leads to consumption of NAD for poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis, which could induce critical depletion of ATP. As this action extends to normal resting lymphocytes deleterious effects related to their immunosuppressive action are also observed, i.e. prolonged lymphopenia predominating in T cells and especially in CD4 subset, increased frequency of opportunistic infections and perhaps increase in autoimmune complications like autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Nevertheless, beneficial effects of this immunosuppressive action have also been reported in the prevention of graft-versus-host disease, graft rejection and in some autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis. Work needs to be carried out to define better the mechanisms of action of these drugs on the different immunological effectors, as well as studies in animal models of transplantation and autoimmune diseases.","['Dighiero, G']",['Dighiero G'],"[""Institut Pasteur, Unite d'ImmunoHematologie et d'ImmunoPathologie, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Pentostatin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Purine Nucleosides/*chemistry', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1996 Dec;38 Suppl 2:S75-81.,,98,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism by which protein tyrosine kinases regulate the phospholipases is not clearly defined yet. In this study, we examined the possibility that phospholipase C gamma 1 associates with protein tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphorylated molecules as a result of activation of RBL-2H3 cells, and that this association involves the Src homology 2 domains of phospholipase C gamma 1. An increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ level and tyrosine phosphorylations of proteins, including 72 and 40 kDa proteins, were observed after the cross-linking of the IgE receptors on RBL-2H3 rat basophilic cells by dinitrophenyl-specific IgE and dinitrophenyl-conjugated human serum albumin. Immunoprecipitation and coprecipitation experiments were performed to determine if the activation of protein tyrosine kinases is linked to the activation of phospholipase C gamma 1 via its SH2 domains. Tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C gamma 1 was observed in 1 min following IgE receptor stimulation. several proteins (72, 50, 40, and 33 kDa) were identified to be tyrosine phosphorylated and specifically associated with phospholipase C gamma 1 by its Src homology 2 domains. In addition, the coprecipitated complex contains the tyrosine kinase activity which phosphorylates 72, 40, and 33 kDa proteins in the complex. In conclusion, these studies establish that tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 72, 40, and 33 kDa associate with phospholipase C gamma 1 via its SH2 domains following IgE receptor stimulation of RBL-2H3 basophilic cells, implying that protein tyrosine kinases may tyrosine-phosphorylate and recruit signaling proteins around the phospholipase C gamma 1 and that phospholipase C gamma 1 activation induces calcium mobilization, PKC activation and degranulation in mast cells or basophils.","['Han, M Y', 'Koh, W S', 'Yoon, S Y', 'Park, Y M', 'Choe, Y K']","['Han MY', 'Koh WS', 'Yoon SY', 'Park YM', 'Choe YK']","['Molecular and Cellular Biology Research Division, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Taejon, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Mol Biol Int,Biochemistry and molecular biology international,9306673,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Binding Sites', 'Dinitrophenols/immunology/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/immunology/*metabolism', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', 'src Homology Domains/*physiology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15216549700201941 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Mol Biol Int. 1997 Apr;41(5):895-904. doi: 10.1080/15216549700201941.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemia Project Group of the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK).,251-7,"BACKGROUND: Intensification of post-remission therapy improves the cure rate of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but is often accompanied by unacceptable toxicity. From 1985 to 1992 the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) performed a randomized phase III trial to evaluate the effectiveness of one single postremission course of high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) in terms of leukaemia-free and overall survival in adults with de novo AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult (15-65 years) AML patients in remission after two induction courses were randomly assigned to one consolidation course either with standard (SDAC: 100 mg/sqm 24 hours infusion over seven days) or with high-dose cytarabine (HDAC: 3000 mg/sqm every 12 hours as one-hour-infusion for six days). In addition, both arms included daunorubicin (45 mg/sqm daily on days 1 to 3). Thereafter, patients were observed without maintenance until relapse. RESULTS: After two induction courses 208/276 eligible patients achieved remission (CR: 169, 61%, PR: 39, 14%), 41 were resistant (15%) and 20 died early (7%). Seventy-one patients in remission were not randomized. One hundred thirty-seven were randomized in CR/PR (67 SDAC, 70 HDAC). 4/70 patients randomized to HDAC did not receive it. Treatment-related mortality in HDAC was 1.4% (1/66). WHO grade 3-4 toxicities occurred in 14/67 SDAC and in 38/66 HDAC patients (P < 0.0001). The median event free survival was 10.8 (SDAC) vs. 12.2 months (HDAC; P = 0.18). The median overall survival was 24.6 (SDAC) vs. 32.6 months (HDAC; P = 0.07). Although statistically uncertain, HDAC reduced the hazard of progression (hazard ratio: 0.69, P = 0.08) and of death (hazard ratio: 0.70, P = 0.13). For 112 patients stratified as CR the estimated four-year disease-free survival was 25% (+/-6%) with SDAC and 37% (+/-6%) with HDAC (P = 0.09). The overall survival rates at four years were 38% (+7%) and 48% (+7%), respectively (P = 0.10). In multivariate analysis HDAC significantly reduced the hazard of relapse by 39% compared to SDAC (hazard ratio = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.37-0.99; P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that early consolidation of adult AML in CR with a single course of HDAC is superior in terms of outcome to one cycle of SDAC. The results of our intensive, single course HDAC group compare favourably with less intensive, repetitive HDAC cycles, suggesting that Ara-C dose intensity may be more important than total dosage. In addition, our treatment strategy is much less toxic and less expensive.","['Fopp, M', 'Fey, M F', 'Bacchi, M', 'Cavalli, F', 'Gmuer, J', 'Jacky, E', 'Schmid, L', 'Tichelli, A', 'Tobler, A', 'Tschopp, L', 'Von Fliedner, V', 'Gratwohl, A']","['Fopp M', 'Fey MF', 'Bacchi M', 'Cavalli F', 'Gmuer J', 'Jacky E', 'Schmid L', 'Tichelli A', 'Tobler A', 'Tschopp L', 'Von Fliedner V', 'Gratwohl A']","['Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research, SIAK/SAKK Coordinating Centre, Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008267904952 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)60510-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1997 Mar;8(3):251-7. doi: 10.1023/a:1008267904952.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Hs578T breast, SKMES non-small-cell lung, and HT-29 colon human tumour cells were exposed, either for 1 h or continuously, to conventionally formulated paclitaxel (Cremophor paclitaxel) or polymeric micellar paclitaxel. After a period of incubation, cytotoxicity was measured using a radiometric system. In the in vivo antitumour study, B6D2F1 mice, bearing P388 leukaemia tumour intraperitoneally (i.p.), were treated with polymeric micellar paclitaxel or Cremophor paclitaxel by i.p. injection. The number of deaths and body weights were recorded. In the biodistribution study, CD-1 mice were given micellar paclitaxel i.p. at a dose of 100 mg/kg. The mice were sacrificed after a given time and the organs were harvested. Paclitaxel in the organs was extracted by acetonitrile and analysed using HPLC. RESULTS: The polymeric micellar paclitaxel showed similar in vitro cytotoxicity to Cremophor paclitaxel against the tumour cell lines. The polymeric micellar formulation of paclitaxel produced a fivefold increase in the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as compared with Cremophor paclitaxel when administered i.p. In addition, micellar paclitaxel was more efficacious in vivo when tested in the murine P388 leukaemia model of malignancy than Cremophor paclitaxel when both were administered i.p. at their MTDs. Micellar paclitaxel-treated animals had an increased survival time and, importantly, long-term survivors (20% of those tested) were obtained only in the polymeric paclitaxel formulation group. Biodistribution studies indicated that a significant amount of paclitaxel could be detected in blood, liver, kidney, spleen, lung and heart of mice after i.p. dosing of the polymeric micellar paclitaxel formulation. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results indicate that polymeric micellar paclitaxel could be a clinically useful chemotherapeutic formulation.","['Zhang, X', 'Burt, H M', 'Von Hoff, D', 'Dexter, D', 'Mangold, G', 'Degen, D', 'Oktaba, A M', 'Hunter, W L']","['Zhang X', 'Burt HM', 'Von Hoff D', 'Dexter D', 'Mangold G', 'Degen D', 'Oktaba AM', 'Hunter WL']","['Angiogenesis Technologies, Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Micelles)', '39279-69-1 (cremophor)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Micelles', 'Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050630 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1997;40(1):81-6. doi: 10.1007/s002800050630.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULT: The amounts of each drug tolerated in the combination treatment setting were much less than their individual maximum tolerated doses (MTDs). Thus, to be used safely, each drug's dose had to be greatly reduced from the amount tolerated when the drugs were given individually. Multiple experiments using a staged P388 leukemia model implanted intravenously yielded confirmatory data supporting the existence of a therapeutic synergy for the drug combination.

In the present study, by using immunofluorescence and immunocytochemical analyses, we have confirmed that the in vivo up-regulation of the alpha 4 beta 7 heterodimeric complex is associated with the leukemic behavior of AKR T-LBLs. In addition, when compared with the parental, highly leukemic NQ22 cells, the variant cell line NQ22V exhibited a reduced leukemic potential that was invariably associated with a delayed alpha 4 beta 7 up-regulation in vivo Moreover, the leukemic cell line SJ-1, derived from a spontaneous T-LBL of the SJL strain, also displayed high levels of alpha 4 beta 7 expression with a pattern of tissue distribution similar to that of NQ22 cells from leukemic AKR animals. Of note, in most of the tissues involved by murine T-LBL dissemination, and particularly in liver, kidney, and lung, alpha 4 beta 7-positive leukemic cells were always located around strongly VCAM-1-positive vascular spaces. These findings are consistent with a possible role of alpha 4 beta 7/VCAM-1 interactions in the extravasation and, consequently, in the leukemic dissemination of murine T-LBL cells. Immunocytochemical analysis carried out in 11 human T-LBLs showed that pathological lymph nodes from all 7 cases with bone marrow infiltration at presentation carried alpha 4 beta 7-positive cells, whereas all 4 aleukemic T-LBLs were repeatedly alpha 4 beta 7 negative, also in metachronous lesions. These findings suggest that alpha 4 beta 7-positive human T-LBLs may represent a distinct clinicopathological entity. In addition, alpha 4 beta 7 expression was significantly more prevalent in younger patients (< 11 years; P = 0.02), further supporting such a hypothesis. Moreover, as in murine T-LBLs, the pattern of alpha 4 beta 7 positivity in involved lymph nodes was mainly focal, whereas nearly all neoplastic cells infiltrating bone marrow expressed this integrin, suggesting a possible role for alpha 4 beta 7 in the leukemic dissemination also of human T-LBLs.","['Dolcetti, R', 'Giardini, R', 'Doglioni, C', 'Cariati, R', 'Pomponi, F', ""D'Orazi, C"", 'Rao, S', 'Lazarovits, A I', 'Butcher, E C', 'Boiocchi, M']","['Dolcetti R', 'Giardini R', 'Doglioni C', 'Cariati R', 'Pomponi F', ""D'Orazi C"", 'Rao S', 'Lazarovits AI', 'Butcher EC', 'Boiocchi M']","['Division of Experimental Oncology 1, IRCCS, Aviano (PN), Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Integrins)', '0 (integrin alpha4beta7)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Integrins/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/etiology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1997 May;150(5):1595-605.,,,PMC1858193,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neither truncated PML nor truncated RAR alpha alone could induce transformation which suggest that the two domains should cooperate for the oncogenicity of the fusion product. To further investigate the mechanisms of this co-operation, we have tested whether a truncated RAR alpha could cooperate with the v-erbB oncogene. This oncogene has previously been shown to co-operate with the rearranged thyroid hormone receptor, v-erbA, to transform erythrocytic progenitors. We show that v-erbB and a truncated RAR alpha co-operate when expressed simultaneously as independent products to transform very early chicken haematopoietic cells close to pluripotent stage. In addition, we show that v-erbB alters transcriptional abilities of RAR alpha by both enhancing its effects on RARE and reducing those on AP-1. Therefore, RAR alpha is able to co-operate with different kinds of proteins to induce transformation of early haematopoietic cells. This strongly suggests that RAR alpha are involved in the differentiation commitment of early haematopoietic progenitors during the normal process of haematopoietic differentiation. These data bring new insights in the mechanisms of oncogenic transformation by rearranged RAR alpha.","['Altabef, M', 'Garcia, M', 'Varior-Krishnan, G', 'Samarut, J']","['Altabef M', 'Garcia M', 'Varior-Krishnan G', 'Samarut J']","[""Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire de l'Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, UMR49 CNRS, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-erbB)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/microbiology/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins v-erbB/*physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retroviridae', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/03/27 00:00,1997/03/27 00:01,['1997/03/27 00:00'],"['1997/03/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1200984 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1997 Mar 27;14(12):1471-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1200984.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was extended to include children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). The index group consisted of 46 children with MDS, 62 with AML, and eight with CML, which is thought to represent all myeloid leukaemias in Danish children, 1980-91. By linkage to the Central Population Register we identified parents (230), siblings (231), grandparents (151), aunts and uncles (132) and cousins (140). Information on the cancer incidence was obtained from the Danish Cancer Registry. 27 cancers were observed versus 26.7 expected (relative risk 1.0). Leukaemia in relatives was observed in only one family. None of 11 children with MDS and monosomy 7 had family members affected by leukaemia. We found no evidence of an increased overall risk of cancer in the relatives. The risk of familial MDS may be considerably lower than previously estimated.","['Hasle, H', 'Olsen, J H']","['Hasle H', 'Olsen JH']","['Department of Paediatrics, Odense University Hospital, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Risk Factors']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.202664.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Apr;97(1):127-31. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.202664.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phenotypic and functional data suggest that leukaemic CD3+ LGL represent activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). One mechanism whereby CTL mediate target cell killing is through the Fas/Fas ligand apoptotic pathway. Fas ligand is expressed by CTL only after activation. In this study we examined seven patients with LGL leukaemia for expression of Fas ligand gene transcripts using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses. We found constitutive expression of Fas ligand gene transcripts in each of the seven patients. Similar up-regulation of Fas ligand gene expression has been observed in mice with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndromes caused by Fas mutations. However, sequence analyses of the death domain of the Fas gene in LGL leukaemia patients revealed no evidence for mutations. Our findings provide further support for the hypothesis that leukaemic LGL are CTL activated by chronic antigenic stimulation.

The clinical and phenotypic data of 77 CLL patients in CR with a median follow-up from CR achievement of 54 months (range 5-127) were analysed. 32 patients (42%) displayed a normalized phenotype as evaluated by k:lambda ratio or by CD5+/CD19+ cell numbers. Patients with normalized phenotype demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of female sex, a lower relapse rate, a trend for higher prevalence of stage A and a lower occurrence of CLL-related deaths. The relapse-free survival of patients with normalized phenotype was significantly longer (P = 0.02), whereas no difference in overall survival was found between the two groups. Interestingly, Binet's stage at diagnosis was highly predictive of the overall survival following CR achievement.

Clinical features at diagnosis, such as stage distribution, are apparently stronger predictors of the final outcome.

However, questions still remain. In six cases of CML we combined the standard May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining with FISH at the single-cell level and were able to demonstrate that not only all maturation stages of granulopoiesis, erythropoiesis, and megakaryocytes, but also plasma cells, eosinophils, basophils and monocytes carried the Philadelphia chromosome in 53-98% of samples. Using immunological identification of single cells we were able to demonstrate that the t(9;22) is detectable in 34% of CD3-positive T lymphocytes, in 32% of CD19-positive B lymphocytes, and in 82% of CD34-positive precursor cells.

Although some studies have disclosed that bone marrow of CML patients may contain some normal Philadelphia-negative early progenitor cells, it has been assumed that the dramatic increase of white blood cells was entirely related to the leukaemic cell expansion. In this study we attempted to quantify the number of normal and leukaemic progenitor cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of newly diagnosed CML patients. Bone marrow and peripheral blood cells of eight newly diagnosed CML patients were analysed for clonogenic colony-forming cells (CFC) and very early progenitor cells, i.e. long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-IC). The leukaemic (Ph-positive) or normal (Ph-negative) origin of progenitor cells was revealed by cytogenetic analysis performed on single colonies arising from in-vitro assays. In 6/8 patients the marrow CFC frequency ranged from 400 to 9300/10(6) mononuclear cells (MNC), 0-50% being Philadelphia chromosome negative; the LTC-IC frequency ranged from 0 to 11/10(6) MNC, and were 80-100% Ph-negative. The corresponding absolute values into peripheral blood were: CFC = 1-35.5 x 10(3)/ml, 0-50% Ph-negative, and LTC-IC = 0-2.5 x 10(3)/ml, 0-100% Ph-negative. In one patient, no LTC-IC were detected in either the marrow or the peripheral blood. In conclusion, in the peripheral blood of some CML patients, the number of normal LTC-IC is more than 3 times the number of leukaemic progenitor cells, and is much higher (50 times) than the corresponding value found in normal subjects in steady state (2.5/ml v 124/ml). These data support the concept that leukaemic 'stem cells', with respect to normal ones, may be considerably fewer than previously thought. In addition it is shown that at the beginning of CML high numbers of normal LTC-IC are spontaneously mobilized into the blood. Finally, the presence of Ph-negative early progenitors into the blood may represent a potential source of normal stem cells available for autografting providing they can be separated from leukaemic cells.","['Podesta, M', 'Piaggio, G', 'Sessarego, M', 'Pitto, A', 'Benvenuto, F', 'Vassallo, F', 'Fugazza, G', 'Carella, A M', 'Frassoni, F']","['Podesta M', 'Piaggio G', 'Sessarego M', 'Pitto A', 'Benvenuto F', 'Vassallo F', 'Fugazza G', 'Carella AM', 'Frassoni F']","['Divisione Ematologia, Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stem Cells/*pathology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.d01-2128.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Apr;97(1):94-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.d01-2128.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a minority (2%) of Ph-positive patients, no BCR rearrangement was detectable due to breakpoints outside the major breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr) or possibly due to M-bcr deletions. Results from 235 samples were compared with the proportion of Ph-positive metaphases found in contemporaneous bone marrow specimens analysed by conventional cytogenetics. The rank correlation between both methods was 0.82 (P < 0.001). The proportion of CML cells in samples determined by Southern blot analysis (BCR ratio) was significantly different between cytogenetically-defined minor, partial, and complete response groups (P < 0.001). Empirically-derived cut-off points in the BCR ratio were introduced in order to define molecular response groups for comparison to standard cytogenetic response groups: a BCR ratio of 0% was defined as complete molecular response and ratios of 1-24%, 25-50%, and > 50% were defined as partial, minor, and no molecular response, respectively. Using these cut-off points the concordance between both methods was 67% (P < 0.0001), a major cytogenetic response could be predicted or excluded in more than 90% of cases (P < 0.0001). Our findings demonstrated that quantitative Southern blot was as sensitive as cytogenetics and as peripheral blood samples are suitable for this technique it should be considered as the method of choice for routine monitoring IFN-alpha therapy in CML patients.","['Reiter, A', 'Skladny, H', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Seifarth, W', 'Heimpel, H', 'Bartram, C R', 'Cross, N C', 'Hehlmann, R']","['Reiter A', 'Skladny H', 'Hochhaus A', 'Seifarth W', 'Heimpel H', 'Bartram CR', 'Cross NC', 'Hehlmann R']","['III.

This fact is frequently not, or not sufficiently, considered in evaluating survival in CML, and some studies do not report risk profiles. Therefore we analysed the relative impact of risk profile and therapy on survival using the median survival times of therapy groups and of risk groups of the three-arm randomized German CML Study I (interferon alpha v hydroxyurea v busulphan; median survival times 65 v 56 v 45 months, n = 490, median observation time 70.4 months). The impact of risk profile (Sokal) on survival as determined by the survival difference between high and low risk patients (40 months) was twice the maximum survival difference between treatment groups (20 months). A similar ratio was obtained after stratification for therapy and for risk profile. Since Sokal's index has been reported to prognostically discriminate IFN-treated patients less well than chemotherapy-treated patients, a new score with better discrimination of IFN-treated patients was also used. The results were similar for both scores. We conclude that the risk profile at diagnosis is still more important for survival of CML patients than therapy.

The effects seen were rapid and sustained, and dependent on the presence of a preformed feeder layer. Interestingly, the same anti-CD44 antibodies had no effect on the maintenance of leukaemic (Ph+) progenitors (from patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia) when these cells were cultured on preformed feeder layers established from normal marrow.

The boundary between these fields is known as the equator. We describe a novel gene, mirror (mrr), which is expressed in the dorsal half of the eye and plays a key role in forming the equator. Ectopic equators can be generated by juxtaposing mrr expressing and nonexpressing cells, and the path of the normal equator can be altered by changing the domain of mrr expression. These observations suggest that mrr is a key component in defining the dorsal-ventral boundary of tissue polarity in the eye. In addition, loss of mrr function leads to embryonic lethality and segmental defects, and its expression pattern suggests that it may also act to define segmental borders. Mirror is a member of the class of homeoproteins defined by the human proto-oncogene PBX1. mrr is similar to the Iroquois genes ara and caup and is located adjacent to them in this recently described homeotic cluster.","['McNeill, H', 'Yang, C H', 'Brodsky, M', 'Ungos, J', 'Simon, M A']","['McNeill H', 'Yang CH', 'Brodsky M', 'Ungos J', 'Simon MA']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Stanford University, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (mirr protein, Drosophila)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Body Patterning', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Drosophila/*embryology/genetics', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Eye Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Insect/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Photoreceptor Cells, Invertebrate/*embryology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Transcription Factors']",1997/04/15 00:00,1997/04/15 00:01,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.11.8.1073 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1997 Apr 15;11(8):1073-82. doi: 10.1101/gad.11.8.1073.,,,,['GENBANK/U95021'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently a partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene, located on chromosome band 11q23, has been identified in de novo AML with trisomy 11. We describe a 72-year-old woman suffering from MDS-derived overt leukemia with trisomy 11 and a tandem duplication of the MLL gene. At first the patient was found to have myeloblasts with Auer rods in the peripheral blood and diagnosed as MDS, refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-T). After 2 months a picture of overt leukemia (AML; M2) developed as shown by an increased number of myeloblasts. Various chemotherapy regimens had little effect, and she died of disease progression 15 months after admission. During her clinical course, the chromosome analyses consistently showed 47,XX, +11. Southern blot analysis of leukemic blasts on admission and in accelerated phase revealed identical rearranged bands of the MLL gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis excluded the possibility of masked translocation of the MLL gene to other chromosomes. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis using a forward exon 6 primer and a backward exon 3 primer demonstrated an in-frame fusion of exon 8 with exon 2. Our results indicated that a partial tandem duplication of exons 2-8 of the MLL gene could be observed in MDS-derived overt leukemia as well as de novo AML with trisomy 11.","['Yamamoto, K', 'Hamaguchi, H', 'Nagata, K', 'Kobayashi, M', 'Taniwaki, M']","['Yamamoto K', 'Hamaguchi H', 'Nagata K', 'Kobayashi M', 'Taniwaki M']","['Department of Hematology, Musashino Red Cross Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Multigene Family', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Transcription Factors', 'Trisomy']",1997/05/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199705)55:1<41::AID-AJH8>3.0.CO;2-3 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199705)55:1<41::aid-ajh8>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1997 May;55(1):41-5. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199705)55:1<41::aid-ajh8>3.0.co;2-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: In both series, the indications were immune thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic anemias, hairy cell leukemia and, staging for Hodgkin's disease. LS resulted in shorter hospitalization (2.3 vs 8.8 days) with fewer postoperative complications. However, the operation was 1.7 times as long, and the operating room charge 2.9 times as high, so that the total cost of LS ($18,015) was greater than that for OS ($14,524).

However, amplification of a large distal segment, 9q31-->9q34, mostly proximal to the ABL locus, was unexpected and is unlikely to be related to BCR-ABL recombination.

In L1210, which is only marginally sensitive to tallimustine, the combination of tallimustine 3 mg/kg i.p. with L-PAM 10 mg/kg i.p. was as effective as 20 mg/kg L-PAM, which is the maximum tolerated dose. In M5, which is sensitive to both drugs, the combination was superior to either drug alone.

All patients were treated with initial chemotherapy and then proceeded to bone marrow transplantation (BMT), conditioned with Melphalan and total body irradiation (TBI). MR measurements were made between 21 and 89 months after TBI. The relaxation times in the six patients were compared with those in six healthy age-matched volunteers to establish whether there were differences between the two groups. Average T1 values in the vertebrae of the treated patients are significantly shorter (p < 0.01) than in the healthy volunteers. This is consistent with the observation of a relatively hyperintense vertebral bone marrow in the T1 weighted images and is likely to be a consequence of treatment induced fatty replacement of marrow. Shorter T1 values tend to be distributed within the centre of the lumbar vertebrae compatible with observations, made by others, which suggest that the peripheral zone of the vertebral body has been repopulated with bone marrow cells whereas the central zone, around the basivertebral vein, is predominantly fat. Histogram displays of vertebral body relaxation time distributions (T1, T2) for both patients and healthy age-matched volunteers are similar in that both patients and volunteers give histograms that are only slightly skewed. This similarity is probably a reflection of the fact that the patients have been in remission for over a year and have generally healthy bone marrow.","['Tanner, S F', 'Clarke, J', 'Leach, M O', 'Mesbahi, M H', 'Nicolson, V', 'Powles, R', 'Husband, J E', 'Tait, D']","['Tanner SF', 'Clarke J', 'Leach MO', 'Mesbahi MH', 'Nicolson V', 'Powles R', 'Husband JE', 'Tait D']","['CRC Clinical Magnetic Resonance Research Group, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Radiol,The British journal of radiology,0373125,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*diagnosis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*therapy', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1259/0007-1285-69-828-1145 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Radiol. 1996 Dec;69(828):1145-51. doi: 10.1259/0007-1285-69-828-1145.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initially reported in 1956, a consistent association has been found in many case-control studies in different countries. The excess relative risk obtained from combining the results of these studies has high statistical significance and suggests that, in the past, a radiographic examination of the abdomen of a pregnant woman produced a proportional increase in risk of about 40%. A corresponding causal relationship is not universally accepted and this interpretation has been challenged on four grounds. On review, the evidence against bias and confounding as alternative explanations for the association is strong. Scrutiny of the objections to causality suggests that they are not, or may not be, valid. A causal explanation is supported by evidence indicating an appropriate dose-response relationship and by animal experiments. It is concluded that radiation doses of the order of 10 mGy received by the fetus in utero produce a consequent increase in the risk of childhood cancer. The excess absolute risk coefficient at this level of exposure is approximately 6% per gray, although the exact value of this risk coefficient remains uncertain.","['Doll, R', 'Wakeford, R']","['Doll R', 'Wakeford R']","['Imperial Cancer Research Fund Cancer Studies Unit, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Radiol,The British journal of radiology,0373125,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Neuroblastoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Third', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Factors']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1259/bjr.70.830.9135438 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Radiol. 1997 Feb;70:130-9. doi: 10.1259/bjr.70.830.9135438.,"['Br J Radiol. 1997 Jul;70(835):769-70; author reply 771.

Once the central nervous system (CNS) is involved, survival without treatment is very limited. Although treatment does not substantially improve the long term survival, it provides short term improvement in these patients. METHODS: The charts of all patients with ocular involvement of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma followed during the period 1984-93 were reviewed. The diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was made by different diagnostic approaches: CNS biopsy, anterior chamber tap, vitrectomy, haematology, and necropsy. RESULTS: Eight patients had oculocerebral large cell and one had small cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Five patients with pure ocular localisation had initially received steroid treatment for intermediate uveitis. First diagnosis was made on CNS biopsy in three, anterior chamber tap in one, vitreous aspirate in three, haematology in one, and necropsy in one case. CONCLUSION: Ocular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a difficult diagnosis. Vitrectomy allows cytological diagnosis in most but not all cases. When no treatment is given, patients survive for only a few weeks once the CNS is involved. Although the disease is eventually fatal, treatment by means of radiotherapy, steroid administration, and vitrectomy can allow these patients to lead a normal professional and social life during the years between recurrences.","['Verbraeken, H E', 'Hanssens, M', 'Priem, H', 'Lafaut, B A', 'De Laey, J J']","['Verbraeken HE', 'Hanssens M', 'Priem H', 'Lafaut BA', 'De Laey JJ']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital of Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Ophthalmol,The British journal of ophthalmology,0421041,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Brain Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Disease Progression', 'Eye Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/complications/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/diagnosis/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Uveitis/etiology', 'Vitrectomy']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bjo.81.1.31 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Ophthalmol. 1997 Jan;81(1):31-6. doi: 10.1136/bjo.81.1.31.,,,PMC1721996,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The event free survival for boys with an isolated testicular relapse was 59% at six years (95% confidence interval (CI) 42 to 74%). The event free survival for the 16 patients with a combined relapse who received a second course of treatment was 32% (95% CI 17 to 60%). Those patients receiving adequate second line treatment for an isolated testicular relapse whose first remission was longer than or equal to two years had an event free survival of 82% (95% CI 63 to 93%) at six years. No boy relapsing within two years from diagnosis has survived. Endocrine late effects are significant, with 82% of the boys requiring hormonal treatment at some stage for induction of puberty or continuing pubertal maturation, or both. It is concluded that, despite the increasing intensity of initial treatment for ALL, isolated testicular relapse is treatable by conventional means in most patients. Careful endocrine follow up of these patients is essential as most will require hormone replacement treatment.","['Grundy, R G', 'Leiper, A D', 'Stanhope, R', 'Chessells, J M']","['Grundy RG', 'Leiper AD', 'Stanhope R', 'Chessells JM']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Institute of Child Health, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,"['3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Leukemic Infiltration', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*mortality/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Testis/*pathology', 'Testosterone/blood/therapeutic use']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/adc.76.3.190 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1997 Mar;76(3):190-6. doi: 10.1136/adc.76.3.190.,,,PMC1717105,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the effects of polylysine (a basic poly-amino acid with a net positive charge which is often used to coat biomaterials surfaces) on the erythroleukemic K562 cell membrane were investigated. In particular, the effects of this polycation were evaluated using dielectric relaxation studies in the radiofrequency range with which it is possible to measure both active ionic transport across the cell membrane (membrane conductivity) and the static charge distribution present on the cell surface due to the structural components of the cell membrane (membrane permittivity). The conductivity of the cytosol can also be determined. The results demonstrate that while the conductivity of the cytosol is not significantly altered, both the conductivity and permittivity of the K562 cell membrane are varied by exposure of these cells to polylysine. These observations indicate that both active ionic transport and the type, quantity, or distribution of membrane components such as lipids, proteins, and polysaccharides may also be altered. Although the precise mechanisms by which these variations in K562 cells occur are unknown, it can be hypothesized that changes in the growth characteristics of these cells may be in part responsible. In particular, as demonstrated by light microscopic examination of K562 cells directly in the culture flasks, the cells in polylysine-coated flasks do not grow in suspension as do the controls, but rather show anchorage-dependent-like behavior. It is this important change from suspension to monolayer growth induced by polylysine that may be responsible for the changes in membrane electrical parameters.","['Santini, M T', 'Cametti, C', 'Indovina, P L', 'Morelli, G', 'Donelli, G']","['Santini MT', 'Cametti C', 'Indovina PL', 'Morelli G', 'Donelli G']","['Laboratorio di Ultrastrutture, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biomed Mater Res,Journal of biomedical materials research,0112726,['25104-18-1 (Polylysine)'],IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Size', 'Cytosol/chemistry/drug effects', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Electrophysiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Polylysine/*pharmacology']",1997/05/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(199705)35:2<165::AID-JBM4>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-4636(199705)35:2<165::aid-jbm4>3.0.co;2-l [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomed Mater Res. 1997 May;35(2):165-74. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-4636(199705)35:2<165::aid-jbm4>3.0.co;2-l.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Titres of retroviruses generated with these chimeric envelopes were enhanced on cells expressing both Ram-1 and Rec-1 receptors compared with the titres on cells expressing only one or other receptor type. The absolute viral titres and the degree of titre enhancement due to receptor cooperativity were highly variable between the different chimeric envelopes and were determined primarily by the properties of the interdomain spacer. An extreme example of receptor co-operativity was encountered when testing Ram-1-targeted AMOPRO envelopes with specific proline-rich interdomain spacers. AMOPRO viruses could not enter cells expressing only Rec-1 or only Ram-1 but could efficiently infect cells co-expressing both receptors. The data are consistent with a model for receptor co-operativity in which binding to the targeted (Ram-1) receptor triggers conformational rearrangements of the envelope that lead to complete unmasking of the hidden Rec-1-binding domain, thereby facilitating its interaction with the viral (Rec-1) receptor which leads to optimal fusion triggering.","['Valsesia-Wittmann, S', 'Morling, F J', 'Hatziioannou, T', 'Russell, S J', 'Cosset, F L']","['Valsesia-Wittmann S', 'Morling FJ', 'Hatziioannou T', 'Russell SJ', 'Cosset FL']","['Centre de Genetique Moleculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS UMR5534, UCB Lyon-I, Villeurbanne, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphate Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Slc20a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Structure', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/pathogenicity/physiology', '*Phosphate Transport Proteins', 'Receptors, Virus/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III', '*Symporters', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",1997/03/17 00:00,1997/03/17 00:01,['1997/03/17 00:00'],"['1997/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/16.6.1214 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 1997 Mar 17;16(6):1214-23. doi: 10.1093/emboj/16.6.1214.,,,PMC1169720,,,,,,,['EMBO J 1997 Jul 1;16(13):4153'],,,,,,

DHGN was shown to chelate nickel by atomic absorption spectrometry, and DHGN-containing monolayers specifically bound gold conjugates of His-tagged proteins. Using PC + DHGN monolayers, we examined membrane-bound arrays of an N-terminal His-tagged Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) capsid (CA) protein, His-MoCA, and in vivo studies suggest that in vitro-derived His-MoCA arrays reflect some of the Gag protein interactions which occur in assembling virus particles. The His-MoCA proteins formed extensive two-dimensional (2D) protein crystals, with reflections out to 9.5 A resolution. The image-analyzed 2D projection of His-MoCA arrays revealed a distinct cage-like network. The asymmetry of the individual building blocks of the network led to the formation of two types of hexamer rings, surrounding protein-free cage holes. These results predict that Gag hexamers constitute a retrovirus core substructure, and that cage hole sizes define an exclusion limit for entry of retrovirus envelope proteins, or other plasma membrane proteins, into virus particles. We believe that the 2D crystallization method will permit the detailed analysis of retroviral Gag proteins and other His-tagged proteins.","['Barklis, E', 'McDermott, J', 'Wilkens, S', 'Schabtach, E', 'Schmid, M F', 'Fuller, S', 'Karanjia, S', 'Love, Z', 'Jones, R', 'Rui, Y', 'Zhao, X', 'Thompson, D']","['Barklis E', 'McDermott J', 'Wilkens S', 'Schabtach E', 'Schmid MF', 'Fuller S', 'Karanjia S', 'Love Z', 'Jones R', 'Rui Y', 'Zhao X', 'Thompson D']","['Vollum Institute and Department of Microbiology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Membranes, Artificial)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '7OV03QG267 (Nickel)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Capsid/*chemistry/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chelating Agents', 'Crystallization', 'Gene Products, gag/*chemistry/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Lipids', 'Membranes, Artificial', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Structure', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/chemistry/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Nickel', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Transfection']",1997/03/17 00:00,1997/03/17 00:01,['1997/03/17 00:00'],"['1997/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/16.6.1199 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 1997 Mar 17;16(6):1199-213. doi: 10.1093/emboj/16.6.1199.,,,PMC1169719,,"['2R01 CA47088-07A3/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01 GM52914-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR02250/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, treatment of sympathetic neuron cultures with leukemia inhibitory factor, a cytokine that is known to be involved in the up-regulation of galanin after axotomy in vivo, decreases neuropeptide tyrosine messenger RNA. These, apparently contradictory findings, prompted us to investigate the regulation of neuropeptide tyrosine in the axotomized superior cervical ganglion in vivo. For comparison, the regulation of galanin was examined under the same conditions. Compared to control ganglia, the number of neuropeptide tyrosine-positive cell bodies decreased while the density of immunoreactive neuronal processes increased one week after transection of the major postganglionic nerves. The nerve fibres were identified as axons by the absence of MAP2, a somatodendritic marker protein. They extended into both carotid nerves and ramified at the lesion site. In situ hybridization revealed that, although the number of neuropeptide tyrosine messenger RNA-positive neurons was not different from controls, the average grain density/neuron decreased by 40%. When axotomized ganglia were decentralized simultaneously, a three-fold elevation of neuropeptide tyrosine immunoreactivity was detectable by radioimmunoassay and an additional increase in numerical density of neuropeptide tyrosine-immunoreactive nerve fibres was observed. Levels of neuropeptide tyrosine messenger RNA were significantly reduced within postganglionic neurons. This synergistic effect of combined axotomy and decentralization on peptide content was also detected for the neuropeptide galanin that, in contrast to neuropeptide tyrosine, is induced by axotomy or decentralization on protein and messenger RNA level. Therefore, while neuropeptide tyrosine messenger RNA is reduced in axotomized ganglia (most likely in response to leukemia inhibitory factor), the peptide accumulates in axonal processes resulting in increased peptide levels as determined by radioimmunoassay.","['Kroesen, S', 'Lang, S', 'Fischer-Colbrie, R', 'Klimaschewski, L']","['Kroesen S', 'Lang S', 'Fischer-Colbrie R', 'Klimaschewski L']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,"['0 (Neuropeptide Y)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '88813-36-9 (Galanin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axons/metabolism/physiology', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Female', 'Galanin/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Neuronal Plasticity/*physiology', 'Neuropeptide Y/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0306452296005878 [pii]', '10.1016/s0306-4522(96)00587-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 1997 May;78(1):251-8. doi: 10.1016/s0306-4522(96)00587-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because ceramide is a second messenger that has been associated with stress-induced apoptosis, we investigated a possible link between photodynamic treatment (PDT), ceramide, and apoptosis in L5178Y-R (LY-R) cells. The cells undergo rapid apoptosis, initiating within 30 min of PDT. After a dose of PDT producing a 99.9% loss of clonogenicity, LY-R cells responded by an increased production of ceramide, which reached a maximum level in 60 min. For a constant light fluence and varying concentrations of the phthalocyanine photosensitizer Pc 4 [HOSiPcOSi(CH3)2(CH2)3N(CH3)2], the ED50 for ceramide generation (46 nM) was similar to the LD50 for clonogenic cell death (40 nM). We suggest that the PDT-stimulated increase in synthesis of ceramide in LY-R cells may be coupled to PDT-induced apoptosis. When the cells were exposed to exogenous N-acetyl-sphingosine (10 microM), apoptotic changes were observed only after 12-24 h. The delayed apoptotic response to the synthetic ceramide may be due to an induction of apoptosis by a different route than the one used by PDT.","['Separovic, D', 'He, J', 'Oleinick, N L']","['Separovic D', 'He J', 'Oleinick NL']","['Department of Radiology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-4942, USA. dxs66@po.cwru.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', 'Photochemotherapy/*methods', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 May 1;57(9):1717-21.,,,,,"['P01 CA48735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA15378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

By contrast, HIC1 was hypermethylated in 100% of recurrent ALL and 100% of blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia.

Adhesiveness of BLVRcp1 to blocked plates hindered development of an antigen capture and receptor binding assay with this protein. Unexpectedly, non-specific adsorption of BLVRcp1 was dramatically influenced by temperature. Optimizing incubation temperature and antigen capture at 4 degrees C instead of 37 degrees C and the use of milk as blocking solution removed nonspecific binding of BLVRcp1 allowing development of a functional immunoassay. Thus, the temperature used for antigen capture can be a critical factor that influences performance of the immunoassay.","['Orlik, O', 'Altaner, C', 'Splitter, G A']","['Orlik O', 'Altaner C', 'Splitter GA']","['Department of Animal Health and Biomedical Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunoassay,Journal of immunoassay,8007167,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adsorption', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/drug effects/immunology', 'Binding, Competitive/immunology', 'Immunoradiometric Assay/methods', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/immunology', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/*metabolism', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology', 'Surface Properties', '*Temperature']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01971529708005812 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunoassay. 1997 May;18(2):185-98. doi: 10.1080/01971529708005812.,,,,,['R01 CA59127/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The neoglycoconjugates (biotinylated pseudopolysaccharides) bound uniformly to streptavidin coated magnetic beads as demonstrated by FITC labeled lectin. Streptavidin beads alone did not bind to any of the cell types. The anti- Le(c) hybridoma cell line, LU BCRU-G7, demonstrated binding only to Le(c) pseudopolysaccharide coated magnetic beads. Subsequent incubation in the presence of unlabeled pseudopolysaccharide resulted in the release of the beads from the cell surface. Although there was some heterogeneity within the individual lung and leukemic cell lines, positive cells showed strong rosette formation with the coated beads. The Adi disaccharide coated beads showed binding in all four lung cancer cell lines, with the Le(c) and the H (type1) pseudopolysaccharide-bead conjugates only reactive in the N417 and H146 SCLC lines. The range of L-selectin ligand-coated beads were all successful in binding to the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines MOLT4 and CCRF-CEM.

The median of the 24h-measurement in the child's bedroom was regarded as the most valid exposure variable.

The study involved 528 men known to have participated in the tests, and a control group of 1,504 men who were in the RNZ Navy during the same period but were not involved in the tests. The original follow-up was carried out for the period 1957-87 with an observed increase in risk of leukemia and other hematologic cancers, but little or no increase of non-hematologic cancers or non-cancer deaths in test participants. Follow-up now has been extended for the period 1988-92. For the total follow-up period, there were 97 deaths in test participants and 256 deaths in controls, a relative risk (RR) of 1.1 (90 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.9-1.3). The RR of death from causes other than cancer was 1.0 (CI = 0.8-1.3), whereas the RR of cancer death was 1.2 (CI = 0.8-1.7) and that of cancer incidence was 1.0 (CI = 0.8-1.4). For cancers other than hematologic malignancies, the RR was 1.0 (CI = 0.7-1.5) for mortality, and 1.0 (CI = 0.7-1.3) for incidence. However, there were eight deaths from hematologic cancers in test participants (RR = 3.8, CI = 1.4-10.8), including four leukemias (RR = 5.6, CI = 1.0-41.7). The RR for incidence of hematologic cancers was 1.9 (CI = 0.8-4.3), and that for leukemia was 5.6 (CI = 1.0-41.6). We concluded that the evidence is still consistent with the hypothesis that some leukemias and other hematologic cancers may have resulted from participation in the nuclear weapons test program, but the further follow-up strengthens the evidence that there is no increased risk for non-hematologic cancers or for causes of death other than cancer in the test participants.","['Pearce, N', 'Winkelmann, R', 'Kennedy, J', 'Lewis, S', 'Purdie, G', 'Slater, T', 'Prior, I', 'Fraser, J']","['Pearce N', 'Winkelmann R', 'Kennedy J', 'Lewis S', 'Purdie G', 'Slater T', 'Prior I', 'Fraser J']","['Department of Medicine, Wellington School of Medicine, Wellington, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Confidence Intervals', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', '*Military Personnel', 'New Zealand/ethnology', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Pacific Islands/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'United Kingdom']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1018407927076 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1997 Mar;8(2):139-45. doi: 10.1023/a:1018407927076.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that growth inhibition by CGP 48664A is not merely accomplished by SAMdc inhibition. Concentration-related growth inhibitory effects of AbeAdo, CGP 48664A and methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) (MGBG) were investigated in L1210 cells that were additionally exposed to 10 microM AbeAdo. This concentration causes maximal growth inhibition, profound SAMdc inhibition and plateau polyamine contents. Almost complete inhibition of functional SAMdc activity by 10 microM AbeAdo was confirmed by demonstration of poor conversion of tetradeuterated spermidine to tetradeuterated spermine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Increasing AbeAdo did not affect L1210 cell numbers, viability, nor polyamine contents. MGBG proved highly toxic. CGP 48664A did not affect L1210 polyamine contents, but cell numbers and viability decreased dose-dependently to 50% and 70% of control, respectively. We conclude that CGP 48664A inhibits L1210 growth not only through SAMdc inhibition, but also by an as yet poorly understood second effect with higher IC50.

A prevalence of hexosaminidase A and A-like intermediate forms (alpha beta structure), characterize leukaemic cells of myeloid origin, whereas greater amounts of hexosaminidase B and B-like intermediate forms (beta beta structure), were consistent attributes of leukaemic cells of lymphoid origin. An over-expression of beta-subunits in blasts might be related to their undifferentiated status. These changes in the isoenzymes of hexosaminidase may prove informative about a variety of changes in the biology of leukaemic cells that could range from chromosomal alterations to changes in the proteolytic processing and glycosylation.","['Martino, S', 'Emiliani, C', 'Tabilio, A', 'Falzetti, F', 'Stirling, J L', 'Orlacchio, A']","['Martino S', 'Emiliani C', 'Tabilio A', 'Falzetti F', 'Stirling JL', 'Orlacchio A']","['Dipartimento di Biologia Cellulare e Molecolare, Universita degli Studi di Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Hexosaminidases)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (Hexosaminidase A)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (Hexosaminidase B)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['Hexosaminidase A', 'Hexosaminidase B', 'Hexosaminidases/analysis', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis', 'Leukemia/blood/*enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Neutrophils/enzymology', 'Placenta/enzymology', 'Spleen/enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/*analysis/chemistry']",1997/04/17 00:00,1997/04/17 00:01,['1997/04/17 00:00'],"['1997/04/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-4165(96)00116-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-4165(96)00116-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1997 Apr 17;1335(1-2):5-15. doi: 10.1016/s0304-4165(96)00116-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detailed analyses were also made using one of them, YN-1, which was isolated and established in culture from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Our results demonstrate that gamma-globin protein level and the percentage of benzidine-positive cells in the cell line increased markedly (10- to 30-fold) upon treatment with hemin, TGF-beta1, or Ara-C. In contrast, gamma-globin mRNA was already markedly expressed prior to treatment in 4 out of 9 cell lines examined, including YN-1, and the level increased only marginally after treatment with hemin. ALAS-E mRNA levels were increased in YN-1 cells after treatment with TGF-beta1 and Ara-C, while hemin treatment had little effect. These results indicate that heme supply is insufficient in YN-1 cells and suggest that hemin increases hemoglobin synthesis principally at the post-transcriptional level, whereas TGF-beta1 and Ara-C stimulate hemoglobin synthesis by activating efficient endogenous heme supply in the cells.","['Nagai, T', 'Harigae, H', 'Furuyama, K', 'Munakata, H', 'Hayashi, N', 'Endo, K', 'Sassa, S', 'Yamamoto, M']","['Nagai T', 'Harigae H', 'Furuyama K', 'Munakata H', 'Hayashi N', 'Endo K', 'Sassa S', 'Yamamoto M']","['Department of Biochemistry, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'EC 2.3.1.37 (5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase)']",IM,"['5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021613 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 1997 Mar;121(3):487-95. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021613.,,,,,['DK32890/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Responder lymphocytes generated in immunocompetent mice displayed significant lysis of human target cells, which suggests that mice can generate a strong lymphocytotoxic response to human cells. Effector cells generated in immunocompetent and gld (Fas ligand mutant) mice predominantly use a perforin-mediated cytotoxic mechanism. By contrast, a Fas-mediated pathway could be stimulated in perforin-deficient or beta2-microglobulin-deficient mice, providing the human target cells were sensitive to Fas-mediated lysis. In vitro depletion of effector CD3+ CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T or NK1.1+ cells, completely inhibited lysis of human target cells. This suggests that CD3+ CD8+ T cells were responsible for perforin-mediated xenospecific cytotoxicity. In vivo depletion of NK1.1+ cells and CD4+ T cells before the final immunization abrogated the capacity of lymph node cells to generate xenospecific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. By contrast, in vitro depletion of CD4+ T cells was most effective in abrogating the xenospecific Fas-mediated cytotoxicity of perforin-deficient effector cells. Xenospecific cytotoxic T cells were also capable of mediating tumor rejection when adoptively transferred into scid/scid mice bearing established human COLO 205 xenografts. Overall, these data suggested that xenospecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes can lyse target cells via either perforin- or Fas-mediated pathways and that these cells can provide protective and specific immunity against tumor xenografts in the absence of an intact humoral immune system.","['Smyth, M J', 'Kershaw, M H', 'Trapani, J A']","['Smyth MJ', 'Kershaw MH', 'Trapani JA']","['Cellular Cytotoxicity Laboratory, The Austin Research Institute, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Graft Rejection/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/physiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/pharmacology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Perforin', 'Phenotype', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/27 00:00,1997/04/27 00:01,['1997/04/27 00:00'],"['1997/04/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199704270-00019 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1997 Apr 27;63(8):1171-8. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199704270-00019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Our study design was a case-series review with determination of risk by comparison with unaffected controls by log-rank or Fisher's exact (two-tailed) test and logistic regression analyses. The study group comprised 1165 consecutive marrow recipients at a single center from 1988 to 1991. RESULTS: IPS was documented in 85 BMT recipients (7.3%) by bronchoalveolar lavage (n=68), open lung biopsy (n=3), or autopsy (n=14). The calculated actuarial incidence for IPS within 120 days after BMT was 7.7%. Median time to onset was 21 days (mean 34+/-30). Hospital mortality was 74%, and 53 BMT recipients (62%) died with progressive respiratory failure. IPS resolved in 22 patients (26%); 18 patients (21%) survived to discharge. Mechanical ventilation was required by 59 BMT recipients (69%), within a median of 2 days of onset of infiltrates. Two of these 59 recipients (3%) survived to discharge. Pulmonary infection (predominantly fungal) was noted in 7 of 25 (28%) BMT recipients who had an autopsy. Potential risk factors for IPS were assessed in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Although the incidence was not significantly different between autologous (5.7%) and allogeneic marrow recipients (7.6%), risks were identified only for the latter: malignancy other than leukemia (odds ratio=6.5 compared with aplastic anemia), and grade 4 graft-versus-host disease (odds ratio=5.4 compared with lower grades). No factors were associated with recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of idiopathic lung injury seems lower, the onset earlier, and the risk factors different from those previously reported. The major risks seem to be regimen-related toxicity and multi-organ dysfunction associated with alloreactive processes.","['Kantrow, S P', 'Hackman, R C', 'Boeckh, M', 'Myerson, D', 'Crawford, S W']","['Kantrow SP', 'Hackman RC', 'Boeckh M', 'Myerson D', 'Crawford SW']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,['RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Bilirubin/blood', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/cytology/microbiology/virology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Pneumonia/epidemiology/*etiology/therapy', 'Regression Analysis', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Risk Factors', 'Syndrome']",1997/04/27 00:00,1997/04/27 00:01,['1997/04/27 00:00'],"['1997/04/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199704270-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1997 Apr 27;63(8):1079-86. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199704270-00006.,,,,,"['CA-15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out on the 8 PCP cases admitted to the PICU from July 1991 to September 1994. The variables studied were: age, sex, geographic origin, associated pathology, immunological status, clinical manifestations, biochemical data, radiology, findings in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL), response to therapy and clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Age of the patients varied between 3 months and 9 years and there were 5 males and 3 females. Associated pathologies included AIDS (4 cases), severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Job's syndrome, and immunodeficiencies secondary to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), one case of each. Four cases appeared in a 22 day period. All cases but one suffered acute respiratory failure and needed mechanical ventilation. Diagnosis was established by means of BAL in every case. All cases showed a bilateral diffuse alveolo-interstitial pattern on chest films. Treatment was trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In the acute illnesses, 2 patients died (cases of terminal SCID and NHL). CONCLUSIONS: To date, epidemic presentation of PCP has not been reported in our community. Four of our cases, with no demonstrable previous relation, appeared over a short period of time. We have not found a relationship between LDH levels and severity, as expressed by mechanical ventilation time. Every AIDS case survived the acute episode and CD4 counts were normal in most cases.","['Martinez Marin, M I', 'de la Mota Ybancos, J L', 'Romero Garcia, J', 'Milano Manso, G', 'Perez Ruiz, E', 'Calvo Macias, C', 'Martinez Valverde, A']","['Martinez Marin MI', 'de la Mota Ybancos JL', 'Romero Garcia J', 'Milano Manso G', 'Perez Ruiz E', 'Calvo Macias C', 'Martinez Valverde A']","['Departamento de Pediatria, Hospital Materno Infantil, Hospital Regional, Malaga.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,An Esp Pediatr,Anales espanoles de pediatria,0420463,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/diagnosis/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,An Esp Pediatr. 1996 Dec;45(6):570-4.,,,,,,,Fracaso respiratorio agudo secundario a neumonia por Pneumocystis carinii en la infancia.,,,,,,,,,

In pediatric oncology, there aren't many specific markers useful to screen subjects at risk of developing cancer or to follow-up after treatment. For these reasons, polyamines' levels in plasma and erythrocytes have been evaluated in three groups of patients: healthy, with acute leukemia and with solid tumour. METHODS: Polyamines' content has been determined on samples of blood, previously dansylated, by HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography). RESULTS: The results of this study show that putrescine is decreased in plasma of patients with acute leukemia and with solid tumours. The difference, even if more important in subjects with leukemia, is significant in both groups. Spermidine instead, shows an increase, but only in patients with solid tumour. Erythrocyte assays reveal a significant decrease of spermidine in subjects with acute leukemia with consequent inversion of spermidine/spermine ratio. In erythrocytes there aren't any other significant changes in relation to the levels observed in healthy patients. Polyamine assay, especially that of putrescine and spermidine in plasma, could be propounded as a marker for pediatric neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS: Moreover, as it is well-known, pediatric neoplasms lead to alterations of polyamine metabolism, because the synthesis and catabolism of these molecules is closely involved in tumoral growth. Consequently, inhibitors of polyamine synthesis could be used with success in antineoplastic chemotherapy.","['Sicca, E', 'Gallesio, C', 'Colombatto, S', 'Madon, E']","['Sicca E', 'Gallesio C', 'Colombatto S', 'Madon E']","[""Dipartimento di Scienze Pediatriche e dell'Adolescenza, Universita degli Studi, Torino,""]",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Minerva Pediatr,Minerva pediatrica,0400740,['0 (Polyamines)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Erythrocytes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Male', '*Plasma', 'Polyamines/*blood']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Minerva Pediatr. 1997 Jan-Feb;49(1-2):21-7.,,,,,,,Dosaggi plasmatici ed eritrocitari delle poliamine in pazienti oncologici pediatrici.,,,,,,,,,

We have compared the efficacy of etoposide with that of mafosfamide, which has been used mainly for purging in acute leukemias. First, we examined the effects of VP-16 and ASTA-Z on the normal hematopoietic progenitors and on the erythroleukemic cell K562. Subsequently, we evaluated purging activity in cocultures using two different ratios of leukemic contamination. The most effective drug concentrations in inhibiting 100% of K562 growth were 50 micrograms/ml of ASTA-Z and 70 micrograms of VP-16. Residual growth of normal colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) was 4.8% with VP-16 and 32.5% with ASTA-Z. In treated cocultures, ASTA-Z produced a higher inhibition of the K562 line than VP-16 at both levels of leukemic cell contamination. At 0.5% contamination, VP-16 showed higher toxicity toward normal hematopoietic progenitors than ASTA-Z. At the 5% contamination level, VP-16 completely inhibited colony formation, whereas ASTA-Z spared some normal progenitor cells (21.2%). In conclusion, in our experimental model, VP-16 did not show improved efficacy over ASTA-Z in killing leukemic cells and in sparing normal progenitors.","['Olivieri, A', 'Poloni, A', 'Montanari, M', 'Cantori, I', 'Corvatta, L', 'Masia, M C', 'Curzi, L', 'Mancini, S', 'Leoni, P']","['Olivieri A', 'Poloni A', 'Montanari M', 'Cantori I', 'Corvatta L', 'Masia MC', 'Curzi L', 'Mancini S', 'Leoni P']","['Clinica di Ematologia, Universita di Ancona, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Hematother,Journal of hematotherapy,9306048,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives', '*Etoposide', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.1.1997.6.137 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother. 1997 Apr;6(2):137-44. doi: 10.1089/scd.1.1997.6.137.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors review 10 cases of cerebral meningiomas following high-dose radiotherapy in patients operated for neoplasm of the nervous system. The pathologic and clinical aspects of this unusual complication are analyzed in all cases in the world literature. RESULTS: There is a female predominance (F-M ratio: 3:2) and the patients are young (mean age: 33.1 years; median: 29 years). The average latency period is 14.4 years (range: 9-21 years). The first disease is acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in 40% of cases. Radiation induced meningiomas are atypical in four cases. Recurrence was observed in one case without malignant transformation. CONCLUSION: High-dose radiation-induced meningiomas have the following characteristics: (1) children appear particularly sensitive to the development of this tumor; (2) there is a female predominance, otherwise than is observed in low-dose meningioma; (3) these tumors present a peak frequency in the third decade of life; and (4) frequently, these tumors are atypical and recur. Finally, it is essential that every new case be reported to throw light on this particular pathologic correlation with its many grey areas.","['Salvati, M', 'Cervoni, L', 'Puzzilli, F', 'Bristot, R', 'Delfini, R', 'Gagliardi, F M']","['Salvati M', 'Cervoni L', 'Puzzilli F', 'Bristot R', 'Delfini R', 'Gagliardi FM']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Neuromed Institute, Pozzilli, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Surg Neurol,Surgical neurology,0367070,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Meningioma/*etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0090301996003606 [pii]', '10.1016/s0090-3019(96)00360-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Surg Neurol. 1997 May;47(5):435-41; discussion 441-2. doi: 10.1016/s0090-3019(96)00360-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effect of soluble ligands and the interaction with fibroblasts in an in vitro system developed for the expansion of normal B lymphocytes. A total of 17 peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from patients with untreated B-CLL were analyzed for survival, apoptosis, and bcl-2 protein expression. The most efficient stimulus for cell survival was cocultivation with CDw32-transfected murine fibroblasts, which achieved a median of 56% surviving CD5 positive B cells with a plateau between Day 3 and Day 13 (p < 0.0001). IL-4 alone had a significant, but less profound, effect on cell survival: cell viability was increased by a factor of 1.7 on Day 3 (p = 0.001), but cell viability continued to decline. In contrast, the soluble recombinant human CD40 ligand and two different anti-CD40 antibodies did not prolong cell survival. In all experiments prolongation of cell survival was accompanied by a significant reduction of apoptosis of the leukemic B cells: in CDw32-transfected fibroblasts apoptosis was reduced by a mean of 90%, in IL-4 by a mean of 55%. Reduction in apoptotic cell death was associated with elevated bcl-2 protein levels. Our results emphasize the critical role of the interaction between B-CLL cells and CDw32-transfected fibroblasts for cell viability in vitro. Prolongation of cell survival is caused by a reduction of apoptosis and correlates with bcl-2 protein expression.","['Buske, C', 'Gogowski, G', 'Schreiber, K', 'Rave-Frank, M', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Wormann, B']","['Buske C', 'Gogowski G', 'Schreiber K', 'Rave-Frank M', 'Hiddemann W', 'Wormann B']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CD40 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1997 Apr;25(4):329-37.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It encodes a transcription factor derived from any one of four alternate transcripts. WT1 has a restricted pattern of expression within the body and within the hemopoietic system its expression is limited to primitive leukemias and a number of leukemic cell lines. Given the overexpression of WT1 in leukemias, we have addressed the question of whether this gene is expressed within the normal hemopoietic system. Mononuclear bone marrow (BM) cells obtained from normal donors were separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) into ""primitive"" (CD34+) and ""mature"" (CD34-) cell populations. Total RNA extracted from these cells was subjected to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers based on the WT1 sequence, to examine the expression of this gene within the hemopoietic system. Phenotypic purity of cells was guaranteed by performing single-cell sorting followed by RT-PCR to define the precise cellular phenotypes that express WT1. Expression of WT1 was detected in cells bearing the CD34+ phenotype but not in those cells lacking expression of CD34. In addition, single-cell analysis revealed that expression of WT1 occurred in the candidate stem cell-containing population of hemopoietic cells which have the phenotype CD34+ CD38-. Moreover, the single-cell RT-PCR analysis also demonstrated that differential expression of alternate transcripts of WT1 occurs between hemopoietic progenitor cells with the same phenotype. In conclusion, expression of WT1 is limited to early progenitors of the blood system, which suggests that this gene plays a critical role in hemopoietic development.","['Baird, P N', 'Simmons, P J']","['Baird PN', 'Simmons PJ']","['Leukaemia Research Unit, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'WT1 Proteins']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1997 Apr;25(4):312-20.,['Exp Hematol. 1997 Dec;25(13):1311-2.

We screened RNA from six patients with JCML for mutations in the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR) coding sequence using RT-PCR-SSCP. Altered patterns were found in five patients for the GM-CSFR alpha chain, and in five patients for the beta chain. Two nucleotide substitutions accounted for all alpha chain abnormalities; one was conservative for Val333 and the other caused an Ala17-->Gly substitution. Both had previously been detected in normal controls. Sequencing of beta chain abnormalities revealed four base substitutions. Three were previously described polymorphisms, one causing a Pro603-->Thr substitution and two conservative point mutations involving Ser426 and Pro648. A further nucleotide mutation, which resulted in a Glu249-->Gln substitution, was also found but is not thought to be of pathological significance. Polymorphisms of the GM-CSFR alpha and beta chains are common, but pathogenic point mutations of the GM-CSFR are infrequent in patients with JCML and are unlikely to be involved in the hypersensitivity to GM-CSF demonstrated by progenitor cells.","['Freeburn, R W', 'Gale, R E', 'Wagner, H M', 'Linch, D C']","['Freeburn RW', 'Gale RE', 'Wagner HM', 'Linch DC']","['Department of Haematology, Univeristy College London Medical School, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1997 Apr;25(4):306-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining delineates splenic microanatomy poorly, we have developed a method that simultaneously stains reticulin fibers and B-lymphocytes. B3 or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival splenic tissue with diagnoses of SLL/CLL (11 cases), RLH (10 cases), and trauma (seven cases) were studied using a novel silver nitrate immunoperoxidase (SNIP) double-staining technique. Gordon and Sweet's reticulin stain was followed by immunoperoxidase staining for B-lineage marker CD20 (Dakopatts, Carpinteria, CA) using the avidin-biotin method. This allowed us to clearly localize B cells to Malpighian bodies, periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths, sinuses, or cords. Features identified by SNIP found only in SLL/CLL, but not in RLH or traumatized spleens, were trabecular infiltration (eight of 11 cases), subendothelial infiltration (seven of 11 cases), and prominent sinus involvement (seven of 11 cases). One or more of these features were seen in 10 of 11 cases of SLL/CLL. Other distinguishing features were the percentage area occupied by B-lymphocytes in each section (SLL/CLL = 74%; RLH = 46%; traumatized spleens = 36%); and mean spleen weight (SLL/CLL = 1,603 g; RLH = 287 g; traumatized spleens = 126 g).

In normal fertile women, LIF was not detected in flushings obtained on days luteinizing hormone (LH)+0 to LH+6 of the cycle, but concentrations gradually increased from day LH+7 to a maximum at day LH+12. The amount of LIF in flushings obtained from women with unexplained infertility was significantly lower than in those from normal fertile women on day LH+10 (P < 0.05). The production of LIF by cultured human epithelial and stromal cells was also investigated. LIF was not detectable in the supernatants of cultured stromal cells. Basal LIF production by epithelial cells varied according to the stage in the cycle at which the biopsy was taken. Significantly more LIF was produced by epithelial cells from late proliferative and early secretory endometrium compared with amounts produced by cells from early proliferative (P < 0.001) and late secretory (P < 0.01) endometrium. High doses of progesterone and oestradiol caused a small decrease in epithelial cell LIF production: the combined effect of progesterone and oestradiol (P < 0.01) was greater than the effect of either steroid alone (P < 0.05). The results show, for the first time, the capability of human endometrium to produce LIF in vivo. The fact that maximum LIF concentrations are present at implantation and that decreased concentrations occur in women with unexplained infertility suggest the importance of this cytokine in embryo implantation.","['Laird, S M', 'Tuckerman, E M', 'Dalton, C F', 'Dunphy, B C', 'Li, T C', 'Zhang, X']","['Laird SM', 'Tuckerman EM', 'Dalton CF', 'Dunphy BC', 'Li TC', 'Zhang X']","['Division of Biomedical Sciences/Health Research Institute, Sheffield Hallam University.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Luteinizing Hormone/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Menstrual Cycle']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/humrep/12.3.569 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Reprod. 1997 Mar;12(3):569-74. doi: 10.1093/humrep/12.3.569.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since Vmw110-deficient viruses reactivate inefficiently in mouse latency models it has been suggested that Vmw110 plays a role in the balance between the latent and lytic states of the virus. The mechanisms by which Vmw110 achieves these functions are poorly understood. Vmw110 migrates to discrete nuclear structures (ND10) which contain the cellular PML protein, and in consequence PML and other constituent proteins are dispersed. In addition, Vmw110 binds to a cellular protein of approximately 135 kDa, and its interactions with the 135 kDa protein and ND10 contribute to its ability to stimulate gene expression and viral lytic growth. In this report we identify the 135 kDa protein as a novel member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family. The protease is distributed in the nucleus in a micropunctate pattern with a limited number of larger discrete foci, some of which co-localize with PML in ND10. At early times of virus infection, the presence of Vmw110 increases the proportion of ND10 which contain the ubiquitin-specific protease. These results identify a novel, transitory component of ND10 and implicate a previously uncharacterized ubiquitin-dependent pathway in the control of viral gene expression.","['Everett, R D', 'Meredith, M', 'Orr, A', 'Cross, A', 'Kathoria, M', 'Parkinson, J']","['Everett RD', 'Meredith M', 'Orr A', 'Cross A', 'Kathoria M', 'Parkinson J']","['Medical Research Council Virology Unit, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Corrected and Republished Article']",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Endopeptidases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Library', 'HeLa Cells', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7', 'Virus Latency']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/16.7.1519 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 1997 Apr 1;16(7):1519-30. doi: 10.1093/emboj/16.7.1519.,,,PMC1169756,['GENBANK/Z72499'],,,,,,,['EMBO J. 1997 Feb 3;16(3):566-77.

The human lysozyme (LZM) gene also provides a very useful model, because its protein synthesis is continuously increased during myelopoiesis and thus most abundant in mature phagocytes. Several shifts toward LZM gene demethylation coincide with upregulation of expression: activation of expression in myeloid precursor cells and in primary cells of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was associated with demethylation at a CpG dinucleotide within the 5' flanking region; high-level expression in different types of normal mature phagocytic cells was associated with complete demethylation at two additional, intragenic CpG sites. Methylation changes occurring within the lysozyme gene could reflect transcriptional control of gene expression or maintenance of distinct maturation stages during phagocyte development. They correlate with maturational arrest and lysozyme gene expression in acute myeloid leukemias and may thus provide a genetic marker for the blocked differentiation of these neoplastic cells.

Hypermethylation within the promoters of selected genes appears to be especially common in all types of human hematopoietic neoplasms, and is usually associated with inactivation of the involved gene(s). Such hypermethylation-associated silencing of gene expression has been shown for several genes regulating the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells, including the estrogen receptor (ER) gene, P15, P16 and others. Hypermethylation within the promoters of some genes appear to be an early event in the pathogenesis of neoplasia (ER, P15), while other genes seem to become methylated during the progression of leukemias (HIC1, c-abl). The high prevalence of promoter methylation suggests that this molecular abnormality can be used to monitor disease activity during therapy. In addition, new technology allows the sensitive identification of gene hypermethylation in a background of normal cells, suggesting possible new strategies for the detection of minimal residual disease. Finally, reactivation of tumor-suppressor gene expression through pharmacologic inhibition of DNA methyltransferase and resultant DNA demethylation appears to be a promising new avenue of therapy in acute leukemia.","['Issa, J P', 'Baylin, S B', 'Herman, J G']","['Issa JP', 'Baylin SB', 'Herman JG']","['Oncology Center, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)""]",IM,"['Blood Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', '*DNA Methylation', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/physiopathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Mar;11 Suppl 1:S7-11.,,58,,,['5R01CA43318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Since 5-Aza-CdR is an S phase specific agent and has a short plasma half-life, its antileukemic activity is dose schedule-dependent. Leukemia patients who are candidates for 5-Aza-CdR therapy following relapse after therapy with cytosine arabinoside are at greater risk for the problem of drug resistance since these cytosine nucleoside analogues are metabolized by the same enzymes. Due to its unique mechanism of action of demethylating DNA, 5-Aza-CdR has the potential to activate tumor (growth) suppressor and differentiation genes that have been accidentally silenced by DNA methylation in leukemic cells. All these factors should be taken into account in the design of the optimal dose schedule of this analogue. The optimal dose schedule of 5-Aza-CdR should be based on the kinetic parameters of deoxycytidine kinase, its pharmacokinetics, its effects on DNA methylation and the cell cycle parameters of the leukemic cells and the normal hematopoietic stem cells. Since granulocytopenia is the major toxic effect produced by 5-Aza-CdR, the use of hematopoietic growth factors to shorten the duration of leukopenia should be investigated. Another approach which we are investigating is to use the methods of gene therapy to insert the cytidine deaminase gene into normal hematopoietic progenitor cells so as to make them drug resistant to 5-Aza-CdR. The use of other agents that can induce the differentiation of leukemic cells in combination with 5-Aza-CdR may have the potential to increase the clinical effectiveness of this analogue for the therapy of leukemia.","['Momparler, R L', 'Cote, S', 'Eliopoulos, N']","['Momparler RL', 'Cote S', 'Eliopoulos N']","['Departement de Pharmacologie, Universite de Montreal, Hopital Ste-Justine, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Mar;11 Suppl 1:S1-6.,,57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These membrane proteins are members of the rhodopsin superfamily of G-protein coupled seven-transmembrane segment receptors. New monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed against the deduced N-terminal sequences of the IL-8RA (mAb SE2) and IL-8RB (mAb HC2) were generated to determine the IL-8R expression on human blood leukocytes and two human myeloid cell lines. The C5aR expression was detected using the mAb W17/1. Approximately 107,000 C5aR, 55,000 IL-8RA, and 25,000 IL-8RB molecules per cell could be detected on human granulocytes by flow cytometric analysis. On peripheral blood monocytes, 42,000 C5aR molecules/cell and 3000 IL-8RB molecules/cell were expressed. However, we were unable to quantitate IL-8RA expression, which was detectable but below 2500 molecules per cell and thus outside the standard range for the quantitation of receptor molecules by flow cytometry. On AML-193 cells, only the IL-8RB was constitutively expressed, whereas on HL-60 cells, we could not detect expression of any of the three receptors. Vitamin D3 (250 ng/ml, 7 days), which has been shown to induce differentiation of AML-193 and HL-60 cells into the monocytic phenotype, led to an up-regulation of IL-8RB and C5aR in both cell lines in the absence of any expression of IL-8RA. In contrast, all-trans retinoic acid (0.1 microM, 7 days), which induces differentiation into the granulocytic phenotype, led to an up-regulation of IL-8RB in AML-193 cells and to an expression of IL-8RB and C5aR in HL-60 cells. Again, neither cell line expressed IL-8RA. These findings suggest that regulation of IL-8RA expression differs from that of its IL-8RB homolog and may be a late event in leukocyte maturation.","['Zahn, S', 'Zwirner, J', 'Spengler, H P', 'Gotze, O']","['Zahn S', 'Zwirner J', 'Spengler HP', 'Gotze O']","['Department of Immunology, Georg-August University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8A)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chemotactic Factors/*metabolism', 'Cholecalciferol/*pharmacology', 'Complement C5a/*metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a', 'Receptors, Complement/*drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8A', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/toxicity']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830270420 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1997 Apr;27(4):935-40. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830270420.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A considerable amount of evidence indicates that the TCR contacts both the peptide and the MHC components of the ligand. In fully differentiated T cells the interaction between the peptide and the TCR makes the critical contribution to eliciting a cellular response. However, during the positive selection of thymocytes the contribution of peptide relative to MHC is less well established. Indeed it has been suggested that the critical interaction for positive selection is between the TCR and the MHC molecule and that peptides can be viewed as either allowing or obstructing this contact. This predicts that a given TCR is capable of engaging multiple MHC/peptide complexes. In this study a system is described which detects simply engagement of the TCR by MHC/peptide complexes rather than the functional outcome of such interactions. Using this approach the extent to which peptides can influence contacts between the TCR and the MHC molecule has been examined. The results show that the TCR does in fact engage a wide range of ligands in an MHC-restricted but largely peptide-independent manner, suggesting that only a few peptides are able to prevent the TCR from contacting the MHC molecule.","['Vessey, S J', 'Barouch, D H', 'McAdam, S N', 'Tussey, L G', 'Davenport, M A', ""O'Callaghan, C A"", 'Bell, J I', 'McMichael, A J', 'Jakobsen, B K']","['Vessey SJ', 'Barouch DH', 'McAdam SN', 'Tussey LG', 'Davenport MA', ""O'Callaghan CA"", 'Bell JI', 'McMichael AJ', 'Jakobsen BK']","['Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John-Radcliffe Hospital, GB.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (antigen T cell receptor, zeta chain)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Degranulation/genetics/immunology', 'Epitopes/genetics', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Peptides/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830270412 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1997 Apr;27(4):879-85. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830270412.,,,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,

Quantification of apoptosis by morphology, diphenylamine DNA fragmentation assay and by gel electrophoresis showed similar rates of apoptosis in chronic phase CML and normal peripheral blood neutrophils when the cells were incubated in RPMI + FCS or in serum-free medium. However, there were lower rates of apoptosis in accelerated and blast phase CML neutrophils (p < .001) and in normal bone marrow neutrophils (p < .001) compared to normal peripheral blood neutrophils (incubated in RPMI + FCS). Survival among neutrophils from chronic phase or accelerated/blast phase CML patients was significantly longer (p < 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively) than among normal peripheral blood neutrophils but neutrophils purified from normal bone marrow had a survival rate which fell between that of normal peripheral blood and chronic phase CML patients. When the cells were incubated in RPMI + autologous sera, neutrophils from chronic phase CML patients showed markedly lower rates of apoptosis (p < 0.001) and maintained higher metabolic activities (p < 0.002) compared to normal neutrophils. G-CSF and GM-CSF were found to considerably decrease the rate of apoptosis in chronic phase CML neutrophils (p < 0.001 and p = 0.008 respectively) while IL-1beta did not show any antiapoptotic effect.

In addition to a high incidence of treatment-related complications, older patients may have other disease characteristics which predict for brief remission duration despite intensive consolidation chemotherapy. We analyzed the long-term results of high-dose cytarabine-anthracycline consolidation chemotherapy in older patients and examined the effect of major prognostic factors including a history of myelodysplasia, increased age, and cytogenetics. One hundred and ten patients age > or = 60 with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia were enrolled on three sequential studies conducted from 1982 to 1996. Fifty-six patients (51%) achieved a complete remission and were eligible for high-dose cytarabine-based consolidation chemotherapy administered in two to three courses. After a median follow-up of surviving patients for seventeen months, twelve patients remain alive with eleven in continued remission. Median remission duration for all eligible patients is nine months and the actuarial leukemia-free survival is 14 +/- 10%. Toxicity of consolidation therapy included treatment-related death in six patients and serious neurotoxicity in five. When compared to younger patients, patients over age 60 sustained a much higher risk of relapse despite successfully completing intensive consolidation therapy, regardless of whether other adverse prognostic features were present. Advanced age in acute myelogenous leukemia is associated with a significantly higher risk of relapse unmodified by the presence or absence of other adverse disease characteristics. Although older patients tolerated intensive therapy designed to address the high risk of relapse, there was no apparent benefit of high-dose cytarabine consolidation alone as post-remission treatment for acute myelogenous leukemia in this population.","['Schiller, G', 'Lee, M']","['Schiller G', 'Lee M']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Preleukemia/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199709042501 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Mar;25(1-2):111-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199709042501.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are different families of RTKs which are mainly characterized by differences in the ligang-binding extracellular domains. Axl (or UFO/Ark) is the first member of a new class of RTK with two fibronectin type III domains and two immunoglobulin-like domains present at the extracellular domain. The axl-gene has been isolated by means of gene transfection studies using DNA of patients with chronic myelogeneous leukemia. For a previous and the present study, we used a sensitive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay to detect axl's mRNA in cells from normal and malignant hematopoietic tissue. Axl's mRNA expression was mainly detected in myelo-monocytic cells, whereas much weaker transcription was seen in lymphatic cells and in lymphatic leukemias. In normal bone marrow, axl was heavily transcribed in marrow stromal cells. Further, we analysed Axl protein expression using monoclonal antibody M50 in peripheral stem cell harvests; in most harvests, no co-expression of CD34 and Axl was detected. However, in one patient with AML in complete remission, Axl was co-expressed on 80% of the CD34-positive population. These data show that axl is preferentially expressed in monocytes and stromal cells. Furthermore, a fraction of CD34-positive progenitor cells may express Axl. The exact mechanism for transformation of myeloid progenitor cells through Axl, however, remains to be determined.","['Neubauer, A', 'Burchert, A', 'Maiwald, C', 'Gruss, H J', 'Serke, S', 'Huhn, D', 'Wittig, B', 'Liu, E']","['Neubauer A', 'Burchert A', 'Maiwald C', 'Gruss HJ', 'Serke S', 'Huhn D', 'Wittig B', 'Liu E']","['Virchow Klinikum, Medizinische Fakultat der Humboldt Universitat zu Berlin, Abteilung fur Innere Medizin-Hamatologie, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (growth arrest-specific protein 6)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (axl receptor tyrosine kinase)']",IM,"['Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', '*Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*physiopathology', 'Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199709042499 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Mar;25(1-2):91-6. doi: 10.3109/10428199709042499.,,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the potential advantages of autologous PBSCT is the possibility that peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are less likely to be contaminated by leukemic cells than bone marrow grafts. However, the major problem still remains the high incidence of leukemic relapse following autologous PBSCT, which may be caused by the reinfusion of PBSC contaminated by leukemic cells. Recently, we have developed a quantitative assay using competitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction that estimates the number of AML1/ETO transcripts in t(8;21) acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), in order to determine the degree of leukemic cell contamination in PBSC harvests, and to monitor minimal residual disease (MRD) quantitatively in patients with t(8;21) AML. Our data indicate that although PBSC harvests collected after consolidation chemotherapy are contaminated by leukemic cells, the degree of leukemic cell contamination decreases with repeated cycles of chemotherapy. Furthermore, the MRD in PBSC harvests is less than in the corresponding bone marrow obtained on the day of the PBSC collection. There appears to be no relationship between the number of AML1/ETO transcripts found in the infused PBSC harvests and the incidence of leukemic relapse following autologous PBSCT in our study. However, a substantial decrease of AML1/ETO transcripts was seen following autologous PBSCT.

In normal donors, G-CSF receptors are widely expressed from CD34-positive immature bone marrow cells to mature peripheral granulocytes. The highest expression of G-CSF receptors is observed in peripheral granulocytes. In the bone marrow, the level of G-CSF receptors expression increases in the following order; CD34+ CD33- cells < CD34+ CD33+ cells < CD34- CD33+ cells, indicating that G-CSF receptors are expressed on myeloid cells from a very early stage of differentiation and that the level of expression increases with the progress of cell maturation. G-CSF receptors are also detected on blast cells of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). The number of cell surface receptors varies from patient to patient, and no clear correlation is observed between the expression of receptors and the leukemia subtype or the cell surface markers.

In particular, those aberrations which cause a shortening of G1 phase length and a deregulated S phase entry seem to be very important. Two main tumor suppressor loci, involved in the cell cycle regulation, are frequently altered in human tumors. One is located on 13q14 chromosome and includes the gene coding pRb protein while the other is located on 9p21 chromosome and involves two genes, namely p16INK4A and p15INK4B which belong to the same gene family. While RB1 gene is scarcely altered in hematological tumors, the putative tumor suppressor gene(s) on 9p21 appear(s) to be frequently inactivated in some subtypes of cancers derived from hematopoietic tissues. This manuscript will review the main biochemical aspects of the cell division cycle with major emphasis devoted to the findings regarding the recently characterized small proteic mitotic inhibitors and to their possible role in cancer formation. Particular attention will be paid to the data concerning the incidence of p16INK4A (and p15INK4B) gene(s) inactivation in human acute lymphoblastic leukemias. Indeed, such gene(s) seems to be the main, and until now the unique, tumor suppressor gene consistently altered in this acute hematological cancer diseases.

The involvement of Fas/FasL pathway has been investigated in human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells. Fas/CD95 is expressed on a majority of AML cells, although the intensity of expression is variable. The cross-linking with anti-Fas antibody can induce apoptotic cell death in certain cases of AML. When DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression are enhanced by growth-promoting cytokines, such as interleukin-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, Fas-insensitive AML cells acquire cellular susceptibility toward Fas-mediated apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis reveals that Fas-mediated apoptotic signals can be transduced into cells in G1B compartment and G1A-->G1B transition might support the induction of Fas-mediated apoptosis. In addition, Fas-mediated apoptotic cell death of AML cells is also induced by interleukin-2-activated T cells expressing functional FasL on their surfaces. Activated T cells express a large amount of FasL mRNA, compared with freshly isolated T cells. The Fas/FasL pathway seems to be the major mechanism of T cell-mediated apoptosis in AML cells, although alternative mechanisms can also be operative. The induction of apoptosis in Fas/FasL system might be a novel and effective approach for leukemia immunotherapy.","['Komada, Y', 'Sakurai, M']","['Komada Y', 'Sakurai M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199709042492 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Mar;25(1-2):9-21. doi: 10.3109/10428199709042492.,,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the contribution of the Fas/Fas ligand (Fas L) system to the pathogenesis of MAIDS remained unknown. Here, we examined the susceptibility of C57BL/6 (B6) lpr/lpr mice, which has been reported to be defective for the expression of Fas, to MAIDS. We found that the Thy1.2- CD4T cells and Ig kappa dull B220+ cells, which are characteristic of MAIDS, increased after the inoculation of LP-BM5 MuLV in B6 lpr/lpr mice. B220+ TCR alpha beta T cells, unique to lupus prone mice, also increased in the B6 lpr/lpr mice after infection. CD4+ B220+ TCR alpha beta T cells increased profoundly among the B220+ TCR alpha beta T cells from LP-BM5 MuLV-infected B6 lpr/lpr mice, while the B220+ TCR alpha beta T cells observed in non-infected B6 lpr/lpr mice were largely of the CD4-CD8- phenotype. A DNA PCR analysis of the LP-BM5 MuLV-infected B6 lpr/lpr mice revealed the genome integration of defective LP-BM5 virus, further confirming that MAIDS is inducible to B6 lpr/lpr mice. LP-BM5 MuLV-infected lpr/lpr mice died within 3 months, while MAIDS-infected B6 +/+ mice usually died within 5 to 6 months, and B6 lpr/lpr mice not infected with LP-BM5 MuLV lived more than 6 months. Taken together, these results suggest that MAIDS is inducible independently with functional Fas expression and the possibility of accelerated progression of murine AIDS and lpr-associated autoimmune disease in B6 lpr/lpr mice infected with LP-BM5 MuLV.","['Hiromatsu, K', 'Usami, J', 'Aoki, Y', 'Makino, M', 'Yoshikai, Y']","['Hiromatsu K', 'Usami J', 'Aoki Y', 'Makino M', 'Yoshikai Y']","['Laboratory of Host Defense, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Defective Viruses/isolation & purification', 'Disease Progression', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred MRL lpr', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*etiology/immunology/mortality', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'fas Receptor/*genetics']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1348-0421.1997.tb01194.x [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 1997;41(3):221-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.1997.tb01194.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the mechanism by which L-arginine stimulates membrane depolarization, an increase of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells. 2. L-Arginine failed to affect beta-cell metabolism, as monitored by NAD(P)H autofluorescence. 3. L-Arginine produced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i, which was dependent on membrane depolarization and extracellular calcium. 4. The cationic amino acids L-ornithine, L-lysine, L-homoarginine (which is not metabolized) and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) produced [Ca2+]i responses similar to that produced by L-arginine. The neutral nitric oxide synthase inhibitors NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) and N omega-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NAME) also increased [Ca2+]i. D-Arginine was ineffective. 5. L-Arginine did not affect whole-cell Ca2+ currents or ATP-sensitive K+ currents, but produced an inward current that was carried by the amino acid. 6. The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated the presence of messenger RNA for the murine cationic amino acid transporters mCAT2A and mCAT2B within the beta-cell. 7. L-Arginine did not affect beta-cell exocytosis as assayed by changes in cell capacitance. 8. Our data suggest that L-arginine elevates [Ca2+]i and stimulates insulin secretion as a consequence of its electrogenic transport into the beta-cell.

The expression of HLA and costimulatory molecules and the stimulatory capacity of the dendritic cell-enriched cell suspensions were optimal between days 7 and 10 after onset of the cultures.

In this study we investigated mechanisms for up-regulation of this process. Activation with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP; 100 nM) enhanced PMN ciprofloxacin uptake by 50% (P < 0.05). Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; > or = 10 nM) enhanced uptake by at least 36-fold, mainly by stimulating an increase in the Vmax of the ciprofloxacin transporter. This effect of PMA was inhibited by antagonists of protein kinase C (H7 and chelerythrine) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade downstream (PD 098059). Under resting and PMA-activated conditions, ciprofloxacin uptake by immature human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells was much lower than in PMNs. However, when HL-60 cells were induced to mature into PMN-like cells, their ciprofloxacin uptake activity increased markedly. These findings implicate a role for protein kinase C in up-regulation of the ciprofloxacin transporter and suggest that myeloid cells acquire an enhanced ability to take up ciprofloxacin as they mature to end-stage PMNs.","['Loo, K C', 'Cario, A C', 'Zhang, F', 'Walters, J D']","['Loo KC', 'Cario AC', 'Zhang F', 'Walters JD']","['Section of Periodontology, College of Dentistry, The Ohio State University Health Sciences Center, Columbus 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Anti-Infective Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciprofloxacin/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neutrophil Activation/drug effects', 'Neutrophils/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.61.5.619 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1997 May;61(5):619-23. doi: 10.1002/jlb.61.5.619.,,,,,"['K04 DE00338/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE09851/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

A 2.7 kb cDNA was cloned and sequenced. The open reading frame contains a 400 amino acid sequence corresponding to a novel 45 kDa basic protein (pI 8.9). The JEM DNA sequence is detected by FISH on human chromosome 1 at q24. The Jem peptide sequence shows a 'leucine-zipper' dimerisation motif with limited homology to Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB proteins and several putative phosphorylation sites. An atypical basic region may correspond to an unknown DNA-binding domain. The C-terminal end of Jem spans a long stretch featuring a PEST motif. After transfection into COS cells, the Jem protein shows a ponctuated nuclear localisation.

However, analysis of the oncogenic activity of the fusion protein in tissue culture assays or in mice has been hampered by its apparent toxicity in multiple murine cells. To circumvent this problem, we generated an inducible line of transgenic mice, MT135, in which the expression of PML-RAR alpha is driven by the metallothionein promoter. After 5 days zinc stimulation, 27 out of 54 mice developed hepatic preneoplasia and neoplasia including foci of basophilic hepatocytes, dysplasia and carcinoma with a significantly higher incidence of lesions in females than in males. The rapid onset of liver pathologies was dependent on overexpression of the transgene since it was not detected in noninduced transgenic animals of the same age. The PML-RAR alpha protein was always present in altered tissues at much higher levels than in the surrounding normal liver tissues. In addition, overexpression of PML-RAR alpha resulted in a strong proliferative response in the hepatocytes.

Infusions of leukemia-reactive T cells to patients after autologous BMT may be a means for providing a GVL effect. Costimulation of T cells by binding of the CD28 receptor on T cells with B7-counter receptors on antigen presenting cells amplifies antigen-specific T-cell responses. To enhance generation of leukemia reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), the murine B7-1- and B7-2-costimulatory molecule cDNAs were introduced into the MHC class I+, class II-, murine meyloid leukemia cell line C1498. B7-1 expression greatly enhanced the ability of the leukemia cells to generate and expand leukemia reactive CTL in vitro. A highly cytolytic and C1498 specific CD8+ CTL line was generated by B7-1 costimulation. This CTL line proliferated autonomously and produced interleukin-2 when provided B7-1 or B7-2 costimulation by C1498 leukemia cells. To test the in vivo antileukemia properties of this CTL line, irradiated syngeneic BMT recipients were given graded doses of leukemia cells on day 0, followed by CTL infusions beginning on day 1 post-BMT. Recipients of 10(7) CTL had a 3 log reduction in leukemia burden such that 100% of mice were protected from a supralethal leukemic cell dose. Sustained immune responses were detectable up to 3 months postinfusion of the CTL line. B7-1 or B7-2 costimulation in vivo did not augment antileukemia effects of infused CTL post BMT.

We examined the involvement of CED-3/ICE-like proteases in the apoptosis of B-CLL cells. One of the substrates of these proteases is poly(ADP [adenosine 5'-diphosphate]-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The effect of different factors that induce the apoptosis of B-CLL cells on the proteolytic cleavage of PARP has been studied. Treatment of B-CLL cells with different concentrations of dexamethasone (1 to 1,000 micromol/L) induced in a dose-dependent manner the cleavage of PARP. Dexamethasone induced PARP cleavage after 12 hours of incubation, which was almost complete at 48 hours. PARP cleavage during apoptosis of B-CLL cells was studied in cells from eight patients and a correlation was found between cell viability and the degree of PARP cleavage. Incubation in vitro of B-CLL cells with fludarabine for 48 hours induced PARP cleavage in all the cases studied. Protein kinase C (PKC) activation with 100 nmol/L TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate) or incubation with interleukin-4 (10 ng/mL) prevented either dexamethasone- or fludarabine-induced proteolysis of PARP. Incubation of B-CLL cells with the CED-3/ICE-like protease inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk inhibited spontaneous and dexamethasone-induced PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, Z-VAD.fmk prevented the cytotoxic effect of dexamethasone. These results indicate that CED-3/ICE-like proteases play an important role in the apoptosis of B-CLL cells.","['Bellosillo, B', 'Dalmau, M', 'Colomer, D', 'Gil, J']","['Bellosillo B', 'Dalmau M', 'Colomer D', 'Gil J']","['Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques Humanes i de la Nutricio, Universitat de Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (ced-3 protein, C elegans)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Apoptosis', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Caspase 1', '*Caspases', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58353-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 May 1;89(9):3378-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HRX gene codes for a predicted 431-kD protein that shows significant homology to the Drosophila trithorax protein, an Hox epigenetic regulator. Typically, the region encoding the HRX gene is rearranged, mostly in reciprocal translocations with a number of partners, resulting in a range of fusion genes. However, this is not the only abnormality affecting HRX because partial duplication of the gene, as well as interstitial deletions, can occur. Despite extensive studies of HRX at the genetic level, the protein products of the HRX gene and their patterns of expression in normal and leukemic cells remain uncharacterized. In this study we analyzed the distribution and localization of HRX proteins in cell lines and human tissues, using both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The specificity of these reagents was confirmed using cells transfected with the HRX-ENL fusion gene. Western blot analyses of protein extracts from cells carrying the t(11;19) and t(4;11) translocations showed HRX chimeric proteins whose migrations corresponded to the sizes predicted from analyses of translocation-induced fusion mRNAs expressed by the derivative 11 chromosomes. Immunocytochemical analysis showed a punctate distribution of wild-type and chimeric HRX proteins within cell nuclei, suggesting that HRX localizes to nuclear structures in cells with and without 11q23 translocations. Nuclear staining was found in the majority of tissues studied with the strongest reactivity in cerebral cortex, kidney, thyroid, and lymphoid tissues. Thus, HRX is widely expressed in most cell types including hematopoietic cells, a finding that precludes an immunocytochemical approach for diagnosis of leukemias bearing 11q23 structural abnormalities.","['Butler, L H', 'Slany, R', 'Cui, X', 'Cleary, M L', 'Mason, D Y']","['Butler LH', 'Slany R', 'Cui X', 'Cleary ML', 'Mason DY']","['University Department of Cellular Science, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Trl protein, Drosophila)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Drosophila', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Lymphocytes', 'Multigene Family', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/genetics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58351-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 May 1;89(9):3361-70.,,,,,['CA55029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

As2O3 was administered intravenously at the dose of 10 mg/d. Clinical CR was achieved in nine of 10 (90%) patients treated with As2O3 alone and in the remaining five patients treated by the combination of As2O3 and low-dose chemotherapeutic drugs or ATRA. During the treatment with As2O3, there was no bone marrow depression and only limited side effects were encountered. Pharmacokinetic studies, which were performed in eight patients, showed that after a peak level of 5.54 micromol/L to 7.30 micromol/L, plasma arsenic was rapidly eliminated, and the continuous administration of As2O3 did not alter its pharmacokinetic behaviors. In addition, increased amounts of arsenic appeared in the urine, with a daily excretion accounting for approximately 1% to 8% of the total daily dose administered. Arsenic contents in hair and nail were increased, and the peak content of arsenic could reach 2.5 to 2.7 microg/g tissue at CR. On the other hand, a decline of the arsenic content in hair and nail was observed after withdrawal of the drug. We conclude that As2O3 treatment is an effective and relatively safe drug in APL patients refractory to ATRA and conventional chemotherapy.","['Shen, Z X', 'Chen, G Q', 'Ni, J H', 'Li, X S', 'Xiong, S M', 'Qiu, Q Y', 'Zhu, J', 'Tang, W', 'Sun, G L', 'Yang, K Q', 'Chen, Y', 'Zhou, L', 'Fang, Z W', 'Wang, Y T', 'Ma, J', 'Zhang, P', 'Zhang, T D', 'Chen, S J', 'Chen, Z', 'Wang, Z Y']","['Shen ZX', 'Chen GQ', 'Ni JH', 'Li XS', 'Xiong SM', 'Qiu QY', 'Zhu J', 'Tang W', 'Sun GL', 'Yang KQ', 'Chen Y', 'Zhou L', 'Fang ZW', 'Wang YT', 'Ma J', 'Zhang P', 'Zhang TD', 'Chen SJ', 'Chen Z', 'Wang ZY']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Department of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, P.R.

As2O3 exerts dose-dependent dual effects on APL cells.,3345-53,"Recent clinical studies in China showed that As2O3 is an effective and relatively safe drug in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). We found previously that As2O3 can trigger apoptosis of APL cell line NB4 cells, which is associated with downregulation of bcl-2 gene expression and modulation of PML-RAR alpha chimeric protein. To further understand the mechanisms of this alternative therapy for APL, we investigated in this report the effects of a wide range of concentrations of As2O2 on cultured primary APL cells, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-susceptible (NB4 cells) and ATRA-resistant (MR2 subclone) APL cell lines. The results indicated that As2O3 had dose-dependent dual effects on APL cells: inducing preferentially apoptosis at relatively high concentrations (0.5 to 2 micromol/L) and inducing partial differentiation at low concentrations (0.1 to 0.5 micromol/L). The rapid modulation and degradation of PML-RAR alpha proteins, which was induced by As2O3 at 0.1 to 2 micromol/L, could contribute to these two effects. Bone marrow and peripheral blood examination showed that myelocyte-like cells, probably as a result of partial in vivo differentiation, and degenerative cells increased after 2 to 3 weeks of continuous in vivo As2O3 treatment when leukemic promyelocytes decreased. In conclusion, combination of induction of apoptosis and partial differention could be the main cellular mechanisms of As2O3 in the treatment of APL, and PML-RAR alpha could play an important role in determining the specific effects of As2O3 on APL cells.","['Chen, G Q', 'Shi, X G', 'Tang, W', 'Xiong, S M', 'Zhu, J', 'Cai, X', 'Han, Z G', 'Ni, J H', 'Shi, G Y', 'Jia, P M', 'Liu, M M', 'He, K L', 'Niu, C', 'Ma, J', 'Zhang, P', 'Zhang, T D', 'Paul, P', 'Naoe, T', 'Kitamura, K', 'Miller, W', 'Waxman, S', 'Wang, Z Y', 'de The, H', 'Chen, S J', 'Chen, Z']","['Chen GQ', 'Shi XG', 'Tang W', 'Xiong SM', 'Zhu J', 'Cai X', 'Han ZG', 'Ni JH', 'Shi GY', 'Jia PM', 'Liu MM', 'He KL', 'Niu C', 'Ma J', 'Zhang P', 'Zhang TD', 'Paul P', 'Naoe T', 'Kitamura K', 'Miller W', 'Waxman S', 'Wang ZY', 'de The H', 'Chen SJ', 'Chen Z']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation Lab, Rui-Jin Hospital, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Arsenic Poisoning', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/therapeutic use', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oxides/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58349-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 May 1;89(9):3345-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Southwest Oncology Group study.,3323-9,"Compared with younger patients, elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy. To determine if this poor response is due to differences in the biologic characteristics of AML in the elderly, we studied 211 patients (161 de novo, 50 secondary AML) over 55 years of age (median, 68 years) registered to a single clinical trial for previously untreated AML (SWOG 9031, Phase III randomized trial of standard dose cytosine arabinoside and daunomycin + rhG-CSF). Pretreatment leukemic blasts were karyotyped and were also analyzed for intrinsic drug resistance by quantitating expression of the multidrug resistance glycoprotein MDR1 and functional drug efflux using sensitive flow cytometric techniques. Results were correlated with clinical variables and outcome. These elderly AML patients had a high frequency of unfavorable cytogenetics (32%), MDR1 protein expression (71%), and functional drug efflux (58%); each of these factors occurred at high frequencies in both de novo and secondary AML patients and was associated with a significantly poorer complete remission (CR) rate. In multivariate analysis, secondary AML (P = .0035), unfavorable cytogenetics (P = .0031), and MDR1 (P = .0041) were each significantly and independently associated with lower CR rates. Resistant disease was associated with unfavorable cytogenetics (P = .017) and MDR1 expression (P = .0007). Strikingly, elderly MDR1(-) de novo AML patients with favorable/intermediate cytogenetics had a CR rate of 81%; with increasing MDR1 expression, CR rate decreased in this cytogenetic group. MDR1(+) secondary AML patients with unfavorable cytogenetics had a CR rate of only 12%. Thus, AML in the elderly is associated with an increased frequency of unfavorable cytogenetics and MDR1 expression, both of which independently contribute to poor outcomes. The high frequencies of these features in both de novo and secondary elderly AML patients suggest a common biologic mechanism for these leukemias distinct from that in younger patients. Investigation of biologic parameters at diagnosis in AML in the elderly may help identify patients with a high likelihood of achieving CR with conventional regimens, as well as those who may require alternate regimens designed to overcome therapy resistance.","['Leith, C P', 'Kopecky, K J', 'Godwin, J', 'McConnell, T', 'Slovak, M L', 'Chen, I M', 'Head, D R', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Willman, C L']","['Leith CP', 'Kopecky KJ', 'Godwin J', 'McConnell T', 'Slovak ML', 'Chen IM', 'Head DR', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Willman CL']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/drug therapy/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58346-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 May 1;89(9):3323-9.,,,,,"['CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

By analysis of clones generated randomly from the blood of virus carriers, we confirm that CD4 T cells are the major reservoir of HTLV-I in vivo and show that most infected cells contain a single integrated provirus. Contrary to the situation in HTLV-I immortalized cell lines, the HTLV-I provirus was found to be transcriptionally silent in a high proportion of randomly generated T-cell clones and could not be reactivated by mitogenic stimulation. The spontaneous proliferation previously documented in HTLV-I-infected T-cell clones was not observed in silently infected cells, and therefore correlates directly with the expression of tax and other viral genes. The only cytokine mRNA found to be significantly elevated in the virus-producing clones was interleukin-6; however, receptor-blocking experiments argue against a role for IL-6 in the virus-induced cell proliferation. We observed a striking variation in the ability of individual HTLV-I-producing clones to immortalize fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes. This ability did not correlate with the levels of viral mRNA expression, gag p24 production, spontaneous proliferation, or tax-transactivation, possibly suggesting a role for host cell factors as determinants of viral infectivity or immortalization. Studies to elucidate the basis of this phenotypic heterogeneity should enhance our understanding of viral spread and pathogenesis.","['Richardson, J H', 'Hollsberg, P', 'Windhagen, A', 'Child, L A', 'Hafler, D A', 'Lever, A M']","['Richardson JH', 'Hollsberg P', 'Windhagen A', 'Child LA', 'Hafler DA', 'Lever AM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Products, gag/biosynthesis', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58344-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 May 1;89(9):3303-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The enriched population of CD34+ cells (more than 95%) was cultured in the presence of stem cell factor, interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, and either granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or macrophage colony-stimulating factor to achieve granulocyte or monocyte/macrophage differentiation, respectively. The expression of Bcl-x increased in the early stages of both differentiation pathways. However, by day 21 of culture mature granulocytes were Bcl-x-negative, whereas monocytes/macrophages either maintained or increased the expression of Bcl-x. The pattern of Bcl-x expression in the differentiated CD34+ cells was similar to that observed in HL-60 cells differentiated along the granulocyte lineage (induced by incubation with retinoic acid), or along the monocyte/macrophage lineage (induced by incubation with phorbol diester). The bcl-x transcript predominant in HL-60 and CD34+ cells differentiated into monocytes/macrophages was bcl-xL. Although little is yet known regarding the functional significance of Bcl-x within the granulomonocytic compartment, marked changes in the pattern of its expression, as observed during granulomonocytic differentiation of HL-60 and CD34+ cells, are likely to alter the life span of mature granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages.","['Sanz, C', 'Benito, A', 'Silva, M', 'Albella, B', 'Richard, C', 'Segovia, J C', 'Insunza, A', 'Bueren, J A', 'Fernandez-Luna, J L']","['Sanz C', 'Benito A', 'Silva M', 'Albella B', 'Richard C', 'Segovia JC', 'Insunza A', 'Bueren JA', 'Fernandez-Luna JL']","['Servicio de Immunologia, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Insalud, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'bcl-X Protein']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58331-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 May 1;89(9):3199-204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients suffered from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 1), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 3), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; n = 3). Two patients received a second DLI because of disease progression after the first one. The origin of the CD34+ cells was determined by analyzing variable number of tandem repeats with polymerase chain reaction and, in sex-mismatched cases, by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Before DLI CD34+ cells were exclusively of donor origin in four patients. In another patient 41% of CD34+ cells were derived from the donor. No aplasia occurred in these patients after DLI, whereas in the two patients with exclusively recipient hematopoiesis severe aplasia lasting for 5 and 13 weeks necessitated hematopoietic stem cell support. One patient who had only 5% CD34+ donor cells before DLI recovered without stem cell support after 10 days. Two patients in relapse of CML showed a high percentage of BCR-ABL- CD34+ cells of recipient origin before DLI. These BCR-ABL- cells of recipient type did not prevent severe aplasia which indicates that the assessment of BCR-ABL+ hematopoiesis alone is insufficient for predicting aplasia. Our data indicate that in case of sufficient donor hematopoiesis before DLI no persistent aplasia will occur. Thus, evaluation of donor hematopoiesis allows prediction of aplasia after DLI and makes early therapeutic interventions possible.","['Keil, F', 'Haas, O A', 'Fritsch, G', 'Kalhs, P', 'Lechner, K', 'Mannhalter, C', 'Reiter, E', 'Niederwieser, D', 'Hoecker, P', 'Greinix, H T']","['Keil F', 'Haas OA', 'Fritsch G', 'Kalhs P', 'Lechner K', 'Mannhalter C', 'Reiter E', 'Niederwieser D', 'Hoecker P', 'Greinix HT']","['Department of Medicine I, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD3 Complex)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Antigens, CD/blood', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD3 Complex/blood', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/immunology/therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Family', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/immunology/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58321-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 May 1;89(9):3113-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To define the phenotype of such cells with long-term proliferative capacity in vitro and in vivo, we have used the production of leukemic clonogenic cells (CFU) after 2 to 8 weeks in suspension culture as a measure of these cells in vitro and compared their phenotype with that of cells capable of engrafting nonobese diabetic severe combined immune deficient (NOD/SCID) mice. Leukemic blast peripheral blood cells were evaluated for expression of CD34 and Thy-1 (CD90) antigens. The majority of AML blast cells at diagnosis lacked expression of Thy-1. Most primary CFU-blast and the CFU detected at up to 8 weeks from suspension cultures were CD34+/Thy-1-. AML cells that were capable of engrafting NOD/SCID mice were also found to have the CD34+/Thy-1- phenotype. However, significant engraftment was achieved using both CD34+/Thy-1- and CD34- subfractions from one AML M5 patient.

It is a common opinion that cranial irradiation (CI) is the most important factor for blunted growth. Accordingly, recent therapeutic strategies in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) avoid cranial irradiation. Here we analysed longitudinal data on growth and puberty of 54 children in first complete remission, who were treated with 18 Gy CI or not submitted to radiotherapy. Two chemotherapeutic protocols were compared which were similar during the induction period but differed in the intensity of maintenance therapy. In cranial irradiated patients both in males and females the pubertal growth spurt started at a mean age of 1.2 years (SD: 0.93 years) earlier than controls. Age at diagnosis and age at pubertal growth spurt were significantly correlated (r = 0.35, P = 0.017). Similarly, menarche occurred at a mean age (n = 22) of 12.1 years and was correlated with the age at start of therapy in girls who were treated with 18 Gy CI (r = 0.61, P = 0.01). Adult height was reached spontaneously in 30 patients treated during prepubertal age and in 10 treated shortly before or during puberty. In all prepubertal patients treated for 2-3 years with intensive maintenance therapy blunted growth resulted in a significant loss of -1.85 H-SDS (median, P = 0.0051) compared to height at diagnosis. However, if continuation treatment used only methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine (i.e. BFM protocol) final height equalled projected adult height, despite 18 Gy CI. CONCLUSIONS: (1) multiagent chemotherapy is of major impact for growth and puberty; (2) 18 Gy cranial irradiation is below the critical dosage responsible for blunted growth; (3) loss in potential growth might be prevented by current CT strategies; (4) onset of puberty depends on age when antileukaemic therapy is applied.","['Mohnike, K', 'Dorffel, W', 'Timme, J', 'Kluba, U', 'Aumann, V', 'Vorwerk, P', 'Mittler, U']","['Mohnike K', 'Dorffel W', 'Timme J', 'Kluba U', 'Aumann V', 'Vorwerk P', 'Mittler U']","['Otto-von-Guericke-Universitat Magdeburg, Zentrum fur Kinderheilkunde, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Growth/physiology', 'Growth Disorders/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Puberty/physiology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004310050599 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 1997 Apr;156(4):272-6. doi: 10.1007/s004310050599.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been linked with the development of IgAN in several clinical studies, and retroviral infection may be associated with the pathogenesis of IgAN in some patients. The incidence of IgAN has been found to possess distinct geographical distributions, and familial genetic clustering. To determine if retroviral infection is associated with IgAN in a large population of patients, genomic DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 90 patients seronegative for HIV and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) (37 IgAN, 33 other glomerulonephritis, and 20 healthy controls) was evaluated by nested PCR using a pan-lentivirus-specific primer set (PLSPS), targeting the consensus sequence of the lentiviral pol gene. In 37.8% (14 of 37) of the patients with IgAN, the PCR products migrated in parallel with bands produced by PCR of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infected cells. No products of the expected size were detected in the other patient groups (p < 0.0001, Chi-square). These results suggest that exposure to retroviral infection is more common in patients with IgAN, compared with patients with other proliferative glomerulonephritides, or patients without renal disease.

The results of immunophenotyping of the leukemic blasts in the BM of the CSF+ and CSF patient groups were then compared, and the relative risk ratio and positive predictive value were calculated for each marker. In addition, other possible prognostic factors, such as gender, race and ethnicity, age, and initial leukocyte count were compared between the two groups.

The expression of any of these antigenic markers at diagnosis appears to identify at least 88% of cases of B-lineage ALL that have or ultimately may have TdT+ cells in CSE The results of this study therefore may have both basic and clinical implications: The former concerns the mechanisms by which these phenotypically defined forms of ALL invade and persist in the CNS; the latter concerns the utility of routine immunophenotyping of BM blasts at diagnosis to assess the biologic predisposition to CNS involvement in individual cases of ALL.","['Donskoy, E', 'Tausche, F', 'Altman, A', 'Quinn, J', 'Goldschneider, I']","['Donskoy E', 'Tausche F', 'Altman A', 'Quinn J', 'Goldschneider I']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington 06030-3105, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Blast Crisis/immunology/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Markers', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukocyte Count']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/107.5.608 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1997 May;107(5):608-16. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/107.5.608.,,,,,['AI-14743/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the NK activity, NK subpopulation, and HLA types of 65 healthy Japanese individuals in Japan, most of whom have a quite different HLA-B(C) type than did subjects in the earlier study. Among 13 individuals having low NK activity, only two were HLA-B(C) homozygous and the rest were heterozygous. No obvious relation between low NK activity and specific HLA-B(C) allele was found. Seven of the nine HLA-B(C) homozygotes had medium or high NK activity. No significant differences were detected in either the NK activity or in the NK subset frequencies (circulating NK cell number) between HLA-B(C) homozygous and heterozygous individuals.

IL-6 belongs to a family of related cytokines that includes leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, IL-11, ciliary neurotropic factor, and cardiotropin-1, all of which initiate signaling through a receptor-associated gp130. IL-6 induces homodimerization of gp130 and activates the Jak/STAT pathway of signal transduction. In addition, IL-6 stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinases designated ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase)-1 and -2. Activation of ERK-1 and -2 may involve the Src homology-2 containing proteins Shc and Grb2. Here we provide evidence that Shc could function as signaling molecules for IL-6 in DeFew-IL-6R/gp130 cells, a human B lymphoma cell line engineered to express high levels of both the IL-6R (p80) and the gp130 subunit. IL-6 was shown to promote the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130, Jak2, and Shc proteins. Moreover, Shc associated both in vivo and in vitro with phosphorylated gp130 through the Shc-Src homology-2 domain. We also report that Shc bound to activated Jak2 by using the Shc amino terminal phosphotyrosine interaction domain. Following IL-6 stimulation, Shc physically associated with Grb2. Thus, the data point to Shc proteins as a functional link between the Jak2 and Ras pathways of IL-6 signal transduction.","['Giordano, V', 'De Falco, G', 'Chiari, R', 'Quinto, I', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Bartholomew, L', 'Delmastro, P', 'Gadina, M', 'Scala, G']","['Giordano V', 'De Falco G', 'Chiari R', 'Quinto I', 'Pelicci PG', 'Bartholomew L', 'Delmastro P', 'Gadina M', 'Scala G']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Technology, Medical School, University Federico II, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (SHC1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*physiology', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proteins/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 May 1;158(9):4097-103.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nucleic acid sequence analyses of the Ig cDNA revealed each to express two functional Ig V(H) genes: V(H)3-33 and V(H)4-39; V(H)3-7 and V(H)4-39; V(H)3-23 and V(H)4-61; V(H)2-70 and V(H)3-30.3; or V(H)3-30 and V(H)4-b (DP67). One sample expressed three Ig V(H) genes: V(H)2-70, V(H)3-7, and V(H)4-59. Despite having more than one Ig heavy chain transcript, each sample was found to express only one functional Ig light chain. From the primary sequence, we deduced that the Ig of some of these CLL samples should react with Lc1, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) reactive with a supratypic cross-reactive idiotype present on Ig encoded by a subgroup of Ig V(H)4 genes (namely, V(H)4-39, V(H)4-b [DP-67], V(H)4-59, or V(H)4-61), and B6, an mAb that reacts with Ig encoded by certain Ig V(H)3 genes (namely, V(H)3-23, V(H)3-30, or V(H)3-30.3), and/or modified staphylococcal protein A (SpA), a 45-kilodalton bacterial ""superantigen"" that reacts with most Ig of the V(H)3 subgroup. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that such samples did in fact react with Lc1 and B6 and/or SpA, but not with control mAbs of irrelevant specificity.

Only a marginal increase in sPLA2 activity in cell culture supernatants of HepG2 cells was observed upon stimulation for 24 h with LIF, whereas OSM increased the activity about 10-fold and proved to be even more effective than the combination of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, the best known stimuli so far. sPLA2 activity was synergistically enhanced by OSM plus TNF-alpha (15-fold) or IL-1 beta (20-fold). Changes in sPLA2 activity were reflected at mRNA levels. Cytokine induction of sPLA2 mRNA was comparable to the induction of haptoglobin mRNA. The effect of dexamethasone on the expression of both genes, in contrast, was different: cytokine-induced haptoglobin mRNA expression was enhanced, whereas sPLA2 mRNA expression was partially inhibited by dexamethasone resulting in decreased sPLA2 activity. The strong induction by OSM in HepG2 cells thus confirmed sPLA2 as acute phase protein, whereas the effect of dexamethasone was comparable to the one observed in other cell types.","['Haselmann, J', 'Goppelt-Struebe, M']","['Haselmann J', 'Goppelt-Struebe M']","['Department of Medicine IV, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Haptoglobins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Haptoglobins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Liver Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Phospholipases A/*genetics', 'Phospholipases A2', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(96)90154-4 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1996.0154 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1997 Mar;9(3):199-205. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1996.0154.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main aim of this paper is to illustrate and compare three such methods. Those of Clayton and Schifflers, Robertson and Boyle, and De Carli and La Vecchia. The main differences between these methods lie in their approach to distinguish between linear-period and linear-cohort effects. Clayton and Schifflers do not attempt to solve this identification problem, whereas Robertson and Boyle, and De Carli and La Vecchia attempt to tackle this question. METHODS: In order to study the assumptions and problems of these methods, we analysed data from 2678 subjects aged 30-84 in Yorkshire, UK, who were diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) during the period 1978-1991. Loglinear Poisson models were used to examine the effects of age, period and cohort. RESULTS: All three methods of analysis agree that, after stratification for sex and county, the age-standardized rate has been increasing at about 5% per year. The Robertson-Boyle method differed from the Clayton-Schifflers method in showing a significant non-linear cohort effect, and a significant county-cohort interaction. The method of De Carli-La Vecchia agreed more closely with Clayton-Schifflers than with Robertson-Boyle. CONCLUSIONS: The linear increase in incidence would lead to a doubling of the number of cases within 15 years. There is controversy over whether the identification problem can be solved and should be solved. Many authors would not rely on the results of the methods of Robertson and Boyle, or De Carli and La Vacchia.","['McNally, R J', 'Alexander, F E', 'Staines, A', 'Cartwright, R A']","['McNally RJ', 'Alexander FE', 'Staines A', 'Cartwright RA']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, University of Leeds, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Sex Distribution', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ije/26.1.32 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 1997 Feb;26(1):32-46. doi: 10.1093/ije/26.1.32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We first assessed the effect of NO on the patching and capping by using anti-human LFA-1 monoclonal antibody. Samples were analyzed by a fluorescence microscope. As expected, NO inhibited the percentage of capping dose dependently. We compared the effect of NO on capping with cytochalasin D (CD) and observed that CD also inhibits the capping in HL-60 cells. We next examined the effect of NO on the F-actin content. For assays of F-actin content, the FITC labelled phalloidin was permeabilized and stained in HL-60 cells. The bound fluorescence quantified by flow cytometry using a FACStar. There was a decrease in the F-actin formation in NO treated cells. Taken together, these data indicate that NO inhibits the capping on cellular membrane by decreasing the intracellular F-actin formation in HL-60 cells. We suggest that the formation of capping linked with actin polymerization at the inner leaflet of plasma membrane may be regulated by NO.","['Lee, J H', 'Ryu, H', 'Han, M K', 'Kim, U H', 'Chung, H T']","['Lee JH', 'Ryu H', 'Han MK', 'Kim UH', 'Chung HT']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Wonkwang University School of Medicine, Chonbuk, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biopolymers)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '169D1260KM (Nitroprusside)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)']",IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biopolymers/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Cytochalasin D/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Capping/*drug effects/physiology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/*pharmacology', 'Nitroprusside/pharmacology', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology']",1997/03/27 00:00,1997/03/27 00:01,['1997/03/27 00:00'],"['1997/03/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(97)96380-4 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1997.6380 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1997 Mar 27;232(3):827-31. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1997.6380.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This substrate was used to assay the ability of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (RT) to cleave the RNA portion of the substrate. The cleavage specificities of the cognate M-MuLV RT and the heterologous enzyme from the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) were compared. M-MuLV and HIV-1 RT recognize and cleave the RNA at distinct positions. The site of the initial RNase H cleavage in vitro was determined using 3' end nearest neighbor analysis of the initial cleavage product. M-MuLV RT/RNase H removed the model tRNAPro between the terminal ribo-A and ribo-C, resulting in a terminal ribo-A attached to the viral DNA, whereas HIV-1 RT/RNase H was shown to cleave at the RNA-DNA junction. Analysis of the DNA over time indicated that the ribo-A is subsequently removed by M-MuLV RT. In vivo analysis from double-LTR circle junctions illustrated that 16 of the 23 clones isolated possessed the predicted junction if complete removal of the tRNA primer were to occur. The predicted junction for complete removal of the tRNA primer was CATT-AATG. One aberrant circle junction was isolated which could result from the use of an alternative primer. In contrast with HIV, no M-MuLV circle junctions were isolated which indicated processing of a single-LTR terminus by integrase. Analysis from in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that the M-MuLV tRNAPro primer is completely removed after plus-strand strong-stop synthesis.","['Smith, C M', 'Potts, W B 3rd', 'Smith, J S', 'Roth, M J']","['Smith CM', 'Potts WB 3rd', 'Smith JS', 'Roth MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Pro)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Chemical', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'RNA, Transfer, Pro/*metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/*metabolism']",1997/03/17 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/03/17 00:00'],"['1997/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(97)98454-3 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1997.8454 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1997 Mar 17;229(2):437-46. doi: 10.1006/viro.1997.8454.,,,,,"['GM51151/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM08360/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the interactions of EBV with HIV-1 and HTLV-I in human term syncytiotrophoblast cells to investigate the significance of double infections in transplacental transmission of human retroviruses. We found that syncytiotrophoblast cells could be productively infected with EBV. Dual infection of the cells with EBV and HTLV-I resulted in full replication cycle of otherwise latent HTLV-I. In contrast, the restricted permissiveness of syncytiotrophoblasts for HIV-1 was not influenced by coinfection of the cells with EBV. Infection of syncytiotrophoblast cells with EBV, but not HTLV-I, induced interleukin-2 and interleukin-6 secretion, and augmented secretion occurred on coinfection with both viruses. Coinfection of syncytiotrophoblast cells with EBV and HTLV-I induced tumor necrosis factor-beta and transforming growth factor-beta 1 secretion, but infection with either virus alone did not lead to secretion of these cytokines. Permissive replication cycle of HTLV-I was induced by the EBV immediate-early gene product Zta. Pseudotype formation between EBV and HTLV-I in coinfected syncytiotrophoblast cells was not found.

Although permanent epithelial and endothelial cell lines are already indispensable tools with respect to initial infection processes, studies concerning the interaction of neisseriae with phagocytic cells have been confined to primary human blood cells. We investigated the use of human leukemia-derived monocytic and myelomonocytic cell lines that can be differentiated in vitro towards phagocytic cells by a panel of chemical and biological reagents including cytokines, vitamin analogs, and antileukemia drugs. Whereas tumor necrosis factor alpha, gamma interferon, bufalin, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor only marginally increased the ability of monocytic MonoMac-6 and myelomonocytic JOSK-M cells to interact with the bacteria, retinoic acid and vitamin D3 treatment for 2 to 4 days led to highly phagocytic cells that internalized gonococci in an Opa protein-specific manner. This is comparable to the phagocytosis by primary monocytes from human blood, where more than 80% of cells are infected with intracellular bacteria. The increased phagocytic activity of JOSK-M cells following in vitro differentiation was paralleled by enhanced oxidative burst capacity. Whereas undifferentiated cells responded to neither phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate nor other known soluble and particulate stimuli, cells incubated with retinoic acid and bufalin showed the same pattern and the same intensity of oxidative burst activity in response to Neisseria gonorrhoeae as primary cells: Opa-expressing gonococci elicited an oxidative burst, whereas Opa- gonococci did not.

The present study sought to determine whether patients with these disorders represent 2 distinct subsets of neutropenic RA. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of outpatients attending clinics in university and private hospitals and in offices of private practice physicians. Twenty-two patients with Felty's syndrome and 22 patients with LGL leukemia, 10 of whom had RA, were studied. HLA genotyping was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear leukocyte genomic DNA. RESULTS: Nineteen of the 22 patients with Felty's syndrome (86%) were DR4 positive. Nine of the 10 patients with LGL leukemia plus RA were also DR4 positive. In contrast, only 4 of the 12 patients with LGL leukemia without RA (33%) were DR4 positive, a frequency that was within the normal range. CONCLUSION: The finding of an equally high prevalence of DR4 in patients with Felty's syndrome and in those with LGL leukemia plus RA suggests that both disorders have a similar immunogenetic basis and are parts of a single disease process rather than 2 separate disorders.","['Starkebaum, G', 'Loughran, T P Jr', 'Gaur, L K', 'Davis, P', 'Nepom, B S']","['Starkebaum G', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Gaur LK', 'Davis P', 'Nepom BS']","['VA Medical Center and University of Washington, Seattle, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,['0 (HLA-DR4 Antigen)'],IM,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/genetics/*immunology', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Felty Syndrome/genetics/*immunology', 'Genotype', 'HLA-DR4 Antigen/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunogenetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/*immunology', 'Prospective Studies']",1997/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.1780400406 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 1997 Apr;40(4):624-6. doi: 10.1002/art.1780400406.,,,,,"['CA-46903/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-54552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The control laboratory magnetic field corresponded to 45 microT DC and a stray 50 Hz field below 0.2 microT. The culture growth cycle of cells maintained inside the solenoid was slightly accelerated compared with that of cells maintained outside the solenoid (P < .05). This stimulation probably depended on sensitivity of cell cycle to a magnetic field, because, inside the solenoid, the percentage of G1 cells slightly increased during the culture growth cycle, whereas that of S cells slightly decreased. Acceleration of growth was detected soon after exposure of the cultures to the solenoid field, and growth did not change further if the action of this field continued for a long time, accounting for adaptation. The solenoid field also caused a small increase of cell survival without influencing cell volume. By contrast, the culture growth cycle of cells maintained inside the magnetically shielded room was slightly decelerated compared with that of cells maintained outside the room (P < .05). The essential absence of any field inside the magnetically shielded room also caused a small increase of cell volume, whereas, during the culture growth cycle, the percentage of G1 cells decreased, and that of S cells increased.

Since specific enzyme replacement for TPI deficiency is not currently available, the secretion and recapture of the missing enzyme was investigated in a co-culture model comprising K562 human erythroleukaemia cells and lymphoblastoid cells taken from a TPI deficient patient. A sevenfold reduction in intracellular DHAP with concomitant increase in intracellular TPI activity from 7.25 +/- 0.1 to 197.2 +/- 10 units/mg protein was achieved for co-cultured lymphoblastoid cells.

However, despite a complete remission rate of about 90%, most patients relapse and are resistant to further treatment with RA. This resistance primarily is due to an increased systemic catabolism of RA. In this study we examined the catabolism of RA by the human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4 and the human myeloid leukemia cell line HL60. NB4 cells converted RA to 4-hydroxy-RA, 4-oxo-RA and more polar unidentified retinoids at a much greater rate than HL60 cells. Exposure of NB4 cells to RA induced RA catabolism. We found that 4-hydroxyphenylretinamide (4-HPR) inhibited the catabolism of RA. This inhibition was dosedependent and greater, on a molar basis, than the inhibition seen with the cytochrome P450 inhibitor, ketoconazole, or two synthetic retinoids, Ch55 and Am80. 4-HPR alone was a poor inducer of differentiation of NB4 cells. However, it markedly enhanced RA-induced differentiation and increased the level of retinoylation, the covalent binding of RA to proteins. These results suggest some retinoid analogs, including 4-HPR, may have clinical utility because of their ability to increase the biological half-life of RA.","['Taimi, M', 'Breitman, T R']","['Taimi M', 'Breitman TR']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Combinations', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1997/03/17 00:00,1997/03/17 00:01,['1997/03/17 00:00'],"['1997/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(97)96309-9 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1997.6309 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1997 Mar 17;232(2):432-6. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1997.6309.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Goodman et al. (1) recently described the successful cultivation of the HGE infectious agent in human promyelocytic HL-60 leukemic cells. It was reported in the same study that infectivity invariably led to host cell death, although the mechanism by which HGE infection triggers cellular self-destruction is as yet undetermined. In this communication, we show that in vitro passage of HGE pathogen-infected blood elicits a significantly dysfunctional G1-to-S transition. Moreover, we provide evidence that the cytopathic properties of the HGE pathogen are attributed to its ability to induce apoptosis in host HL-60 cells. Determination of specific protein expression changes by Western blot analysis showed that HGE infection resulted in reduced expression of PCNA and pRB, both of which play a role in cell cycling. Moreover, the steady state level of bcl-2, which protects eukaryotic cells against apoptosis, is suppressed by exposure to the HGE agent. These results suggest that this pathogen HGE induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells by a mechanism involving the shut-off of multiple cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory events.","['Hsieh, T C', 'Aguero-Rosenfeld, M E', 'Wu, J M', 'Ng, C', 'Papanikolaou, N A', 'Varde, S A', 'Schwartz, I', 'Pizzolo, J G', 'Melamed, M', 'Horowitz, H W', 'Nadelman, R B', 'Wormser, G P']","['Hsieh TC', 'Aguero-Rosenfeld ME', 'Wu JM', 'Ng C', 'Papanikolaou NA', 'Varde SA', 'Schwartz I', 'Pizzolo JG', 'Melamed M', 'Horowitz HW', 'Nadelman RB', 'Wormser GP']","['Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,['0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)'],IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Ehrlichia/growth & development/*isolation & purification', 'Ehrlichiosis/blood/microbiology/pathology', 'Granulocytes/microbiology/pathology', 'HL-60 Cells/*microbiology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/microbiology/pathology', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/biosynthesis']",1997/03/17 00:00,1997/03/17 00:01,['1997/03/17 00:00'],"['1997/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(97)96276-8 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1997.6276 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1997 Mar 17;232(2):298-303. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1997.6276.,,,,,"['R01-AR 41508/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U50/CCU 210280/PHS HHS/United States', 'U50/CCU 210286/PHS HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

No changes in cellular rheology were observed after binding of anti-dinitrophenol IgE to Fce receptors. Furthermore, cytoplasmic viscosity mu showed power-law dependence on mean shear rate gama m: mu = mu c(gamma m/gamma c)-b, where mu c is a characteristic viscosity at characteristic shear rate gamma c, and b is a material coefficient. All the cells exhibited similar dependence on shear rate (b approximately 0.5).

Under optimal conditions for in vitro cell transduction, primary cultures of adult rat fibroblasts derived from various organs were very poorly transduced by the ecotropic MuLV vector (0.02-0.12%) when compared to immortalized cells such as the F2408 (42%) and 3Y1 (defined as 100%) lines. Primary cultures of fibroblasts from neonatal (3.7%) or embryonic rat tissues (4.6%) and primary cultures of rat mammary epithelial cells (3-4%) were somewhat more susceptible. Immortalization of rodent fibroblasts with Polyomavirus Large T. SV40 Large T, and E6-E7 genes of human papilloma virus resulted in a modest or minimal increase in transduction efficiency, and introduction of the transforming genes v-Src, v-Ras, and v-Raf was in most instances associated with a decrease in MuLV vector entry. Variability of transduction efficiency was not related to differences in cellular growth rate and treatment of MuLV vectors in vitro with deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates and treatment of cells in culture with protease inhibitors failed to modify cellular entry of the MuLV vector. On the other hand, inhibition of cellular glycosylation with swansonine, 1-deoxymannojirimycin and, primarily, tunicamycin enhanced entry of the ecotropic vector by up to 220-fold, particularly into cells which were otherwise highly resistant. These findings demonstrate major differences in transduction efficiency of the ecotropic MuLV vector on rodent cells and indicate that cellular glycosylation plays a critical role in determining MuLV cellular tropism.","['Tavoloni, N', 'Rudenholz, A']","['Tavoloni N', 'Rudenholz A']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029, USA.

This virus was modified further by introducing the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR promoter in place of the upstream sequences controlling expression of the IE regulatory protein ICPO, to yield mutant in 1820. In almost all cell types tested, in 1820 initiated infection less efficiently than in 1814, behaving as if lacking both VP16 and ICPO functions, but in BHK cells in 1820 was less impaired than in 1814. A rescuant of in 1820 at the VP16 locus, in 1825, also exhibited a host range phenotype, initiating replication as efficiently as wild-type HSV-1 in BHK cells but inefficiently in other cell types. In 1825 was unable to complement an ICPO null mutant in restricted cells, demonstrating that the promoter exchange prevented the expression of ICPO protein in functionally significant amounts. The novel host range properties of in 1820 provided a basis for the construction of additional viruses conditionally impaired for IE gene expression and assessment of their value as prototype vectors. Production of an HSV-1 mutant multiply defective in the expression of IE gene products was achieved by introduction of the temperature-sensitive mutation of HSV-1 tsK, which inactivates the IE transcription activator ICP4 at nonpermissive temperatures, into in 1820 to produce in 1820K. This mutant could be propagated effectively in BHK cells at 31 degrees but was effectively devoid of the major regulators ICPO, ICP4, and VP16 in other cells types at 38.5 degrees. Cultures could withstand infection with 5 PFU of in 1820K per cell without detectable cytopathology and could be reseeded to form colonies at approximately 90% efficiency. A derivative of in 1820K containing the Escherichia coli lacZ gene controlled by the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) major IE promoter expressed low but detectable levels of beta-galactosidase in almost all cells after infection of cultures at 5 PFU per cell and incubation at 38.5 degrees. Cultures infected with 5 PFU per cell of an in 1820K derivative expressing neomycin phosphotransferase (npt) controlled by the HCMV IE promoter were resistant to killing by the antibiotic G418 for up to 3 days, and cell survival correlated with the retention of functional levels of npt. Mutants based on in 1820K can thus express foreign gene products in virtually all cells in a culture under conditions in which cytotoxicity is eliminated, demonstrating that progressive reduction of IE gene expression is an important step in the design of HSV-1-derived vectors.","['Preston, C M', 'Mabbs, R', 'Nicholl, M J']","['Preston CM', 'Mabbs R', 'Nicholl MJ']","['MRC Virology Unit, Institute of Virology, Glasgow, Scotland. c.preston@vir.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cricetinae', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*genetics', '*Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Vero Cells']",1997/03/03 00:00,1997/03/03 00:01,['1997/03/03 00:00'],"['1997/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(96)98424-X [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1996.8424 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1997 Mar 3;229(1):228-39. doi: 10.1006/viro.1996.8424.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test the functional role of the highly conserved BH1 domain present in the A179L protein, the Gly residue at position 85 was mutated to Ala, since it has been shown that substitution of the corresponding Gly in human Bcl-2 abrogates its death-repressor activity. It was found that the Gly-to-Ala mutation in the BH1 domain of the viral protein abolished its capacity to protect the K562 cells from apoptosis, indicating that this Gly is essential for A179L action.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: This review article describes mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetic, preclinical and recent clinical data on topotecan with and without concomitant radiation therapy. RESULTS: Following a 30 min. intravenous bolus, median plasma half-lives between 2 and 3 h. and a total-body clearance of 0.57 l/min/m2 were seen. After oral administration the bioavailability varied between 30 and 35%. Topotecan is able to pass the blood brain barrier. Encouraging clinical results are reported in gastrointestinal tumors, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, leukemia and pediatric tumors in addition to ovarian carcinoma. Recent studies indicate that topotecan functions as a radiosensitizer and may be applied together with radiation in future trials. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed a good modulation ofradiation effects of topotecan. CONCLUSIONS: In experimental and preclinical studies using topotecan both additive and sensitization effects to normal cells and tumor cells were seen by ionizing radiation. Clinical phase II/III trials may preferentially be indicated in non-small cell lung cancer and primary and metastatic brain tumors.","['Sauer, R', 'Heuser, A']","['Sauer R', 'Heuser A']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Strahlentherapie, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg.']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Their characteristic biological and clinical course starts from the localized form of plasmacytoma, progressing to the more diffuse benign gammopathy, then the premalignant conditions like indolent (IM) or smouldering (SM) myeloma, and ending at the multiple myeloma (MM) stage. During and before this multistep development, genetic and environmental factors appear to be involved and spontaneous regressions may even occur. However, when MM is diagnosed, the outcome is invariably fatal despite conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Prognostic factors like G-reactive protein, the plasma cell labeling index, and beta 2-microglobulin are extremely useful not only for determining the aggressivity of the abnormal clone but also for predicting the transformation from a benign state to a definitive malignant condition. Standard single-agent chemotherapy with melphalan and multidrug combinations can significantly prolong survival, but no cure has yet been achieved. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support can decrease tumor burden to an undetectable level and, compared with conventional approaches, has recently proved to increase response rates, the symptom-free interval, and survival. Moreover, interferon alfa is also able to prolong the responding interval, but this has yet to be translated into a survival advantage. These new more aggressive therapies are reminiscent of the early days of leukemia treatment and should now be offered to patients in controlled trials on the basis of comorbidities rather than age or some discriminating economic factors.","['Zulian, G B']",['Zulian GB'],"['Department of Medicine, Geneva University Hospital, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,IM,"['Combined Modality Therapy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/classification/*diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Paraproteinemias/diagnosis', 'Plasmacytoma/diagnosis', 'Prognosis']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1997 Jan;34(1 Suppl 1):29-39.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The activation of plasminogen is regulated by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), plasmin is controlled by alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor. The fibrinolytic system is not only involved in the intravascular dissolution of fibrin (thrombi), it also plays a vital role in normal physiologic reproduction, wound repair, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling. Fibrinolysis is also a vital component in the pathogenesis of neoplastic disease. It is essential in releasing cells from their primary site of origin, providing nutrition for neoplastic cell growth and promoting cell mobility and motility. In neoplastic cells the degradation of the extracellular matrix proteins is facilitated by excessive expression of u-PA, t-PA, and u-PAR. In many forms of carcinoma increased expression of u-PAR and u-PA is associated with significantly shorter survival. Greater expression of u-PA in breast cancer cells, for example, is associated with shorter survival and increased relapse rate. Progressively aggressive neoplastic cells evidence high expression of u-PA and u-PAR activities, variable expression of t-PA, and enhanced PAI-1 and PAI-2 activities. In acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, poor outcome correlates with high t-PA levels. In acute progranulocytic leukemia there is a high incidence of DIC. Neoplastic prostatic tissue also expresses high u-PA activity and the more aggressive the cell line, the greater the number of u-PAR and the higher the u-PA activity. In gynecologic malignancies, a greater expression of u-PA in combination with cathepsin D is associated with widespread disease and poor prognosis. High u-PA values were also seen in patients with brain, gastric, and hepatic malignancies. It is evident that the plasminogen-plasmin system is a vital component in the biology of neoplastic disease and that it is, in theses conditions, in no way beneficial to the host.","['Bell, W R']",['Bell WR'],"['Department of Medicine/Division Hematology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Thromb Hemost,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,0431155,"['0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', 'EC 3.4.21.68 (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Coagulation Factors/metabolism', 'Fibrinolysis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*blood/diagnosis', 'Thrombosis/blood/metabolism', 'Tissue Plasminogen Activator/blood/metabolism', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/blood/metabolism']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-999047 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Thromb Hemost. 1996;22(6):459-78. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-999047.,,402,,,['HL36260/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The spontaneous incidence of myeloid leukemia in C3H/He male mice is 1%, and the incidence increased to 23.3% when 3 Gy of whole-body x-ray irradiation was given. However, the incidence of myeloid leukemia was found to be significantly decreased by caloric restriction; it was reduced to 7.9% and 10.7% when restriction was started before (6 weeks old) and after (10 weeks old) irradiation, respectively. In addition, the onset of the myeloid leukemia in both restricted groups was prolonged to a greater extent as compared with the control diet group.

When introduced into interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent mouse pro-B lymphocytes, E2A-HLF prevents apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation, suggesting that IL-3 mediates cell survival through activation of a transcription factor whose activity can be constitutively replaced by the chimeric oncoprotein. We considered four bZIP transcription factors as candidates for this putative IL-3-regulated factor, each of which binds avidly to the DNA consensus sequence recognized by E2A-HLF and is related to the Caenorhabditis elegans CES-2 (cell death specification protein) neuron-specific mediator of cell death. The expression and binding activity of the Nfil3 protein (also called E4bp4), but not of Hlf, Dbp, or Tef, was found to be regulated by IL-3 in mouse pro-B cell lines (Baf-3 and FL5.12). Northern blot analysis showed that Nfil3/E4bp4 is regulated as a ""delayed-early"" IL-3-responsive gene, requiring de novo protein synthesis. In the absence of IL-3, enforced expression of the human NFIL3/E4BP4 cDNA promoted the survival but not the growth of IL-3-dependent pro-B cells. Our results implicate NFIL3/E4BP4 (nuclear factor regulated by IL-3/adenovirus E4 promoter binding protein) in a distinct growth factor-regulated signaling pathway that is responsible for the survival of early B-cell progenitors, and whose alteration by E2A-HLF leads to childhood B lineage leukemia.","['Ikushima, S', 'Inukai, T', 'Inaba, T', 'Nimer, S D', 'Cleveland, J L', 'Look, A T']","['Ikushima S', 'Inukai T', 'Inaba T', 'Nimer SD', 'Cleveland JL', 'Look AT']","[""Department of Experimental Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Adenovirus E4 Proteins)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (G-Box Binding Factors)', '0 (HLF protein, human)', '0 (Hlf protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (NFIL3 protein, human)', '0 (Nfil3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adenovirus E4 Proteins/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'G-Box Binding Factors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",1997/03/18 00:00,1997/03/18 00:01,['1997/03/18 00:00'],"['1997/03/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.94.6.2609 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Mar 18;94(6):2609-14. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.6.2609.,,,PMC20136,['GENBANK/U83148'],"['R01 DK044158/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 59571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA059571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We have identified a new partner gene, EEN, fused to MLL in a case of acute myeloid leukemia. The gene is located on chromosome 19p13, where two other MLL partner genes, ENL and ELL/MEN have also been identified. The deduced protein of 368 aa contains a central alpha-helical region and a C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain most similar to the C-terminal SH3 domain found in the Grb2/Sem-5/Drk family of genes. Sequence analysis of the fusion MLL/EEN transcript in our patient reveals that exon 6 of MLL is fused to the N-terminal end of EEN, a fusion that would create a chimeric protein that includes the major functional domain of EEN.

To test the hypothesis that the chimera PMLRAR alpha plays a role in leukemogenesis, we expressed a PMLRAR alpha cDNA in myeloid cells of transgenic mice. PMLRAR alpha transgenic mice exhibited impaired neutrophil maturation early in life, which progressed at a low frequency over the course of several months to overt APL. Both the preleukemic state and the leukemia could be transplanted to nontransgenic mice, and the transplanted preleukemia could progress to APL. The APL recapitulated features of the human disease, including a response to retinoic acid. Retinoic acid caused the leukemic cells to differentiate in vitro and in vivo, eliciting remissions of both the preleukemic state and APL in mice. Our results demonstrate that PMLRAR alpha impairs neutrophil differentiation and initiates the development of APL. The transgenic mice described here provide an apparently accurate model for human APL that includes clear evidence of tumor progression. The model should be useful for exploring the molecular pathogenesis of APL and the mechanisms of the therapeutic response to retinoic acid, as well as for preclinical studies of therapeutic regimens.","['Brown, D', 'Kogan, S', 'Lagasse, E', 'Weissman, I', 'Alcalay, M', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Atwater, S', 'Bishop, J M']","['Brown D', 'Kogan S', 'Lagasse E', 'Weissman I', 'Alcalay M', 'Pelicci PG', 'Atwater S', 'Bishop JM']","['G.W.

They share several characteristics and respond to immunosuppressives. Aetiology is felt to represent a manifestation of altered immunologic reactivity. Patients with both conditions concurrently have been described. Diagnosis is based on clinical and histopathological findings. However, clinically the typical forms of the two conditions are quite distinct: pyoderma showing cutaneous ulceration with a purple undermined border and Sweet's syndrome having tender, erythematous, nonulcerated plaques and nodules. Approximately 50% of cases of pyoderma are associated with a specific systemic disorder. These include inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and myeloproliferative disorders. Many associations with Sweet's syndrome have been described, including acute myeloid leukaemia, myeloma and adenocarcinomas, and haematological malignancy. There is overlap between the two conditions with lesions categorised as Sweet's syndrome being clinically more characteristic of atypical pyoderma and vice versa. We believe that pyoderma and Sweet's syndrome represent a continuum of spectrum of disease. The reason for the clinical differences between the conditions is unclear and merits further investigation but may be explained by varying levels of intensity and extent of the inflammatory process. This review will describe the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, associations and treatment of the two conditions.","['Lear, J T', 'Atherton, M T', 'Byrne, J P']","['Lear JT', 'Atherton MT', 'Byrne JP']","['Department of Dermatology, North Staffs NHS Trust, Stoke on Trent, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Postgrad Med J,Postgraduate medical journal,0234135,,IM,"['Aged', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Pyoderma Gangrenosum/complications/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', '*Sweet Syndrome/complications/diagnosis/etiology/therapy']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/pgmj.73.856.65 [doi]'],ppublish,Postgrad Med J. 1997 Feb;73(856):65-8. doi: 10.1136/pgmj.73.856.65.,,27,PMC2431222,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paraprotein crystallization is supported by hydrophobicity, poor solubility in the cold or at acid pH, and there are few reports on structural defects of crystal-forming myeloma proteins which are supposed to promote either their crystallization or impaired intralysosomal degradation. In the hitherto known cases of crystal histiocytosis, immunoglobulins of light chain type kappa have been exclusively involved in the process of macrophage storage. Accumulation of paraprotein-related crystals in macrophages may mimic the appearance of Gaucher cells or of the so-called pseudo-Gaucher cells seen in chronic myelogeneous leukaemia. With regard to their lightmicroscopical and ultrastructural differences to both, Gaucher cells and pseudo-Gaucher cells, paraproteinaemia-related crystal-storing macrophages may be denoted as pseudo-pseudo-Gaucher cells (PPGC). Human PPGC are similar to constitutive crystal-storing histiocytes known from inbred C57 BL-6 mice. The distribution of PPGC may be limited to the realm of a plasmacytoma or immunocytoma, but there are also cases with systemic involvement of the RES similar to Gaucher disease.","['Schaefer, H E']",['Schaefer HE'],"['Pathologisches Institut der Universitat, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comment', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,,IM,"['Animals', 'Crystallization', 'Gaucher Disease/pathology', 'Histiocytosis/*complications/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Paraproteinemias/*complications', 'Skin Diseases/complications/metabolism/pathology']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0344-0338(96)80037-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0344-0338(96)80037-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 1996 Nov;192(11):1152-62. doi: 10.1016/S0344-0338(96)80037-9.,,95,,,,['Pathol Res Pract. 1996 Nov;192(11):1148-51.

In the current experiments, beta-carotene and lutein were tested for the induction of differentiation with HL-60 cells, a bipotent promyelocytic leukemia cell line. Cultures were incubated with lutein (0.0-10.0 mumol/l), beta-carotene (0.0-10.0 mumol/l), and retinoic acid (0.0-1.0 mumol/l); retinoic acid incubations were positive controls for the differentiation of HL-60 cells into granulocytes. The carotenoid-incubated cultures developed significantly more (p < or = 0.05) differentiated cells than control cultures (vehicle alone). Morphology of the carotenoid-incubated cells indicated differentiation along the granulocytic pathway. The percentage of differentiated cells increased significantly throughout a seven-day incubation period to 25% (lutein), 35% (beta-carotene), and 75% (retinoic acid). A dose response was found for lutein (0.0-10.0 mumol/l), but not for beta-carotene. Throughout the incubation period, the percentage of differentiated cells in negative control cultures did not change, remaining at the initial background level (approximately 5%). These results provide evidence for carotenoid-induced differentiation of cells.

Phorbol esters, which initiate megakaryocyte differentiation in this cell line, caused a rapid increase in extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which remained elevated for 2 h and returned to near-basal levels by 24 h. In the absence of extracellular stimuli, ERK could be activated by expression of constitutively active mutants of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MKK), resulting in cell adhesion and spreading, increased cell size, inhibition of cell growth, and induction of the platelet-specific integrin alphaIIb beta3, all hallmarks of megakaryocytic differentiation. In contrast, expression of wild-type MKK had little effect. In addition, constitutively active MKK suppressed the expression of an erythroid marker, alpha-globin, indicating the ability to suppress cellular responses necessary for alternative cell lineages. The MKK inhibitor PD98059 blocked MKK/ERK activation and cellular responses to phorbol ester, demonstrating that activation of MKK is necessary and sufficient to induce a differentiation program along the megakaryocyte lineage. Thus, the MAP kinase cascade, which promotes cell growth and proliferation in many cell types, instead inhibits cell proliferation and initiates lineage-specific differentiation in K562 cells, establishing a model system to investigate the mechanisms by which this signal transduction pathway specifies cell fate and developmental processes.","['Whalen, A M', 'Galasinski, S C', 'Shapiro, P S', 'Nahreini, T S', 'Ahn, N G']","['Whalen AM', 'Galasinski SC', 'Shapiro PS', 'Nahreini TS', 'Ahn NG']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado, Boulder 80309, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Erythropoiesis/physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Globins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Mutation', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex/genetics', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.17.4.1947 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 Apr;17(4):1947-58. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.4.1947.,,,PMC232041,,"['GM18151-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM48521/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

NHL/86 protocol for B-non-Hodgin's Lymphoma (NHL) and B-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) in Argentina. Design. Prospective, single arm, non-randomized trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From August 1988 to December 1993, 87 consecutive patients with B-NHL/B-ALL were admitted and 82 were eligible. The therapy was stratified according to stage. All patients received a cytoreductive prephase with cyclophosphamide and prednisone. Those with stage I-II were treated with three 5-day blocks of combined intense chemotherapy including dexamethasone, cyclophosphamidie, ifosfamide, cytarabine, teniposide, doxorabicin, and 500 mg/m2 of methotrexate as a 24 hour continuous infusion. Stage III received 6 blocks and those with stage IV/B-ALL received 6 intensified blocks in which 2 g/m2 of 24 hour continuous infusion methotrexate and vincristine were added. Triple intrathecal therapy was given for CNS prevention. After the first two blocks the response was assessed and those with a partial response were offered optionallya second look surgery or local radiotherapy. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 38 (range 16-71) months, the event-free survival (pEFS) for the whole group was 0.69 (Stage I-II n = 16 pEFS = 0.94, stage III n = 50 pEFS = 0.66, Stage IV n = 7 pEFS = 0.43, B-ALL n = 9 pEFS = 0.66). Patients with stage III abdominal tumors who achieved a partial response by imaging studies after induction had a significantly higher risk of relapse than those with a complete response (p = 0.02). Relapse was the most frequent event Toxicity was mainly hematological. CONCLUSIONS: The application of this protocol was feasible in our setting and its results comparable to the German study. Patients with stage I-II had an excellent outcome. Those with stage III and B-ALL achieved an encouraging event-free survival, however those with abdominal tumors and partial response to induction chemotherapy fared less favourably. This strategy was less effective for patients with initial CNS disease.","['Chantada, G L', 'Felice, M S', 'Zubizarreta, P A', 'Diaz, L', 'Gallo, G', 'Sackmann-Muriel, F']","['Chantada GL', 'Felice MS', 'Zubizarreta PA', 'Diaz L', 'Gallo G', 'Sackmann-Muriel F']","['Hematology-Oncology Department, Hospital de Pediatria, SAMIC Prof Dr JP Garrahan, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Argentina', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/05/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199705)28:5<333::AID-MPO2>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199705)28:5<333::aid-mpo2>3.0.co;2-i [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1997 May;28(5):333-41. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199705)28:5<333::aid-mpo2>3.0.co;2-i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the MLL gene on 11q23 and 10 partner genes involved in these translocations have been cloned and characterized. We performed a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the resultant der(11) chimeric mRNAs of the 3 types of 11q23 translocations including t(4;11), t(9;11), or t(11;19), in 14 leukemia patients with MLL gene rearrangements. At diagnosis or relapse, chimeric mRNA could be detected in all of the 4 patients with t(4;11), 2 of 3 with t(9;11), 2 of 3 with t(11;19), and 1 of 4 with unsuccessful karyotype. In 5 patients, we could monitor minimal residual disease (MRD) serially through the clinical course. One patient, in whom chi-meric mRNA was detected during complete remission (CR) just after the induction chemotherapy, relapsed within 2 months and died, while 2 patients in which chimeric mRNA was not detected remained in CR from 10-23 months. These findings suggest that RT-PCR is a useful approach for detecting which partner gene is involved in the translocation and monitoring MRD in patients with MLL gene rearrangement. Nonetheless, the clinical relevance of MRD evaluation by RT-PCR monitoring remains controversial. Long-term and prospective investigation of a larger series of patients is needed to confirm the clinical significance of monitoring MRD by RT-PCR method.","['Ida, K', 'Taki, T', 'Bessho, F', 'Kobayashi, M', 'Taira, F', 'Hanada, R', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Okimoto, Y', 'Seto, M', 'Ueda, R', 'Hayashi, Y']","['Ida K', 'Taki T', 'Bessho F', 'Kobayashi M', 'Taira F', 'Hanada R', 'Yamamoto K', 'Okimoto Y', 'Seto M', 'Ueda R', 'Hayashi Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1997/05/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199705)28:5<325::AID-MPO1>3.0.CO;2-J [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199705)28:5<325::aid-mpo1>3.0.co;2-j [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1997 May;28(5):325-32. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199705)28:5<325::aid-mpo1>3.0.co;2-j.,['Med Pediatr Oncol. 1998 May;30(5):313-5.

In the absence of modulator, the 50% inhibitory concentration for epirubicin after 48-h incubation, determined using a microculture tetrazolium assay, was 0.8 microgram/ml in P388/R cells and 0.009 microgram/ml in P388/S cells. P388/R cells demonstrated a 90-fold reduction in sensitivity to epirubicin. Tacrolimus hydrate (1 and 10 microM) markedly enhanced epirubicin cytotoxicity by 4.2- and 26.7-fold for P388/R cells. A significant increase in LDH release from cells by tacrolimus hydrate was also observed in P388/R cells treated with epirubicin. Tacrolimus hydrate had a marked effect on epirubicin-induced G2/M blockade in the resistant cells. Both tacrolimus hydrate and cyclosporin A dramatically increased the accumulation of epirubicin by the resistant cells, while these compounds had no effect on epirubicin accumulation in the parent cells. Thus, tacrolimus hydrate is able to down-modulate P-glycoprotein-associated resistance through inhibition of P-glycoprotein function, suggesting that the drug may be a candidate for killing drug-resistant tumor cells.","['Wu, J', 'Furusawa, S', 'Nakano, S', 'Takahashi, M', 'Chiba, H', 'Takayanagi, M', 'Takayanagi, Y', 'Sasaki, K']","['Wu J', 'Furusawa S', 'Nakano S', 'Takahashi M', 'Chiba H', 'Takayanagi M', 'Takayanagi Y', 'Sasaki K']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Tohoku College of Pharmacy, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol,Methods and findings in experimental and clinical pharmacology,7909595,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epirubicin/*pharmacology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Tacrolimus/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/enzymology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol. 1996 Dec;18(10):651-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The smoking of cigarettes as an advantageous delivery system for nicotine, accelerates and aggravates cardiovascular disease, and is causally associated with increased risks for chronic obstructive lung disease, cancer of the lung and of the upper aerodigestive system, and cancer of the pancreas, renal pelvis, and urinary bladder. It is also associated with cancer of the liver, cancer of the uterine cervix, cancer of the nasal cavity, and myeloid leukemia. In 1950, the first large-scale epidemiological studies documented that cigarette smoking induces lung cancer and described a dose-response relationship between number of cigarettes smoked and the risk for developing lung cancer. In the following decades these observations were not only confirmed by several hundreds of prospective and case-control studies but the plausibility of this causal association was also supported by bioassays and by the identification of carcinogens in cigarette smoke. Whole smoke induces lung tumors in mice and tumors in the upper respiratory tract of hamsters. The particulate matter of the smoke elicits benign and malignant tumors on the skin of mice and rabbits, sarcoma in the connective tissue of rats, and carcinoma in the lungs of rats upon intratracheal instillation. More than 50 carcinogens have been identified, including the following classes of compounds: polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), aromatic amines, and N-nitrosamines. Among the latter, the tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (TSNA) have been shown to be of special significance. Since 1950, the makeup of cigarettes and the composition of cigarette smoke have gradually changed. In the United States, the sales-weighted average ""tar"" and nicotine yields have declined from a high of 38 mg ""tar"" and 2.7 mg nicotine in 1954 to 12 mg and 0.95 mg in 1992, respectively. In the United Kingdom, the decline was from about 32 mg ""tar"" and 2.2 mg nicotine to less than 12 mg ""tar"" and 1.0 mg nicotine per cigarette. During the same time, other smoke constituents changed correspondingly. These reductions of smoke yields were primarily achieved by the introduction of filter tips, with and without perforation, selection of tobacco types and varieties, utilization of highly porous cigarette paper, and incorporation into the tobacco blend of reconstituted tobacco, opened and cut ribs, and ""expanded tobacco."" In most countries where tobacco blends with air-cured (burley) tobacco are used, the nitrate content of the cigarette tobacco increased. In the United States nitrate levels in cigarette tobacco rose from 0.3-0.5% to 0.6-1.35%, thereby enhancing the combustion of the tobacco. More complete combustion decreases the carcinogenic PAH, yet the increased generation of nitrogen oxides enhances the formation of the carcinogenic N-nitrosamines, especially the TSNA in the smoke. However, all analytical measures of the smoke components have been established on the basis of standardized machine smoking conditions, such as those introduced by the Federal Trade Commission, that call for 1 puff to be taken once a minute over a 2-s period with a volume of 35 ml. These smoking parameters may have simulated the way in which people used to smoke the high-yield cigarettes; however, they no longer reflect the parameters applicable to contemporary smokers, and especially not those applicable to the smoking of low- and ultra-low-yield filter cigarettes. Recent smoking assays have demonstrated that most smokers of cigarettes with low nicotine yield take between 2 and 4 puffs per minute with volumes up to 55 ml to satisfy their demands for nicotine. The overview also discusses further needs for reducing the toxicity and carcinogenicity of cigarette smoke. From a public health perspective, nicotine in the smoke needs to be lowered to a level at which there is no induction of dependence on tobacco.","['Hoffmann, D', 'Hoffmann, I']","['Hoffmann D', 'Hoffmann I']","['American Health Foundation, Valhalla, New York 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Toxicol Environ Health,Journal of toxicology and environmental health,7513622,"['0 (Benzopyrenes)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Nitrates)', '0 (Nitrosamines)', '0 (Pesticide Residues)', '0 (Tars)', '0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)', '0 (tobacco tar)', '16291-96-6 (Charcoal)', '3J2P07GVB6 (acetylcellulose)', '6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine)', '7U1EE4V452 (Carbon Monoxide)', '9004-34-6 (Cellulose)']",IM,"['Benzopyrenes/analysis', 'Carbon Monoxide/analysis', 'Carcinogens/*analysis', 'Cellulose/analogs & derivatives', 'Charcoal', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Nicotine/analysis', 'Nitrates/chemistry', 'Nitrosamines/chemistry', 'Paper', 'Pesticide Residues/analysis', '*Plants, Toxic', 'Smoking/adverse effects/epidemiology/*trends', 'Tars/analysis', 'Tobacco/*chemistry/classification', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*analysis', 'United Kingdom', 'United States']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/009841097160393 [doi]'],ppublish,J Toxicol Environ Health. 1997 Mar;50(4):307-64. doi: 10.1080/009841097160393.,,176,,,"['CA-17613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29850/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-70972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

BLV-free laboratory strains of R. appendiculatus and A. hebraeum nymphal ticks (n = 400) were fed on a BLV-infected and a negative control bovine. At various intervals after engorgement the ticks were homogenised and injected subcutaneously into BLV-negative sheep. Adult R. appendiculatus and A. hebraeum, which had fed as nymphs on the BLV-infected bovine, were then allowed to feed on BLV-negative sheep. A control sheep was also injected intravenously with blood from the infected bovine. Only the control sheep that received blood from the BLV-positive bovine seroconverted 9 months later.

The change in shape or biological functions of cells may affect the surface properties and can be detected by electrokinetic measurements. Biological cell surfaces are covered with polysaccharide chains, some are charged and some are not. Some polysaccharides produce a hydrogel matrixes under a proper condition. We thus consider it reasonable that cell surface is approximated by a hydrogel surface. Electrophoretic mobility measurements are useful for studying the surface properties of biological cells suspended as colloidal particles in an electrolyte solution. The electro-osmotic velocity measurements on the other hand are advantageous to the study of the surface properties of slab-shaped biological systems such as membranes. This work was started with a hydrogel, as a model material. As a hydrogel, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) poly(NIPAAm), abbreviated as hereafter, was chosen, because this hydrogel changes its volume depending on temperature. The dependence of the electrophoretic mobility of latex particles covered with poly(NIPAAm) hydrogel layer or of the electro-osmotic mobility on poly(NIPAAm) plate upon temperature and ionic strength of the dispersing medium was well explained with an electrophoretic mobility formula for ""soft particles"" developed by Ohshima. The electrokinetic measurements and the explanation of data with an electrophoretic mobility formula for ""soft particles"" give us information about the surface charge density and the ""softness"" of soft surfaces. On the basis of the findings with hydrogels, we have discussed the relationship between the changes in shape or function of the biological cells and the change in physicochemical surface properties using these measurements. To study the change in physicochemical properties of the cell surface caused by apoptosis, we have measured the electrophoretic mobilities of intact and apoptotic human promyelocytic leukemia cell lines, HL-60RG cells. We have also studied the differences observed in surface properties of malignant lymphosarcoma cell line, RAW117-P, and its variant, RAW117-H10, with a high metastatic property to the liver. In both cases, the cell surfaces became softer by the changes of biological functions. We have applied electrophoresis and electro-osmosis measurements to the study of the electrokinetic surface properties of rat basophilic leukemia cells, RBL cells.

This may explain why neuromuscular complications of chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), a frequent disorder, have been rarely reported. We describe 7 patients with CLL and neuromuscular involvement in whom phenotypic and genotypic characterization of infiltrating lymphoid cells was carried out by immunocytochemistry and PCR-amplification of immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. One patient had massive neoplastic infiltration of muscle, and six presented with inflammatory-like NMDs (dermatomyositis: 2, polymyositis: 1, vasculitic mononeuropathy: 2; inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy: 1). Immunocytochemistry on nerve and muscle frozen sections showed a monotypic lymphoid cell population in 3 cases and failed in 4 cases. The PCR analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (FR3-FR4) rearrangement detected clonal B-cells in all biopsy specimens. There are arguments suggesting that incidental or paraneoplastic inflammatory NMDs may progress to neoplastic infiltration in CLL patients, as a result of the traffic of tumor B-cells from circulation to nerve and muscle tissues.

THP, URO, and its fragments stimulated human mononuclear cells to proliferate and secrete TNF-alpha. The release of URO and THP-induced TNF-alpha in monocytes was dependent upon protein tyrosine kinase activation that results in tyrosine phosphorylation. URO and THP also induced TF expression of human monocytes and monocytic cell line U937 in a dose-dependent manner. TF expression was transient, reached its peak at 6 h and declined toward basal levels by 24 h. Reverse transcriptase-PCR and dot-blot analysis confirmed the induction of TF mRNA synthesis. URO and THP-induced TF expression were inhibited by actinomycin D and pentoxifylline further supporting the requirement of de novo TF mRNA synthesis. The possibility of LPS contamination of URO and THP was excluded because: 1) URO and THP-induced TF expression were inhibited by specific Ab; 2) URO was less capable of inducing TF in HUVEC as compared with LPS; 3) polymyxin B blocked the induction of Limulus clotting by LPS but not by URO and THP; 4) both LPS-sensitive (C3H/HeN) and -resistant (C3H/HeJ) mice produced little or no TNF-alpha after URO challenge. Therefore, our findings suggest that URO and THP play a significant role in the innate immunity of the urinary system and that the immunostimulatory activity of URO is potentially useful for immunotherapy.","['Su, S J', 'Chang, K L', 'Lin, T M', 'Huang, Y H', 'Yeh, T M']","['Su SJ', 'Chang KL', 'Lin TM', 'Huang YH', 'Yeh TM']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, National Cheng Kung University, College of Medicine, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Mucoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (UMOD protein, human)', '0 (Umod protein, mouse)', '0 (Uromodulin)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Limulus Test', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mucoproteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Thromboplastin/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Uromodulin']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Apr 1;158(7):3449-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sFv fragments were derived from the murine hybridomas 3A1e and 3A1f and were expressed as soluble proteins in Escherichia coli. Surface plasmon resonance analyses demonstrated that the purified 3A1e and 3A1f sFv fragments specifically bound CD7 with high affinity, 8.1 and 1.8 nM, respectively. The difference in affinity is chiefly due to a slower dissociation rate for the 3A1f sFv fragment. Despite this difference, both monovalent sFv fragments were comparably internalized by CD7+ human T leukemic cells within 30 min. These data support findings of previous studies suggesting that CD7 internalization does not require cross-linking. The sFv immunotoxins were assembled by linking ricin toxin A chain to the C termini of the sFv fragments via disulfide bonds.

We here report that MAFA is encoded by a single-copy gene that spans 13 kb in the rat genome and is composed of five exons. Three separate exons encode the carbohydrate recognition domain of the MAFA, defining its close homology to the genes of CD23, CD69, CD72, NKR-P1, and Ly49. Functional analysis of the 5' flanking region of the gene reveals that a cell type-specific promoter is located within the first 664 bp upstream of the transcription origin. The promoter lacks any obvious TATA box and drives gene transcription originating from multiple start sites. Examination for possible polymorphism of the MAFA transcripts revealed two novel transcripts, generated by alternative splicing. Deletion of the transmembranal exon in one of them does not result in a frameshift and would, upon translation, give rise to a soluble MAFA molecule. Splicing of two exons in a second transcript results in a new reading frame encoding a putative protein containing MAFA's cytoplasmic domain. The transcription of the MAFA gene was detected in normal rat lungs, where both transmembranal and soluble MAFA appear to be expressed.

Dichlorofluorescin oxidation assay indicated that the apoptosis in MT-1 and MT-2 cells was preceded by an increase in the level of intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The addition of catalase and recombinant ADF/hTRX (rADF) partially blocked the apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. rADF has been also shown to enhance the internalization of L-cystine into MT-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas oxidized rADF or mutated rADF that has no insulin-reducing activity failed to do so. Furthermore, culture in the L-cystine- and GSH-free medium lowered the cellular GSH content of PHA blasts, which was restored dose-dependently by rADF. These data suggest that the inability to neutralize oxidative stress results in the apoptosis of lymphoid cells under L-cystine- and GSH-depleted conditions. The protective effects of rADF may be explained by direct scavenging action on H2O2 (catalase-like activity) or by indirect neutralizing effects on the pro-oxidant status through enhancing the L-cystine internalization and elevating the intracellular GSH content.","['Iwata, S', 'Hori, T', 'Sato, N', 'Hirota, K', 'Sasada, T', 'Mitsui, A', 'Hirakawa, T', 'Yodoi, J']","['Iwata S', 'Hori T', 'Sato N', 'Hirota K', 'Sasada T', 'Mitsui A', 'Hirakawa T', 'Yodoi J']","['Department of Biological Responses, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '48TCX9A1VT (Cystine)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Cystine/deficiency/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/deficiency/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Oxidants/*pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Thioredoxins/*pharmacology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Apr 1;158(7):3108-17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we show that the mitogenic combination of IL-4 and anti-mu Ab triggered induction of cyclin D3 and up-regulated cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 6 expression, whereas such regulation was not observed in B cells activated by IL-4 or anti-mu Ab alone. Furthermore, cyclin D3 immunoprecipitated fron as associated with cdk6, and the cyclin D3/cdk6 complex was able to phosphorylate recombinant retinoblastoma protein in vitro. In addition, B cells activated with either IL-4 or 1L-13 alone expressed a higher amount of p27kip1 (p27) cdk inhibitor than nonstimulated cells. In contrast, p27 expression was decreased when cells were activated with mitogenic combinations of IL-4 and anti-mu Ab or anti-CD40 mAb. We also observed that the IL-4-mediated inhibition of the proliferation of anti-mu/IL-2- or anti-mu/phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate-activated human leukemic B cells was associated with the maintenance of large amounts of p27 in these cells. These data suggest that IL-4 controls B cell proliferation by action during at least two steps of the regulation of the cell cycle, cyclin D3/cdk6 complex regulation and p27 inhibitor expression.","['Blanchard, D A', 'Affredou, M T', 'Vazquez, A']","['Blanchard DA', 'Affredou MT', 'Vazquez A']","['INSERM Unit 131-IPSC, Clamart, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (anti-IgM)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Cyclins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Interleukin-13/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/immunology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Apr 1;158(7):3054-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of bovine apo-lactoferrin (apo-LF-B, 1 mg/mouse) and Lfcin-B (0.5 mg/mouse) 1 day after tumor inoculation significantly inhibited liver and lung metastasis of L5178Y-ML25 cells. However, human apolactoferrin (apo-LF-H) and bovine holo-lactoferrin (holo-LF-B) at the dose of 1 mg/mouse failed to inhibit tumor metastasis of L5178Y-ML25 cells. Similarly, the s.c. administration of apo-LF-B as well as Lfcin-B, but not apo-LF-H and holo-LF-B, 1 day after tumor inoculation resulted in significant inhibition of lung metastasis of B16-BL6 cells in an experimental metastasis model. Furthermore, in in vivo analysis for tumor-induced angiogenesis, both apo-LF-B and Lfcin-B inhibited the number of tumor-induced blood vessels and suppressed tumor growth on day 8 after tumor inoculation. However, in a long-term analysis of tumor growth for up to 21 days after tumor inoculation, single administration of apo-LF-B significantly suppressed the growth of B16-BL6 cells throughout the examination period, whereas Lfcin-B showed inhibitory activity only during the early period (8 days). In spontaneous metastasis of B16-BL6 melanoma cells, multiple administration of both apo-LF-B and Lfcin-B into tumor-bearing mice significantly inhibited lung metastasis produced by B16-BL6 cells, though only apo-LF-B exhibited an inhibitory effect on tumor growth at the time of primary tumor amputation (on day 21) after tumor inoculation. These results suggest that apo-LF-B and Lfcin-B inhibit tumor metastasis through different mechanisms, and that the inhibitory activity of LF-B on tumor metastasis may be related to iron (Fe3+)-saturation.","['Yoo, Y C', 'Watanabe, S', 'Watanabe, R', 'Hata, K', 'Shimazaki, K', 'Azuma, I']","['Yoo YC', 'Watanabe S', 'Watanabe R', 'Hata K', 'Shimazaki K', 'Azuma I']","['Institute of Immunological Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Sapporo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '146897-68-9 (lactoferricin B)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lactoferrin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L5178/*prevention & control', 'Liver Neoplasms/*prevention & control/secondary', 'Lung Neoplasms/*prevention & control/secondary', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*prevention & control/secondary', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/prevention & control', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0910505097877976 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1997.tb00364.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1997 Feb;88(2):184-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1997.tb00364.x.,,,PMC5921353,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Double immunofluorescence labeling was used to characterize the nature of E. chaffeensis inclusion in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. E. chaffeensis was labeled with dog anti-E. chaffeensis serum and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-dog immunoglobulin G (IgG). Lissamine rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was used to label various mouse monoclonal antibodies. Ehrlichial inclusions did not fuse with lysosomes, since they were not labeled with anti-CD63 or anti-LAMP-1. The ehrlichial inclusions were slightly acidic, since they weakly accumulated 3-(2,4-dinitroanilino)-3'-amino-N-methyldipropylamine and stained weakly positive for vacuolar type H+ ATPase. Some ehrlichial inclusions were labeled positive with antibodies against HLA-DR, HLA-ABC, and beta2 microglobulin, while other inclusions in the same cell were labeled negative. The inclusions were labeled strongly positive for transferrin receptors (TfRs) and negative for the clathrin heavy chain. Time course labeling for TfRs showed that up to 3 h postinfection, most of the ehrlichial inclusions were negative for TfRs. After 6 h postinfection, 100% of the ehrlichial inclusions became TfR positive and the intensity of labeling was increased during the subsequent 3 days. Reverse transcription-PCR showed a gradual increase in the level of TfR mRNA postinfection, which reached a peak at 24 h postinfection. These results suggest that ehrlichial inclusions are early endosomes which selectively accumulate TfRs and that the ehrlichiae up-regulate TfR mRNA expression.","['Barnewall, R E', 'Rikihisa, Y', 'Lee, E H']","['Barnewall RE', 'Rikihisa Y', 'Lee EH']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210-1092, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Adhesion', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Dogs', 'Ehrlichia chaffeensis/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Endosomes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/iai.65.4.1455-1461.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Immun. 1997 Apr;65(4):1455-61. doi: 10.1128/iai.65.4.1455-1461.1997.,,,PMC175153,,"['AI30010/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HD-2-3144/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Between 1982 and 1989, 53 patients with SBP were randomly assigned to be treated with either local radiotherapy with doses ranged from 4000 to 5000 cGy to achieve local control of disease (28 patients) or the same radiotherapy schedule followed by melphalan and prednisone given every 6 weeks for 3 years (25 patients).

Treatment was well tolerated; planned doses were administered in all cases; no delays in treatment or acute side-effects were observed during treatment. Long-term secondary toxicities including secondary neoplasms and acute leukaemia, have not been observed.

A validation study for the PG4 S+L- assay demonstrated very good linearity (r2 of 0.95 to 0.99), reproducibility within a study (+/-0.35 log10 units), and precision between tests (+/-0.45 log10 units). Interference (or selectivity) in the presence of a non-specific antibody was insignificant (less than 0.2 log10 units). Sensitivity levels established from measurements as virus titres approach zero demonstrated a threshold value of 2-3 focus forming units (FFU)/ml. Two methods for increasing assay sensitivity were used including: (i) increased product samplings combined with a Poisson distribution analysis, and (ii) a 14-day co-cultivation with Mus dunni cells. Each of these methods was shown to increase sensitivity by at least one log10 unit. Murine retroviruses may also be detected by a less sensitive immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using specific monoclonal antibodies; this assay is essential for detecting certain recombinant ecotropic MuLVs.

These cell lines usually have A- or C-type retrovirus-like particles which are visible by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) even when infectivity (IF) or reverse transcriptase activity (RTA) cannot be demonstrated. The supernatant of the post-production cell cultures, therefore, also needs to be evaluated by TEM for viral burden. A major question, however, is how to establish a quantitative viral load estimate for the evaluation of a purification process. The FDA recommends that a purification process for viral contaminants remove or inactivate 3-5 logs over the estimated viral burden. Viral particles are difficult to identify and quantify, however, by conventional negative staining. We present a comparison of infectivity assay, reverse transcriptase assay, negative staining, and thin sectioned TEM. These assays were performed on four samples. Ultracentrifuged sediments of cleared cell-culture media were measured, fixed and processed. Thin sections were evaluated by TEM and the number of viral particles estimated by morphometric derived quantification. Retrovirus particles were easily identified and quantified when examined by TEM as compared to negative staining and correlated with the other viral assays (IF, RTA). These results demonstrate that the TEM thin section method was a superior technique to negative staining for estimating viral particle load in cell-culture supernatant. To validate further the plastic embedding with thin sectioning, we evaluated cell culture supernatants (pellets) for retroviral burden at various dilutions, from two cell lines. Morphometric determinations were made of the number of viral particles present per unit volume and compared to results obtained by infectivity assay. Since the morphometric calculation for viral density assumes even distribution of viral particles, we also evaluated and calculated viral counts on multiple thin sections taken throughout selected pellets.","['Bierley, S T', 'Raineri, R', 'Poiley, J A', 'Morgan, E M']","['Bierley ST', 'Raineri R', 'Poiley JA', 'Morgan EM']","['IEM Section, Pathology Associates International, Durham NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Dev Biol Stand,Developments in biological standardization,0427140,"['0 (Biological Products)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Products/*standards', 'Cells, Cultured/virology', 'Drug Contamination/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Rauscher Virus/isolation & purification']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Dev Biol Stand. 1996;88:163-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study derives new risk estimates using data from follow-up through 1987 (whereas the earlier assessment only had follow-up available through 1978) and uses new exposure information for this cohort developed by Paustenbach et al. that accounts for a number of factors that were unknown or not fully evaluated in earlier exposure assessments. There was a significant excess of acute myelocytic or acute monocytic leukemia (AMML) (8-10 observed, 1.61 expected) in this cohort, and this end point also exhibited a strong dose-response trend. No other types of lymphatic or hematopoietic cancer were clearly linked to benzene exposure. Quantitative risk estimates were robust with respect to whether AMML or all leukemia was being modeled. They were also robust with respect whether the Paustenbach et al. or Crump and Allen exposure estimates were used (differences in risk estimates of no greater than 2-fold) as long as linear dose-response models were applied. However, whereas the Crump and Allen exposures predicted a linear dose response, the Paustenbach et al. exposures predicted a quadratic dose response.

The hematotoxic effects of benzene in humans are well documented and include aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, and acute myelogenous leukemia. However, the risks of leukemia at low exposure concentrations have not been established. A combination of metabolites (hydroquinone and phenol, for example) may be necessary to duplicate the hematotoxic effect of benzene, perhaps due in part to the synergistic effect of phenol on myeloperoxidase-mediated oxidation of hydroquinone to the reactive metabolite benzoquinone. Because benzene and its hydroxylated metabolites (phenol, hydroquinone, and catechol) are substrates for the same cytochrome P450 enzymes, competitive interactions among the metabolites are possible. In vivo data on metabolite formation by mice exposed to various benzene concentrations are consistent with competitive inhibition of phenol oxidation by benzene. In vitro studies of the metabolic oxidation of benzene, phenol, and hydroquinone are consistent with the mechanism of competitive interaction among the metabolites. The dosimetry of benzene and its metabolites in the target tissue, bone marrow, depends on the balance of activation processes such as enzymatic oxidation and deactivation processes such as conjugation and excretion. Phenol, the primary benzene metabolite, can undergo both oxidation and conjugation. Thus the potential exists for competition among various enzymes for phenol. Zonal localization of phase I and phase II enzymes in various regions of the liver acinus also impacts this competition. Biologically based dosimetry models that incorporate the important determinants of benzene flux, including interactions with other chemicals, will enable prediction of target tissue doses of benzene and metabolites at low exposure concentrations relevant for humans.","['Medinsky, M A', 'Kenyon, E M', 'Seaton, M J', 'Schlosser, P M']","['Medinsky MA', 'Kenyon EM', 'Seaton MJ', 'Schlosser PM']","['Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709-1237, USA. medinsky@ciit.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Phenols)', 'EC 1.14.13.- (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Models, Biological', 'Phenols/metabolism/toxicity']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.961041399 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1996 Dec;104 Suppl 6:1399-404. doi: 10.1289/ehp.961041399.,,39,PMC1469768,,['ES05630/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Although a large number of studies of petroleum workers have been conducted to examine leukemia and other cancer risks, few existing studies have investigated cell-type-specific leukemias. One of the major reasons for the lack of cell-type-specific analysis was the small number of deaths by cell type in individual studies. In the present investigation, all cohort studies of petroleum workers in the United States and the United Kingdom were combined into a single database for cell-type-specific leukemia analysis. The majority of these workers were petroleum refinery employees, but production, pipeline, and distribution workers in the petroleum industry were also included. The combined cohort consisted of more than 208,000 petroleum workers, who contributed more than 4.6 million person-years of observation. Based on a meta-analysis of the combined data, cell-type-specific leukemia risks were expressed in terms of standardized mortality ratios (meta-SMRs). The meta-SMR for acute myeloid leukemia was 0.96. The lack of an increase of acute myeloid leukemia was attributed to the low levels of benzene exposure in the petroleum industry, particularly in comparison to benzene exposure levels in some previous studies of workers in other industries, who had been found to experience an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia. Similarly, no increase in chronic myeloid, acute lymphocytic, or chronic lymphocytic leukemias was found in petroleum workers (meta-SMRs of 0.89, 1.16, and 0.84, respectively). Stratified meta-analyses restricted to refinery studies or to studies with at least 15 years of follow-up yielded similar results. The findings of the present investigation are consistent with those from several recent case-control studies of cell-type-specific leukemia. Patterns and levels of benzene exposure in the petroleum industry are reviewed.

Information on the distribution sites, more than 90% of which were closed at the time of data collection, was obtained from site visits and archive material. Industrial hygiene measurements measured under known conditions were assembled for different tasks. These were adjusted for conditions where measured data were not available using variables known to influence exposure, such as temperature, technology, percentage of benzene in fuel handled, products handled, number of loads, and job activity. A quantitative estimate of dermal contact and peak exposure was also made.","['Rushton, L']",['Rushton L'],"[""Department of Public Health Medicine and Epidemiology, University Hospital, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, UK. lesley.rushton@nottingham.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Petroleum)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/*toxicity', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Petroleum/*toxicity', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.961041371 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1996 Dec;104 Suppl 6:1371-4. doi: 10.1289/ehp.961041371.,,,PMC1469726,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using medical records, laboratory hematology results, and histopathology, U.S. and Chinese expert hematopathologists, blinded to exposure status, carried out a detailed review using standardized evaluation forms. Key among the findings were a notable diversity of malignant and nonneoplastic hematopoietic and lymphoproliferative disorders, documentation of excess myelodysplastic syndromes among benzene workers, and widespread dyspoiesis involving all hematopoietic cell lines. As sophisticated clinicopathologic characterization and corresponding classification schemes for HLD become increasingly widespread, it is recommended that future epidemiologic investigations of benzene workers incorporate similarly detailed morphologic evaluation. In extending follow-up of this cohort of young workers, we will continue to use all available clinical, laboratory hematology, and pathology data as well as cytogenetic and biochemical markers to characterized various HLD outcomes. These careful surveillance mechanisms should also provide additional insight into carcinogenic mechanisms of benzene and allow comparison of the molecular pathogenesis of HLD induced by benzene versus chemotherapy, radiation, or other exposure.","['Linet, M S', 'Yin, S N', 'Travis, L B', 'Li, C Y', 'Zhang, Z N', 'Li, D G', 'Rothman, N', 'Li, G L', 'Chow, W H', 'Donaldson, J', 'Dosemeci, M', 'Wacholder, S', 'Blot, W J', 'Hayes, R B']","['Linet MS', 'Yin SN', 'Travis LB', 'Li CY', 'Zhang ZN', 'Li DG', 'Rothman N', 'Li GL', 'Chow WH', 'Donaldson J', 'Dosemeci M', 'Wacholder S', 'Blot WJ', 'Hayes RB']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7368, USA. linetm@epndce.nci.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology', '*Occupational Exposure']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.961041353 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1996 Dec;104 Suppl 6:1353-64. doi: 10.1289/ehp.961041353.,,116,PMC1469722,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both BZ and therapy-related secondary AML are characterized by chromosomal translocations that may occur by inappropriate recombinational events. DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) is an essential sulfhydryl (SH)-dependent endonuclease required for replication, recombination, chromosome segregation, and chromosome structure. Topo II cleaves DNA at purine(R)/pyrimidine(Y) repeat sequences that have been shown to be highly recombinogenic in vivo. Certain antineoplastic drugs stabilize topo II-DNA cleavage complexes at RY repeat sequences, which leads to translocations of the type observed in leukemia. Hydroquinone (HQ) is metabolized to p-benzoquinone (BQ) in a peroxidase-mediated reaction in myeloid progenitor cells. BQ interacts wit SH groups of SH-dependent enzymes. Consequently, the aims of this research were to determine whether HQ and BQ are topo II inhibitors. The ability of the compounds to inhibit the activity of topo III was tested using an assay system that depends on the conversion, by homogeneous human topo II, of catenated kinetoplast DNA into open and/or nicked open circular DNA that can be separated from the catenated DNA by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose-ethidium bromide gel. We provide preliminary data that indicate that both HQ and BQ cause a time and concentration (microM)-dependent inhibition of topo II activity. These compounds, which potentially can form adducts with DNA, have no effect on the migration of the supercoiled and open circular forms in the electrophoretic gradient, and BQ-adducted KDNA can be decatenated by topo II. Using a pRYG plasmid DNA with a single RY repeat as a cleavage site, it was determined that BQ does not stimulate the production of linear DNA indicative of an inhibition of topo II religation of strand breaks by stabilization of the covalent topo III-DNA cleavage complex. Rather, BQ most probably inhibits the SH-dependent topo II by binding to an essential SH group. The inhibition of topo II by BQ has implications for the formation of deleterious translocations that may be involved in BZ-induced initiation of leukemogenesis.","['Hutt, A M', 'Kalf, G F']","['Hutt AM', 'Kalf GF']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (DNA, Kinetoplast)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Benzoquinones/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/metabolism/toxicity', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Kinetoplast/drug effects/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.961041265 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1996 Dec;104 Suppl 6:1265-9. doi: 10.1289/ehp.961041265.,,,PMC1469763,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The studies presented here were undertaken to determine whether benzene, or its reactive metabolite, hydroquinone (HQ), affects differentiation of myeloblasts. Benzene or HQ administered to C57BL/6J mice specifically induced granulocytic differentiation of myeloblasts. The ability of these compounds to induce differentiation of the myeloblasts was tested directly using the murine interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent 32D.3 (G) myeloblastic cell line, and the human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line. We have previously shown that benzene treatment of HL-60 myeloblasts activates protein kinase C (PKC) and upregulates the 5-lipoxygenase (LPO) pathway for the production of leukotriene D4 (LTD4), an essential effector or granulocytic differentiation. Differentiation was prevented by sphinganine, a PKC inhibitor, and, as shown here, by LPO inhibitors and LTD4 receptor antagonists. Benzene or HQ also induces differentiation in 32D.3 (G) myeloblasts. Both compounds interact with cellular signaling pathways normally activated by granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and can replace the requirement for G-CSF. While IL-3 induces a growth response in 32D.3 (G) cells, G-CSF has been shown to provide both growth and differentiated signals. Both HQ and LTD4 induce differentiation and synergize with IL-3 for growth; however, neither supports growth in the absence of IL-3. Benzene, like HQ, also provides a differentiation signal for 32D cells; however, it has no effect on their growth. Unlike G-CSF, benzene, or LTD4, each of which stimulates terminal differentiation; HQ blocks differentiation at the myelocyte stage, allowing only a small percentage of progenitors to proceed to mature segmented granulocytes. Benzene- and G-CSF-induced differentiation were prevented by the additional of either LPO inhibitors or LTD4 receptor antagonists, indicating that benzene, like G-CSF, upregulates LTD4 production. Hydroquinone-induced differentiation was not affected by the LPO inhibitors, but only by the specific receptor antagonists. Thus HQ appears to obviate the requirement for LTD4 by activating the LTD4 receptor directly.","['Hazel, B A', ""O'Connor, A"", 'Niculescu, R', 'Kalf, G F']","['Hazel BA', ""O'Connor A"", 'Niculescu R', 'Kalf GF']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Leukotriene Antagonists)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene)', '73836-78-9 (Leukotriene D4)', 'AJT72OTM42 (cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'LRF7RW46ID (leukotriene D4 receptor)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/metabolism', 'Benzene/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Leukotriene Antagonists', 'Leukotriene D4/pharmacology', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Male', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', '*Receptors, Leukotriene']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.961041257 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1996 Dec;104 Suppl 6:1257-64. doi: 10.1289/ehp.961041257.,,,PMC1469738,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Characterization of these clonal chromosomal aberrations, together with observed alterations in other growth-promoting genes, provides a useful framework for studying chemical leukemogenesis and for use in understanding the origins and development of leukemia in general.","['Irons, R D', 'Stillman, W S']","['Irons RD', 'Stillman WS']","['School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262, USA. richard.irons@uchsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/toxicity', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics', 'Cocarcinogenesis', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', '*Models, Biological', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology', 'Preleukemia/etiology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.961041239 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1996 Dec;104 Suppl 6:1239-46. doi: 10.1289/ehp.961041239.,,122,PMC1469736,,"['ES06258/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA46934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Key components of the hypothesis include a) activation of benzene in the liver to phenolic metabolites; b) transport of these metabolites to the bone marrow and conversion to semiquinone radicals and quinones via peroxidase enzymes; c) generation of active oxygen species via redox cycling; d) damage to tubulin, histone proteins, topoisomerase II, other DNA associated proteins, and DNA itself; and e) consequent damage including DNA strand breakage, mitotic recombination, chromosome translocations, and aneuploidy. If these effects take place in stem or early progenitor cells a leukemic clone with selective advantage to grow may arise, as a result of protooncogene activation, gene fusion, and suppressor gene inactivation. Epigenetic effects of benzene metabolites on the bone marrow stroma, and perhaps the stem cell itself, may then foster development and survival of the leukemic clone. Evidence for this hypothesis is mounting with the recent demonstration that benzene induces gene-duplicating mutations in human bone marrow and chromosome-specific aneuploidy and translocations in peripheral blood cells. If this hypothesis is correct, it also potentially implicates phenolic and quinonoid compounds in the induction of ""spontaneous"" leukemia in man.","['Smith, M T']",['Smith MT'],"['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley 94720-7360, USA. martynts@uclink4.berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Phenols)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Benzene/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Phenols/metabolism/toxicity', 'Recombination, Genetic/drug effects', 'Translocation, Genetic/drug effects']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.961041219 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1996 Dec;104 Suppl 6:1219-25. doi: 10.1289/ehp.961041219.,,63,PMC1469721,,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES01896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES 06721/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Study of the relationship between the metabolism and toxicity of benzene indicates that several metabolites of benzene play significant roles in generating benzene toxicity. Benzene is metabolized, primarily in the liver, to a variety of hydroxylated and ring-opened products that are transported to the bone marrow where subsequent secondary metabolism occurs. Two potential mechanisms by which benzene metabolites may damage cellular macromolecules to induce toxicity include the covalent binding of reactive metabolites of benzene and the capacity of benzene metabolites to induce oxidative damage. Although the relative contributions of each of these mechanisms to toxicity remains unestablished, it is clear that different mechanisms contribute to the toxicities associated with different metabolites. As a corollary, it is unlikely that benzene toxicity can be described as the result of the interaction of a single metabolite with a single biological target. Continued investigation of the metabolism of benzene and its metabolites will allow us to determine the specific combination of metabolites as well as the biological target(s) involved in toxicity and will ultimately lead to our understanding of the relationship between the production of benzene metabolites and bone marrow toxicity.","['Snyder, R', 'Hedli, C C']","['Snyder R', 'Hedli CC']","['Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute, Rutgers, State University of New Jersey, Piscataway 08855, USA. rsnyder@eohsi.rutgers.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (DNA Adducts)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Biotransformation', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'DNA Adducts/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Microsomes, Liver/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxidative Stress']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.961041165 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1996 Dec;104 Suppl 6:1165-71. doi: 10.1289/ehp.961041165.,,52,PMC1469747,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive entry study of patients meeting severe sepsis criteria and having bacteriologically documented infections. SETTING: University hospital, surgical intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Fifty consecutive patients developing severe sepsis or septic shock between December 1991 and December 1993. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and leukemia inhibitory factor were measured by immunoradiometric assay in the plasma of patients as soon as they developed severe sepsis or septic shock. Septic shock patients were divided into three groups in a blinded fashion (i.e., without knowing the results of the concentrations of cytokines), according to the presence of sustained hyperlactacidemia and to the rapidity of the onset of sepsis. Peak concentrations of all cytokines were statistically different between severe sepsis and septic shock patients. This finding was almost exclusively due to the data from patients with rapid onset of septic shock, who demonstrated very high but transient cytokine concentrations. Septic shock patients may thus have different profiles in the time course of their cytokine concentrations. The transient, high peak concentrations of cytokines were also related to transient leukopenia. Among the cytokines measured, IL-8 appeared to be the one that correlated best with lactacidemia, the presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, severe hypoxemia, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, and mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: According to the profiles of the cytokines, septic shock patients do not represent a homogeneous population. These profiles should be described in order to distinguish between patients, and the profiles may be useful to identify those patients susceptible to new therapies.","['Damas, P', 'Canivet, J L', 'de Groote, D', 'Vrindts, Y', 'Albert, A', 'Franchimont, P', 'Lamy, M']","['Damas P', 'Canivet JL', 'de Groote D', 'Vrindts Y', 'Albert A', 'Franchimont P', 'Lamy M']","['Department of Anesthesia, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire of Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['*APACHE', 'Acidosis, Lactic/microbiology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Interleukin-8/*blood', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sepsis/blood/classification/*immunology', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00003246-199703000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Care Med. 1997 Mar;25(3):405-12. doi: 10.1097/00003246-199703000-00006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cell populations were treated with the GARFT inhibitors 6R-5, 10-dideazatetrahydrofolate (Lometrexol) or LY309887, the TS inhibitor ZD1694, or the multitargeted antifolate LY231514. DNA content, nucleoside precursor incorporation and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression as functions of drug treatment were assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry. Cellular respiration was measured by MTT analysis and apoptosis was detected by extraction of DNA fragments. RESULTS: Cell populations treated for up to 96h with lometrexol or LY309887 did not replicate and maintained a cell cycle distribution with distinct G1, S and G2/M regions. The number of S phase cells in treated populations was slightly elevated relative to control as measured by DNA content and PCNA. However, these cells were unable to incorporate 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Throughout treatment, cells incubated with GARFT inhibitors maintained intact membranes and respired at a level comparable to untreated cells. In contrast, ZD1694 as well as LY231514, induced synchronization of the treatment population at the G1/S interface within 12h of drug addition. This was followed by synchronous entry of the population into S phase. After 24 h of treatment, more than 90% of the cells were capable of incorporating BrdU and stained positive for PCNA. DNA fragmentation occurred in cells treated with ZD1694 or LY231514 but not in those treated with GARFT inhibitors. In addition, the viable cells remaining after 24-48 h of treatment with ZD1694 or LY231514 were respiring at twice the level of untreated cells. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the distinct endpoints of GARFT and TS inhibition are preceded by distinct cell cycle and metabolic alterations.","['Tonkinson, J L', 'Marder, P', 'Andis, S L', 'Schultz, R M', 'Gossett, L S', 'Shih, C', 'Mendelsohn, L G']","['Tonkinson JL', 'Marder P', 'Andis SL', 'Schultz RM', 'Gossett LS', 'Shih C', 'Mendelsohn LG']","['Lilly Research Laboratories, Lilly Corporate Center, Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, IN 46285, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 2.1.2.- (Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases)', 'EC 2.1.2.2 (Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Acyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Glutamates/pharmacology', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Pemetrexed', 'Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase', 'Tetrahydrofolates/pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050608 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1997;39(6):521-31. doi: 10.1007/s002800050608.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a previous study with such rats that had been treated with a high dose of CDDP (10 mg/kg) the tumors did not show differences in cellular platinum content or DNA-adduct levels, either immediately after treatment or 24 h later. Recently, this high dose was found to overcome resistance. Therefore, the study was repeated with a 10-fold lower dose (1 mg/kg, i.v.). At 1 and 24 h after treatment, tumor and kidney tissue were assayed for cellular platinum (atomic absorption spectroscopy, AAS) and DNA platination (immunochemical detection of the four CDDP-DNA adducts). The results were compared with previous data. All tissues showed a linear response to dose with regard to platinum uptake as well as adduct formation, with no quantitative difference being seen between the tumors. Also the relative occurrence of the four adducts was very similar. Between 1 and 24 h, in tumors a substantial decrease occurred in both platinum content and adduct level; the kidneys showed little reduction, if any. At the lower CDDP dose a somewhat larger loss of platinum and removal of DNA adducts was observed for the resistant tumor, but these differences could be explained by ""dilution"", as this tumor continues to grow after low-dose treatment (about 20% within 24 h). Since the strong difference observed between the tumors in sensitivity to CDDP cannot be attributed to differences in CDDP uptake, efficiency of adduct formation, or repair capability, other mechanisms are held responsible.","['Vendrik, C P', 'Fichtinger-Schepman, A M', 'van Dijk-Knijnenburg, W C', 'de Jong, W H', 'van der Minnen, A C', 'de Groot, G', 'Berends, G F', 'Steerenberg, P A']","['Vendrik CP', 'Fichtinger-Schepman AM', 'van Dijk-Knijnenburg WC', 'de Jong WH', 'van der Minnen AC', 'de Groot G', 'Berends GF', 'Steerenberg PA']","['Department of Oncology, University Hospital of Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (cisplatin-DNA adduct)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cisplatin/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA Adducts/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Immunoglobulin M/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Rats']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050602 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1997;39(6):479-85. doi: 10.1007/s002800050602.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although various methods of purging are established for marrow, purging procedures for blood progenitor cell preparations have not been widely used primarily because of the technical challenges to process a higher number of cells. As a broadly applicable method for immunological purging, we tested whether highly cytotoxic cells from a natural killer (NK) cell line characterized previously (NK-92) could be used for immunological purging of blood preparations. The NK-92 cell line, which was established from a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, can lyse in vitro a broad range of leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma cell lines even at very low effector:target (E:T) ratios; this lysis is superior to cytotoxicity obtained from normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated for 4 days with interleukin (IL)-2. In an attempt to quantitate the purging achievable with NK-92 cells, normal PBMCs were spiked with 10% K562 cells that had been transfected with the neo(r) marker gene (K562-neo(r). Various numbers of NK-92 cells were then added to the cell mixtures, which were incubated for 4 or 48 hours at 37 degrees C with or without IL-2 (500 U/mL). In order to prevent their proliferation, NK-92 cells were irradiated with 1000 cGy (cesium source). This radiation dose was determined to suppress proliferation of NK-92 cells, but at the same time maintain full cytotoxic activity. After co-culture, the cells were plated in methylcellulose containing 0.8 mg/mL G418. The number of surviving K562-neo(r) colonies was counted under the microscope 7 days later and the results were considered a quantitative readout for the purging efficacy of NK-92 cells. No neomycin-resistant K562 colonies could be detected up to a ratio of NK-92:K562-neo(r) cells of 5:1 (effective NK-92:PBMC ratio of 0.5:1). The presence or absence of IL-2 during the culture period did not affect the results. At this ratio of NK-92:PBMC, the growth of normal clonogenic hematopoietic progenitor cells was not compromised as determined by a standard methylcellulose assay. Considering that K562 is a rapidly proliferating cell line and that the input number of K562 cells (10%) tested here was high, the data suggest that the cytotoxic NK-92 clone (after irradiation to prevent proliferation) could be used effectively for immunological ex vivo purging without compromising hematopoietic cell function.","['Klingemann, H G', 'Wong, E', 'Maki, G']","['Klingemann HG', 'Wong E', 'Maki G']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, Division of Hematology, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Cell Separation/*methods', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 1996 May;2(2):68-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventeen of the patients were transplanted in relapse or for primary refractory disease, and three were transplanted in ""high risk"" remission. Thirteen patients had at least one positive PCR assay for MRD in the first 100 days after transplant; two died of nonleukemic causes, while all the remaining 11 relapsed. Seven patients had all negative PCR assays; two died of nonleukemic causes, four remain alive and well, and one patient with consistently negative PCR assays relapsed 47 days after his last negative test. Considering PCR status as a time-dependent covariate, the relative risk of relapse for PCR-positive patients compared to PCR-negative patients is 6.4 (p = 0.0067; 95% CI, 1.6-24.4), and the relative risk of relapse or death is 4.8 (p = 0.0052; 95% CI, 1.6-14.2).

This analysis was designed to determine device-related morbidity and factors predictive of poor long term outcome for patients with subcutaneous single lumen intravenous access ports. METHODS: Six hundred eighty patients who underwent subcutaneous intravenous port placement between June 1987 and May 1989 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center were followed prospectively until port removal, death, or a maximum of 1960 days. Indications for and circumstances of placement, patient diagnoses, patient demographics, and subsequent courses of treatment were recorded, as well as technical and microbiologic device-related complications. Total, device specific, and complication free device durations were calculated. RESULTS: The median patient age was 52.4 years (range, 1.6-83.9 years). The female-to-male ratio was 1.5 to 1. Cancer diagnoses included solid organ tumors (84%), leukemia (4%), lymphoma (11%), and others (1%). Indications included access for systemic chemotherapy (98%), total parenteral nutrition (0.5%), and others (1.5%). One insertion complication and six insertion failures occurred, without mortality. The estimated mean overall actuarial device specific duration was 1191 days (range, 2-1960 days). Actuarial mean complication free, device specific duration was 952 days. Complications included sepsis (n = 31; 4.4%), site infection (n = 31; 4.4%), and accessibility failures such as thrombosis and leakage (n = 40, 5.7%). Reasons for end of port duration were patient death (72.4%), end of treatment (13.5%), functional failure or intractable infection (11.2%), and others (2.9%). Independent factors correlating with decreased port specific, complication free duration included placement site, age, tumor type, and catheter tip position. CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous intravenous access ports in cancer patients are safe and well tolerated. Long term device duration is primarily influenced by patient survival.

However, no controlled studies have previously explored the risk of second malignancies after RT for prostate carcinoma. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted utilizing data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) of the U. S. National Cancer Institute from 1973-1990. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR), adjusted for age, was calculated as an estimate of the relative risk (RR) of developing a second malignancy after prostate carcinoma for radiated and nonradiated prostate carcinoma patients separately. RESULTS: The cohort was comprised of 34,889 prostate carcinoma patients who had undergone RT, and 106,872 who had not. After 8 years, the risk of bladder carcinoma was elevated for the RT group (RR 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.0) but not for the non-RT group (RR 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7-1.2). There was an elevated risk of bladder carcinoma for the RT group at 5-8 years as well (RR 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7). No elevations in risk were observed for rectal carcinoma, acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia for either RT patients or non-RT patients. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of bladder carcinoma is elevated several years after RT for prostate carcinoma, but this elevation is not dramatic. There is no increased risk of rectal carcinoma or leukemia after this type of radiation exposure.","['Neugut, A I', 'Ahsan, H', 'Robinson, E', 'Ennis, R D']","['Neugut AI', 'Ahsan H', 'Robinson E', 'Ennis RD']","['Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Rectal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*epidemiology']",1997/04/15 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19970415)79:8<1600::AID-CNCR24>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19970415)79:8<1600::aid-cncr24>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1997 Apr 15;79(8):1600-4. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19970415)79:8<1600::aid-cncr24>3.0.co;2-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Four hundred seventy-nine previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma from 23 ECOG institutions were enrolled. Treatment, assigned by randomization, consisted of either 4-week cycles of MP or 5-week cycles of VBCMP. After 1 year of induction therapy, patients received MP or VBMCP maintenance therapy at 6- and 8- week intervals, respectively, until relapse. Patients who experienced treatment failure with MP were eligible for crossover therapy with VBMCP. RESULTS: Objective responses were obtained for 51% of patients receiving MP, as compared with 72% of patients receiving VBMCP (P < 0.001). Response duration was also longer with VBMCP (median, 18 months with MP vs. 24 months with VBMCP; P = 0.007). Overall survival was not significantly different between MP and VBMCP (P = 0.30). The 5-year survival for VBMCP was 26%, as compared with 19% for MP. VBMCP was associated with more nausea, peripheral nerve toxicity, alopecia, and neutropenia, but the infection rate was equal to that observed with MP. Both regimens were generally well tolerated. The main exception was that elderly patients who were confined to bed had a higher risk of death with VBMCP. The two regimens produced a similar incidence of late secondary myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia. Crossover VBMCP for patients failing with MP was only minimally effective, with an objective response rate of 20% and median survival of 11 months after crossover. CONCLUSIONS: VBMCP is more effective than MP in producing and sustaining remission of multiple myeloma. It is associated with a marginal survival advantage and an apparently greater chance of surviving 5 years for patients who can tolerate moderately intensive combination chemotherapy.

The authors examined the relationship between telomere length (terminal restriction fragment [TRF]) and therapy-associated cytogenetic responses in CML patients. METHODS: The authors examined the telomere length and telomerase activity in 44 patients with Ph-positive CML in the chronic phase. TRF was determined by Southern blot analysis using the (TTAGGG)4 probe and telomerase activity was assessed by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol and fluorescent-labeled primers. RESULTS: At the time of CML diagnosis, 19 patients had TRFs within the age-matched normal range (mean +/- 2 x standard deviation [SD]) and the remaining 25 patients had TRFs shorter than the age-matched normal range (< mean +/- 2 x SD). Hematologic findings, including leukocyte count, hemoglobin level, platelet count, and percentage of bone marrow blasts at the time of diagnosis did not significantly differ between patients with normal and shortened TRFs; however, those with shortened TRFs had high levels of telomerase activity (P = 0.045). In a group of patients treated with alpha-interferon (n = 32), those with normal TRFs had a significantly lower frequency of blast crises (P = 0.0328), a significantly higher incidence of cytogenetic responses (P = 0.0185), and a favorable prognosis (P < 0.01) compared with those with shortened TRFs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that normal TRFs in a small number of CML patients at the time of diagnosis may have a significant amount of normal stem cells remaining. The authors suggest that normal TRFs at the time of diagnosis indicate a subset of CML patients who may respond favorably to alpha-interferon therapy.","['Iwama, H', 'Ohyashiki, K', 'Ohyashiki, J H', 'Hayashi, S', 'Kawakubo, K', 'Shay, J W', 'Toyama, K']","['Iwama H', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Hayashi S', 'Kawakubo K', 'Shay JW', 'Toyama K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical College, Shinjuku-ku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Telomerase/blood', 'Telomere/*genetics']",1997/04/15 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19970415)79:8<1552::AID-CNCR17>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19970415)79:8<1552::aid-cncr17>3.0.co;2-x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1997 Apr 15;79(8):1552-60. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19970415)79:8<1552::aid-cncr17>3.0.co;2-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients had at least one positive blood cultures for one or more microorganism drawn during 1-10 days after cytotoxic chemotherapy, viridans streptococcal bacteremia was more frequently observed in patients with AML (12.5%) and NHL (27.9%) than ST (43%, p < 0.01 and 0.03). The incidence of anaerobic bacteria was similar in patients with NHL and ST, and in both groups significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in AML. Enterobacteriaceae caused bacteremia less frequently in patients with AML than in those with ST (12.5 vs 27.8%, p < 0.05). However, the highest incidence of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bacteremia was seen in patients with AML (6.3% vs 2.3%, p < 0.04 and 0.03). Concerning fungemia, Candida albicans occurred significantly more frequently in blood cultures in patients with NHL, and molds in patients with AML.

The time-course of the changes in glial activation have been characterized in an effort to understand the cellular basis of the neurobehavioral abnormalities observed in these mice. Glial activation was determined by measuring the relative changes in F4/80 protein and GFAP immunoreactivity using immunoblots. Augmented F4/80 expression preceded that of GFAP, with global elevations of 4-6-fold at 3 weeks, sustained for up to 12 weeks after inoculation. GFAP immunoreactivity increased 2-fold only in the cerebral cortex and striatum 5 weeks postinfection, declining to control levels by 12 weeks. Immunohistochemistry revealed significant increases in microglial size and staining intensity in the cortex, corpus callosum and striatum, with the development of a unique population of highly ramified, intensely stained microglia and microglial nodules in the corpus callosum and striatum. No evidence of ameboid microglia was found. Astrocyte size and degree of ramification was increased in the hippocampus, cortex, striatum and corpus callosum. Thus, microgliosis is an early event in LP-BM5 infection, preceding astrocytosis, neurotransmitter loss, and development of cognitive deficits. Activated microglia may secrete neurotoxins leading to the neurochemical alterations and cognitive deficits observed in these mice. Because gliosis and microglial nodule formation are hallmarks of HIV-1 encephalopathy, LP-BM5 MuLV-infected C57/B16 mice may afford insights into the mechanisms contributing to the early stages of this syndrome.","['Kustova, Y', 'Sei, Y', 'Goping, G', 'Basile, A S']","['Kustova Y', 'Sei Y', 'Goping G', 'Basile AS']","['Laboratory of Neuroscience, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/virology', 'Animals', 'Dementia/*virology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Gliosis/*metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",1996/12/02 00:00,1996/12/02 00:01,['1996/12/02 00:00'],"['1996/12/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/02 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-8993(96)01014-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-8993(96)01014-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 1996 Dec 2;742(1-2):271-82. doi: 10.1016/s0006-8993(96)01014-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients had received at least 2.5 x 10(6) CD34-positive cells for stem cell rescue after high-dose chemotherapy. Ninety-four percent of the patients experienced at least one febrile episode during their post-transplant course. The patients recovered quickly and defervesced after a median of 4 days.

Both ET-18-OCH3 and MC540-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) have been used as purging agents in preclinical models of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and are currently undergoing phase I/II clinical testing for the same purpose. We report here that ET-18-OCH3 synergistically enhances the MC540-mediated photoinactivation of leukemia cells but only minimally reduces the survival of normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. Therapeutic indices are most favorable when MC540-mediated PDT precedes incubation with ET-18-OCH3 and when purging is followed by cryopreservation. Taken together, these data suggest that combination purging with alkyl-lysophospholipid and MC540-mediated PDT may provide a simple, versatile, and effective means of eliminating large numbers of leukemia cells from autologous bone marrow grafts without causing excessive damage to normal hematopoietic stem cells.","['Yamazaki, T', 'Sieber, F']","['Yamazaki T', 'Sieber F']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Blood Component Removal/*methods', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Synergism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/02 00:00,1997/01/02 00:01,['1997/01/02 00:00'],"['1997/01/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/02 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700625 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Jan;19(2):113-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700625.,,,,,['CA49089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['Bone Marrow Transplant 1997 Jul;20(1):95'],,,,,,

In the present studies, we report clinical observations using autologous marrow mixed with HLA-haploidentical allogeneic marrow transplantation for treatment of patients with malignant blood diseases. Sixteen cases, including 12 with acute leukemia and four with advanced malignant lymphoma, were treated by autologous marrow, which was purged in vitro by hyperthemia (42.5 degrees C for 70 min) following incubation for 5 days with interleukin 2 (IL-2) in liquid culture and mixed with HLA haploidentical marrow cells from their sibling or parent. Acute GVHD was not observed in any patient after transplantation. Hematological rescue in the clinical setting was demonstrated in all cases but one who died early from hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Five cases who were transplanted at the time of CR2 or CR3 and in advanced phase of lymphoma, relapsed 4 to 7 months after transplantation. The relapse rate was 31.3%. None of eight patients who received allogeneic BMT within 2 h after ABMT relapsed with median follow-up of 12 months and two of them died from procedure-related complications. Seven cases are still alive and disease-free with a median follow-up of 12 months. Mixed chimerism was found in 3/6 cases, who had different sex donors, by analysis of sex chromosomes. These results show that mixed transplantation is a safe, effective and new approach to treating patients with malignant tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples were analysed to determine Candida IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies and defect free C. albicans glucoprotein antigen and C. enolase antigen in eight children who had nine episodes of DCI and six with suspected DCI. RESULTS: DCI occurred shortly after the leukaemia diagnosis (median 40 days) or after the leukaemia relapse (median 30 days). Children with DCI had fever (100%), skin lesions/exanthema (45%), oral thrush (45%), oesophagitis (22%) and laryngo-tracheitis (22%). Candida endocarditis, arthritis and hepatic candidosis were diagnosed in one patient each. Two children with disseminated candidosis died in leukaemia relapse. In patients with C. albicans infections serology had a sensitivity of 83%. However, in patients with C. parapsilosis infection antibody detection was negative. As the patients were cured of their Candida infection, the IgG antibodies disappeared and the IgM and IgA antibodies fell within the normal range for age. CONCLUSION: DCI in children occurs shortly after the leukaemia diagnosis or shortly after relapse of leukaemia. The clinical features are many. Candida serology may help to diagnose or confirm DCI. The dynamics of antibody titres may help to establish the efficacy of antifungal treatment.","['Klingspor, L', 'Stintzing, G', 'Tollemar, J']","['Klingspor L', 'Stintzing G', 'Tollemar J']","['Department of Paediatrics, Karolinska Institute, Danderyd Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,"['0 (Antibodies, Fungal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Fungal/blood', 'Candida/immunology', 'Candidiasis/diagnosis/*etiology/microbiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/blood', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/*etiology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survival Analysis']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1651-2227.1997.tb08827.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 1997 Jan;86(1):30-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.1997.tb08827.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four groups of AML are included: group A: 19 cases of de novo AML in elderly patients; group B: ten cases of AML in relapse; group C: five cases of AML refractory to previous treatment and group D: seven cases of secondary AML. Cytarabine was given subcutaneously at the dose of 10 mg/m2 of body surface, for 21 days per month for the first course; then 15 days per month for the following courses. The response rates were 42, 20, 0, and 43% respectively for the A, B, C, and D groups. A complete remission was attained in only 15% (six patients). Extra haematological tolerance was excellent. Infection complications were noted in 66%, whereas a severe neutropenia was observed in 34% of patients. Hemorrhagic complications were more rare (20% of patients). The mean duration of complete remission was 10 months. The median survival was 10.5 months (2 to 31 months) for the responder patients, and 2.4 months (1 to 7 months) for the non-responders. Cytarabine at low doses seems to be a good indication for first intention treatment of AML in elderly patients. It does not give a bone marrow aplasia, the infection and hemorrhagic episodes are less numerous than with conventional dose chemotherapy, the life quality is improved, and treatment at home is often possible.","['Frikha, M', 'Elloumi, M', 'Bouaziz, M', 'Daoud, J', 'Mseddi, S', 'Khanfir, A', 'Gargouri, J', 'Souissi, T']","['Frikha M', 'Elloumi M', 'Bouaziz M', 'Daoud J', 'Mseddi S', 'Khanfir A', 'Gargouri J', 'Souissi T']","[""Service d'hemato-oncologie, CHU Hedi-Chaker, Sfax, Tunisie.""]",['fre'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 1996 Dec;83(12):996-1001.,,22,,,,,Cytarabine a faible dose dans le traitement des leucemies aigues myeloides.

Seventeen were transplanted in relapse, and 19 were transplanted in remission. Twenty-three patients had at least one positive bcr-abl polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay after BMT either before a relapse or without subsequent relapse. Ten of these 23 relapsed after a positive assay at a median time from first positive PCR assay of 94 days (range, 28 to 416 days). By comparison, only 2 relapses occurred in the 13 patients with no prior positive PCR assays; both patients had missed at least one scheduled follow-up assay and were not tested 2 months and 26 months before their relapse. The unadjusted relative risk (RR) of relapse associated with a positive PCR assay compared with a negative assay was 5.7 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 26.0, P = .025). In addition, the data suggest that the type of bcr-abl chimeric mRNA detected posttransplant was associated with the risk of relapse: 7 of 10 patients expressing the p190 bcr-abl relapsed, compared with 1 of 8 who expressed only the p210 bcr-abl mRNA (P = .02, log-rank test). The RR of p190 bcr-abl positivity compared to PCR-negative patients was 11.2 (confidence interval 2.3-54.8, P = 0.003), whereas a positive test for p210 bcr-abl was apparently not associated with an increased relative risk. In separate multivariable models, PCR positivity remained a statistically significant risk factor for relapse after separately adjusting for donor (unrelated and partially matched v matched, autologous, and syngeneic), remission status at the time of transplant, the presence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and type of conditioning regimen (total body irradiation dose of < or = 1,200 cGy v > 1,200 cGy). The PCR assay appears to be a useful test for predicting patients at high risk of relapse after BMT and may identify patients who might benefit from therapeutic interventions. The finding that the expression of p190 bcr-abl may portend an especially high risk of relapse suggests a different clinical and biologic behavior between p190 and p210 bcr-abl.","['Radich, J', 'Gehly, G', 'Lee, A', 'Avery, R', 'Bryant, E', 'Edmands, S', 'Gooley, T', 'Kessler, P', 'Kirk, J', 'Ladne, P', 'Thomas, E D', 'Appelbaum, F R']","['Radich J', 'Gehly G', 'Lee A', 'Avery R', 'Bryant E', 'Edmands S', 'Gooley T', 'Kessler P', 'Kirk J', 'Ladne P', 'Thomas ED', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/genetics', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Treatment Failure']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59072-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 1;89(7):2602-9.,,,,,"['K08CA1612/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA01612/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-six patients (median age 42 years) with secondary AML (17 therapy-related, 29 myelodysplasia-related) who had not received remission induction chemotherapy underwent allogeneic (n = 43) or syngeneic (n = 3) transplantation. The 5-year actuarial disease-free survival was 24.4%, and the cumulative incidences of relapse and nonrelapse mortality were 31.3% and 44.3%, respectively. Lower peripheral blood blast count was associated with a lower risk of relapse (P = .05) and shorter time from AML diagnosis to transplant was associated with a lower risk of nonrelapse mortality (P = .02) and improved disease-free survival (P = .026). Patients with therapy-related secondary AML tended to have lower disease-free survival (P = .16) and a higher relapse rate (P = .16) than patients whose leukemia was not therapy-related. The results of these 46 previously untreated patients were compared to 20 patients (median age 36 years, 12 therapy-related, 8 myelodysplasia-related) transplanted with chemotherapy-sensitive disease after induction chemotherapy (first complete remission [n = 6], second complete remission [n = 3], first untreated relapse [n = 11]). We found no statistically significant difference in outcome between these 2 groups of patients. These results suggest that prompt transplantation should be considered after diagnosis of secondary AML or, if possible, high-risk myelodysplasia, particularly in patients with low peripheral blast counts. Innovative transplant strategies are needed to reduce the high risks of relapse and nonrelapse mortality seen in this patient population.","['Anderson, J E', 'Gooley, T A', 'Schoch, G', 'Anasetti, C', 'Bensinger, W I', 'Clift, R A', 'Hansen, J A', 'Sanders, J E', 'Storb, R', 'Appelbaum, F R']","['Anderson JE', 'Gooley TA', 'Schoch G', 'Anasetti C', 'Bensinger WI', 'Clift RA', 'Hansen JA', 'Sanders JE', 'Storb R', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/drug therapy/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59069-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 1;89(7):2578-85.,,23,,,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, following irradiation, 10% to 30% of these mice develop acute myelomonocytic leukemia (radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia [RI-AML]), an incidence that can be increased to 50% by treatment of the mice with corticosteroids after irradiation. The role played by the mononuclear phagocyte growth factor, colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), in the development of RI-AML in SJL/J mice was investigated. Mice dying of RI-AML, but not those dying of RCN B or without disease, possessed elevated concentrations of circulating CSF-1. In addition, in mice developing RI-AML with a more prolonged latency, circulating CSF-1 concentrations were increased before overt expression of RI-AML. First-passage tumors from 14 different RI-AMLs all contained high concentrations of CSF-1, and six of six different first- or second-passage tumors expressed the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1 R). Furthermore, in vitro colony formation by first- or second-passage tumor cells from 20 of 20 different RI-AMLs was blocked by neutralizing anti-CSF-1 antibody, and four of four of these tumors were inhibited by anti-CSF-1R antibody. The results of these antibody neutralization studies, coupled with the observation of elevated circulating CSF-1 in mice developing RI-AML, show an autocrine role for CSF-1 in RI-AML development in SJL/J mice. Southern blot analysis of tumor DNA from six of six of these tumors failed to reveal any rearrangements in the genes for CSF-1 or the CSF-1R. Studies in humans have shown that patients with AML possess elevated levels of circulating CSF-1 and that AML cells can express CSF-1 and the CSF-1R. Thus, RI-AML in the SJL/J mouse appears to be a useful model for human AML.","['Haran-Ghera, N', 'Krautghamer, R', 'Lapidot, T', 'Peled, A', 'Dominguez, M G', 'Stanley, E R']","['Haran-Ghera N', 'Krautghamer R', 'Lapidot T', 'Peled A', 'Dominguez MG', 'Stanley ER']","['Department of Immunology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Dexamethasone/toxicity', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*blood', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/blood/genetics', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*blood/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59064-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 1;89(7):2537-45.,,,,,"['CA 32551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA 13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, in most conventional chromosome banding studies of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), 11q deletions were not identified as a frequent aberration. The objective of this study was to analyze the frequency and clinical impact of 11q deletions in B-CLL by interphase cytogenetics using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Mononuclear cells from 214 patients with B-CLL were studied by FISH using the yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone 755b11 from chromosome region 11q22.3-q23.1; we previously showed that this clone was contained within a 2- to 3-Mb sized segment of 11q commonly deleted in lymphoproliferative disorders. Forty-three of the 214 (20%) tumors exhibited 11q deletions; 11q deletions were the second most frequent chromosome aberration following 13q14 (RB1 and/or D13S25) deletions (45%); they were more frequent than trisomy 12 (15%) or deletion of 17p (TP53 gene) (10%). Patients with 11q deletions were younger (P = .01) and had more advanced clinical stages (P = .01). 11q deletions were associated with extensive peripheral, abdominal, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (P < .001). Patients with 11q deletions had a more rapid disease progression as shown by a shorter treatment-free interval (9 months v 43 months; P < .001). The prognostic effect of 11q deletion on survival strongly depended on the age: in patients less than 55 years old, the median survival time was significantly shorter in the deletion group (64 months v 209 months; P < .001), whereas in patients > or = 55 years old there was no significant difference (94 months v 111 months; P = .82). 11q deletions identify a new clinical subset of B-CLL characterized by extensive lymph node involvement.

The alteration of MTX uptake kinetics in these cells, the intermediately resistant MOLT-3/MTX200 and the highly resistant MOLT-3/MTX10,000 cell lines, was attributed to a change in Vmax for methotrexate transport, without an apparent change in affinity of the transporter for MTX. We studied these cell lines to determine whether alteration of transcription or translation of the recently isolated reduced folate carrier gene (RFC1) was the cause of MTX transport deficiency in these cell lines. Reconstitution of RFC activity in MOLT-3/MTX10,000 cells by transduction with a murine RFC retroviral vector reversed MTX resistance and trimetrexate sensitivity. Although RFC1 RNA levels were unchanged in the resistant cell lines, FACS analysis using a polyclonal anti-RFC1 antibody showed no detectable RFC1 protein in the MOLT-3/MTX10,000 cells. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of RFC1 genes from MOLT-3/MTX10,000 cells revealed that this cell line contained 3 RFC1 alleles: a wild-type allele, an allele containing the premature stop codon at codon 40 and a third allele containing another mutation, which resulted in a premature stop codon at codon 25. We examined the relative expression of these alleles by determining the nucleotide sequence of 24 RFC1 cDNA subclones from MOLT-3/MTX10,000 cells and found that only one-third of these clones contained the wild-type sequence. Determination of the genomic sequence of RFC1 in MOLT-3/ MTX200 cells demonstrated that these cells were heterozygous for a mutation at codon 40, but were homozygous for the wild-type sequence at codon 25. Thus, the acquisition of MTX transport-deficiency in MOLT-3/MTX10,000 cells results from inactivating mutations of RFC1 gene alleles.","['Gong, M', 'Yess, J', 'Connolly, T', 'Ivy, S P', 'Ohnuma, T', 'Cowan, K H', 'Moscow, J A']","['Gong M', 'Yess J', 'Connolly T', 'Ivy SP', 'Ohnuma T', 'Cowan KH', 'Moscow JA']","['Medicine and Pediatric Branches, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892,USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (SLC19A2 protein, human)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Codon/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/physiology', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Terminator Regions, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59058-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 1;89(7):2494-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report the first comprehensive comparison of treatment outcomes among a large cohort of children with CD2+ CD19+ biphenotypic ALL (N = 77), B-lineage ALL (BL) (N = 1,631), or T-lineage ALL (TL) (N = 347) ALL who were treated on risk-adjusted Children's Cancer Group (CCG) protocols.

The percentages of patients achieving successful induction therapy outcome were 98.7%, 97.8%, and 97.3% for CD2+ CD19+, BL, and TL patients, respectively. Univariate comparisons of 4-year event-free survival (83.7%, 72.8%, 75.2% for CD2+ CD19+, BL, and TL patients, respectively) achieved borderline significance (CD2+ CD19+ B, P = .08; CD2+ CD19+ v T, P = .07). Relative hazard rate (RHR) estimates for BL and TL compared with CD2+ CD19+ were 1.79 and 1.90, respectively, implying a better outcome for biphenotypic patients. However, multivariate adjusted RHRs for BL and TL compared with CD2+ CD19+ were 1.43 (P = .29) and 1.16 (P = .76), respectively, suggesting a significant reduction in risk for BL or TL patients once adjustment was made for the more favorable characteristics of the CD2+ CD19+ group. Thus, pediatric ALL patients treated on contemporary CCG protocols who present with CD2+ CD19+ biphenotypic leukemia generally have good treatment outcomes, due in part to their favorable presenting features.","['Uckun, F M', 'Gaynon, P', 'Sather, H', 'Arthur, D', 'Trigg, M', 'Tubergen, D', 'Nachman, J', 'Steinherz, P', 'Sensel, M G', 'Reaman, G R']","['Uckun FM', 'Gaynon P', 'Sather H', 'Arthur D', 'Trigg M', 'Tubergen D', 'Nachman J', 'Steinherz P', 'Sensel MG', 'Reaman GR']","['Biotherapy Institute, University of Minnesota, Roseville 55113, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD19/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'CD2 Antigens/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59057-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 1;89(7):2488-93.,,,,,"['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-51425/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the expression of an ATL-derived factor (ADF)/thioredoxin in relation to resistance to adriamycin (ADM) in various T-cell leukemia cell lines including ATL cell lines. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that ATL cell lines expressed ADF/thioredoxin at levels 2.8 to 12 times those of other T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines, and that ATL cell lines were 2 to 15 times more resistant to ADM than other T-ALL cell lines. Therefore, we established ADM-resistant cell lines from three different ATL cell lines, and examined the correlation between ADM resistance and expression of ADF/thioredoxin. ADM-resistant ATL cell lines were also found to be resistant to other drugs such as cisplatin and etoposide, and they expressed ADF/thioredoxin at levels 5 to 10 times those of parent ATL cell lines. Diamide and sodium selenite, which have been reported to inhibit ADF/thioredoxin, restored the sensitivity to ADM in ATL and ADM-resistant ATL cell lines. The MDR-1 gene product, a membrane P-glycoprotein (Pgp), was not expressed on ATL cell lines or ADM-resistant ATL cell lines. Topoisomerase II and glutathione peroxidase activities in T-cell leukemia cell lines were not correlated with ADM resistance. These results suggest that ADF/thioredoxin may play an important role in the drug resistance of ATL cells to ADM.","['Wang, J', 'Kobayashi, M', 'Sakurada, K', 'Imamura, M', 'Moriuchi, T', 'Hosokawa, M']","['Wang J', 'Kobayashi M', 'Sakurada K', 'Imamura M', 'Moriuchi T', 'Hosokawa M']","['The Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '10465-78-8 (Diamide)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'HIW548RQ3W (Sodium Selenite)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/analysis', 'Diamide/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/analysis', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Sodium Selenite/pharmacology', 'Thioredoxins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59056-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 1;89(7):2480-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic cells from 19 patients (6 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 13 acute myeloid leukemia) were examined for their sensitivity to DOX and TNF in relation to their enTNF expression and MnSOD activity. Sensitivity to DOX and the expression of enTNF or MnSOD activity were inversely correlated. In a case with acquired resistance to chemotherapy which included DOX, enTNF expression and MnSOD activity were increased. Furthermore, in 14 cases treated with a regimen including an anthracycline, 4 cases that failed to respond to chemotherapy showed relatively high amounts of enTNF expression. KG-1 (human acute myelogenous leukemia) cells transfected with a nonsecretory-type TNF expression vector (pTNF delta pro) showed resistance to DOX. A significant increase in MnSOD levels was also noted in the transfectants. TNF antisense cDNA was transfected into isolated leukemic cells from five patients. Sensitivity of the antisense transfectants to DOX was increased, approximately 1.4- to 2.5-fold. These results suggest that enTNF acts as a resistance factor against DOX in leukemia, and that enTNF may be useful as a predictor of DOX sensitivity in leukemia.","['Kobayashi, D', 'Watanabe, N', 'Yamauchi, N', 'Tsuji, N', 'Sato, T', 'Niitsu, Y']","['Kobayashi D', 'Watanabe N', 'Yamauchi N', 'Tsuji N', 'Sato T', 'Niitsu Y']","['Department of Laboratory Diagnosis, Sapporo Medical University, School of Medicine, Chuo-ku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'DNA, Antisense/pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59055-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 1;89(7):2472-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the frequency of these specific G-CSF receptor mutations in patients with congenital neutropenia undergoing treatment with r-metHuG-CSF (Filgrastim) and the clinical relevance of these mutations. Nucleotides 2306 to 2561 including the critical region (nucleotides 2384-2429) from the intracellular domain of the G-CSF receptor gene were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Detection of point mutations was performed with specific restriction enzyme analysis, as well as sequencing of PCR products. Both genomic DNA and cDNA from neutrophils and mononuclear cells were analyzed from 28 patients with severe congenital neutropenia. Four of 28 patients with congenital neutropenia displayed a point mutation in the tested cytoplasmic region of the G-CSF receptor gene. The point mutations replace a glutamine codon by a stop codon of the G-CSF receptor gene. Among these four congenital neutropenia patients with a mutated G-CSF receptor, two developed AML. All four patients were investigated regularly and no correlation between occurrence of G-CSF receptor mutation and time or dose of r-metHuG-CSF treatment was found. No point mutations in the G-CSF receptor critical domain could be detected in cells from the other 24 congenital neutropenia patients. Furthermore, we tested six family members of the two patients with AML including mothers and fathers, one sister, and one brother who suffers from congenital neutropenia, as well. All family members displayed a normal G-CSF receptor gene. After the acquisition of the G-CSF receptor mutations, the congenital neutropenia patients continued to respond to G-CSF therapy with an increase in absolute neutrophils in the peripheral blood. We conclude that the point mutations in the critical region of the intracellular part of the G-CSF receptor occur spontaneously and are not inherited. From our data, we suggest that the described G-CSF receptor point mutations do not alter the response to treatment with r-metHuG-CSF and are not the cause of severe congenital neutropenia.","['Tidow, N', 'Pilz, C', 'Teichmann, B', 'Muller-Brechlin, A', 'Germeshausen, M', 'Kasper, B', 'Rauprich, P', 'Sykora, K W', 'Welte, K']","['Tidow N', 'Pilz C', 'Teichmann B', 'Muller-Brechlin A', 'Germeshausen M', 'Kasper B', 'Rauprich P', 'Sykora KW', 'Welte K']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/congenital/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Pedigree', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/chemistry/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59044-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 1;89(7):2369-75.,['Blood. 1997 Oct 1;90(7):2839-41.

Two other chemokines, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and neutrophil-activating peptide-2 (NAP-2), were also studied in comparison to PF4. Using a tetrazolium salt assay for cell viability, we observed that PF4 at 1 to 50 microg/mL supported the viability of normal human bone marrow cells. Approximately 45% of cells cultured for 48 hours survived, whereas 80% or more survived in the presence of PF4 5 microg/mL. PF4 also supported the viability of CD34+ cord blood (CB) cells and protected them from apoptosis induced by transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) and cytotoxic drugs. Pretreatment of CD34+ cells by PF4, but not by TGFbeta1, caused an increase in the number of megakaryocyte colonies after these cells were replated in secondary cultures. Flow cytometry analysis showed that when CD34+ cells were preincubated with PF4 or TGFbeta1 for 12 days in hematopoietic growth factor-rich medium, an increased number of remaining CD34+ cells was observed only for PF4-treated cells. Furthermore, PF4 significantly reduced the chemosensitivity of bone marrow cells, as shown by its ability to increase the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of several cytotoxic agents. Like PF4, IL-8 and NAP-2 at 0.1, 0.6, and 1 microg/mL supported the survival of myeloid progenitors, including colony-forming units granulocyte, erythroblast, monocyte, megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM), CFU-megakaryocyte (CFU-MK), CFU-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM), and burst-forming units-erythroblast (BFU-E), and reduced their sensitivity to the toxicity of etoposide (ETP). Protamine sulfate at 1 to 100 microg/mL showed no such activity of PF4. Interestingly, the three chemokines failed to affect significantly the viability and chemosensitivity of three leukemic and two other tumor cell lines. Based on these results, we conclude for the first time that PF4 and IL-8 and NAP-2 support the survival of normal hematopoietic precursors and protect them from the toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. Because such activities are unique to normal hematopoietic cells but not to the cancer cell lines evaluated, a potential clinical application of these molecules in the treatment of cancer is suggested.","['Han, Z C', 'Lu, M', 'Li, J', 'Defard, M', 'Boval, B', 'Schlegel, N', 'Caen, J P']","['Han ZC', 'Lu M', 'Li J', 'Defard M', 'Boval B', 'Schlegel N', 'Caen JP']","['Institut des Vaisseaux et du Sang, University of Paris VII, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (PPBP protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (beta-Thromboglobulin)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', '69344-77-0 (connective tissue-activating peptide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Platelet Factor 4/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'beta-Thromboglobulin']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59040-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 1;89(7):2328-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The French Polycythemia Study Group.,2319-27,"Despite myelosuppression, polycythemic (PV) patients greater than 65 years of age have a high risk of vascular complications, and the leukemic risk exceeds 15% after 12 years. Is the addition of low-dose maintenance treatment with hydroxyurea (HU) after radiophosphorus (32P) myelosuppression able to decrease these complications? Since the end of 1979, 461 patients were randomized to receive (or not) low-dose HU (5 to 10 mg/kg/d), after the first 32P-induced remission, and were observed until death or June 1996. Maintenance treatment very significantly prolonged the duration of 32P-induced remissions and reduced the annual mean dose received to one-third. However, despite this maintenance, 25% of the patients had an excessive platelet count and the rate of serious vascular complications was not decreased, except in the most severe cases with short-term relapse of polycythemia. Furthermore, the leukemia rate was significantly increased beyond 8 years and a significant excess of carcinomas was also observed. The continuous use of HU did not decrease the risk of progression to myelofibrosis (incidence of 20% after 15 years). Life expectancy was shorter (a median of 9.3 years v 10.9 years with 32P alone), except in the most severe cases (initial 32P-induced remission lasting <2 years) in which maintenance treatment moderately prolonged the survival by reducing the vascular risk. In most cases of PV, in which the duration of the first 32P-induced remission exceeded 2 years, the introduction of HU maintenance did not reduce the vascular risk. Although it considerably decreased the mean dose of 32P received, HU maintenance therapy significantly increased the leukemia and cancer risks and reduced the mean life expectancy by 15%. However, in cases with more rapid recurrence, the introduction of maintenance treatment reduced the vascular risks and moderately prolonged survival. The use of HU as a maintenance therapy is therefore only justified in this situation.","['Najean, Y', 'Rain, J D']","['Najean Y', 'Rain JD']","['Service de Medecine Nucleaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Aged', 'Alkylating Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Progression', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology/etiology', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Polycythemia Vera/drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vascular Diseases/epidemiology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59039-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 1;89(7):2319-27.,,,,,['93CN10/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Adult and Childhood Leukaemia Working Parties of the Medical Research Council.,2311-8,"The relative efficacy and toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agents thioguanine (6TG) and etoposide (VP16) were assessed by a randomized comparison of the DAT (daunorubicin, cytarabine, thioguanine) versus ADE (daunorubicin, cytarabine, etoposide) regimens in the Medical Research Council's 10th acute myeloid leukaemia trial (MRC AML 10), which was open to patient entry from May 1988 to April 1995. In this, the largest reported trial of AML therapy to date, 1,857 eligible patients, mostly less than 56 years old, were randomized: 929 (including 143 children under 15 years old) were allocated to DAT and 928 (143 children) to ADE. The two groups were well matched for presentation features. The complete remission (CR) rate was 81% with DAT and 83% with ADE (P = .3). The percentages of remitters achieving remission after 1, 2, or more than 2 courses were 70%, 22%, and 8% for DAT and 74%, 21%, and 5% for ADE. The percentages failing to achieve a CR due to resistant disease were 11% with DAT versus 9% with ADE (P = .07). There was a slightly higher death rate in CR during consolidation chemotherapy with ADE (9%) than with DAT (6%) (P = .06). Patients receiving DAT took slightly but significantly longer to recover from neutropenia and thrombocytopenia but the median number of days in hospital were similar in each group. ADE patients experienced slightly more severe nonhematologic toxicity. There was also no significant difference between the groups in the longer-term measures of efficacy: disease-free survival at 6 years from CR was 42% (+/-4) for DAT and 43% (+/-4) for ADE (P = .8); relapse rate at 6 years was 50% (+/-4) for DAT and 49% (+/-5) for ADE (P = .6); survival at 6 years was 40% (+/-4) for both DAT and ADE (P = .9). Subgroup analysis failed to show any benefit for etoposide in patients with monocytic or myelomonocytic disease, or in any other diagnostic subgroup. In conclusion, DAT and ADE both achieve high remission rates and good long-term survival, and are equally effective chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of AML patients aged up to 55 years.","['Hann, I M', 'Stevens, R F', 'Goldstone, A H', 'Rees, J K', 'Wheatley, K', 'Gray, R G', 'Burnett, A K']","['Hann IM', 'Stevens RF', 'Goldstone AH', 'Rees JK', 'Wheatley K', 'Gray RG', 'Burnett AK']","['Medical Research Council, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAT protocol 1', 'DAV regimen']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/mortality', 'Patient Compliance', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59038-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 1;89(7):2311-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine if the lymphomas these mice develop are related to a particular subtype of human lymphoma we evaluated 20 clinically ill homozygous MSH2-/- mice ranging in age from 2 to 13 months. The murine tumors comprised a single histopathologic entity representing the malignant counterpart of precursor thymic T cells and closely resembled human precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL). Evaluation of the expression of three T-cell malignancy associated genes showed that Rhombotin-2 (RBTN-2 also known as Lmo-2), TAL-1 (also known as SCL), and HOX-11 were expressed in 100%, 40%, and 0% of the murine tumors, respectively. The MSH2-/- murine model of precursor T-cell LBL was substantiated by the finding of a nearly identical expression profile of RBTN-2, TAL-1, and HOX-11 in 10 well-characterized cases of human LBL. Direct evidence for MSH2 abnormalities in human LBL was established by sequence analysis of exon 13 of hMSH2, which revealed coding region mutations in 2 of 10 cases.

After induction with DMSO, declines in cell growth, clonogenicity and PCNA positivity of the cells indicated a decrease in proliferation and an increase in differentiation.

However, neither of these growth factors individually or together induced differentiation of K562 cells. Hemin appears to be more efficient than DMSO or PMA in differentiation of K562 cells as measured by benzidine positive cells (70% or more). The differentiation of K562 cells by hemin occurs independently of protein kinase-C activation and the arrest of DNA synthesis. In contrast, hemin significantly stimulated RNA and protein synthesis (P<0.0001) as measured by [3H]-uridine and [3H]-leucine incorporation respectively. Analysis of hemin-treated K562 nuclear extract on sodium dodecylsulphate gel electrophoresis showed that one protein band of molecular weight 70 kDa decreased after 48 h of incubation in the presence of 25 microM hemin.

The results were based on the separate analysis of 870 cases of leukemia, 577 brain tumors, and 1,980 female breast cancers. We estimated the risk of leukemia among those exposed to magnetic fields of > 0.2 microtesla (microT), relative to the risk among those exposed to fields of < 0.1 microT; the odds ratio was 1.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.0-1.9].

N-(4-tert-Butylbenzoyl)-2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde hydrazone (BBNH) inhibited both the polymerase and the RNase H activities of HIV-1 RT in vitro. IC50 values for inhibition of RDDP were 0.8-3.4 microM, depending on the template/primer (T/P) used in the assay. The IC50 for DDDP inhibition was about 12 microM, while that for inhibition of RNase H was 3.5 microM. EC50 for inhibition of HIV-1 replication in cord blood mononuclear cells was 1.5 microM. BBNH inhibition of RNase H in vitro was time-dependent, whereas inhibition of RT polymerase activities was immediate. BBNH was a linear mixed-type inhibitor of RT RDDP activity with respect to both T/P and to dNTP, whereas BBNH inhibition of RT RNase H activity was linear competitive. Protection experiments using an azidonevirapine photolabel showed that BBNH binds to the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI) binding pocket. Importantly, the compound inhibited recombinant RT containing mutations associated with high-level resistance to other NNRTI. While BBNH did not inhibit the DNA polymerase activities of other retroviral reverse transcriptases and DNA polymerases, the compound inhibited Escherichia coli RNase HI and the RNase H activity of murine leukemia virus RT. BBNH also inhibited HIV-1 RT RNase H in the presence of high concentrations of other non-nucleoside inhibitors with higher affinities for the NNRTI binding pocket, and of RT in which the NNRTI binding pocket had been irreversibly blocked by the azidonevirapine photolabel. We conclude that BBNH may therefore bind to two sites on HIV-1 RT. One site is the polymerase non-nucleoside inhibitor binding site and the second may be located in the RNase H domain. BBNH is therefore a promising lead compound for the development of multisite inhibitors of HIV-1 RT.","['Borkow, G', 'Fletcher, R S', 'Barnard, J', 'Arion, D', 'Motakis, D', 'Dmitrienko, G I', 'Parniak, M A']","['Borkow G', 'Fletcher RS', 'Barnard J', 'Arion D', 'Motakis D', 'Dmitrienko GI', 'Parniak MA']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

Since gallium can be incorporated into ferritin, an iron storage protein that protects cells from iron toxicity, we investigated whether ferritin expression was altered in gallium-resistant (R) CCRF-CEM cells. We found that the ferritin content of R cells was decreased, while heavy chain ferritin mRNA levels and iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP-1) RNA binding activity were increased. IRP-1 protein levels were similar in gallium-sensitive (S) and R cells, indicating that R cells contain a greater proportion of IRP-1 in a high affinity mRNA binding state. 59Fe uptake and transferrin receptor expression were decreased in R cells. In both S and R cells, gallium inhibited cellular 59Fe uptake, increased ferritin mRNA and protein, and decreased IRP-1 binding activity. Gallium uptake by R cells was markedly diminished; however, the sensitivity of R cells to gallium could be restored by increasing their uptake of gallium with excess transferrin. Our results suggest that R cells have developed resistance to gallium by down-regulating their uptake of gallium. In parallel, iron uptake by R cells is also decreased, leading to changes in iron homeostasis. Furthermore, since gallium has divergent effects on iron uptake and ferritin synthesis, its action may also include a direct effect on ferritin mRNA induction and IRP-1 activity.","['Chitambar, C R', 'Wereley, J P']","['Chitambar CR', 'Wereley JP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53226, USA.

The initial results of retroviral gene transfer to cancer cells in malignant pleural effusions revealed that transduction was markedly inhibited, and studies to characterize the inhibitory factor(s) were performed. The inhibition was contained within the soluble, rather than cellular, components of the effusions and was demonstrated with amphotropic, gibbon ape leukemia virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein pseudotyped retroviral vectors. After excluding complement proteins, a series of studies identified chondroitin sulfates (CSs) as the inhibitory substances. First, treatment of the effusions with mammalian hyaluronidase or chondroitinases, but not Streptomyces hyaluronidase, abolished the inhibitory activity. Second, addition of exogenous CS glycosaminoglycans mimicked the inhibition observed with pleural effusions. Third, immunoassays and biochemical analyses of malignant pleural effusion specimens revealed CS in relevant concentrations within pleural fluid. Fourth, proteoglycans/glycosaminoglycans isolated from the effusions inhibited retroviral gene transfer. Analyses of the mechanism of inhibition indicate that the chondroitin sulfates interact with vector in solution rather than at the target cell surface. These results suggest that drainage of the malignant pleural effusion, and perhaps enzymatic pretreatment of the pleural cavity, will be necessary for efficient retroviral vector mediated gene delivery to pleural metastases.","['Batra, R K', 'Olsen, J C', 'Hoganson, D K', 'Caterson, B', 'Boucher, R C']","['Batra RK', 'Olsen JC', 'Hoganson DK', 'Caterson B', 'Boucher RC']","['Division of Pulmonary Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-7248, USA. rkbatra@med.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.35 (Hyaluronoglucosaminidase)', 'EC 4.2.2.- (Chondroitinases and Chondroitin Lyases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans/analysis/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Chondroitinases and Chondroitin Lyases', 'Epithelium', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Glycosaminoglycans/analysis/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronoglucosaminidase', 'Hylobates', 'Immunoassay', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Mesothelioma', 'Mink', '*Pleural Effusion, Malignant/chemistry/physiopathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/*biosynthesis', '*Retroviridae', 'Streptomyces/enzymology', 'Transfection/*drug effects/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus', 'beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis']",1997/05/02 00:00,1997/05/02 00:01,['1997/05/02 00:00'],"['1997/05/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/02 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.18.11736 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)40510-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 May 2;272(18):11736-43. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.18.11736.,,,PMC1626586,,"['M01 RR000046/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'AR32666/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL07106/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL51818/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS9455'],,,,,,,

Once hospitalized, the course of her disease was very acute and severe, as is seen with angiocentric lymphoma. Based on histological features, this case was judged not to be angiocentric lymphoma; however, it may lie within the spectrum of angiocentric immunoproliferative lesions (AIL). The findings in this case strongly suggest that HTLV-1 can be a pathogenic factor in the expression of angiocentric and angiodestructive features in ATLL, as is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (1-4).

GATA-3 is found exclusively in T cells of hematopoietic lineage. To clarify whether these expression profiles are preserved or changed during the development of malignancies, we analyzed the expression of GATA factors in the blasts from leukemic children. A total of 18 myelogenous leukemia and 24 lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases were investigated. In the majority of the former cases, GATA-2 mRNA expression and the expression of CD34 and c-kit antigens on leukemic cells were demonstrated. In contrast, GATA-2 mRNA and c-kit antigen could not be detected in CD34-positive cells from ALL patients. GATA-3 mRNA was expressed in all T-ALL cases, but not in any precursor B-ALL. These findings suggest that down-regulation of GATA-2 and expression of GATA-3 are important events for the commitment of cells to lymphoid and T cell lineage, respectively. The expression profiles of GATA factors in leukemic cells are generally consistent with those in their normal counterparts, and thus provide a useful tool to determine the lineage commitment of unclassified leukemia.","['Minegishi, N', 'Morita, S', 'Minegishi, M', 'Tsuchiya, S', 'Konno, T', 'Hayashi, N', 'Yamamoto, M']","['Minegishi N', 'Morita S', 'Minegishi M', 'Tsuchiya S', 'Konno T', 'Hayashi N', 'Yamamoto M']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA3 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Trans-Activators/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0925571096005531 [pii]', '10.1016/s0925-5710(96)00553-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1997 Apr;65(3):239-49. doi: 10.1016/s0925-5710(96)00553-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, passage of the cell-free extract from the MQ-580 cells over Sephadex G-25 resulted in a 4.8-fold increase in specific activity over that of the wild-type cells. While the reductase activity in the cell-free extract from the MQ-580 cells did not show altered sensitivity to MAIQ, the reductase activity in the cell-free extract from the MQ-580 cells was much more sensitive to the effects of the iron-chelating agents Desferal and EDTA. The cell pellets from the MQ-580 cells were much darker in color than the pellets from the wild-type cells or hydroxyurea-resistant cells. The supernatant fraction from the MQ-580 cells after-SDS-PAGE showed the appearance of a strong Coomassie blue-staining band at 50 kDA that was not apparent in either the wild-type or hydroxyurea-resistant cells. This new resistant cell line offers an opportunity to explore differences in resistance mechanisms of drugs (e.g. MAIQ and hydroxyurea) that are directed at the same subunit of ribonucleotide reductase.","['Cory, A H', 'Sato, A', 'Thompson, D P', 'Cory, J G']","['Cory AH', 'Sato A', 'Thompson DP', 'Cory JG']","['Department of Biochemistry, East Carolina University School of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27858, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '59261-39-1 (4-methyl-5-amino-1-formylisoquinoline thiosemicarbazone)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1996;8(10-11):449-56.,,,,,['CA55540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

There are now a number of suitable assays available that focus on different histopathological forms of cancer and on different stages of carcinogenesis--induction, promotion, progression. In this review we discuss eight major systems in the context of this generalized carcinogenesis paradigm. Our aim is to bring together what is currently known about the biology of carcinogenesis in these systems in order to provide a context for evaluating EMF results as they become available. We also critically discuss EMF test results that have so far been obtained in the animal models reviewed. Most of the 19 completed studies identified were negative. However, suggestive positive results were reported in three promotion assays (in rat mammary gland, in rat liver, and in mouse skin), and in one multigeneration study in mice. Results in the rat liver assay and in the multigeneration study have only been reported in abstract form and cannot be adequately evaluated. Positive results reported in both the rat mammary gland and the mouse skin systems are of weak statistical significance and have not been independently replicated. However, it may be of interest that effects in both systems appear primarily to involve the progression stage of carcinogenesis. We suggest that more definitive conclusions as to the carcinogenic potential of EMF may require expanded test protocols that reinforce traditional carcinogenesis end points with biochemical or other parameters reflective of biological processes known to be associated with carcinogenesis in the different systems.","['McCann, J', 'Kavet, R', 'Rafferty, C N']","['McCann J', 'Kavet R', 'Rafferty CN']","['Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, California 94303, USA. 102733.2717@compuserve.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cocarcinogenesis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*etiology', 'Rats']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.97105s181 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1997 Feb;105 Suppl 1:81-103. doi: 10.1289/ehp.97105s181.,,248,PMC1470226,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LCR functions over a long distance on chromosome 11 to regulate transcription and replication of the beta-globin genes. To determine whether the HSs function independently or as an integrated unit, we analyzed the requirements for long-range transcriptional activation. If the HSs function independently, individual HSs would be expected to have long-range activity. In contrast, if long-range activity requires multiple HSs, individual HSs would have a limited functional distance. HS2, HS3, and a miniLCR containing multiple HSs, were separated from a gamma-globin promoter by fragments of phage lambda DNA. After stable transfection into K562 cells, HS2 had strong enhancer activity, but only when positioned close to the promoter. HS3 also had strong enhancer activity, although it was weaker than HS2 and more sensitive to the spacer DNA. The miniLCR had the strongest enhancer activity and functioned even at a distance of 7.3 kb. A model is proposed in which synergistic interactions between HSs confer long-range activation by creating a stable LCR nucleoprotein structure, which is competent for recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes. These enzymes would mediate the well-characterized activity of the LCR to modulate chromatin structure.","['Bresnick, E H', 'Tze, L']","['Bresnick EH', 'Tze L']","['University of Wisconsin Medical School, Department of Pharmacology, 387 Medical Science, 1300 University Avenue, Madison, WI 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Nucleoproteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Chromatin', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Models, Genetic', 'Multigene Family', 'Nucleoproteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/29 00:00,1997/04/29 00:01,['1997/04/29 00:00'],"['1997/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.94.9.4566 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Apr 29;94(9):4566-71. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.9.4566.,,,PMC20763,,"['R01 DK050107/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK050107/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK50107/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Angiogenesis, inflammation, and cancer invasion are linked to the overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which destroy the extracellular matrix. Therefore, the MMPs are promising targets for therapy. We have displayed epidermal growth factor (EGF) on retroviral vector particles as an MMP-cleavable amino-terminal extension of the 4070A murine leukemia virus (MLV) envelope glycoprotein. This was achieved by engineering an MMP-cleavage signal (PLGLWA) into the linker between the EGF domain and the 4070A SU. The chimeric envelope was expressed and incorporated into viral particles, and the EGF domain could be cleaved from the surface of the viral particles by gelatinase A (MMP-2). The MMP-sensitive vector and control MMP-insensitive vectors could bind, via their displayed EGF domains, to EGF receptors on A431 cells but were unable to infect them because the EGF receptor (EGFR) does not support postbinding steps required for retroviral entry. In the presence of exogenous MMPs, the infectivity of the MMP-sensitive vector, but not of the MMP-insensitive vectors, was restored on A431 cells, and this cleavage activation could be partially blocked by MMP inhibitors. Endogenous MMPs produced by EGFR-positive HT 1080 cells could selectively activate the MMP-sensitive vector giving rise to a titer that was 1,000-fold higher on HT 1080 cells than on MMP-negative A431 cells. Inhibitor studies and gelatin zymograms indicated that the membrane-associated MT-MMP expressed on the HT 1080 cells played an important role in cleavage activation of the vector. When presented simultaneously with both EGFR-positive cell lines A431 and HT 1080, the vector could efficiently discriminate between the two different cell types, infecting the MMP-positive HT 1080 cells in preference over the A431 cells.","['Peng, K W', 'Morling, F J', 'Cosset, F L', 'Murphy, G', 'Russell, S J']","['Peng KW', 'Morling FJ', 'Cosset FL', 'Murphy G', 'Russell SJ']","['Cambridge Centre for Protein Engineering, Medical Research Council Centre, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '127497-59-0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 3.4.21.6 (Factor Xa)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Gelatinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Factor Xa/metabolism', 'Gelatinases/metabolism', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Engineering', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2', 'Metalloendopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Protease Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Retroviridae', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",1997/04/10 00:00,1997/04/10 00:01,['1997/04/10 00:00'],"['1997/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1997.8.6-729 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1997 Apr 10;8(6):729-38. doi: 10.1089/hum.1997.8.6-729.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the possibility that a newly expressed guanylyl cyclase may be responsible for the increase of plasma cyclic GMP levels patients with acute and chronic leukemia as well as patients with lymphoma and healthy volunteers were studied. Plasma levels of cyclic GMP were measured and isolated peripheral blood mononuclear or bone marrow cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of ANP. The stimulation of cells was measured as cGMP accumulation in the supernatant. Furthermore guanylyl cyclase activity was measured in membrane preparations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

Cyclic GMP in the supernatant of cells was elevated between 2- and 132-fold of basal when cells were incubated with 1 microM ANP for 60 minutes. Like in healthy volunteers, no effect of ANP on freshly isolated mononuclear cells was observed in cases with chronic leukemia or in patients with lymphoma.

Thus, the incompletely inducible expression of DRB1 gene products was responsible for the limited accumulation of normally assembled molecules for cell surface expression and the lack of serological determination.","['Nakatsuji, T']",['Nakatsuji T'],"['Department of Marine Biological Science, Tokai University Graduate School of Marine Science and Technology, Shizuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Cell Struct Funct,Cell structure and function,7608465,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR alpha-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DRB1 Chains)']",IM,"['Dimerization', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Eosinophils/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*genetics/metabolism', 'HLA-DR alpha-Chains', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia, Eosinophilic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1247/csf.22.15 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Struct Funct. 1997 Feb;22(1):15-20. doi: 10.1247/csf.22.15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemical study using monoclonal anti-PVC441 antibody revealed that in the central nervous system endothelial cells but not neuronal or glial cells were infected with PVC441 virus. The major pathological changes were myelin vacuolation and oligodendrocyte degeneration in the white matter at the white-gray border zone. Anterior and lateral funiculi and intercalated myelin of anterior horns were dominantly affected in the spinal cord from the sacral to cervical level. The midbrain was also vacuolated. An ultrastructural study demonstrated that many viral particles were present outside the endothelial cells but only sparsely inside endothelial cells and pericytes. Endothelial cell membranes and tight junctions were also disrupted. Immunohistochemical studies with antibodies against major histo-compatibility complex class Ia, intercellular adhesion molecule-I, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament protein, CD3 and OX42 revealed the presence of abundant microglia but not of lymphocytes or polymorphonuclear cells in the lesions. Axonal degeneration and astrogliosis were mild in degree. These pathological changes explain the observed spastic paraparesis in the rats, and represent a good model of spongiform diseases of the human central nervous system of retroviral origin, such as human T cell leukemia virus-associated myelopathy and AIDS.","['Saida, K', 'Saida, T', 'Kai, K', 'Iwamura, K']","['Saida K', 'Saida T', 'Kai K', 'Iwamura K']","['Utano National Hospital, Department of Neurology and Clinical Research Center, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Acta Neuropathol,Acta neuropathologica,0412041,,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/metabolism/*pathology/*virology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/*pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Retroviridae Infections/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/metabolism/*pathology', 'Vacuoles/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Virion/ultrastructure']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004010050628 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Neuropathol. 1997 Apr;93(4):369-78. doi: 10.1007/s004010050628.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The factors that control the cellular entry and subcellular distribution of etoposide remain poorly understood. Therefore, we have synthesized a novel fluorescence-labeled etoposide (Bodipyetoposide) by coupling 4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a, 4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-propionylethylenediamine (Bodipy) to 4'-benzyloxycarbonyl-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin beta-D-glucopyranoside, a precursor of etoposide. Bodipy-etoposide retained the ability to stabilize topo II-DNA covalent complexes in isolated nuclei, although it was significantly less potent and efficacious than etoposide. The growth inhibitory activity of Bodipy-etoposide was also approximately 200-fold less than that of etoposide in human leukemia K562 and DU-145 prostatic carcinoma cells. Nonetheless, etoposide-resistant K/VP.5 and K/VP.5-1 leukemia cells were cross-resistant to Bodipy-etoposide compared with parental K562 cells. Analysis by flow cytometry revealed a concentration-dependent Bodipy-etoposide cell association with no significant difference in drug association in the etoposide-resistant cell lines relative to the parental K562 cells. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy, we found significant cytoplasmic perinuclear localization of Bodipy-etoposide. Thus, Bodipy-etoposide displays promise as a tool to probe the factors controlling entry and subcellular distribution of etoposide-like compounds in live cells.","['Lazo, J S', 'Li, T', 'Woo, E S', 'Settineri, C E', 'Allan, W P', 'Yalowich, J C']","['Lazo JS', 'Li T', 'Woo ES', 'Settineri CE', 'Allan WP', 'Yalowich JC']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA. lazo@pop.pitt.edu or yalowich+@pitt.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BODIPY-etoposide)', '0 (Boron Compounds)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Boron Compounds/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/03/07 00:00,1997/03/07 00:01,['1997/03/07 00:00'],"['1997/03/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/07 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(96)00906-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(96)00906-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1997 Mar 7;53(5):715-22. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(96)00906-9.,,,,,"['CA61299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA62781/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The novel derivatives exhibit DNA-affinity and redox properties similar to the parent drug. However, unlike MX, they are not able to stimulate DNA cleavage, as shown by alkaline elution experiments. Molecular modeling studies using ab initio quantum mechanical methods show that, while the stereochemistry of the drug molecule is not appreciably affected when an amide group replaces the aromatic amino function, the reverse is true for the electrostatic properties. Indeed, overlapping of electron density of MX with its analogs is very poor. Moreover, a reversal in the direction of MX dipole moment occurs in the amido congeners. This may explain the lack of recognition of the cleavable topoisomerase II-DNA complex and loss of cleavage stimulation. However, the new derivatives exhibit pharmacological activity comparable to that found for MX, as they are remarkably cytotoxic and are active in vivo against P388 murine leukemia. Hence, amido substitution may lead to a different mechanism of cytotoxicity, not related to classical protein or free radical-mediated DNA damage, which points to a novel type of antineoplastic pharmacophore.","['Zagotto, G', 'Moro, S', 'Uriarte, E', 'Ferrazzi, E', 'Palu, G', 'Palumbo, M']","['Zagotto G', 'Moro S', 'Uriarte E', 'Ferrazzi E', 'Palu G', 'Palumbo M']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Electrochemistry', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mitoxantrone/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1997 Mar;12(2):99-112.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The GEA compounds (10-50 microM) induced rapid surface changes, which progressed as peculiar deep indentations and strictures in human leukemic T cells (MOLT-3) in 30 min. An excess of red cells partially prevented these surface changes. GEA 3162-treated MOLT-3 cells became permeable to ethidium bromide and lost their ability to be stained by acridine orange after 5 h of exposure. GEA 3162 and GEA 3175 suppressed thymidine and uridine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner, reflecting the inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis respectively. In addition, the GEA compounds inhibited the growth of human bone marrow stem cells, CFU-GM colonies being more susceptible to the cytostatic action than BFU-E. The reference compound SIN-1 had comparative cytostatic effects at ten times greater concentrations (500 microM).

The incidence of DIC was high in acute promyelocytic leukemia, fulminant hepatitis, abruptio placentae, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and sepsis. In cases of DIC, bleeding tendency due to consumption coagulopathy is most important, but organ dysfunction due to circulatory disturbances by development of multiple thrombi is also noteworthy. As a whole, DIC may be divided in two types. The first type is cases of DIC with severe bleeding symptoms. However, except cerebral hemorrhage, organ dysfunction is rare in these cases. These cases may be called as ""fibrinolysis-dominant DIC"", because hemostatic thrombi as well as thrombi which cause organ dysfunction by circulatory disturbances are rapidly removed by abnormally enhanced fibrinolysis. The second type involves cases of DIC with severe organ dysfunction. Bleeding symptoms in these cases are usually not severe. These cases may be called as ""coagulation-dominant DIC"". The most typical causative disease of the fibrinolysis-dominant DIC is acute promyelocytic leukemia. The most typical causative disease of the coagulation-dominant DIC is sepsis. The presence of causative disease of DIC, elevation of FDP, and depletion of platelet count are most important to diagnose DIC. In the treatment of DIC, removal of cause of DIC, administration of heparin to protect further development of multiple thrombi, and replacement of platelets in cases of acute leukemia are most important.","['Matsuda, T']",['Matsuda T'],"['Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine (III), Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Pol J Pharmacol,Polish journal of pharmacology,9313882,"['0 (Antithrombins)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)']",IM,"['Antithrombins/therapeutic use', '*Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/blood/drug therapy/etiology', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Heparin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications', 'Sepsis/complications']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pol J Pharmacol. 1996 Jan-Feb;48(1):73-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four antitumoral drugs currently used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia were studied in vitro: DNR, IDR, MITO and Ara-C. Our results show a dissociation between the cytostatic effect (the block in the cell cycle observed for low drug concentrations) and the cytotoxic effect (the induction of apoptosis induced by higher concentrations) for all the tested molecules. Low concentrations of Ara-C induced a block in the S phase while higher concentrations (>10(-7) M) induced apoptosis at the G1-S boundary. Low concentrations of anthracyclines (<40 nM DNR and <20nM IDR) induced a block in G2 without apoptosis. Apoptosis was induced in G1 and/or early S phases by higher concentrations of anthracyclines. The concentration inducing 50% apoptosis (IC50) was found to be, respectively, 200 and 40 nM for DNR and IDR. Analysis of MITO-treated cells showed a parallel increase in the percentages of S phase and apoptotic cells. However, the bivariate analysis showed that apoptosis did occur in a population with G1 DNA content. For two other drugs (CAM and COLC), apoptosis occurred for the same concentrations and in the same phase as the block (in S and G2M, respectively). The IC50 of MITO was found to be 100 nM. Cotreatment of the cells with colchicin and either Ara-C or IDR showed that the passage through mitosis was not necessary for the completion of apoptosis at the G1-S boundary. Short incubations of U937 cells with high concentrations of anthracyclines were found to be efficient in inducing further apoptosis. We conclude that, for all the assayed molecules, the cytotoxic and/or cytostatic effects of the antitumoral drugs tested greatly depend on the concentrations used and that, depending on their in vivo pharmacokinetics, the induction of apoptosis could be an important mechanism of action for some of these drugs.","['Vial, J P', 'Belloc, F', 'Dumain, P', 'Besnard, S', 'Lacombe, F', 'Boisseau, M R', 'Reiffers, J', 'Bernard, P']","['Vial JP', 'Belloc F', 'Dumain P', 'Besnard S', 'Lacombe F', 'Boisseau MR', 'Reiffers J', 'Bernard P']","[""Laboratoire Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite de Bordeaux II, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212696001026 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00102-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 Feb;21(2):163-72. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00102-6.,['Leuk Res. 1998 Jun;22(6):561.

On the other hand, it remains unclear whether IL-3 also promotes the maturation of megakaryocytes. In this report, we investigated the effects of IL-3 on megakaryocyte maturation in vitro using the human megakaryocytic cell line, CMK, which excludes the influence of bone marrow accessory cells. CMK cells were incubated both with and without 2-50 U/ml of recombinant human IL-3 (rhIL-3) and then analyzed for the effects on proliferation, cell size, DNA ploidy and the expression of platelet glycoproteins. We initially confirmed that CMK cells express IL-3 receptors (IL-3R) on the surface, and rhIL-3 stimulates the proliferation of CMK cells, showing their IL-3R function normally. With addition of rhIL-3 to the CMK cell culture system, increments in cell size, a significant shift toward high ploidy classes, and an increased expression of platelet glycoproteins CD29, CD41, CD42a, CD42b and CDw49f were newly observed. These findings suggest that rhIL-3 acts directly on human megakaryocytes and has the ability to directly promote both proliferation and maturation of megakaryocytes, without the help of accessory cells. Furthermore, rhIL-3 induced/enhanced the expression of mRNA for granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in CMK cells. Therefore, the effects of rhIL-3 on the maturation of megakaryocytic cell lines demonstrated in this study may be partly mediated by the action of cytokines such as LIF and GM-CSF, which are induced by IL-3 in the megakaryocytic cell line.","['Hagiwara, S', 'Sato, T', 'Itoh, Y']","['Hagiwara S', 'Sato T', 'Itoh Y']","['Pharmacology Department, Tsukuba Research Institute, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'DNA/drug effects/genetics', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Ploidies', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212696000835 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00083-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 Feb;21(2):153-62. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00083-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These drug-resistant CEM-VLB cells, which have increased expressions of mdr1 and P-glycoprotein, displayed p53 and mdm2 protein expressions similar to those observed in their sensitive CCRF-CEM counterparts. Treatment of these drug-resistant cells with non-toxic doses of the resistance-inducing drug vinblastin induced a strong increase in p53 protein and mRNA but was ineffective on mdm2 protein expression, or mdr1 mRNA expression. These data indicate that mutant p53 protein was not overexpressed in these MDR cells.

The complex formed with their specific receptors associates with a common transducing gp130 membrane protein (gp130) resulting in the formation of high avidity receptor and activation of tyrosine kinases. With the view of identifying gp130 domains specifically involved in IL-6 signalling, the authors prepared 37 new anti-gp130 mAb and analysed the structure-function relationship of the molecule. By cross-competition ELISA, the mAb were classified in 10 subgroups called A to J. By ELISA and BIAcore analysis, the mAb were found to recognize at least 18 antigenic specificities of the gp130 chain. The mAb reacted against the soluble and the membrane forms of gp130 as well. Their ability to inhibit the proliferation of the human myeloma cell line XG-4 of which the growth is strictly dependent on the presence of either exogenous IL-6, or LIF, or OM, or CNTF was studied. Besides mAb with no evident neutralizing effect (G and H) and mAb which neutralized equally well the activity of all tested cytokines (all mAb of groups A, I and J), some showed a selective effect. Those of group F inhibited also the proliferation induced by the 4 cytokines, but more specifically that dependent on the CNTF. mAb of groups B and E specifically inhibited the growth induced by IL-6, whereas those of group C inhibited that induced by LIF and OM. These results show the presence of different gp130 epitopes specifically involved in the signaling induced by the cytokines of the gp130 family. In ELISA, only mAb of group B and E were found to inhibit the binding of the IL-6-IL-6R complex to gp130, showing that they identified one or two domains of gp130 involved in its interaction with the IL-6-IL-6R complex.

Curcumin, a potent inhibitor of tumor promotion and of tumor cell growth, has also been shown to have antioxidant properties and to inhibit NF-kappa b. to ascertain whether curcumin would also enhance the differentiation of HL-60 leukemia cells produced by vitamin D3, presumably by interfering with NF- kappa B activity, the effects of curcumin on the differentiation of HL-60 cells produced by low levels of vitamin D3 were measured. Curcumin used alone did not produce a significant degree of differentiation of HL-60 cells; however, this agent markedly enhanced the expression of differentiation markers induced by low levels of vitamin D3. Curcumin also increased the differentiation of HL-60 cells when combined with vitamin D analogues (1,25-dihydroxy-16-ene-23-yne vitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxy-16-ene vitamin D3) that share the receptor binding properties of vitamin D3, whereas as vitamin D analogue (1,25-dihydroxy-16,23-diene vitamin D3) that caused significant calcium mobilization, but was less effective than vitamin d3 in binding the receptor, did not cause the differentiation of HL-60 cells in the presence or absence of curcumin. Several dietary compounds structurally related to curcumin (i.e., caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and ferulic acid) did not increase the differentiation of HL-60 cells produced by vitamin D3. However, the more lipophilic ethyl of ferulic and caffeic acid were capable of inducing the differentiation of HL-60 cells, as well as enhancing the maturation produced by vitamin D3. Curcumin caused a marked reduction in NF-kappa B activity in nuclear extracts of HL-60 cells exposed to this agent in the presence or absence of vitamin D3, supporting the possibility that NF-kappa B may be a factor in the regulation of the state of differentiation of leukemia cells.","['Sokoloski, J A', 'Shyam, K', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Sokoloski JA', 'Shyam K', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Caffeic Acids)', '0 (Coumaric Acids)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '318ADP12RI (Chlorogenic Acid)', 'AVM951ZWST (ferulic acid)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'U2S3A33KVM (caffeic acid)']",IM,"['Caffeic Acids/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chlorogenic Acid/pharmacology', 'Coumaric Acids/pharmacology', 'Curcumin/*administration & dosage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1997;9(1):31-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell morphology and flow cytometric studies (with the monocytic surface antigen CD14) indicated that combinations of RA and curcumin stimulated differentiation predominantly to granulocytes whereas combinations of vitamin D3 and curcumin stimulated differentiation predominantly to monocytes. Studies on cell cycle kinetics indicated that treatment of HL-60 cells with a combination of RA and curcumin for 48 or 96 h reduced the proportion of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle and increased the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle to a greater extent than occurred for cells treated with either compound alone.

Combinations of RA and curcumin or vitamin D3 and curcumin inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells to a greater extent than was observed for either compound alone.

MC540 is currently undergoing phase I clinical testing for the extracorporeal purging of autologous bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells. We report here that performing MC540-mediated PDT at 4.7 degrees C (hypothermia) instead of at ambient temperature enhanced the photoinactivation of L1210 cells and CFU-GM but left the photoinactivation of K562 cells unchanged. Hypothermia reduced dye binding in K562 but not in L1210 cells, whereas the photogeneration of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) was affected in neither cell line. Post-PDT incubation at 4 degrees C delayed the decay of LOOH and enhanced the photoinactivation of CFU-GM as well as L1210 and K562 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that hypothermia interfered with the repair of potentially lethal photodynamic damage.

Cellular components are dismantled within the confines of an intact cell membrane, and rapid ingestion by phagocytic cells prevents local inflammation. A variety of genes have now been identified as positive or negative regulators of apoptosis. Transfection experiments and studies of gene cooperation in viral transformation suggest that full cellular transformation requires not only the deregulation of proliferation, but also the inhibition of concomitant apoptosis programs. The regulation of apoptosis is fundamental to hematopoietic homeostasis. Stem cell renewal is continuously counterbalanced by apoptosis in functionally inactive or terminally differentiated cells. Extensive cell death in developing lymphocyte populations ensures that only cells recognizing non-self antigens are released into the periphery, and the finite lifespan of terminally differentiated cells enables the extensive cell turnover demanded by functional aspects of the hematopoietic system. The requirement of each hematopoietic sub-population for a specific sub-set of survival factors, provides a flexible mechanism for dictating the cellular composition of the mature population and for controlling population size. Surplus cell production and apoptosis are therefore normal features of hematopoiesis. The consequences of deregulated apoptosis are severe. Excessive apoptosis in lymphocyte populations plays a major role in the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), whereas ineffective apoptosis has been associated with the development of inflammation, autoimmunity and hematological malignancies. The identification of various genetic abnormalities which influence apoptosis in leukaemic cells (e.g., mutant p53, Bcr-Abl and over-expression of Bcl-2), suggests that the acquisition of an anti-apoptotic lesions is an important event in the multi-step evolution of hematological malignancies. In addition, the nature of some leukaemias particularly the chronic leukemias, in which the leukemic cells are nonproliferative and long lived, suggests that anti-apoptotic lesions are early events in the pathogenesis of these diseases. It is likely that the utilization of mechanisms to evade apoptosis would facilitate disease progression in all leukemias and contribute to the development of multi-drug resistance. A better understanding of apoptosis mechanisms in hematopoietic cells, and their exploitation by leukemic cells should be useful in the development of improved cytotoxic regimes.","['McKenna, S L', 'Cotter, T G']","['McKenna SL', 'Cotter TG']","['Department of Biochemistry, University College, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Adv Cancer Res,Advances in cancer research,0370416,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/physiopathology', '*Apoptosis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/physiology', 'Forecasting', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Genes, myc', 'Genes, p53', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/physiopathology', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/pathology', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0065-230X(08)60098-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0065-230x(08)60098-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Cancer Res. 1997;71:121-64. doi: 10.1016/s0065-230x(08)60098-6.,,284,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemogenesis is modeled as transformation of target stem cells that initially grow rapidly in the embryo but plateau and then decline in postnatal childhood. Inheritance of the first of two leukemogenic mutations is allowed as a possibility in a small minority of leukemic patients who would characteristically develop leukemia at an early age. The model is shown to be capable of providing good fits to incidence data for childhood ALL; these fits allow estimation of some parameters of the model. The analysis shows that individuals inheriting one of the two mutations necessary for ALL would be likely to experience ""multiclonal leukemogenesis""; that is, the parallel development of several leukemic clones arising from multiple independent leukemic events. The model suggests that between two and ten such clones would typically have developed in such individuals by the time of diagnosis. The main conclusions of the deterministic investigation were confirmed by stochastic modeling. The existence of multiclonal leukemogenesis is in principle testable by molecular biological methods (clonality analysis) that rely on the random inactivation of one of two X-chromosomes in normal female subjects. It is expected that the mathematical methods developed here will also be useful for more general (N-stage) models of malignant transformation of stem cell populations undergoing growth or decline.","['Wheldon, E G', 'Lindsay, K A', 'Wheldon, T E', 'Mao, J H']","['Wheldon EG', 'Lindsay KA', 'Wheldon TE', 'Mao JH']","['Department of Mathematics, University of Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Math Biosci,Mathematical biosciences,0103146,,IM,"['Aging', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Genetic', '*Models, Theoretical', '*Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Sex Factors', 'Stochastic Processes']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0025556496001368 [pii]', '10.1016/s0025-5564(96)00136-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Math Biosci. 1997 Jan 1;139(1):1-24. doi: 10.1016/s0025-5564(96)00136-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here by mobility-shift assay that E2F-containing DNA-binding complexes were detected in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and leukemic cells obtained from ATL patients but not in an uninfected T-cell line, Jurkat, and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The Tax protein, encoded by HTLV-I, is a potent transcription activator of viral and several cellular genes. We demonstrate that expression of Tax can induce the E2F-containing DNA-binding complexes in Jurkat T cells. Thus, Tax, through enhancement of the DNA-binding activity of E2F, may be capable of regulating cellular gene expression implicated in the proliferation and transformation of T cells in ATL.

Two cytoplasmic variants, A and B, have been identified for each of these alpha subunits, although the alpha 3B splice variant has been detected only at the mRNA level. We prepared a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for the A and B variants of the alpha 3 subunit to study their tissue distribution. Four monoclonal antibodies react with alpha 3A, one of which recognizes only the nonphosphorylated form; of the three anti-alpha 3B antibodies, one cross-reacts with alpha 6B. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of various human tissues revealed the presence of alpha 3B mRNA in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. Moreover, the alpha 3B protein was detected by immunoblotting in brain and heart tissue but not in skeletal muscle. In contrast, alpha 3A mRNA and protein were present in all tissues studied. Thus, the expression of alpha 3B in adult tissues is more restricted than that of alpha 3A. Immunohistochemical studies showed that in brain tissue, both variants are exclusively expressed on small blood-vessel endothelium, whereas in heart tissue their distribution patterns differ markedly. Although alpha 3A is strongly expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells, alpha 3B is detected only on endothelial cells of veins. Expression of the two variant forms of alpha 3 in K562 cells revealed that the ligand-binding specificities of alpha 3A beta 1 and alpha 3B beta 1 are identical: both bind human laminin-2 and -4, laminin-5, and laminins isolated from bovine kidney, but not bovine laminin-2 and -4, mouse laminin-1, or human fibronectin. In addition, adhesion mediated by both integrins is induced to the same extent by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The alpha 3A, but not the alpha 3B subunit, is phosphorylated; and phosphorylation of alpha 3A increases after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation.

Thus the concept has evolved that it might be autoimmune. OBJECTIVE: We have prospectively assessed sera obtained from 50 consecutive patients with chronic urticaria for the presence of autoantibodies that could be pathogenic. METHODS: We tested sera for their ability to release histamine from human basophils and to activate rat basophil leukemia cells that were transfected with the alpha subunit of the IgE receptor. We also tested selected sera for anti-IgE antibodies and for IgG anti-Fc epsilon RI alpha by Western blot. RESULTS: Sera from 38 of 50 patients with chronic urticaria released beta-hexosaminidase from transfected rat basophil leukemia cells, whereas only one of 20 control sera did so (p < 0.001); in 30 subjects this could be attributed to IgG anti- Fc epsilon RI alpha. When human basophils were used, sera from 20 of 50 patients with chronic urticaria released a significant quantity of histamine compared with one of 20 control subjects (p < 0.01). Six patients with chronic urticaria and one control subject had IgG anti-IgE. In selected sera we could demonstrate IgG anti-Fc epsilon RI alpha by Western blot; however, some sera are positive for histamine release but do not demonstrate such binding. CONCLUSION: A large fraction of patients with chronic urticaria have antibody directed to Fc epsilon RI alpha that is functional (60%). A smaller number have IgG anti-IgE (10%). A third group may also have circulating factors capable of activating basophils or mast cells of which the identity is unknown. Thus chronic urticaria may be autoimmune in origin.","['Tong, L J', 'Balakrishnan, G', 'Kochan, J P', 'Kinet, J P', 'Kaplan, A P']","['Tong LJ', 'Balakrishnan G', 'Kochan JP', 'Kinet JP', 'Kaplan AP']","['Department of Medicine, State University of New York at Stony Brook 11794-8161, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*immunology', 'Autoimmunity', 'Basophils/immunology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Histamine Release/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Prospective Studies', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Urticaria/*immunology', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/blood']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0091-6749(97)70071-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0091-6749(97)70071-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 1997 Apr;99(4):461-5. doi: 10.1016/s0091-6749(97)70071-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to characterize the neurotoxicity of a peptide sequence derived from an animal retrovirus, the feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Using a peptide sequence from the subtype FeLV-C envelope protein variable region 5 (VR5), cytotoxicity was demonstrated in studies that evaluated neuronal survival, neurite outgrowth, and alterations in intracellular calcium ion concentration. The FeLV subtype isolate FeLV-CSarma possesses an envelope protein VR5 amino acid sequence that varies by four amino acids from the VR5 amino acid sequence of subtype FeLV-AGlasgow. The polypeptide representing the VR5 of FeLV-CSarma (FeLV-CVR5) is significantly more neurotoxic than the polypeptide sequence representing the VR5 of FeLV-AGlasgow (FeLV-AVR5). FeLV-CVR5 (> or = 3 microM) exposure resulted in significant dose-dependent neurotoxicity. Antibodies to FeLV-CVR5 blocked this effect. Neurite outgrowth was significantly reduced at all tested concentrations (3-12 microM) of FeLV-CVR5, with a 92% reduction in neurite length at 12 microM. FeLV-AVR5 was significantly less neurotoxic with respect to neurite outgrowth than was FeLV-CVR5. The significant reduction in neurotoxicity for FeLV-AVR5 illustrates the importance of the 4-amino-acid difference between it and FeLV-CVR5. Alterations in intracellular calcium ion concentration were associated with this neurotoxicity.","['Mitchell, T W', 'Rojko, J L', 'Hartke, J R', 'Mihajlov, A R', 'Kasameyer, G A', 'Gasper, P W', 'Whalen, L R']","['Mitchell TW', 'Rojko JL', 'Hartke JR', 'Mihajlov AR', 'Kasameyer GA', 'Gasper PW', 'Whalen LR']","['Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes and human retrovirology : official publication of the International Retrovirology Association,9501482,"['0 (Peptides)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp70, Feline leukemia virus)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Ganglia, Parasympathetic/cytology', 'Homeostasis', 'Neurons/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oculomotor Nerve/cytology', 'Peptides/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Time Factors', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00042560-199704010-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol. 1997 Apr 1;14(4):307-20. doi: 10.1097/00042560-199704010-00002.,,,,,"['K01 RR 00084/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS28510/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The basis for the molecular detection of clonal T cells is amplification of the V-(D)-N-J region of the TCR gene. We evaluated PCR amplification of the rearranged gamma TCR from genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood and subsequent polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in an automated DNA sequencer. We determined the sensitivity for the detection of clonal T cells and propose a standardized evaluation procedure for the electrophoretic profiles generated by the DNA sequencer. The sensitivity of our method was 0.6-1.25% of clonal T cells within a polyclonal background. Sixteen patients with T-cell malignancies, ten with acute inflammatory rheumatic diseases, and twelve healthy controls were examined. Among the systemic T-cell malignancies, all but one patient with T-PLL (8/ 9) revealed a clonal PCR signal. No clonal signal was detectable in any patient in clinical complete remission (5/5) or in either of the two patients with lymphomas limited to cutaneous sites. However, clonal T cells were detected in one patient with polymyalgia rheumatica and in one with reactive arthritis. A polyclonal signal was found in the remaining eight patients with acute inflammatory rheumatic diseases and in 12 healthy controls. Taking our results together, the PCR/PAGE assay is able to reliably distinguish clonal from polyclonal T-cell populations. However, although the sensitivity is limited to approximately 1%, clonal T cells can be found in the peripheral blood of some patients with autoimmune diseases and not only in T-cell malignancies.","['Witzens, M', 'Mohler, T', 'Willhauck, M', 'Scheibenbogen, C', 'Lee, K H', 'Keilholz, U']","['Witzens M', 'Mohler T', 'Willhauck M', 'Scheibenbogen C', 'Lee KH', 'Keilholz U']","['Department of Internal Medicine V (Hematology, Oncology, Rheumatology), University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arthritis, Reactive/blood/genetics', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/blood/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/blood/genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*blood/*genetics', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/blood/genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*blood/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/blood/genetics', 'Panniculitis/blood/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymyalgia Rheumatica/blood/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics', 'Rheumatic Diseases/*blood/*genetics', 'Sezary Syndrome/blood/genetics']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050269 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1997 Mar;74(3):123-30. doi: 10.1007/s002770050269.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We treated 12 patients with an outpatient low-dose chemotherapy regimen consisting of Ara-C 100 mg subcutaneously on day 1, and 6-thioguanine 80 mg orally on days 2-5, repeated every week. Nine patients had MDS, six RAEB-T, and three RAEB (median age 57 years) and three had de novo AML (median age 73 years). All patients were transfusion dependent.

From 1972 to 1992, 1045 patients with HD were assessed and treated at the Department of Radiation Oncology, the Institute of Radiology, and the Department of Human Biopathology, Hematology Section, University of Rome ""La Sapienza"". The average follow-up was 72 months. For a more accurate calculation of the risk of ANLL occurrence, the patients were first divided into three subgroups according to initial treatment and then according to the total treatment they had received. Moreover, to establish the probable connection between leukemia and splenic treatment the patients were also divided into three subgroups (splenectomy, splenic irradiation, and no splenectomy/no splenic irradiation). Sixteen cases of ANLL were recorded, giving an overall risk of 0.2% at 5 years and 3.4% at 20 years. In 12 patients overt leukemia was preceded by a myelodys-plastic syndrome. Five cases had evaluable chromosome analysis. Clonal chromosome abnormalities were demonstrated in two patients, whereas three patients showed an apparently normal karyotype. Bone marrow agar cultures were analyzed in two patients and were abnormal in both cases. In the radiotherapy (RT) group, the cumulative risk was 0.4% at 10 years and 3.2% at 15 and 20 years: in the chemotherapy (CT) group it was 1.2% at 10, 15, and 20 years; in the combined group it was 3.7% at 10 years and 4.9% at 15 and 20 years. In the multivariate analysis, MOPP treatment with or without RT is a statistically significant variable for ANLL occurrence (p = 0.009). This study demonstrates that splenic treatment does not lead to ANLL. Treatment with MOPP alone and with MOPP plus RT can increase the risk of ANLL.","['Maurizi Enrici, R', 'Anselmo, A P', 'Osti, M F', 'Santoro, M', 'Sbarbati, S', 'Tombolini, V', 'Mandelli, F', ""D'Arcangelo, E"", 'Biagini, C']","['Maurizi Enrici R', 'Anselmo AP', 'Osti MF', 'Santoro M', 'Sbarbati S', 'Tombolini V', 'Mandelli F', ""D'Arcangelo E"", 'Biagini C']","['Chair of Radiation Oncology, Hospital S.

L. Condorelli, L. Vitelli, M. Valtieri, I. Marta, E. Montesoro, V. Lulli, R. Baer, and C. Peschle, Blood 86:164-175, 1995). We show that in late myeloid progenitors (the phenotypically normal murine 32D cell line) and early leukemic precursors (the human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line) ectopic tal-1 expression induces (i) a proliferative effect under suboptimal culture conditions (i.e., low growth factor and serum concentrations respectively), via an antiapoptotic effect in 32D cells or increased DNA synthesis in HL-60 cells, and (ii) a total or marked inhibitory effect on differentiation, respectively, on granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced granulopoiesis in 32D cells or retinoic acid- and vitamin D3-induced granulo- and monocytopoiesis in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, experiments with 32D temperature-sensitive p53 cells indicate that aberrant tal-1 expression at the permissive temperature does not exert a proliferative effect but causes p53-mediated apoptosis, i.e., the tal-1 proliferative effect depends on the integrity of the cell cycle checkpoints of the host cell, as observed for c-myc and other oncogenes. tal-1 mutant experiments indicate that ectopic tal-1 effects are mediated by both the DNA-binding and the heterodimerization domains, while the N-terminally truncated tal-1 variant (M3) expressed in T-ALL malignant cells mimics the effects of the wild-type protein. Altogether, our results (i) indicate proliferative and antidifferentiative effects of ectopic tal-1 expression, (ii) shed light on the underlying mechanisms (i.e., requirement for the integrity of the tal-1 bHLH domain and cell cycle checkpoints in the host cell, particularly p53), and (iii) provide new experimental models to further investigate these mechanisms.","['Condorelli, G L', 'Tocci, A', 'Botta, R', 'Facchiano, F', 'Testa, U', 'Vitelli, L', 'Valtieri, M', 'Croce, C M', 'Peschle, C']","['Condorelli GL', 'Tocci A', 'Botta R', 'Facchiano F', 'Testa U', 'Vitelli L', 'Valtieri M', 'Croce CM', 'Peschle C']","['Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107-5541, USA. condore1@jeflin.tju.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.17.5.2954 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 May;17(5):2954-69. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.5.2954.,,,PMC232147,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line, CMK, that showed some degree of megakaryocytic differentiation after culture with TPO, the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21(WAF1/Cip1), but not p27(Kip1), p16(INK4A), p15(INK4B), or p18(INK4C), was found to be upregulated in an immediately early response to TPO. The expression of p21 was found to be sustained over a period of 5 days by treatment with TPO in large polyploid cells that developed in response to TPO, but not in small undifferentiated cells, indicating a close correlation between the ligand-induced differentiation and p21 induction in CMK cells. To examine potential roles of Cdk inhibitors in megakaryocytic differentiation, CMK cells were transfected with the p21, p27, or p16 gene, together with a marker gene, beta-galactosidase, and were cultured with medium alone for 5 days. The ectopic expression of p21 or p27 but not of p16 led to induction of megakaryocytic differentiation of CMK cells. Overexpression of the N-terminal domain (amino acids [aa] 1 to 75) of p21 was sufficient to induce megakaryocytic differentiation, whereas that of the C-terminal domain (aa 76 to 164) had little or no effect on morphological features. Furthermore, we found that although TPO induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT3 and STAT5 in CMK cells, only STAT5 showed binding activities to potential STAT-binding sites that locate in the promoter region of p21 gene (p21-SIE sites), thereby leading to transactivation of p21. These results suggested that p21 induction, possibly mediated through activated STAT5, could play an important role in TPO-induced megakaryocytic differentiation.","['Matsumura, I', 'Ishikawa, J', 'Nakajima, K', 'Oritani, K', 'Tomiyama, Y', 'Miyagawa, J', 'Kato, T', 'Miyazaki, H', 'Matsuzawa, Y', 'Kanakura, Y']","['Matsumura I', 'Ishikawa J', 'Nakajima K', 'Oritani K', 'Tomiyama Y', 'Miyagawa J', 'Kato T', 'Miyazaki H', 'Matsuzawa Y', 'Kanakura Y']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka University Medical School, Suita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (CDKN2C protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', '*Milk Proteins', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.17.5.2933 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 May;17(5):2933-43. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.5.2933.,,,PMC232145,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because expression of the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kappaB is sensitive to the redox state in eukaryotic cells, the DNA binding activity of AP-1 and NF-kappaB was examined in HL-60 promyeloid leukemia cells exposed to trans,trans-muconaldehyde, a microsomal hematotoxic metabolite of benzene. There was little AP-1 binding activity in nuclear extracts from control HL-60 cells based on electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Exposure to 0.1 microM MUC for 4 h resulted in significantly increased levels of nuclear protein with high sequence specificity for the consensus AP-1 sequence. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed a strong increase in the binding of a factor to the NF-kappaB site. The latter was highest in nuclear extracts from HL-60 cells treated with 1.0 microM muconaldehyde and cultured for 4 h. Exposure of HL-60 cells to muconaldehyde resulted in an increase in c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels. Western blot analysis showed that the protein levels of c-jun increased in HL-60 cells treated with 1 microM muconaldehyde and cultured for 4-6 h and subsequently decreased gradually. Increased AP-1 binding was observed in bone marrow cells from B6C3F1 mice 2 h after administration of 440 mg/kg benzene.

In our earlier studies, we have shown that transcripts for Fc gammaRII and Fc gammaRIII are lowered in CML granulocytes, while no such trend was seen for CD11b, CD18 and actin, the other molecules involved in this process. We have also shown by flow cytometry that the number of granulocytes expressing the Fc receptors on their surface is lowered in CML patients. In this report, we show that the lowered steady state level of the mRNA for the Fc receptors is due to their faster degradation and not due to any defect in transcription. A study of the expression of mRNA for Fc gammaRIII in morphologically mature CML granulocytes by in situ hybridization showed that there is heterogeneity in the expression of this receptor, with some cells positive for the message and some not. These results suggest that the Fc gammaRIII transcript reaches a stable RNA pool in only some of the granulocytes, whereas in the rest of the cells, it is probably degraded after it is transcribed and is therefore not detected. The Fc gammaRIII is probably one of the first antigens to be lost from the leukemic granulocyte surface during the transition of the disease from the chronic phase to the accelerated phase and finally to the blast crisis.","['Kant, A M', 'Advani, S H', 'Zingde, S M']","['Kant AM', 'Advani SH', 'Zingde SM']","['Molecular Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research Institute, Parel, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*immunology', 'Mutation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, IgG/*genetics']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S014521269600118X [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00118-x [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 Mar;21(3):225-34. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00118-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated MRD in leukemia with TCR beta rearrangement by examining TCR beta-chain RNA. A complementary DNA (cDNA) corresponding to the variable region of the TCR beta-chains originating from the peripheral blood or bone marrow from four patients was amplified. Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of amplified cDNA showed that all four patients had monoclonal leukemia with TCR beta rearrangement; two patients had Vbeta2+ leukemia, another patient had Vbeta14+ leukemia and the other had Vbeta9+ leukemia. Flow cytometry supported this finding. Sequencing of the Vbeta2-complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3), Vbeta9-CDR3 and Vbeta14-CDR3 revealed monoclonality. To investigate MRD using TCR beta-chain RNA, cDNA from each patient was diluted with the cDNA of a healthy person and amplified using a specific CDR3 clonotype primer. A band in the ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel was detected from samples diluted 10,000-fold. SSCP analysis determined which V region gene was utilized in monoclonal leukemic cells. The leukemic cell specific TCR, determined in such a manner, may be a target for immunotherapy.

The translational products of this gene contain the basic domain helix-loop-helix motif characteristic of a family of transcription factors that bind to a consensus nucleotide sequence termed the E-box. Previous work established that the TAL1 proteins are phosphorylated exclusively on serine and identified Ser122 as a substrate for the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK-1. We provide evidence that an additional serine residue, Ser172, located in a conserved region proximal to the DNA binding domain and sharing homology with a similarly positioned sequence in the HLH oncoprotein LYL1, can be phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation was found to alter TAL1 DNA binding activity in a target-dependent manner that was influenced by both the specific CANNTG E-box core motif and its flanking sequences. In contrast, the ability of TAL1 to interact with the E2A gene product E12 and its subcellular localization in transfected COS cells were unaffected by Ser172 phosphorylation. These results suggest this serine residue has a regulatory function and indicate a mechanism by which phosphorylation could affect DNA binding site discrimination.","['Prasad, K S', 'Brandt, S J']","['Prasad KS', 'Brandt SJ']","['Department of Medicine,Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Lyl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Phosphopeptides/analysis', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Serine/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",1997/04/25 00:00,1997/04/25 00:01,['1997/04/25 00:00'],"['1997/04/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/25 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.17.11457 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)40661-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Apr 25;272(17):11457-62. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.17.11457.,,,,,['R29 HL49118/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike full-sized NOTCH1, two such truncated forms of the protein either lacking a major portion of the extracellular domain (DeltaE) or consisting only of the intracellular domain (ICN) were found to activate transcription in cultured cells, presumably through RBP-Jkappa response elements within DNA. Both truncated forms also bound to the transcription factor RBP-Jkappa in extracts prepared from human and murine T-ALL cell lines. Transcriptional activation required the presence of a weak RBP-Jkappa-binding site within the NOTCH1 ankyrin repeat region of the intracellular domain. Unexpectedly, a second, stronger RBP-Jkappa-binding site, which lies within the intracellular domain close to the transmembrane region and significantly augments association with RBP-Jkappa, was not needed for oncogenesis or for transcriptional activation. While ICN appeared primarily in the nucleus, DeltaE localized to cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes, suggesting that intranuclear localization is not essential for oncogenesis or transcriptional activation. In support of this interpretation, mutation of putative nuclear localization sequences decreased nuclear localization and increased transcriptional activation by membrane-bound DeltaE. Transcriptional activation by this mutant form of membrane-bound DeltaE was approximately equivalent to that produced by intranuclear ICN. These data are most consistent with NOTCH1 oncogenesis and transcriptional activation being independent of association with RBP-Jkappa at promoter sites.","['Aster, J C', 'Robertson, E S', 'Hasserjian, R P', 'Turner, J R', 'Kieff, E', 'Sklar, J']","['Aster JC', 'Robertson ES', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Turner JR', 'Kieff E', 'Sklar J']","['Departments of Pathology, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RBPJ protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ankyrin Repeat', 'Binding Sites', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptor, Notch1', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Sequence Deletion', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1997/04/25 00:00,1997/04/25 00:01,['1997/04/25 00:00'],"['1997/04/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/25 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.17.11336 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)40643-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Apr 25;272(17):11336-43. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.17.11336.,,,,,"['CA47006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA62450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66849/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Several evidences indicate that the expression of a mdr 1 gen, which codifies for P glycoprotein (PgP), contributes to this resistance in leukaemic cells. PgP functions as an energy-dependent efflux pump transporting a variety of unrelated drugs to the outside of the cells. It is possible to modulate this efflux using a number of drugs known as multidrug resistance (MDR) reversors or modulating agents. The present paper discusses some of the methods used for detecting the MDR phenotype, although the most reliable results are the ones that take into account an association of various methods. Despite the existence of disagreements regarding which method presents the greatest sensitivity or specificity the majority of authors agrees that the MDR phenotype, in isolation, affects the prognosis of leukaemias. The, coexpression of PgP with the molecule CD34 confers the worst prognosis in acute leukaemias. The authors demonstrate using cell cultures testing chemotherapeutic agents, alone or associated to modulating agents, that this line of research may allow in the future to elaborate an individualized clinical treatment.

Both presented with left testicular swelling and underwent orchiectomy, which revealed cream-colored to yellow-tan, rubbery-to-firm, testicular tumors with extensive paratesticular spread. The tumor in the younger patient was composed of a uniform population of primitive cells with scant cytoplasm and was initially misinterpreted as malignant lymphoma. Staging revealed no extrascrotal spread. The patient was treated with radiation and chemotherapy and remained free of disease for 12 years, at which time he died of unrelated causes. The older patient had a history of a myelodysplastic syndrome. His tumor contained cells with bright eosinophilic, occasionally granular cytoplasm, consistent with myeloid lineage. Because of a prominent component of myelocytes, with round, eccentric nuclei and moderately abundant cytoplasm, and because of an associated chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate that contained mature plasma cells, the tumor was initially misinterpreted as a plasmacytoma, although it was reinterpreted as a granulocytic sarcoma before initiation of therapy. Tumor cells in both cases were positive with a chloroacetate esterase stain. Immunohistochemical staining revealed expression of myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, leukocyte common antigen, and CD43, but not of B-cell-specific or T-cell-specific antigens in both cases. Granulocytic sarcomas are apt to be misinterpreted as other hematolymphoid tumors, which may result in a significant error in management. The diagnosis should at least be thought of any time the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma or plasmacytoma of the testis is being considered.","['Ferry, J A', 'Srigley, J R', 'Young, R H']","['Ferry JA', 'Srigley JR', 'Young RH']","['James Homer Wright Pathology Laboratories, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Testicular Neoplasms/diagnosis/metabolism/*pathology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1997 Apr;10(4):320-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

O13, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes CD99, the p30/32MIC2 gene product, has been used to identify a number of cell types, including lymphoblasts, in paraffin sections. To evaluate the usefulness of CD99 immunoreactivity in the diagnosis of leukemia cutis, we analyzed cases of cutaneous involvement by acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma and acute myelogenous leukemia for the presence of this marker. Without the use of antigen retrieval methods, lymphoblasts in cases of cutaneous involvement by acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma were immunoreactive for CD99 in 9 of 9 cases. Myeloblasts and early myeloid cells in cases of cutaneous involvement by acute myelogenous leukemia were immunoreactive for CD99 in 12 (80%) of 15 cases.

Because the distribution of 013 positivity in hematopoietic proliferations is similar to that of TdT, we hypothesized that 013 might correlate with TdT positivity. We studied 67 lymphoblastic lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leukemias, 6 chronic myelogenous leukemias in blast crisis, a variety of acute myeloid leukemias, 5 granulocytic sarcomas, and a spectrum of 94 diffuse lymphomas other than lymphoblastic type. With the use of heat-induced epitope retrieval and automated immunostaining, we compared the results obtained with 013 and TdT, a well-established marker of lymphoblastic lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leukemias that can also be successfully demonstrated in tissue sections by use of a similar technique. In our study, all of the 013-positive cases were also TdT positive. 013 reacted with 44 (71%) of 62 of the TdT-positive lymphoblastic lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leukemias cases studied. We also found 013 to be positive in one case of TdT-positive acute myeloid leukemia, in two cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis, and in three TdT-positive granulocytic sarcomas. 013 was negative in all of the other high-grade malignant lymphomas and in TdT-negative leukemias. With use of our technique, 013 positivity appears to be restricted to hematologic proliferations that demonstrate TdT positivity. 013 may be a helpful additional marker in the diagnosis of TdT-positive leukemias and lymphomas in conventionally processed tissue sections.","['Robertson, P B', 'Neiman, R S', 'Worapongpaiboon, S', 'John, K', 'Orazi, A']","['Robertson PB', 'Neiman RS', 'Worapongpaiboon S', 'John K', 'Orazi A']","['Division of Hematopathology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (12E7 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD99 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['12E7 Antigen', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*analysis', 'Child', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1997 Apr;10(4):277-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IL-6/IL-6R complexes associate with gp130, induce its dimerization and signal transduction. When IL-6 is complexed to IL-6R, two distinct sites of IL-6 are able to bind gp130. Other cytokines-oncostatin M (OM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) also use the gp130 transducer and induce its heterodimerization with LIF receptor (LIFR). A series of IL-6 mutants have been generated which function as IL-6 receptor antagonists (IL-6RA). These IL-6RA carried substitutions that increased their affinity with IL-6R and abolished 1 or the 2 sites of interaction with gp130. All the IL-6RA inhibited wild-type IL-6. The IL-6RA with one mutated binding site to gp130 inhibited IL-11 activity. They did not affect those of CNTF, LIF and OM, even when used at a very high concentration at which virtually all membrane IL-6R were bound to IL-6RA. IL-6RA with two mutated gp130 binding sites did not affect IL-11, CNTF, LIF or OM activities. The results indicate that the interaction of one gp130 chain with IL-6R/IL-6R complexes inhibited further the dimerization of gp130 induced by IL-11/IL-11R but not its heterodimerization with LIFR. Thus these IL-6RA can also function as IL-11 antagonists.","['Sun, R X', 'Gennaro, C', 'Rocco, S', 'Gu, Z J', 'Klein, B']","['Sun RX', 'Gennaro C', 'Rocco S', 'Gu ZJ', 'Klein B']","['Unit for Cellular Therapy, Hopital St. Eloi, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis/metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Interleukin-11/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 1997 Mar;8(1):51-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This weight loss is largely due to a reduction in food intake, but is also accompanied by inappropriately high rates of energy expenditure. Increases in resting oxygen consumption (VO2) of 25% to 35% above the levels of pair-fed animals were observed over the period of weight loss. The present study investigated the possible involvement of prostaglandins in the cachexia induced by T-cell leukemia in the rat. Acute systemic injection of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin 1 mg/kg or flurbiprofen 1 mg/kg intraperitoneally [IP]) significantly reduced (by 14% and 10%, respectively) the increase in metabolic rate and also reversed the elevated body temperature of leukemic animals. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of indomethacin (0.2 mg/kg) had only modest effects on the increase in temperature or hypermetabolism of leukemic animals. Long-term daily injection of indomethacin or flurbiprofen (1 mg/kg/d IP) had no significant effect on food intake or body weight of leukemic animals, and neither treatment significantly affected disease status. Indomethacin significantly reduced the decline in epididymal fat pad weight of leukemic animals. These data indicate that prostaglandins, produced peripherally, are involved in the acute hypermetabolism associated with T-cell leukemia, but have little or no effect on the hypophagia or body weight loss of leukemic rats.","['Roe, S Y', 'Cooper, A L', 'Morris, I D', 'Rothwell, N J']","['Roe SY', 'Cooper AL', 'Morris ID', 'Rothwell NJ']","['School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Metabolism,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,0375267,"['0 (Prostaglandins)', '5GRO578KLP (Flurbiprofen)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Temperature Regulation', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Cachexia/complications/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Feeding Behavior/drug effects', 'Flurbiprofen/pharmacology', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/complications/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Prostaglandins/*physiology', 'Rats']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0026-0495(97)90047-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0026-0495(97)90047-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Metabolism. 1997 Apr;46(4):359-65. doi: 10.1016/s0026-0495(97)90047-0.,,,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,

Application to substance P receptor.,4542-51,"Benzoylphenylalanine, a photoreactive phenylalanine analog that can be incorporated into a peptide during solid-phase synthesis, is a useful probe for investigating the interactions of bioactive peptides with their receptors. This probe, however, lacks versatility because it is not detectable by Edman sequencing and because it cannot be labeled with radioiodine, requiring radiolabeling of the peptide ligand at a site distal to the photoreactive amino acid. The separation of the radioisotope and photoaffinity labels along the primary sequence limits identification of the photoinsertion site to a peptide fragment rather than a specific amino acid of the receptor protein. We have now synthesized p-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)phenylalanine by a synthetic route involving reaction of 4-(chloromethyl)benzoic anhydride with phenol in polyphosphoric acid to give the 4-(chloromethyl)benzoyl ester of 4-(chloromethyl)-4'-hydroxybenzophenone followed by reaction of the benzophenone derivative with ethyl acetamidocyanoacetate and subsequent hydrolysis of the product to give p-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)phenylalanine. The novel photolabile amino acid was incorporated into substance P (replacing Phe8 or Lys3) to give 11-mer peptides that bind with high (nM) affinity and specificity to the substance P receptor. Radioiodination of the substance P analogs resulted in the incorporation of 125I at the photoreactive amino acid residue, yielding probes of high (approximately 2000 Ci/mmol) specific activity. Subsequent photolysis of the radiolabeled peptides in the presence of substance P receptor caused covalent attachment of the peptide to the receptor with high photoinsertion yield (approximately 30%); photolabeling was abolished in the presence of excess unlabeled SP. p-(4-Hydroxybenzoyl)phenylalanine retains p-benzoylphenylalanine's high insertion yield and low reactivity with water, but in contrast allows placement of radioiodine and the photoactive moieties within the same residue, providing the ability to identify the specific site(s) of interaction, and identification of the residue by Edman sequencing. This novel amino acid may be useful in the elucidation of the interaction of a variety of peptides with their receptors.","['Wilson, C J', 'Husain, S S', 'Stimson, E R', 'Dangott, L J', 'Miller, K W', 'Maggio, J E']","['Wilson CJ', 'Husain SS', 'Stimson ER', 'Dangott LJ', 'Miller KW', 'Maggio JE']","['Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (4-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)phenylalanine)', '0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Neurokinin-1)', '130409-05-1 (substance P, Bpa(8)-)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)']",IM,"['*Affinity Labels', 'Animals', 'Drug Interactions', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia P388', 'Mice', 'Peptides/*chemistry', 'Phenylalanine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Receptors, Neurokinin-1/*chemistry', 'Substance P/analogs & derivatives/chemistry']",1997/04/15 00:00,1997/04/15 00:01,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi962299x [doi]', 'bi962299x [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1997 Apr 15;36(15):4542-51. doi: 10.1021/bi962299x.,,,,,['GM-15904/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Similar results for luciferase expression were obtained in immortalized cells either by infection using adenoviral constructs or by transfection using conventional plasmid vectors. Taking advantage of adenoviral vectors, we extended our experiments to various primary cell cultures. The first 800 bp of the TH promoter were found to be sufficient to confer a cell-type preferential activity in noradrenergic neurons of the rat superior cervical ganglia. Furthermore, using this neuronal culture model, we showed that the same promoter region carries leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF)-responsive element(s). Our results demonstrate that the first 800 bp of the rat TH promoter contains a functionally important core region for constitutive and LIF-regulated expression of TH in peripheral noradrenergic neurons.

Subtilisin/kexin-like convertases cleave proproteins at preferred RX(K/R)R / sites, including those commonly found in viral envelope glycoprotein precursors. We first demonstrated that gp72 is processed into gp51/gp30 in both CV1 cells and the furin-deficient LoVo cells, leading us to compare the ability of mammalian convertases to cleave BLV gp72 in vitro. In contrast to the inability of the neuroendocrine PC1 to cleave gp72, the convertases furin, PACE4, PC5-A and PC5-B, which process constitutively secreted precursors, can effectively cleave gp72 into gp51/gp30. N-terminal sequence analysis of the convertase-generated gp30 demonstrated that cleavage occurs at the in vivo-utilized RVRR / SPV site. Such furin-, PACE4- and PC5-mediated processing was completely inhibited by the alpha1-antitrypsin variant alpha1-PDX. Mutagenesis of the gp72 cleavage site into RVRG-TPV resulted in complete abrogation of gp72 processing by endogenous CV-1 cells and by convertases in vitro. Since our in vitro data suggest a redundancy in the ability of the convertases to cleave gp72, RT-PCR analysis was used to define the convertases expressed in B-lymphocytes, representing one of the major targets of BLV infection.

Bcl-2 is highly expressed in a variety of lymphomas. Lymphocytes of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) express high amounts of bcl-2 even in the absence of the t(14;18) translocation, resulting in a strong resistance towards corticosteroid induced apoptosis. Within the 5'-untranslated region of the bcl-2 gene a p53 dependent negative response element has been described. Genetic alterations within this element could lead to uncontrolled overexpression of bcl-2 and subsequent resistance towards apoptosis. We therefore analyzed the mRNA from the 5'-untranslated region -279 to -85 bp of the bcl-2 gene by direct PCR sequencing from peripheral blood derived lymphocytes from patients with CLL and normal healthy donors. Compared to published sequences (Tsujimoto and Croce (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Hormonal agents include progesterone, luteolytic factors (prostaglandin F2 alpha) and embryonic signals (chorionic gonadotrophin, oestradiol-17 beta, interferon-tau) responsible for maintaining the corpus luteum. Non-hormonal agents include surface antigens (attachment and adhesion molecules), vasoactive agents, tissue-remodelling enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases) and inhibitors (TIMPs), growth factors (epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor families) and cytokines (such as leukaemia inhibitory factor, colony-stimulating factor-1, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6) associated with the pre-attachment period and the apposition, adhesion and invasion of the blastocyst. This review describes some of the hormonal and non-hormonal agents present at the time of implantation that may be exploited as targets for contraception in feral species. Particular attention is paid to the mouse as an experimental model and potential target species. The considerable species differences which exist in the models of implantation and placentation and the way in which the female 'recognizes' the presence of a viable conceptus offer a means of conferring species specificity on potential contraceptive targets for feral species.","['Nie, G Y', 'Butt, A R', 'Salamonsen, L A', 'Findlay, J K']","['Nie GY', 'Butt AR', 'Salamonsen LA', 'Findlay JK']","[""Prince Henry's Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, Vic, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Australia,Reprod Fertil Dev,"Reproduction, fertility, and development",8907465,"['0 (Contraceptive Agents, Female)', '0 (Hormones)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Contraception/*veterinary', '*Contraceptive Agents, Female', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Female', '*Hormones', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Pregnancy']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1071/r96065 [doi]'],ppublish,Reprod Fertil Dev. 1997;9(1):65-76. doi: 10.1071/r96065.,,114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Writing Committee for the International Collaboration on Antimicrobial Treatment of Febrile Neutropenia in Children.,346-53,"BACKGROUND: The combination of ceftazidime plus aminoglycoside is widely used for the treatment of febrile neutropenic patients but requires multiple daily administration. Because the frequency of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is low in many centers, there is a rationale to test other antibiotic regimens that provide appropriate antibacterial coverage with the advantage of reduced dosing frequency, such as once daily ceftriaxone plus amikacin. METHODS: Febrile neutropenic children with leukemia, lymphoma or solid tumors after chemotherapy were included in an open, prospective, randomized, multinational study comparing once daily ceftriaxone plus amikacin vs. 8-hourly ceftazidime and amikacin. The response to antimicrobial therapy was defined as complete response, improvement or failure. Assessment of adverse events was supplemented by specific definitions of nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, hepatotoxicity and hypokalemia. Costs were estimated from published values of acquisition costs, delivery costs and hospitalization costs. RESULTS: Efficacy was evaluable in 364 of 468 episodes in 265 children. Response rates in ceftriaxone and amikacin vs. ceftazidime and amikacin-treated episodes were 119 of 181 (66%) vs. 121 of 183 (66%), 7 of 181 (4%) vs. 9 of 183 (5%) and 55 of 181 (30%) vs. 53 of 181 (29%) for complete response, improvement and failure, respectively. Safety profiles were similar with both treatment regimens. The acquisition and administration costs were lower for the ceftriaxone and amikacin regimen. CONCLUSIONS: A once daily regimen of ceftriaxone and amikacin is as safe and clinically effective as that of three times daily ceftazidime and amikacin for the treatment of febrile neutropenic children with cancer and is more cost-effective. The once daily regimen of ceftriaxone and amikacin is suitable for outpatient treatment.","['Charnas, R', 'Luthi, A R', 'Ruch, W']","['Charnas R', 'Luthi AR', 'Ruch W']","['F.

DESIGN: Five double-copy retroviral vectors were constructed, in which the expression of the sense or antisense RNA corresponding to HIV minus- or plus-strand strong-stop DNA was driven by the human tRNA(met) promoter. METHOD: The templates for the sense or antisense RNA were polymerase chain reaction-cloned from HIV pNL43 into a murine leukaemia virus-based vector and corresponding defective virions were packaged in PA317 cells. Human Jurkat T cells transduced with these vectors were challenged with HIV and monitored for viral RNA, viral DNA and p24 production for 23 weeks. RESULTS: Intracellular expression of HIV sense RU5 sequences (RNA complementary to minus-strand strong-stop DNA) enhanced HIV replication in T cells. Expression of HIV sense or antisense U3RU5 sequences (identical or complementary to plus-strand strong-stop DNA) conferred long-term inhibition of HIV replication, despite continuous presence of viral challenge in the transduced cell cultures. CONCLUSION: Plus-strand strong-stop DNA as an intermediate in the early process of viral reverse transcription can be explored as an additional target for anti-HIV gene therapy.","['Peng, H', 'Callison, D E', 'Li, P', 'Burrell, C J']","['Peng H', 'Callison DE', 'Li P', 'Burrell CJ']","['National Centre for HIV Virology Research, University of Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,"['0 (RNA, Antisense)']",IM,"['Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'RNA, Antisense/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002030-199705000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS. 1997 Apr;11(5):587-95. doi: 10.1097/00002030-199705000-00006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A pivotal issue in transplantation for CML is whether donor lymphocytes are specific for host tumor or myeloid cells or a subset of the lymphocytes that cause graft-versus-host disease. We have enrolled seven patients in an experimental trial to evaluate the specificity of HLA-matched donor lymphocytes in vitro. We have produced 11 CD4+ cytotoxic and proliferative T-cell clones from five of the donors that only lyse or proliferate to leukemic myeloid cells. These T lymphocytes do not react with interleukin (IL)-2-stimulated blasts, natural killer-sensitive targets, donor neutrophils, or bcr-abl+ EBV-lymphoblastoid cell lines. We show that the addition of the cytokines IL-7 and IL-12 during the production of T-cell clones enhances the recovery of myeloid-specific clones in vitro. Five of the myeloid-specific clones that we produced maintained specificity over 12 weeks in culture. Adoption of this method should allow for the expansion and in vivo testing of CML-specific CD4+ T-cell clones in adoptive immunotherapy.","['Serody, J S', 'Brecher, M E', 'Dent, G', 'Bentley, S A', 'Frelinger, J A', 'Shea, T C']","['Serody JS', 'Brecher ME', 'Dent G', 'Bentley SA', 'Frelinger JA', 'Shea TC']","['Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill 27599-7305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Adult', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Transplantation Immunology']",1997/04/15 00:00,1997/04/15 00:01,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Apr 15;57(8):1547-53.,,,,,"['AI 20288/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 66715/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We reported previously that fludarabine nucleoside synergistically enhanced cisplatin (CDDP)-induced cytotoxicity in vitro, and that the synergism was concomitant with inhibition of removal of cellular CDDP-induced DNA interstrand cross-links, which are presumably repaired by homologous recombinational repair. To extend our work, we investigated whether fludarabine inhibits nucleotide excision repair (NER) of CDDP-induced DNA intrastrand adducts. The effect of fludarabine on NER was determined using a cell-free system in which a plasmid containing the DNA adducts served as the substrate for repair enzymes in whole-cell extracts from repair-competent cells. To prevent the cell-bound high mobility group box-containing proteins from interfering with repair, cell extracts were depleted with high mobility group box proteins by immunoprecipitation prior to the assay. Repair synthesis, measured by the incorporation of [(32)P]dATP or [(32)P]dCTP, was inhibited by 50% at 26 or 43 microM fludarabine triphosphate, respectively; the effect was dose dependent and may have resulted from the termination of repair-patch elongation. These results were consistent with those from pulse-chase experiments demonstrating the conversion of nicked circular plasmid to the closed circular form by cell extracts filling the repair gaps. When proliferating cell nuclear antigen-depleted cell extracts were used and aphidicolin was added in the repair assay to arrest NER at the incision/excision stage, 100 microM fludarabine triphosphate inhibited about 55% of the conversion of nicked plasmids from the closed circular damaged plasmid substrate; the inhibition was dose dependent. We conclude that fludarabine triphosphate inhibited NER at the steps of incision and repair synthesis. These results suggest that fludarabine may serve as a potential repair modulator to improve the antitumor efficacies of combination regimens containing agents that induce NER.","['Li, L', 'Liu, X', 'Glassman, A B', 'Keating, M J', 'Stros, M', 'Plunkett, W', 'Yang, L Y']","['Li L', 'Liu X', 'Glassman AB', 'Keating MJ', 'Stros M', 'Plunkett W', 'Yang LY']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas M.

All patients received the same regimen of BU, 16 mg/kg orally and cyclophosphamide (CY), 120 mg/kg intravenously. Plasma concentrations of BU at steady state (C(SS)BU) during the dosing interval were measured for each patient. The mean C(SS)BU was 917 ng/mL (range, 642 to 1,749; median, 917; standard deviation, 213). Of patients with C(SS)BU below the median, seven (five of 18 in CP and two of four in AP) developed persistent cytogenetic relapse and three of these patients died. There were no relapses in patients with C(SS)BU above the median. The difference in the cumulative incidence of relapse between the two groups was statistically significant (P = .0003). C(SS)BU was the only statistically significant determinant of relapse in univariable or multivariable analysis. The 3-year survival estimates were 0.82 and 0.64 for patients with C(SS)BU above and below the median (P = .33). There was no statistically significant association of C(SS)BU with survival or nonrelapse mortality, although the power to detect a difference in survival between 0.82 and 0.64 was only 0.24, similarly C(SS)BU above the median was not associated with an increased risk of severe regimen-related toxicity. We conclude that low BU plasma levels are associated with an increased risk of relapse.","['Slattery, J T', 'Clift, R A', 'Buckner, C D', 'Radich, J', 'Storer, B', 'Bensinger, W I', 'Soll, E', 'Anasetti, C', 'Bowden, R', 'Bryant, E', 'Chauncey, T', 'Deeg, H J', 'Doney, K C', 'Flowers, M', 'Gooley, T', 'Hansen, J A', 'Martin, P J', 'McDonald, G B', 'Nash, R', 'Petersdorf, E W', 'Sanders, J E', 'Schoch, G', 'Stewart, P', 'Storb, R', 'Sullivan, K M', 'Thomas, E D', 'Witherspoon, R P', 'Appelbaum, F R']","['Slattery JT', 'Clift RA', 'Buckner CD', 'Radich J', 'Storer B', 'Bensinger WI', 'Soll E', 'Anasetti C', 'Bowden R', 'Bryant E', 'Chauncey T', 'Deeg HJ', 'Doney KC', 'Flowers M', 'Gooley T', 'Hansen JA', 'Martin PJ', 'McDonald GB', 'Nash R', 'Petersdorf EW', 'Sanders JE', 'Schoch G', 'Stewart P', 'Storb R', 'Sullivan KM', 'Thomas ED', 'Witherspoon RP', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104-2092, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/epidemiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/blood/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/blood/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Quality of Life', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/04/15 00:00,1997/04/15 00:01,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59021-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 15;89(8):3055-60.,,,,,"['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Although allogeneic transplantation results in a lower risk of disease recurrence than intensive chemotherapy alone, overall outcome following BMT may not be improved due to the higher incidence of therapy-related fatal complications, frequently as a result of the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Selective T-cell depletion of donor marrow can reduce the incidence of GVHD and thereby limit transplant-related toxicity. Herein we report the risk of GVHD, incidence of transplant related mortality (TRM), likelihood of disease relapse, and overall survival in adult patients undergoing BMT with CD6 depleted allogeneic marrow for acute leukemia in first remission. Forty-one consecutive allogeneic transplants were performed on patients with acute leukemia and high-risk features (28 AML, 13 ALL) using T12 monoclonal antibody and complement to remove CD6+ T cells from donor marrow. No pre- or posttransplant immune suppressive medications for GVHD prophylaxis were administered. The actuarial estimated risk of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD was 15% in patients receiving HLA identical grafts. Chronic GVHD developed in five patients. The estimated risk of TRM for patients in first complete remission was 5% at Day +100 and 16% at 2 years. Fatalities attributable to infection with cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus occurred in only three patients. Estimated probabilities of relapse, overall survival, and event-free survival at 4 years were 25%, 71%, and 63%, respectively. No significant differences in GVHD, TRM, relapse rate, or survival was observed for patients with AML compared with those with ALL. Allogeneic transplantation with CD6 depleted bone marrow is effective in consolidating remissions of high-risk patients with acute leukemia in first remission without excessive toxicity.","['Soiffer, R J', 'Fairclough, D', 'Robertson, M', 'Alyea, E', 'Anderson, K', 'Freedman, A', 'Bartlett-Pandite, L', 'Fisher, D', 'Schlossman, R L', 'Stone, R', 'Murray, C', 'Freeman, A', 'Marcus, K', 'Mauch, P', 'Nadler, L', 'Ritz, J']","['Soiffer RJ', 'Fairclough D', 'Robertson M', 'Alyea E', 'Anderson K', 'Freedman A', 'Bartlett-Pandite L', 'Fisher D', 'Schlossman RL', 'Stone R', 'Murray C', 'Freeman A', 'Marcus K', 'Mauch P', 'Nadler L', 'Ritz J']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD6 antigen)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Purging', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/immunology/mortality', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology/mortality', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Life Tables', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', '*T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/immunology/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/04/15 00:00,1997/04/15 00:01,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59019-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 15;89(8):3039-47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined the expression and regulation of these genes at both the mRNA and protein level in 22 pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines, as well as their sensitivity to apoptosis after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). Eleven of 22 lines expressed wild-type (wt) p53, 4 expressed mutant p53, and 7 did not express p53 (p53-null). Nine of 22 (41%) lines expressed Bcl-2; of these, 8 were wt-p53+ and 1 expressed mutant p53. Bcl-2 was not expressed in any p53-null lines. In contrast, all 22 lines were positive for Bcl-x1 and Bax, although expression level varied. Treatment with IR (10 Gy) induced both downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax at 2 to 5 hours post-IR in 5 of 8 (63%) wt-p53+ lines, leading to apoptosis. Conversely, lines that failed to both downregulate Bcl-2 and upregulate Bax after IR were resistant to apoptosis. Although levels of Bcl-x1 expression varied among the 22 lines, high levels of Bcl-x1 were observed in 5 of 7 (71%) p53- lines. There were no obvious changes in the expression of Bcl-x1 in these lines after IR. However, among the p53-null lines, resistance to IR was observed only in those expressing high levels of Bcl-x1. These results suggest that expression of Bcl-2 but not Bcl-x1 is p53-dependent and that IR-induced downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax occur in most wt-p53+ lines and are associated with radiosensitivity. Furthermore, high-level expression of Bcl-x1 occurs predominantly in p53-null lines and is associated with resistance to IR-induced apoptosis in these lines, indicating differential expression and regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x1 in pediatric ALL.","['Findley, H W', 'Gu, L', 'Yeager, A M', 'Zhou, M']","['Findley HW', 'Gu L', 'Yeager AM', 'Zhou M']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Child', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Radiation Tolerance/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1997/04/15 00:00,1997/04/15 00:01,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59013-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 15;89(8):2986-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although these subline cells retain their monocytic characteristics in vitro, Mm-A and Mm-P cells are highly leukemogenic to syngeneic SL mice and athymic nude mice, whereas Mm-S1 and Mm-S2 cells are not or are only slightly leukemogenic. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of these levels of leukemogenicity, we investigated putative leukemogenesis-associated genes or oncogenes involved in the maintenance of growth, especially in vivo, by means of differential mRNA display. We isolated a fragment clone (15T01) from Mm-P cells. The mRNA probed with 15T01 was expressed at high levels in leukemogenic Mm-P and Mm-A cells but not in nonleukemogenic Mm-S1 and Mm-S2 cells. The gene corresponding to 15T01, named TRA1, was isolated from an Mm-P cDNA library. The longest open reading frame of the TRA1 clone predicts a peptide containing 204 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 23,049 D. The predicted TRA1 protein is cysteine-rich and contains multiple cysteine doublets. A putative normal counterpart gene, named NOR1, was also isolated from a normal mouse kidney cDNA library and sequenced. NOR1 cDNA predicts a peptide containing 234 amino acids. The sequence of 201 amino acids from the C-terminal NOR1 was completely identical to that of TRA1, whereas the remaining N-terminal amino acids (33 amino acids) were longer than that (3 amino acids) of TRA1 and the N-terminus of NOR1 protein contained proline-rich sequence. A similarity search against current nucleotide and protein sequence databases indicated that the NOR1/TRA1 gene(s) is conserved in a wide range of eukaryotes, because apparently homologous genes were identified in Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomes. Northern blotting using TRA1-specific and NOR1-specific probes indicated that TRA1 mRNA is exclusively expressed in leukemogenic but not in nonleukemogenic Mm sublines and normal tissues and also indicated that NOR1 mRNA is expressed in normal tissues, especially in kidney, lung, liver, and bone marrow cells but not in any Mm sublines. After leukemogenic Mm-P cells were induced to differentiate into normal macrophages by sodium butyrate, the normal counterpart, NOR1, was expressed, whereas the TRA1 level decreased. Furthermore, transfection of TRA1 converted nonleukemogenic Mm-S1 cells into leukemogenic cells. These results indicate that the TRA1 gene is associated at least in part with the leukemogenesis of monocytic Mm sublines.","['Kasukabe, T', 'Okabe-Kado, J', 'Honma, Y']","['Kasukabe T', 'Okabe-Kado J', 'Honma Y']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Ina, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Helminth Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nr4a3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phospholipid Transfer Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/genetics', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes', 'Helminth Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Muramidase/biosynthesis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Organ Specificity', '*Phospholipid Transfer Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Steroid', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Subtraction Technique', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/15 00:00,1997/04/15 00:01,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59012-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 15;89(8):2975-85.,,,,"['GENBANK/D78354', 'GENBANK/D78355']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellular drug resistance is thought to be an important cause of induction failure and relapse. We performed in vitro tests of bone marrow samples in 196 children with newly diagnosed ALL with a 4-day culture and a methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium assay. We tested 16 drugs and calculated the 70% lethal dose (LD70) for 14 drugs and the leukemic cell survival (LCS) rate for dexamethasone and prednisolone. For each single drug, patients were classified into two groups, sensitive or resistant, by median concentration of LD70 or LCS. When patients were classified into three groups by sensitivity to four drugs of DPAV (dexamethasone, prednisolone, L-asparaginase, and vincristine), 3-year event-free survival (EFS; 95% confidence intervals) of the super sensitive group (SS; sensitive to all 4 drugs) was 0.833 (0.690 to 0.976), that of the intermediate sensitive group (IS; sensitive to 2 or 3 drugs) was 0.735 (0.609 to 0.863), and that of the relatively resistant group (RR; sensitive to no drugs or to 1 drug) was 0.541 (0.411 to 0.670; P = .0008). We then investigated the relationship between the above four-drug sensitivity and the time of relapse. The SS and IS patients tended to maintain continuous complete remission, and RR patients tended to undergo induction failure and early and late relapse (P = .004). Initial white blood cell count, immunologic classification, and age were also predictive factors, but the patient numbers showed no statistical correlation between these factors and the four-drug sensitivity groups (SS, IS, and RR). When we took three groups SS/IS/RR and investigated the EFS for various clinical groups, DPAV sensitivity strongly influenced EFS in the standard-risk ALL (P = .016). In vitro drug sensitivity testing provides additional prognostic information about childhood ALL, and early detection of drug resistance at the time chemotherapy commences may provide a successful strategy for individualizing treatment, as the results indicate de novo resistance to front-line drugs and suggest alternative, second-line drugs.","['Hongo, T', 'Yajima, S', 'Sakurai, M', 'Horikoshi, Y', 'Hanada, R']","['Hongo T', 'Yajima S', 'Sakurai M', 'Horikoshi Y', 'Hanada R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'D58G680W0G (pirarubicin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Survival', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Life Tables', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Mitomycin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/pharmacology']",1997/04/15 00:00,1997/04/15 00:01,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59010-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 15;89(8):2959-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined expression of OX40 on fresh leukemic cells from patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and its possible involvement in cell adhesion. Flow cytometric analysis showed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or lymph node tumor cells from 15 of 17 cases expressed significant levels of OX40 without stimulation. On the other hand, gp34 was not expressed on these cells, although its expression is also known to be associated with HTLV-I-infection. In Western blot analysis, a 50-kD protein band was detected by anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) in two ATL cases examined, as well as phytohemagglutinin (PHA) blasts and Hut102, an HTLV-I-infected T-cell line, but not in resting PBMC or Jurkat. Expression of OX40 mRNA was shown by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in all ATL cases tested, PHA-blasts, and Hut102, but not in resting PBMC or Jurkat. We could not detect expression of HTLV-I viral mRNA in any of the cases tested. Cell adhesion assay was performed and in at least three cases, fresh ATL cells exhibited adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells that could be considerably inhibited by either anti-OX40 MoAb or anti-gp34 MoAb. Immunohistochemical staining of skin biopsy specimens indicated that infiltrating mononuclear cells express OX40 in vivo. Taken together, these data indicate that leukemic cells from most, but not all, ATL patients constitutively express OX40, which may play a role in leukemic cell infiltration in addition to cell adhesion in vivo.","['Imura, A', 'Hori, T', 'Imada, K', 'Kawamata, S', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Imamura, S', 'Uchiyama, T']","['Imura A', 'Hori T', 'Imada K', 'Kawamata S', 'Tanaka Y', 'Imamura S', 'Uchiyama T']","['Research Center for Immunodeficiency Virus, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, OX40)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF4 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Surface', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, OX40', '*Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",1997/04/15 00:00,1997/04/15 00:01,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59009-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 15;89(8):2951-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RB is necessary for hematopoiesis in mice, and aberrant RB-expression is associated with the progress and prognosis of leukemia. We have used antisense oligonucleotides, established clones stably expressing an antisense RB construct, and also established clones over expressing the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) to study the role of RB expression in monocytic differentiation induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or 1-alpha-25-dihyroxycholecalciferol (Vit D3) in the monoblastic cell line U-937 and erythroid differentiation induced by transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) and hemin in the erythroleukemic cell line K562. A reduction in pRb production in antisense RB-transfected U-937 clones was shown. Antisense oligonucleotides as well as expression of the antisense RB construct suppressed differentiation responses to ATRA or Vit D3, as judged by the capability to reduce nitro blue tetrazolium, by the appearance of monocyte-related cell surface antigens and by morphologic criteria. K562 cells showed decreased differentiation response to TGFbeta1, but not to hemin, when incubated with antisense oligonucleotides. U-937 antisense RB-transfected cells were also suppressed in their ability to upregulate levels of hypophosphorylated pRb when induced to differentiate. Although U-937 cells incubated with antisense oligonucleotides and clones expressing the antisense RB construct were hampered in their ability to differentiate on incubation with ATRA or Vit D3, the induced G0/G1-accumulation was similar to differentiating control cells treated with ATRA or Vit D3. Intriguingly, U-937 clones overexpressing RB were also inhibited in their differentiation response to ATRA or Vit D3 but not inhibited in their ability to respond with G0/G1 accumulation when induced with these substances. The results indicate that pRb plays a role in induced differentiation of U-937 cells as well as K562 cells involving mechanisms that, at least partially, are distinct from those inducing G1 accumulation.","['Bergh, G', 'Ehinger, M', 'Olofsson, T', 'Baldetorp, B', 'Johnsson, E', 'Brycke, H', 'Lindgren, G', 'Olsson, I', 'Gullberg, U']","['Bergh G', 'Ehinger M', 'Olofsson T', 'Baldetorp B', 'Johnsson E', 'Brycke H', 'Lindgren G', 'Olsson I', 'Gullberg U']","['Department of Medicine, University of Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'G1 Phase/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Retinoblastoma', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*deficiency/genetics', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/biosynthesis/*deficiency/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/15 00:00,1997/04/15 00:01,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59008-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 15;89(8):2938-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed expression of RET and GDNFR-alpha in purified normal hematolymphopoietic cells, leukemia/lymphoma cell lines, and 154 primary samples from patients with hematopoietic malignancies encompassing different lineages and differentiation stages. Relatively low amounts of RET mRNA were found in early CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors, but RET transcripts appeared to increase after myelomonocytic maturation. No expression of RET was found in peripheral blood and tissue B and T lymphocytes. Analysis of human myelomonocytic cell lines was overall consistent with results obtained on purified normal cells. Accordingly, RET expression was mainly confined to acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) displaying either monocytic (French-American-British M4 and M5) or intermediate-mature myeloid (M2 and M3) phenotypes, being less frequently detected in early myeloid (M0 and M1) AMLs. In contrast, RET mRNA was sporadically detected in B-cell tumors, whereas, among T-cell malignancies, RET transcripts were mainly detected in cells of postthymic and mature T-cell phenotype. RET broad detection in primary tumors was not paralleled by the mutual expression of GDNFR-alpha, which was detected only in 2 isolated primary samples and in 3 leukemia/lymphoma cell lines. However, GDNFR-alpha transcripts, in the absence of RET mRNA, were found in normal bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), in BM fibroblasts, and in two osteoblast cell lines previously described to support normal hematopoiesis. In the presence of GDNF-receptors derived from BMSC by PI-specific phospholipase C cleavage, GDNF efficiently bound RET-expressing AML blasts and was functionally active by reducing their clonogenic growth and triggering the monocytic maturation of leukemic cells.","['Gattei, V', 'Celetti, A', 'Cerrato, A', 'Degan, M', 'De Iuliis, A', 'Rossi, F M', 'Chiappetta, G', 'Consales, C', 'Improta, S', 'Zagonel, V', 'Aldinucci, D', 'Agosti, V', 'Santoro, M', 'Vecchio, G', 'Pinto, A', 'Grieco, M']","['Gattei V', 'Celetti A', 'Cerrato A', 'Degan M', 'De Iuliis A', 'Rossi FM', 'Chiappetta G', 'Consales C', 'Improta S', 'Zagonel V', 'Aldinucci D', 'Agosti V', 'Santoro M', 'Vecchio G', 'Pinto A', 'Grieco M']","['Divisione di Oncologia Medica, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, INRCCS, Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Ret protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/*metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Connective Tissue/*metabolism/pathology', '*Drosophila Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/15 00:00,1997/04/15 00:01,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59007-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 15;89(8):2925-37.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, when B7 vaccine is administered 2 weeks after leukemia inoculation, the effect is only prolonged survival, ending in death virtually of all the mice. To distinguish between tumor kinetics and tumor-induced immunosuppression as potential mechanisms eliminating the therapeutic potential of late B7 vaccines, we performed in vitro T-cell studies during leukemia progression and in vivo studies on the clinical outcome of late B7 vaccines in combination with prior cytoreductive chemotherapy. Our results show that CD8+ T cells from leukemic mice 1 and 2 weeks after leukemia inoculation proliferate more vigorously in response to in vitro activation than cells from normal mice and produce Th1-type cytokines interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assays demonstrate that cells from week-2 vaccinated mice (which succumb to their leukemia), surprisingly develop a stronger CTL activity than cells from week-1 vaccinated mice (which reject their leukemia). Finally, the combination of late chemotherapy and late B7 vaccine administration can cure only 20% of leukemic mice, whereas early chemotherapy and the same late B7 vaccine administration cure 100% of leukemic mice. These results demonstrate that in murine AML tumor growth does not induce T-cell anergy or a Th2 cytokine profile and suggest that tumor growth is most likely to be the limiting factor in the curative potential of late B7 vaccines.","['Dunussi-Joannopoulos, K', 'Krenger, W', 'Weinstein, H J', 'Ferrara, J L', 'Croop, J M']","['Dunussi-Joannopoulos K', 'Krenger W', 'Weinstein HJ', 'Ferrara JL', 'Croop JM']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Vaccines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'B7-1 Antigen/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Immunization Schedule', '*Immunotherapy, Active', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Th1 Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vaccines/*immunology']",1997/04/15 00:00,1997/04/15 00:01,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59006-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 15;89(8):2915-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A characteristic t(1;19) (q23;p13.3) chromosomal translocation is detected in 5% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases. This translocation results in the formation of a fusion gene, which leads to the expression of an oncogenic E2A/pbx1 protein. Breakpoints in the E2A gene almost invariably occur within a single intron, and the identical portion of PBX1 is joined consistently to exon 13 of E2A in fusion mRNA. In this article, we report the development of monoclonal antibodies against E2A/pbx1 fusion protein using a specific peptide that corresponds to the junction region of the protein. The obtained antibodies recognize specifically the chimeric E2A/pbx1 fusion protein and lack cross-reactivities with E2A and pbx1. Immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometric studies show that these antibodies can distinguish t(1;19)-positive from t(1;19)-negative leukemic cells.

However, anti-CD6 stimulation was found to protect against anti-IgM-induced apoptosis in B-CLL. bax(alpha) upregulation and bcl-2 downregulation were found in anti-IgM- and glucocorticoid (GCC)-induced apoptotic cells, respectively. Furthermore, CD6 cross-linking downregulated bax(alpha) mRNA levels in anti-IgM-treated cells, resulting in an increased bcl-2/bax(alpha) ratio.

About 5% of the bone marrow cells were HTK+, which were also c-Kit+, CD34(low), and glycophorin A(-/low). Assays of progenitors showed that HTK+ c-Kit+ cells consisted exclusively of erythroid progenitors, whereas HTK- c-Kit+ cells contained progenitors of granulocytes and macrophages as well as those of erythroid cells. Most of the HTK+ erythroid progenitors were stem cell factor-dependent for proliferation, indicating that they represent mainly erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E). During the erythroid differentiation of cultured peripheral CD34+ cells, HTK expression was upregulated on immature erythroid cells that corresponded to BFU-E and erythroid colony-forming units and downregulated on erythroblasts with high levels of glycophorin expression. These findings suggest that HTK is selectively expressed on the restricted stage of erythroid progenitors, particularly BFU-E, and that HTK is the first marker antigen that allows the purification of erythroid progenitors.

Grb2/Ash and Shc have the SH3, SH2, or phosphotyrosine binding domains. These domains bind to proteins containing proline-rich regions or tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and contribute to the association of Grb2/Ash and Shc with other signaling molecules. However, there could remain unidentified signaling molecules that physically and functionally interact with these adapter proteins and have biologically important roles in the signaling pathways. By using the GST fusion protein including the full length of Grb2/Ash, we have found that c-Cbl and an unidentified 135-kD protein (pp135) are associated with Grb2/Ash. We have also found that they become tyrosine-phosphorylated by treatment of a human leukemia cell line, UT-7, with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). We have purified the pp135 by using GST-Grb2/Ash affinity column and have isolated the full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding the pp135 using a cDNA probe, which was obtained by the degenerate polymerase chain reaction based on a peptide sequence of the purified pp135. The cloned cDNA has 3,958 nucleotides that contain a single long open reading frame of 3,567 nucleotides, encoding a 1,189 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 133 kD. The deduced amino acid sequence reveals that pp135 is a protein that has one SH2, one SH3, and one proline-rich domain. The pp135, which contains two motifs conserved among the inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase proteins, was shown to have the inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase activity.

In the human system, the role of CXCR4 in HIV infection has been determined through env-mediated cell fusion assays and confirmed by blocking viral entry in CD4+/CXCR4+ cells by SDF-1 pretreatment. We observed that the human megakaryoblastic CD4+ UT-7 cell line fails to express CXCR4 RNA and is fully resistant to HIV entry. Transfection of an expression vector containing the CXCR4 c-DNA rendered UT-7 cells readily infectable by different T-lymphotropic syncytium-inducing HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates. Interestingly, HIV-1 infection of CXCR4 expressing UT-7 cells (named UT-7/fus) induces the formation of polynucleated cells through a process highly reminiscent of megakaryocytic differentiation and maturation. On the contrary, no morphologic changes were observed in HIV-2-infected UT-7/fus cells. These findings further strengthen the role of CXCR4 as a molecule necessary for the replication of T-lymphotropic HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates and provide a useful model to study the functional role of CD4 coreceptors in HIV infection.","['Baiocchi, M', 'Olivetta, E', 'Chelucci, C', 'Santarcangelo, A C', 'Bona, R', ""d'Aloja, P"", 'Testa, U', 'Komatsu, N', 'Verani, P', 'Federico, M']","['Baiocchi M', 'Olivetta E', 'Chelucci C', 'Santarcangelo AC', 'Bona R', ""d'Aloja P"", 'Testa U', 'Komatsu N', 'Verani P', 'Federico M']","['Laboratory of Virology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, HIV)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['CD4 Antigens/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/metabolism', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'HIV-2/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism/*virology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, CXCR4', 'Receptors, HIV/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Replication']",1997/04/15 00:00,1997/04/15 00:01,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58978-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Apr 15;89(8):2670-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML/RAR alpha was proposed to block myeloid differentiation through inhibition of nuclear receptor response, as does a dominant negative RAR alpha mutant. In addition, in APL cells, PML/RAR alpha displaces PML and other nuclear body (NB) antigens onto nuclear microspeckles, likely resulting in the loss of PML and/or NB functions. RA leads to clinical remissions through induction of terminal differentiation, for which the respective contributions of RAR alpha (or PML/RAR alpha) activation, PML/RAR alpha degradation, and restoration of NB antigens localization are poorly determined. Arsenic trioxide also leads to remissions in APL patients, presumably through induction of apoptosis. We demonstrate that in non-APL cells, arsenic recruits the nucleoplasmic form of several NB antigens onto NB, but induces the degradation of PML only, identifying a powerful tool to approach NB function. In APL cells, arsenic targets PML and PML/RAR alpha onto NB and induces their degradation. Thus, RA and arsenic target RAR alpha and PML, respectively, but both induce the degradation of the PML/RAR alpha fusion protein, which should contribute to their therapeutic effects. The difference in the cellular events triggered by these two agents likely stems from RA-induced transcriptional activation and arsenic effects on NB proteins.","['Zhu, J', 'Koken, M H', 'Quignon, F', 'Chelbi-Alix, M K', 'Degos, L', 'Wang, Z Y', 'Chen, Z', 'de The, H']","['Zhu J', 'Koken MH', 'Quignon F', 'Chelbi-Alix MK', 'Degos L', 'Wang ZY', 'Chen Z', 'de The H']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism']",1997/04/15 00:00,1997/04/15 00:01,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.94.8.3978 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Apr 15;94(8):3978-83. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.8.3978.,,,PMC20553,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with mice treated with mismatched oligodeoxynucleotides, the peripheral blood leukemic load of mice treated with the antisense sequences was markedly reduced, and such effects were associated with significantly prolonged survival of the antisense-treated mice. Moreover, with each of three different treatment schedules (100, 300, or 900 microg/day for 6 consecutive days), survival of the phosphoramidate-treated mice was significantly longer than that of the phosphorothioate-treated mice. Both phosphoramidate and phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were efficiently taken up by leukemic cells in vivo and were capable of specifically down-regulating c-Myc expression.

To better understand the underlying mechanisms of leukemogenesis, we asked whether in cytogenetically normal cases one or both chromosomes carry the mutated allele and whether in trisomic cases the mutation is present in one, two, or three chromosomes. Herein we show that in cytogenetically normal cases of AML and in cases with +11 as a sole cytogenetic abnormality, only one chromosome contains the mutated ALL1 allele.

Induction of apoptosis in murine thymocytes by dexamethasone or gamma-irradiation shifts the subcellular locations of Bax and Bcl-X(L) from soluble to membrane-bound forms. A similar shift in the localization of Bax from the cytosol to membranes was observed in HL-60 leukemia cells upon induction of apoptosis by staurosporine. Inhibition of apoptosis with cycloheximide inhibits the movement of Bax and Bcl-X(L) in thymocytes from the cytosol into membranes induced by dexamethasone treatment.

We have shown that transactivation by Tax was correlated with its ability to interact with the C-terminal moiety of the TATA box-binding protein (TBP). In the present study, the ability of Tax to interact with several human TBP-associated factors (TAF(II)s) was analyzed. We show that Tax interacts selectively with hTAF(II)28 in transfected HeLa cells. A direct interaction between Tax and hTAF(II)28 was also observed in vitro with purified proteins. In transient expression studies we show that overexpression of hTAF(II)28 significantly increased transactivation by Tax, both in the absence and in the presence of overexpressed TBP. The ability of hTAF(II)28 to potentiate transactivation correlated with the ability of Tax to interact with hTAF(II)28 and also with the ability of hTAF(II)28 to interact with TBP. Coexpression of TBP and hTAF(II)28 resulted in an additive increase in transactivation by Tax. From these observations we propose that transcriptional activation by Tax involves multiple interactions with TFIID via its TBP and hTAF(II)28 subunits.","['Caron, C', 'Mengus, G', 'Dubrowskaya, V', 'Roisin, A', 'Davidson, I', 'Jalinot, P']","['Caron C', 'Mengus G', 'Dubrowskaya V', 'Roisin A', 'Davidson I', 'Jalinot P']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor TFIID)', '0 (Transcription Factors, TFII)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor TFIID', 'Transcription Factors, TFII/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1997/04/15 00:00,1997/04/15 00:01,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.94.8.3662 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Apr 15;94(8):3662-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.8.3662.,,,PMC20497,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is associated with down-regulation in expression of bcl-2. Spontaneous apoptosis of these cells contrasts their enhanced longevity in vivo and suggests that apoptosis-inhibitory factors may be responsible for the accumulation of leukaemic cells in B-CLL. The effect of different cytokines on apoptosis and bcl-2 expression was examined in six populations of leukaemic CD5+ B cells. Consistent with previous data, IL-4 and IFN-gamma suppressed apoptosis in 6/6 and 5/6 cell populations, respectively. Interestingly, the ability to suppress apoptosis in leukaemic CD5+ B cells was also found to be a property of IL-2, IL-6, IL-13 and TNF-alpha. In the presence of these cytokines, 10-40% more viable cells were detected, compared with unstimulated cultures. Enhancement of cell viability and suppression of apoptosis were associated with a delay in down-regulation of bcl-2. These results suggest a role for autocrine and paracrine growth factors in the pathogenesis of B-CLL, and indicate that cytokines which prevent apoptosis in vitro may be targets for treating this malignancy.","['Tangye, S G', 'Raison, R L']","['Tangye SG', 'Raison RL']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Technology, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/icb.1997.17 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 1997 Apr;75(2):127-35. doi: 10.1038/icb.1997.17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This drug in itself is inactive; it needs to be converted intracellularly by a series of cellular kinases to AZT 5'-triphosphate (AZT-TP) to exert antiviral activity. The purpose of this study was to examine the in vivo disposition of the phosphorylated AZT anabolites in different target tissues and to investigate the effects of chronic retrovirus infection on the tissue disposition of AZT anabolites. Female C57BL/6 mice at 20 weeks after inoculation with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus, as well as age-matched control animals, were dosed subcutaneously with 25 mg/kg of AZT. The dosing solution contained [3H]AZT with a specific activity of 87 mCi/mmol. The levels of AZT and its phosphorylated anabolites were determined in tissues collected at different times after AZT administration using an analytical method coupling an ion-pair HPLC separation procedure with radioactivity detection after the separation. The tissue-to-plasma AZT ratios in control mice could be ranked in the following order: kidneys > muscle approximately equal to spleen approximately equal to liver approximately equal to heart approximately equal to lung > thymus > lymph nodes > brain. Similar rank order was observed in infected animals, with the exception that significantly higher AZT levels were found in the lymph nodes, where the tissue-to-plasma AZT ratios in lymph nodes were higher than those in thymus tissues. Tissue AZT 5'-monophosphate profiles tended to parallel the AZT profiles in most tissues examined. Delays in the appearance of AZT 5'-diphosphate and AZT-TP were observed in all tissues tested. AZT-TP content was not detectable in any of the brain samples analyzed. The conversion of AZT to AZT anabolites was found to be highest in the spleen and bone marrow samples from both control and infected animals. Lymph nodes of the control animals showed poor ability to phosphorylate AZT to its active triphosphate moiety. This ability was significantly enhanced in infected animals. We concluded that the in vivo disposition of AZT anabolites after a single dose administration of AZT is tissue-specific in mice and that experimentally induced chronic retrovirus infection resulted in the most significant changes in the distribution of AZT into the lymph nodes and in the phosphorylation of AZT in this important target tissue. Further studies are needed to relate the tissue-specific disposition of AZT anabolites to the therapeutic problems encountered with AZT treatment.","['Chow, H H', 'Li, P', 'Brookshier, G', 'Tang, Y']","['Chow HH', 'Li P', 'Brookshier G', 'Tang Y']","['Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,['4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae Infections/*metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Zidovudine/blood/*pharmacokinetics']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 1997 Apr;25(4):412-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GER (Gruppo Ematologico Retinoidi).",106-21,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: During the past ten years, the study of retinoids has undergone a total transformation. The Italian Society of Experimental Hematology decided to discuss these advances at a meeting in Florence on April 18, 1996. INFORMATION SOURCES: The material examined in the present review includes articles and abstracts published in journals covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline. In addition, all the authors of the present article have been actively working in the field of retinoids and have contributed several papers. Summaries of their oral presentations at the Florence meeting are reported in the Appendix to this review article. STATE OF ART AND PERSPECTIVES: One of the most important advances has been the elucidation of new molecular mechanisms of control of gene expression by retinoids. A number of new retinoids have been synthesized by chemists, some of which are being screened for potential clinical use, and a few have already had a tremendous impact on clinical practice. The most important achievements have been obtained in acute promyelocytic leukemia. In 1988 a Chinese group working in Shanghai showed that using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) alone 94% of acute promyelocytic leukemic patients obtained complete remission through differentiation of the leukemic clone. This result transformed a dream into reality and allowed researchers to move from laboratory experience to clinical applications of this differentiating therapy. Expanding the spectrum of hematological malignancies that may respond to ATRA remains a challenge; however, several results show some activity of retinoids alone or in combination with other drugs in juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), myelodysplastic syndrome, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and CML. Particularly interesting are the studies that explored the potential clinical synergism of ATRA-based combination therapies with growth factors, other differentiating agents such as vitamin D3, immunomodulators like interferons, or chemotherapeutic agents, in particular Ara-C, all of which show promising in vitro effects when used in combination with retinoids.","['Sacchi, S', 'Russo, D', 'Avvisati, G', 'Dastoli, G', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Bonora, M R', 'Visani, G', 'Grassi, C', 'Iacona, I', 'Luzzi, L', 'Vanzanelli, P']","['Sacchi S', 'Russo D', 'Avvisati G', 'Dastoli G', 'Lazzarino M', 'Pelicci PG', 'Bonora MR', 'Visani G', 'Grassi C', 'Iacona I', 'Luzzi L', 'Vanzanelli P']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Oncologiche e Radiologiche, Universita di Modena, Italy. ssacchi@unimo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Biotransformation', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Pseudotumor Cerebri/chemically induced', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/drug effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Respiration Disorders/chemically induced', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Jan-Feb;82(1):106-21.,,117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There have been difficulties in establishing whether BAL represents a distinct clinico-biological entity due to a lack of objective criteria for distinguishing BAL from acute myeloid leukemias (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) with aberrant expression of a marker from another lineage. In this work we analyze diagnostic criteria for BAL. METHODS: We describe the features of 26 patients (19 adults and 7 children) with BAL diagnosed at the Royal Marsden Hospital. BAL was defined according to a scoring system devised by our group and the European Group for the Immunological Classification of Leukemia (EGIL). This system is based on the number and degree of specificity of the markers (lymphoid and myeloid) expressed by the blasts. RESULTS: According to the FAB criteria, BAL may present as ""ALL"" or as one of the ""AML"" subtypes, often M1. It is not infrequent to identify two distinct blast populations: one of small size resembling lymphoblasts and the other larger. The most common immunophenotype is coexpression of B-lymphoid and myeloid markers and less frequently, T-lymphoid and myeloid markers. Cases with a B and T lymphoid phenotype or with trilineage differentiation are rare. BAL has a high incidence of clonal chromosomal abnormalities, the most common being the t(9;22) (q34;q11) (Ph chromosome) and structural abnormalities involving 11q23. Data are emerging that BAL has a negative prognosis in both children and adults and this may be related to the underlying chromosome abnormalities. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In summary, BAL is an uncommon type of leukemia which probably arises from a multipotent progenitor cell and carries a poor prognosis. Although there are no uniform criteria about whether to treat these patients as ALL or AML, it is likely that an intensive approach with high-dose therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation will be required to eradicate the disease permanently.","['Matutes, E', 'Morilla, R', 'Farahat, N', 'Carbonell, F', 'Swansbury, J', 'Dyer, M', 'Catovsky, D']","['Matutes E', 'Morilla R', 'Farahat N', 'Carbonell F', 'Swansbury J', 'Dyer M', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Hematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK. estella@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Naphthol AS D Esterase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*classification/epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification', 'Middle Aged', 'Naphthol AS D Esterase/analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/pathology', 'Peroxidase/analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification', 'Prognosis']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Jan-Feb;82(1):64-6.,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Collection of PBSC in healthy subjects currently implies the administration of G-CSF or GM-CSF and, of course, the use of apheretic devices. These procedures involve potential risks, in particular the risk of leukemia secondary to growth-factor treatment. To evaluate the current practice of PBSC mobilization and collection, and initially assess the short-term side effects and efficiency of procedures, the GITMO (Gruppo Italiano Trapianti di Midollo Osseo) promoted a retrospective cooperative study among the Italian centers. METHODS: Seventy-six healthy individuals donating to their HLA-identical or partially matched sibling recipients in seven Italian centers form the basis of the present analysis. The data were retrospectively collected by proper forms, pooled and analyzed by means of a commercially available statistical soft package. RESULTS: All donors received G-CSF as mobilizing agent with different schedules according to each single center policy. A median of 2.5 (range 1-4) aphereses per donor were run. The most frequent side effect was bone pain. In no case did the medium term follow-up reveal subjective complaints or laboratory modifications. After G-CSF mobilization, WBC and lymphocytes counts increased to a maximum of (mean +/- SD) 48.1 +/- 15.6 x 10(9)/L and 4.2 +/- 1.5 x 10(9)/L, respectively. The peak was reached on day 5 in both cases. Platelets decreased after the apheretic procedures, reaching a minimum of (mean +/- SD) 77 +/- 26 x 10(9)/L on day 8 and returning to normal values on day 11. Overall, the apheretic collection yielded (mean +/- SD) 18.6 +/- 19.2 x 10(8)/kg donor body weight MNC; 10.4 +/- 5.7 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells; 90.6 +/- 75.9 x 10(4)/kg CFU-GM and 4.3 +/- 1.8 x 10(8)/kg CD3+ cells. The target dose of 4 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells was harvested in 51.3% donors after a single apheresis, in 85.5% after the second, and in nearly 100% after a maximum of 3 aphereses. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that collection of adequate numbers of circulating progenitors is feasible and well tolerated in healthy donors. However, only careful monitoring of donors and international cooperation will help to definitively assess the long-term safety of G-CSF for mobilization of PBSC.","['Majolino, I', 'Cavallaro, A M', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Falda, M', 'Locatelli, F', 'Raimondi, R', 'Pucci, G', 'Mordini, N', 'Barbui, T', 'Locatelli, F', 'Rodeghiero, F', 'Irrera, G', 'Indovina, A', 'Valbonesi, M', 'Bellavita, P', 'Tassi, V', 'Perotti, C', 'Soli, M', 'Bresolin, G']","['Majolino I', 'Cavallaro AM', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Rambaldi A', 'Falda M', 'Locatelli F', 'Raimondi R', 'Pucci G', 'Mordini N', 'Barbui T', 'Locatelli F', 'Rodeghiero F', 'Irrera G', 'Indovina A', 'Valbonesi M', 'Bellavita P', 'Tassi V', 'Perotti C', 'Soli M', 'Bresolin G']","['Ospedale Cervello, Palermo, Dipartimento di Ematologia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Donors', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Child', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukapheresis/*methods', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Safety']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Jan-Feb;82(1):47-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD34+ ALL displayed a significantly lower frequency of extramedullary involvement, a lower LDH level and lower WBC count, lower proliferative activity (as evaluated by the Ki67 monoclonal antibody) than CD34- ALL. CD34 expression was also associated with early phenotypes in both B- and T-ALL, co-expression of myeloid antigens, and the presence of the Ph1 chromosome. Due to a different distribution of prognostic factors investigated, DFS and OS were both significantly better in CD34+ than in CD34- childhood ALL, whereas no statistical difference was found in adults. Multivariate analyses confirmed these data in children. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Expression of the CD34 antigen is a positive prognostic factor in childhood ALL. In adult ALL the presence of this marker on leukemic cell does not seem to influence the clinical outcome of these patients.","['Cascavilla, N', 'Musto, P', ""D'Arena, G"", 'Ladogana, S', 'Matera, R', 'Carotenuto, M']","['Cascavilla N', 'Musto P', ""D'Arena G"", 'Ladogana S', 'Matera R', 'Carotenuto M']","['Division of Hematology, IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Hospital, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Jan-Feb;82(1):31-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to analysis the incidence and significance of monocytosis among our series of patients with MDS and correlate the distributions of these elements with other hematologic features. METHODS: We evaluated the monocytic component in myelodysplastic syndromes in order to clarify the significance of monocytosis in MDS and its relationship with CMMoL and other MDS. Monocytosis was defined as a percentage of blood monocytes greater than 10%. RESULTS: Among a series of 139 consecutive MDS patients, we describe a group of 29 (20.8%) patients with monocytosis and dysplastic features involving multiple cell lineages which do not fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of CMMoL or aCML. These patients, who do not differ from MDS without monocytosis in the main clinical parameters, are characterized by relatively higher leukocyte (WBC 6.6 x 10(9)/L) and granulocyte counts (PMN 2.5 x 10(9)/L), hypercellular bone marrow and relatively poor prognosis. Among these patients, we observed a particularly high incidence of evolution to CMMoL (34.5%) and AML (17.2%) with monocytic component (FAB M4 and M5). Cytogenetic data demonstrated clonal chromosome changes in 11/13 patients with MDS and monocytosis, while only 19/41 patients without monocytosis showed clonal abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: The combination of hematologic and cytogenetic features in our study suggests that it is reasonable to consider myelodysplasia with monocytosis as a distinct disease subset of MDS, characterized by multilineage dysplasia along with a higher incidence of karyotype aberrations. The multi-step pathogenetic process in these patients may have reached a more advanced stage at which the relative or absolute increase in the number of monocytes may represent the first event in the subsequent progression of the disease towards acute leukemia.","['Rigolin, G M', 'Cuneo, A', 'Roberti, M G', 'Bardi, A', 'Castoldi, G']","['Rigolin GM', 'Cuneo A', 'Roberti MG', 'Bardi A', 'Castoldi G']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Terapie Avanzate, Universita di Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Cell Lineage', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/blood/classification/pathology', 'Monocytes/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*classification/epidemiology/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Jan-Feb;82(1):25-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus we studied the relationship between bcl-2 protein expression, p53 gene mutations and in vitro drug sensitivity in CLL. METHODS: Fifty-three samples from untreated CLL patients in early disease stages were tested in vitro for chemosensitivity to chlorambucil (CLB), fludarabine (FAMP) and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA) using the MTT assay. Intracellular bcl-2 protein expression was evaluated by flow cytometry analysis. p53 gene mutations were detected by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. RESULTS: The median LD50 values were 1.55 microM, 4.41 microM and 58.2 microM for 2-CDA, FAMP and CLB, respectively. About 23%, 41% and 11% of samples were defined as being sensitive to FAMP, 2-CDA and CLB, respectively, when samples were clustered for LD50 threshold values corresponding to the plasmatic levels of the drug. No statistically significant difference in bcl-2 protein expression was noted between sensitive and resistant samples for each drug. A p53 gene mutation was detected in 4 of the 30 cases studies and all of them were among samples resistant to CLB. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Bcl-2 expression is not an indicator of in vitro response to drugs in CLL; similarly, although the four cases showing a p53 gene mutation were associated with CLB resistance, drug resistant samples were also observed in the group of patients showing wild type p53, suggesting multiple mechanisms of drug resistance in CLL.","['Morabito, F', 'Filangeri, M', 'Callea, I', 'Sculli, G', 'Callea, V', 'Fracchiolla, N S', 'Neri, A', 'Brugiatelli, M']","['Morabito F', 'Filangeri M', 'Callea I', 'Sculli G', 'Callea V', 'Fracchiolla NS', 'Neri A', 'Brugiatelli M']","['Dipartimento di Emato-Oncologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Melacrino-Bianchi-Morelli, Reggio Calabria, Italy. sp0040@relay.it.net']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/*pharmacology', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Jan-Feb;82(1):16-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The long term cancer risk in a cohort of 7,761 Danish employees who had been working for some time (median 19.7 months) in Greenland during the period 1955-1978 was studied. During a total of 162,300 person-years (average 20.9 years) of follow-up ending on December 31, 1992, the number of cancers observed was 732 vs. 669 expected (relative risk (RR) = 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.18). Whereas the men did not experience any unusual cancer incidence at any cancer site, the women were at elevated risk of developing breast cancer (RR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8 (n = 96)); malignant melanoma (RR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-2.9 (n = 16)); and lymphatic and hematopoietic malignancies (RR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.8 (n = 16)). Exposure during adulthood to a high-incidence area for cervical cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and tumors of the major salivary glands did not confer any measurable increase in the risk for these virus-associated cancers. Postponement of childbearing might explain part of the elevated breast cancer risk. Intensive exposure to ultraviolet light, that is likely to explain the increased risk of malignant melanoma among the women, might also be involved in the excess incidence of lymphatic and hematopoietic malignancies observed in these women. However, why the men did not experience similar alterations in the risk of melanoma and cancers of the immune system is enigmatic.","['Nielsen, L G', 'Frisch, M', 'Melbye, M']","['Nielsen LG', 'Frisch M', 'Melbye M']","['Department of Epidemiology Research, Danish Epidemiology Science Centre, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Sweden,Scand J Soc Med,Scandinavian journal of social medicine,0365610,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Carcinoma/epidemiology', 'Denmark/ethnology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Greenland/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Risk', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Virus Diseases/complications']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/140349489702500110 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Soc Med. 1997 Mar;25(1):44-9. doi: 10.1177/140349489702500110.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeted mutagenesis in embryonic stem cells has been used to introduce a germ-line null mutation into this gene. This mutation removes a domain critical for virus binding and inactivates amino acid transport activity. Homozygous mutant pups generated from these cells were approximately 25% smaller than normal littermates, very anemic, and died on the day of birth. Peripheral blood from homozygotes contained 50% fewer red blood cells, reduced hemoglobin levels, and showed a pronounced normoblastosis. Histological analyses of bone marrow, spleen, and liver showed a decrease in both erythroid progenitors and mature red blood cells. Mutant fetal liver cells behaved normally in in vitro hematopoietic colony-forming assays but generated an anemia when transplanted into irradiated C.B.-17 SCID mice. Furthermore, reconstitution of the white cell compartment of SCID mice by mutant fetal liver cells was less complete than that observed with a mixed population of wild-type and heterozygous fetal liver cells. Primary embryo fibroblasts from mutant mice were completely resistant to ecotropic retrovirus infection.

CldAdo at 6-16 nM was toxic to cells within 24 hr, which is in contrast to 300 nM ddC, which had no effect on cell growth for the first 4 days of treatment. Cellular lactic acid production was used to monitor concomitant perturbations in oxidative phosphorylation during drug treatment. Unlike the delayed increase in lactate observed with ddC exposure, CldAdo-treated cells exhibited a 2-2.4-fold increase in lactate levels after 2 days of exposure to 16 nM CldAdo. By days 4 and 7, however, lactate production returned to control levels. Shorter incubations with CldAdo revealed that lactate levels began to increase within 12 hr of drug exposure, paralleling cytotoxicity. We also examined mitochondrial DNA content during drug treatment by competitive polymerase chain reaction. ddC (300 nM) reduced mitochondrial DNA levels from approximately 1000 copies/untreated cell to approximately 130 copies/cell after 7 days of exposure. In contrast, cytotoxic doses of CldAdo had little or no effect on mitochondrial DNA content during the 1-week incubation. Thus, the early CldAdo-induced perturbation of mitochondrial function was not associated with a loss of mitochondrial DNA per cell. In addition, no evidence of DNA laddering, indicative of cellular apoptosis, was detected at these dosage levels and treatment times.","['Hentosh, P', 'Tibudan, M']","['Hentosh P', 'Tibudan M']","['Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Biology, Chicago Medical School, North Chicago, Illinois 60064, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.51.4.613 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1997 Apr;51(4):613-9. doi: 10.1124/mol.51.4.613.,,,,,['CA55414/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike other chemically induced erythroleukemia cell differentiation, no c-myc mRNA down-regulation was observed in the early phases of drug treatment. Among the heme-synthesizing enzyme mRNAs that were analyzed, only that of the erythroid-specific delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS-E) was stimulated. Vanadate or benzylphosphonic acid, which inhibited protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPase), blocked the camptothecin-induced differentiation. Maximal inhibition was attained if vanadate was added within the first 6 hr of camptothecin treatment, after which vanadate gradually lost its effectiveness. Camptothecin-induced expression of beta-globin or ALAS-E transcript levels was inhibited in the presence of cycloheximide or vanadate. It was also shown that vanadate blocked differentiation of IW32 cells induced by sodium butyrate, VM-26, and p53. Increased PTPase activity could be observed 48 hr after cells were treated with camptothecin, VM-26, or sodium butyrate. Analysis of PTPase activity in the course of camptothecin treatment showed elevated levels of PTPase in the cytosol and the nucleus, with a greater increase demonstrated in the cytosol than in the nucleus.

The LP-BM5 murine leukemia-infected mice, which develop immunological and cognitive deficits reminiscent of human HIV-1 infection, were employed to investigate the changes in brain constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. Cerebellar and striatal cNOS enzymatic activity increased approximately 70% as early as 2 weeks after infection, declining to control levels by 12-16 weeks. In contrast, cNOS protein expression in the striatum and cerebellum was decreased 30% at 4 weeks, declining to 50% of control levels by 16 weeks post-infection. Staining intensity for cNOS, but not neuron number was reduced in the cerebral cortex, striatum, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and amygdala. Although iNOS protein expression was elevated in splenic monocytes, neither iNOS activity, mRNA nor protein was detected in the brains of mice 12 weeks after infection. These results indicate that neurons decrease cNOS protein expression to compensate for chronic cNOS activation, probably resulting from glutamatergic stimulation.

The first step in this hypothesis is associated with a small subset of resident microglial cells that serve as the principal target cells for ts1 MoMuLV infection. The second step is likely linked to trophic events, probably mediated by cytokines, that lead to hypertrophy and activation of a substantial number of additional microglial cells (autocrine effect) and adjacent astrocytes (paracrine effect). The third step in this hypothesis appears related to indirect neuronal degeneration mediated by cytotoxins produced by activated microglial cells and astrocytes. In this last step, motor neurons located within these foci of activated microglial cells and astrocytes are 'innocent bystander cells' and degenerate and die due to paracrine effects. The mechanism of motor neuron degeneration is poorly understood but is likely linked to a sequential cascade of trophic factors and cytokines resulting in a final common pathway for motor neuron death involving production of oxidative radicals, excitatory aminoacid neurotransmitter-like substances, prostaglandins, or nitric oxide.","['Zachary, J F', 'Baszler, T V', 'French, R A', 'Kelley, K W']","['Zachary JF', 'Baszler TV', 'French RA', 'Kelley KW']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois, Urbana, USA. zacharyj@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Mol Psychiatry,Molecular psychiatry,9607835,['0 (Cytotoxins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Brain Stem/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microglia/metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Motor Neuron Disease/etiology/pathology/*virology', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurons/*pathology', 'Retroviridae Infections/complications/pathology/*virology', 'Spinal Cord/pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/complications/pathology/*virology']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.mp.4000219 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Psychiatry. 1997 Mar;2(2):104-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.mp.4000219.,,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the common reasons given by physicians is that the process of ""getting a DNR"" takes too long, and some authorities have suggested that additional reimbursement is needed. The purpose of this study is to assess how long the DNR education and consent process actually takes in practice. Our study group was a convenience sample of consecutive patients seen by experienced oncologists in a community and academic practice setting. Physicians were asked to record the time spent in DNR discussions with patients, the outcomes, and their comments. DNR orders were obtained on 16 of 22 patients with a single interview lasting a mean time of 16 minutes. Additional DNR orders were obtained on two more patients after a second interview of 6 patients, mean time 17.5 minutes. After a third interview of 4 patients, mean time 23 minutes, only 2 of 22 patients would not allow DNR orders. Of these two, one died intubated in the intensive care unit and the other underwent continued unsuccessful induction therapy for acute leukemia before dying. CONCLUSION: DNR orders can be obtained on nearly all patients within the time frame of an inpatient or outpatient visit. Time is not the main obstacle to DNR discussions, and additional reimbursement for additional time is not necessary. A small subset of patients continue to refuse DNR orders. Physician and patient reluctance to broach the subject may be a bigger impediment than time.","['Smith, T J', 'Desch, C E', 'Hackney, M H', 'Shaw, J E']","['Smith TJ', 'Desch CE', 'Hackney MH', 'Shaw JE']","['Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Palliat Care,Journal of palliative care,8610345,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', 'Male', '*Medical Oncology', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Education as Topic', '*Physician-Patient Relations', 'Reimbursement Mechanisms', '*Resuscitation Orders', 'Time and Motion Studies']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Palliat Care. 1997 Spring;13(1):5-8.,,,,,['CO 94388-63/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,['KIE: 55734'],['KIE'],"['Death and Euthanasia', 'Empirical Approach']","['KIE: KIE BoB Subject Heading: resuscitation orders', 'KIE: Full author name: Smith, Thomas J', 'KIE: Full author name: Desch, Christopher E', 'KIE: Full author name: Hackney, Mary Helen', 'KIE: Full author name: Shaw, James E']",

Little information is available on the degree of functional redundancy between these two ligands in terms of target selectivity and intracellular signalling pathway(s). To address these issues, we have expressed and characterized recombinant mouse TRAIL. Specific detection with newly developed rabbit anti-TRAIL antibodies showed that the functional TRAIL molecule released into the supernatant of recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells is very similar to that associated with the membrane fraction of Sf9 cells. CD95L resistant myeloma cells were found to be sensitive to TRAIL, displaying apoptotic features similar to those of the CD95L- and TRAIL-sensitive T leukemia cells Jurkat. To assess if IL-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE) and/or ICE-related proteases (IRPs) (caspases) are involved in TRAIL-induced apoptosis of both cell types, peptide inhibition experiments were performed. The irreversible IRP/caspase-inhibitor Ac-YVAD-cmk and the reversible IRP/caspase-inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO blocked the morphological changes, disorganization of plasma membrane phospholipids, DNA fragmentation, and loss of cell viability associated with TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In addition, cells undergoing TRAIL-mediated apoptosis displayed cleavage of poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) that was completely blocked by Ac-DEVD-CHO. These results indicate that TRAIL seems to complement the activity of the CD95 system as it allows cells, otherwise resistant, to undergo apoptosis triggered by specific extracellular ligands. Conversely, however, induction of apoptosis in sensitive cells by TRAIL involves IRPs/caspases in a fashion similar to CD95L. Thus, differential sensitivity to CD95L and TRAIL seems to map to the proximal signaling events associated with receptor triggering.","['Mariani, S M', 'Matiba, B', 'Armandola, E A', 'Krammer, P H']","['Mariani SM', 'Matiba B', 'Armandola EA', 'Krammer PH']","['Tumor Immunology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (N-acetyl-tyrosyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl chloromethyl ketone)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tnfsf10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Caspase 1', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/enzymology', '*Lymphoma, B-Cell', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multiple Myeloma', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology/*metabolism', 'fas Receptor/immunology/metabolism']",1997/04/07 00:00,1997/04/07 00:01,['1997/04/07 00:00'],"['1997/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.137.1.221 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1997 Apr 7;137(1):221-9. doi: 10.1083/jcb.137.1.221.,,,PMC2139852,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In each case, mutations arise predominantly at the N-RAS locus. These observations suggest a fundamental role for this oncogene in leukemogenesis. However, despite its obvious significance, little is known of how this key oncogene may subvert the process of hematopoiesis in human cells. Using CD34+ progenitor cells, we have modeled the preleukemic state by infecting these cells with amphotropic retrovirus expressing mutant N-RAS together with the selectable marker gene lacZ. Expression of the lacZ gene product, beta-galactosidase, allows direct identification and study of N-RAS-expressing cells by incubating infected cultures with a fluorogenic substrate for beta-galactosidase, which gives rise to a fluorescent signal within the infected cells. By using multiparameter flow cytometry, we have studied the ability of CD34+ cells expressing mutant N-RAS to undergo erythroid differentiation induced by erythropoietin. By this means, we have found that erythroid progenitor cells expressing mutant N-RAS exhibit a proliferative defect resulting in an increased cell doubling time and a decrease in the proportion of cells in S + G2M phase of the cell cycle. This is linked to a slowing in the rate of differentiation as determined by comparative cell-surface marker analysis and ultimate failure of the differentiation program at the late-erythroblast stage of development. The dyserythropoiesis was also linked to an increased tendency of the RAS-expressing cells to undergo programmed cell death during their differentiation program. This erythroid lineage dysplasia recapitulates one of the most common features of myelodysplastic syndrome, and for the first time provides a causative link between mutational activation of N-RAS and the pathogenesis of preleukemia.","['Darley, R L', 'Hoy, T G', 'Baines, P', 'Padua, R A', 'Burnett, A K']","['Darley RL', 'Hoy TG', 'Baines P', 'Padua RA', 'Burnett AK']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Antigens, CD34', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/genetics', 'Preleukemia/etiology/*genetics']",1997/04/07 00:00,1997/04/07 00:01,['1997/04/07 00:00'],"['1997/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.185.7.1337 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1997 Apr 7;185(7):1337-47. doi: 10.1084/jem.185.7.1337.,,,PMC2196261,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Varicella vaccination has been proven by several workers to be effective in both healthy children and adults as well as in leukaemic children. As the vaccine had not been licensed for sale in Singapore, we could only import 10 doses of the vaccine under special license. This was given to 8 leukaemic children. Of this, 5 seroconverted after the first dose. Two patients had the benefit of a repeat vaccination 3 months later. Both subsequently seroconverted. Two of the patients died from a relapse of the illness, a year and 2 years after the vaccination. None of the patients developed any side effects of fever and pain or varicella or zoster after the immunisation even though there was close contact with chicken pox.

The major dependent variables are symptoms of anxiety and posttraumatic stress, family functioning, and social support. Multivariate analyses of covariance indicated significantly more posttraumatic stress symptoms in mothers and fathers of childhood leukemia survivors (p < .001) and no differences between survivors and peers. There were no significant group differences for family functioning or social support, although they were associated with anxiety and posttraumatic stress outcomes. Current child age, age at diagnosis, and months off treatment were not significantly correlated with outcome. These findings document the long-term impact of childhood cancer treatment on parents. The lack of significant differences for survivors argues for further attention to the relevance of posttraumatic stress disorder for childhood cancer survivors. The clinical implications are that psychological interventions are needed during and after cancer treatment.","['Kazak, A E', 'Barakat, L P', 'Meeske, K', 'Christakis, D', 'Meadows, A T', 'Casey, R', 'Penati, B', 'Stuber, M L']","['Kazak AE', 'Barakat LP', 'Meeske K', 'Christakis D', 'Meadows AT', 'Casey R', 'Penati B', 'Stuber ML']","[""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-4399, USA. kazak@kermit.oncol.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Consult Clin Psychol,Journal of consulting and clinical psychology,0136553,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', '*Family Health', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*psychology', 'Sampling Studies', '*Social Support', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'United States/epidemiology']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1037//0022-006x.65.1.120 [doi]'],ppublish,J Consult Clin Psychol. 1997 Feb;65(1):120-9. doi: 10.1037//0022-006x.65.1.120.,,,,,['63930/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

PML-RAR alpha is invariably transcribed and is believed to mediate leukaemogenesis. PML was initially considered to be a transcription factor. However, characterisation of other RING finger containing proteins shows no direct evidence for DNA binding. The RING, B-box, and coiled-coil domains are more likely to represent sites of protein-protein interaction and may be critical for the stability of the multiprotein nuclear domains of which PML is an integral part. In APL the nuclear bodies become disrupted, presumably as a consequence of the presence of PML-RAR alpha and aberrant PML proteins that might render the structure unstable. PML-RAR alpha is capable of binding RXR and sequestering it into the disrupted nuclear domains. Sequestration of RXR would be expected to limit high affinity binding of VDR, TR and residual RARs to DNA response elements and might account for the block in myeloid differentiation at the promyelocyte stage that characterizes APL. Recently PML has been found to have growth suppressor/anti-oncogenic activity. It is unclear whether this is a property of PML itself or reflects a nonspecific function of the PML-associated nuclear domains. Hence the PML/RAR alpha rearrangement alone may be sufficient to cause APL. Abnormal PML function may prevent its growth-suppressor activity, leading to leukaemic transformation; concomitant disruption of retinoid pathways due to sequestration of RXR and/or an abnormal repertoire and character of response element activation mediated by the fusion protein, causing the block in myeloid differentiation (Fig. 3). Disruption of RAR alpha would be expected to account for the similar leukaemic phenotype associated with the t(5;17) and t(11;17) APL cytogenetic variants. Further characterisation of NPM and PLZF at the structural and functional level will determine whether PML and other proteins disrupted in APL associated translocations play an active or purely permissive role in leukaemogenesis and will help dissect the events leading to transformation from those causing blockade of myeloid differentiation and mediating the response to ATRA.","['Grimwade, D', 'Solomon, E']","['Grimwade D', 'Solomon E']","['Somatic Cell Genetics Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics/*ultrastructure', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/physiology', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-60479-9_6 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 1997;220:81-112. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-60479-9_6.,,153,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vivo studies demonstrated that DMPC/Chol liposomes released drug faster (1.7 microg drug/microg lipid/hr) than did DSPC/Chol liposomes (<0.025 microg drug/microg lipid/hr). In BDF1 mice, the acute toxicities of DMPC/Chol and DSPC/Chol liposomal mitoxantrone were similar, with a maximum tolerated dose of approximately 30 mg drug/kg, in comparison with the maximum tolerated dose of free drug, which was approximately 10 mg/kg. Efficacy studies were conducted in BDF1 mice inoculated i.v. with murine P388 cells or L1210 tumor cells. These cells seed in the liver and spleen of animals after i.v. inoculation, and a single dose of DMPC/Chol liposomal mitoxantrone of 10 mg drug/kg resulted in 100% of the treated animals surviving for >60 days. In contrast, no long-term survivors were obtained in any other treatment group, even when drug doses were escalated to the maximum tolerated dose. Pharmacodynamic studies with DMPC/Chol liposomal mitoxantrone and DSPC/Chol liposomal mitoxantrone illustrate the importance of achieving a balance between drug release characteristics and drug delivery to the site of tumor progression.","['Lim, H J', 'Masin, D', 'Madden, T D', 'Bally, M B']","['Lim HJ', 'Masin D', 'Madden TD', 'Bally MB']","['Division of Medical Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Carriers', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitoxantrone/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1997 Apr;281(1):566-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The capacity of this transporter subtype to release nucleosides from L1210/MA27.1 cells was investigated with the poorly metabolized inosine analog [3H]formycin B. Uptake of [3H]formycin B into these cells was inhibited by replacement of Na+ in the buffer with choline, or by blocking Na+/K+ ATPase with 2 mM ouabain, inhibiting glycolysis with 5 mM iodoacetic acid or inhibiting nucleoside transport with 1 mM phloridzin. Sodium stimulated uptake with an EC50 value of 12 mM. To measure release of [3H]formycin B, cells were loaded with [3H]formycin B (10 microM) then washed and resuspended in buffer. Replacement of Na+ in the buffer with choline enhanced [3H]formycin B release by 20 to 47%, and significant stimulation of release was observed with Na+ concentrations of 30 mM or less. Resuspending loaded cells into Na+ buffer containing 2 mM ouabain or 10 microM monensin, a Na+ ionophore, significantly enhanced [3H]formycin B release during 20 min by 39% or 29%, respectively. Release of [3H]formycin B into choline buffer was inhibited 26.5% by 10 mM phloridzin and 39.6% by 10 mM propentofylline, compounds known to inhibit various transporters including Na+-dependent nucleoside transporters. Release was also inhibited significantly by 100 microM concentrations of dilazep, dipyridamole and nitrobenzylthioinosine, inhibitors with selectivity for Na+-independent nucleoside transporters. In the absence of Na+, the permeants adenosine and uridine enhanced [3H]formycin B release by up to 40.9% and 21.4%, respectively. These data indicate that in the absence of an inwardly directed Na+ gradient, Na+-dependent nucleoside transporters can function in the release of nucleosides.","['Borgland, S L', 'Parkinson, F E']","['Borgland SL', 'Parkinson FE']","['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Formycins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '13877-76-4 (formycin B)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Formycins/*pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins', 'Sodium/*physiology', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1997 Apr;281(1):347-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L-selectin, cutaneous lymphocyte-associated Ag (CLA), and integrin alpha4beta7 are proposed to be involved in selective migration of T cell subsets into peripheral lymph nodes, skin, and gastrointestinal mucosa, respectively. Adult T cell leukemia (ATL) is associated with lymphoid infiltration of tissues and secondary lymphoid organs. To clarify the role of these putative homing molecules in vivo, we assessed their expression on circulating ATL cells from patients with lymph node, skin, and gut involvement. L-selectin expression was significantly higher on peripheral ATL cells in patients with lymphadenopathy than in patients without it. CLA was highly expressed on peripheral ATL cells compared with normal T cells: its expression was also significantly higher on peripheral ATL cells from patients with skin involvement compared with cells from patients without it. beta7 was particularly highly expressed on peripheral ATL cells from patients with gastrointestinal involvement. In summary, the differential expression of beta7 and beta1 on peripheral ATL cells correlates with the presence of gastrointestinal involvement. Similarly, the presence of skin involvement is associated with the expression of CLA(high)beta7low on peripheral ATL cells. These results, which are consistent with the molecules CLA and alpha4beta7 mediating preferential T cell migration to the skin and gastrointestinal mucosa, respectively, may allow for a refinement of the classification of lymphoid neoplasms on the basis of differential expression of homing molecules.","['Tanaka, Y', 'Wake, A', 'Horgan, K J', 'Murakami, S', 'Aso, M', 'Saito, K', 'Oda, S', 'Morimoto, I', 'Uno, H', 'Kikuchi, H', 'Izumi, Y', 'Eto, S']","['Tanaka Y', 'Wake A', 'Horgan KJ', 'Murakami S', 'Aso M', 'Saito K', 'Oda S', 'Morimoto I', 'Uno H', 'Kikuchi H', 'Izumi Y', 'Eto S']","['The First Department of Internal Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan, School of Medicine, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu. tanaka@med.uoeh-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Cell Movement', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology']",1997/04/15 00:00,1997/04/15 00:01,['1997/04/15 00:00'],"['1997/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Apr 15;158(8):3822-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neurological symptomatology in patients with CNS leukemia is due to meningeal infiltration, but sometimes also to diffuse and nodular cerebral infiltration. Between January 1991 and December 1994, 36 patients suffering of acute leukemia, 28 with ALL, and 8 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were demonstrated to have neuroleukemia by the following criteria: (1) the presence at lumbar puncture (LP) pleocytosis and blast cells on CSF sediment (without positive bacteriologic and fungal cultures), and (2) the presence of neurological symptoms and signs. All 36 patients had 46 episodes of CNS involvement. All patients had neurological examinations during every episode, and according to the neurological abnormalities were classified into four categories. LP was performed in all, and CSF sediments obtained by sedimentation in Sayk's chambers, were routinely stained by MGG and cytochemical stains to detection of leukemic cells (Fig. 1). EEG was done during 21 episodes, CT scan during 15. We divided patients into four groups according to the most prominent neurological symptoms and signs. First was the group included 23 episodes (50%), (18 ALL, 5 AML), where symptoms and signs of meningeal irritation predominated, mimicking the clinical picture of meningitis. This meningeal syndrome can sometimes produce differential diagnostic problems with CNS infections, when CSF examination is of primary importance. Second was the group of 9 patients (6 ALL and 3 AML) with 10 episodes (21.74%) where cranial nerve symptoms and signs-predominated, or were exclusively present. Most frequently affected were bulbomotors, facials and opticus. Third group consisted of 8 ALL patients (8 episodes, 17.39%) with dominant spinal root symptomatology, caused by pathological infiltration of either spinal roots or meninges surrounding them. This group includes also one patient with mononeuritis multiplex and the other with painful polyneuropathy. All patients in this group had pain on straight leg raising, but we stress here that all patients from other groups had positive Lazarevitsh's sign, too. So, it can be a good differential diagnostic parameter for distinguishing toxic medicamentous polyneuropathy from leukemic poliradiculoneuropathy. Fourth group included 5 patients (5 episodes, 10.87%). 4 ALL and 1 AML, where cerebral symptoms, such as seizures, hemiparesis and psychoorganic syndromes were prominent. CSF was obtained during all episodes by lumbar puncture. The protein concentration ranged from 21-3180 mg/dl, and was above normal (45 mg/dl) during 28 episodes. Mild hypoglycoracchia was present during 16 episodes. Cell count ranged from 11-4816 cells/cm3, malignant cells were identified during all episodes with same morphological and cytochemical characteristics of identified type of leukaemia. It has been established that the most valuable diagnostic procedure in CNS leukemia is CSF examination, and detection of blasts is sufficient for diagnosis. All other procedures like EEG, myelography and CT have only supplemental diagnostic significance. Finally, in this study we showed that neurological symptomatology in patients with acute leukemia is not dependent of the type of leukemia, moreover different types of AL can have same neurological manifestations.

The clinical results in 41 patients].,201-6,"BACKGROUND: A single-center experience using autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) as postremission therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1) in 41 patients is analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From July 1986 to March 1994, 41 patients with AML in CR1 underwent an ABMT. Source of hematopoietic stem cells was bone marrow in all cases. In eleven patients the marrow was purged with mafosfamide (ASTA-Z 7654). Median age was 31 years (17-59) and median time from CR to ABMT was 7 months (3-27). Busulfan (16 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) was employed as conditioning regimen in 36 patients. The rest 5 patients were prepared with cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and fractioned total body irradiation (12 Gy). Eleven patients received G-CSF after AMBT because of an absolute neutrophil count lower than 0.5 x 10(9) on day +30. Survival analysis was performed according to the methods of Kaplan and Meier and comparison between groups used the log-rank test. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 26 months (12-75) 21 patients remain alive in CR. Disease-free survival (DFS) at five years was 40% (95% CI: 25-55%). Transplant-related mortality, mainly for infection and hemorrhage, occurred in 6/41 patients (16%). Leukemia relapse was the main cause of treatment failure: 14/35 (40%). Probability of DFS and relapse was similar for those patients with purged ABMT on unpurged ABMT 45 +/- 23% vs 38 +/- 16% and 37 +/- 14% vs 54 +/- 22% respectively. A significantly longer engraftment time for neutrophils (> 0.5 x 10(9)) and platelets (> 20 x 10(9)) was observed in those patients who received a bone marrow treated with mafosfamide compared with the unpurged group (54 vs 29 days for neutrophils and 102 vs 58 for platelets respectively) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ABMT is a feasible treatment for AML in CR1. Using bone marrow as hematopoietic stem cell support we observed that delayed engraftment was a common finding among AML patients, specially when the marrow was treatment with mafosfamide. Leukemia relapse remains as the main cause of treatment failure for ABMT.","['Tomas, J F', 'Gomez-Garcia de Soria, V', 'Pinilla, I', 'Lamana, M', 'Figuera, A', 'Arranz, R', 'Camara, R', 'Fernandez-Villalta, M J', 'Alegre, A', 'Fernandez-Ranada, J M']","['Tomas JF', 'Gomez-Garcia de Soria V', 'Pinilla I', 'Lamana M', 'Figuera A', 'Arranz R', 'Camara R', 'Fernandez-Villalta MJ', 'Alegre A', 'Fernandez-Ranada JM']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Madrid.']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1997/02/15 00:00,1997/02/15 00:01,['1997/02/15 00:00'],"['1997/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1997 Feb 15;108(6):201-6.,['Med Clin (Barc). 1997 Feb 15;108(6):221-3.

The transfection activity of the cationic liposomes composed of N-(alpha-trimethylammonioacetyl)-didodecyl-D-glutamate chloride (TMAG), dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) and dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC) (1:2:2, molar ratio) (TMAG-liposome) and liposomes composed of phosphatidylserine (PS) (PS-liposome) was evaluated by the luciferase assay using a plasmid which contains the coding sequence of firefly luciferase under the control of the SR alpha promoter (pSR alpha/L-A delta 5). The TMAG-liposome gave highly efficient transfection in the presence of serum. On the other hand, PS-liposome showed inferior efficiency. When BLV-infected cells were co-transfected with a fixed amount of pSR alpha/L-A delta 5-entrapped TMAG-liposome and various amount of pLTR-DT-containing TMAG-liposome, the luciferase activity in the BLV-infected cells was inhibited by the addition of pLTR-DT-entrapped TMAG-liposome dose-dependently. The cationic TMAG-liposome containing pLTR-DT was successively added to BLV-infected cells in culture. The number of viable cells was markedly reduced by the cationic TMAG-liposome containing pLTR-DT. On the other hand, TMAG-liposome containing pSR alpha/L-A delta 5 showed no such effect. pLTR-DT entrapped by the cationic TMAG-liposome was not digested by the treatment with DNase I and with serum. These results suggest that the cationic liposomes, such as TMAG-liposome, may be efficient transfection reagent for the BLV-infected cells and can be utilized for DT-A gene delivery into the BLV-infected cells in vivo.","['Lee, J T', 'Watarai, S', 'Kakidani, H', 'Onuma, M', 'Zhao, D D', 'Yasuda, T']","['Lee JT', 'Watarai S', 'Kakidani H', 'Onuma M', 'Zhao DD', 'Yasuda T']","['Department of Cell Chemistry, Okayama University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,"['0 (Cations)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (diphtheria toxin fragment A)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cations', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/pharmacology', 'Diphtheria Toxin/*administration & dosage/*genetics', 'Drug Carriers', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/genetics/therapy', 'Genes, Viral/genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/methods/veterinary', 'Kidney/embryology/pathology/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Liposomes', 'Luciferases/analysis', 'Peptide Fragments/*administration & dosage/*genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Sheep', 'Transfection/*methods']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1292/jvms.59.169 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 1997 Mar;59(3):169-74. doi: 10.1292/jvms.59.169.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA repair and programmed cell death both function using different mechanisms to protect the organism from the consequences of extensive cellular damage; however, little is known about the relationship of the DNA BER repair pathway to apoptosis. We have determined the relationship of a BER DNA repair enzyme, APE, to apoptosis using the myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60, which can be induced to differentiate down the granulocytic or monocytic/ macrophage pathway. Treatment of HL-60 cells with retinoic acid/DMSO (granulocytic) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (monocytic) results in apoptosis and in down-regulation of APE expression at both the RNA and protein levels. Moreover, double-labeling experiments using APE immunohistochemistry and the terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-fluorescein nick end labeling assay for apoptosis demonstrate that individual cells undergoing apoptosis lose expression of APE regardless of their state of differentiation. Blocking apoptosis by overexpression of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene in HL-60 cells or by a bcr-abl-related mechanism in K562 cells and subsequent differentiation results in morphological differentiation but no loss of APE expression.

High IFN-gamma R expression is a marker for the T cell stress that precedes apoptosis. In this paper, we show that a 12- to 24-h culture of three human malignant T-cell lines displaying distinct differentiation stages (ST4, PF382, and Jurkat) in medium supplemented with four chemotherapy drugs (etoposide, cisplatin, cytarabine, and daunomycin) up-modulates their IFN-gamma R expression followed by their apoptosis after 24-48 h later. Increased IFN-gamma R expression (by at least an order of magnitude) was observed in 30 to 90% of cells during exposure to pharmacologic drug concentrations.

Gaudio, G. Geraci and P. Manduca (1986) Inhibition of dimethyl sulfoxide induced erythropoietic differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells in culture. Cancer Res., 46, 6260-6263). We show here the occurrence of another period of sensitivity during the initial 5 h after the addition of the inducer dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the culture medium. The sensitivity to the mutagenic action of a sublethal 3-s pulse of UV light (13.5 J/m2) was monitored on the progeny of the irradiated cells at day 5 after the start of induction. The effects were analysed on functions strictly linked to the final expression of the differentiated phenotype: hemoglobin concentration, percent cells producing hemoglobin (%B+), activity of delta-amino levulinic acid dehydrase (ALA-DH) and presence of globins. Each function appeared differently and selectively affected in the progeny of the cells depending on the exact time of irradiation during the period of sensitivity Specifically, cells irradiated at hour 3 after induction show both hemoglobin concentration and ALA-DH activity values increased by a factor 3 over controls. Cells irradiated at hour 5 show an almost complete halt in cell induction and the other tested functions show minimal values. Cells are nearly insensitive to irradiation at later times, until hour 20, after which a second period of sensitivity with peak value at hour 22 occurs at which time hemoglobin concentration in the progeny of irradiated cells is increased by a factor 3 over controls, ALA-DH activity is increased by a factor 15 while percent B+ value is at its minimum. The differential effects of UV irradiation on Mel cell functions in the first and in the second period of sensitivity to mutagens confirm the hypothesis that the consequences of a mutational event are strictly dependent on the functional state of the cell. The 1-5 h period of sensitivity in which Mel cells fix the effects of the mutagen in their genome corresponds to increased thymidine incorporation not correlated with cell duplication.","['Foresti, M', 'Paoletti, I', 'Mele, F', 'Geraci, G']","['Foresti M', 'Paoletti I', 'Mele F', 'Geraci G']","['Dipartimento di Genetica, Biologia Generale e Molecolare, Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 4.2.1.24 (Porphobilinogen Synthase)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', '*Mutagenesis', 'Porphobilinogen Synthase/metabolism', 'S Phase', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",1997/03/21 00:00,1997/03/21 00:01,['1997/03/21 00:00'],"['1997/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0027-5107(96)00242-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0027-5107(96)00242-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1997 Mar 21;374(2):269-75. doi: 10.1016/s0027-5107(96)00242-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 40-year summary.",467-73,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the applicability of the cytologic examination of serous fluids in the management of malignant neoplasms in children. STUDY DESIGN: A review of the reports of all cytologic specimens of pleural, peritoneal and pericardial fluids from children examined in our laboratory during a 40-year period. A total of 226 specimens from 146 patients under 18 years old with a documented neoplasm were analyzed by diagnosis and fluid type. The data were tabulated and analyzed in a format that allowed comparison with the results of earlier studies. RESULTS: Eighty-eight specimens (39%) from 66 patients (45%) were suspicious or positive for malignancy. The positive specimens included lymphoma and leukemia (52%), neuroblastoma (14%), Wilms' tumor (9%), gonadal and extragonadal germ cell neoplasms (8%), bone and soft tissue sarcomas (7%), epithelial neoplasms (5%), Ewing's sarcoma (2%) and other neoplasms (3%). Positive results were obtained in 47% (66/139) of pleural fluids, 23% (15/65) of ascitic fluids, 27% (4/15) of peritoneal washings and 43% (3/7) of pericardial fluids. CONCLUSION: Cytologic examination of serous fluids is a simple and useful procedure in the management of pediatric neoplasms. This study showed a higher proportion of positive effusion cytology with lymphoma/leukemia and a lower proportion with sarcoma as compared with earlier reports. Pleural fluids were the most common specimen type and showed the highest proportion of positivity.","['Wong, J W', 'Pitlik, D', 'Abdul-Karim, F W']","['Wong JW', 'Pitlik D', 'Abdul-Karim FW']","['Institute of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Ascites/*pathology', 'Body Fluids/cytology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Male', 'Neuroblastoma/pathology', 'Pericardial Effusion/*pathology', 'Peritoneal Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Pleural Effusion/*pathology', 'Pleural Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma/pathology', 'Sex Distribution', 'Wilms Tumor/pathology']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000332540 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Cytol. 1997 Mar-Apr;41(2):467-73. doi: 10.1159/000332540.,,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) smears of 258 cases of cysticercosis, 35 of lymphatic filariasis and 19 of nonparasitic lesions with significant eosinophils were screened for the presence of CLC and correlated with the cytomorphology of the underlying disease. RESULTS: Charcot-Leyden crystals were seen in lymphatic filariasis (4), eosinophilic granuloma (1), chronic myelogenous leukemia (1) and pyogenic abscess (1). CLC were conspicuous by their absence in smears of cysticercosis, although cholesterol crystals were frequently observed. CLC were present in both May-Grunwald-Giemsa- and Papanicolaou-stained smears. Necrosis was a prominent cytologic feature in all cases with CLC. CONCLUSION: CLC encountered in routinely processed aspirates containing eosinophils, albeit infrequently, indicate in vivo formation. Necrosis probably provides a milieu for suspension of eosinophils, facilitating the formation of CLC. Absence of CLC in cysticercosis could be attributed to the high lipid content of these lesions, as indicated by the frequent occurrence of cholesterol crystals.","['Arora, V K', 'Singh, N', 'Bhatia, A']","['Arora VK', 'Singh N', 'Bhatia A']","['Department of Pathology, University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.1.1.5 (Lysophospholipase)', 'EC 3.1.1.5 (lysolecithin acylhydrolase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Child, Preschool', 'Crystallization', 'Cysticercosis/diagnosis/pathology', 'Elephantiasis, Filarial/diagnosis/pathology', 'Eosinophilic Granuloma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Eosinophils/*chemistry/parasitology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphadenitis/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lysophospholipase', 'Male', 'Suppuration']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000332532 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Cytol. 1997 Mar-Apr;41(2):409-12. doi: 10.1159/000332532.,['Acta Cytol. 1998 Sep-Oct;42(5):1310.

Adhesion and spreading on fibronectin leads to increased degranulation, inositol phosphate production, phospholipase D activation, and increased production of prostaglandin D2 and leukotriene C4 when the cells are activated through the high affinity IgE receptor. Rat basophilic leukemia cells will also adhere to surfaces coated with anti-rat class I antibodies, poly-L-lysine, and a lectin purified from Tetragonolobus purpureas. In all cases, antigen activated cells, which were adherent, displayed increased signaling, degranulation and eicosanoid production as compared to cells which were non-adherent. Cells which adhere to either anti-rat class I antibodies or poly-L-lysine also spread even though this is not mediated through integrins. In contrast, adhesion to the lectin from Tetragonolobus did not cause any appreciable spreading unless the cells were also triggered through the IgE receptor. Cells were also able to bind to fibronectin immobilized on polystyrene beads which mimics adhesion but does not allow spreading. However, these cells exhibited no increased signaling, degranulation, or eicosanoid production. Furthermore, rat basophilic leukemia cells can be modified by incubating them in the presence of biotinylated-phosphatidylserine which becomes incorporated into the membrane. These modified cells will adhere to streptavidin coated plates while unmodified cells will not. However, these modified cells do not spread, even after activation with antigen, and they show no increased degranulation or production of eicosanoids. These results indicate that adhesion itself is not sufficient for upregulation of the cells in response to antigen and that spreading of the cells may be the critical component.","['Apgar, J R']",['Apgar JR'],"['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Degranulation', 'Cell Movement', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/enzymology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mast Cells/physiology', 'Phospholipase D/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1997 Mar;110 ( Pt 6):771-80.,,,,,['R01-GM42388/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Despite its possible importance as a therapeutic target, very little is known about the regulation of human LIF. In particular, its regulation at the promoter level has not been studied so far, and was, therefore, the focus of the present work. After showing that Jurkat T lymphoma cells can be induced to express endogenous LIF mRNA, we used this cell line as a model to study the regulation of the human LIF promoter in transient transfection assays. For this purpose, a 666 bp fragment of the human LIF 5'-flanking region, amplified from genomic DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), was used for the construction of a luciferase reporter plasmid (hLIF666-Luc). In unstimulated Jurkat cells, the human LIF promoter showed low constitutive activity. The promoter was induced upon stimulation with phorbol ester (TPA). Combined stimulation with TPA and the calcium ionophore ionomycin resulted in strong synergistic induction of luciferase activity from the LIF promoter. Transfection experiments with deletion constructs (hLIF274-Luc and hLIF82-Luc) located the region required for this induction to a 192 bp portion of the promoter, which carries two putative c-ets binding sites. We then investigated the effect of glucocorticoids and estradiol by cotransfecting the respective receptors. Both hormones strongly inhibited the stimulation of the LIF promoter by TPA and ionomycin. Since LIF is implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and degenerative conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis, the finding that therapeutic agents employed in the treatment of such conditions, i.e. glucocorticoids and estrogens, can modulate the induction of LIF at the transcriptional level, is of particular interest.","['Bamberger, A M', 'Erdmann, I', 'Bamberger, C M', 'Jenatschke, S S', 'Schulte, H M']","['Bamberger AM', 'Erdmann I', 'Bamberger CM', 'Jenatschke SS', 'Schulte HM']","['IHF, Institute for Hormone and Fertility Research, University of Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Estradiol/*pharmacology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1997/03/14 00:00,1997/03/14 00:01,['1997/03/14 00:00'],"['1997/03/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0303720796039913 [pii]', '10.1016/s0303-7207(96)03991-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 1997 Mar 14;127(1):71-9. doi: 10.1016/s0303-7207(96)03991-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore tested mechanisms for molecular interactions between LIF and CRH. Although LIF and CRH synergized to induce an 8-fold induction of POMC transcription, CRH alone (but not LIF) induced cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation (5-fold) or an increase of c-fos mRNA levels (>100-fold), suggesting that these pathways are not implicated in LIF transcriptional synergistic effects. Using a DNase I footprint assay, POMC promoter regions protected by AtT20 cell nuclear extracts were identified (-121/-109, and -143/-134, and -173/-160). The protected -173/-160 element fused to a heterologous promoter conferred LIF-CRH synergy (6.5-fold induction of POMC) and formed a specific complex with AtT20 cell nuclear extracts. This complex was supershifted by an anti-phosphoserine antibody, and a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor also altered both this complex and LIF-CRH transcriptional synergy on the POMC promoter-luciferase reporter construct, indicating that these events depend on post-translational serine phosphorylations. LIF-CRH synergy on POMC transcription is therefore mediated at least in part by -173/-160 sequences conferring confluent transcriptional activity of both peptides.","['Bousquet, C', 'Ray, D W', 'Melmed, S']","['Bousquet C', 'Ray DW', 'Melmed S']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute-UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '9015-71-8 (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/*pharmacology', 'DNA Footprinting', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Drug Synergism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, fos/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary Neoplasms', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/*biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transfection']",1997/04/18 00:00,1997/04/18 00:01,['1997/04/18 00:00'],"['1997/04/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.16.10551 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)40724-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Apr 18;272(16):10551-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.16.10551.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study opened in January 1985 and randomized patients to receive ""high-dose,"" ""standard-dose,"" or ""low-dose"" adjuvant CAF (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil) chemotherapy. Patients were stratified according to treatment of the primary lesion (mastectomy or breast conservation), menopausal status, number of positive lymph nodes, and estrogen-receptor status. Twelve percent of the patients entered in this study were African-American, 84% were white, and 4% were of other racial backgrounds. RESULTS: African-Americans and whites were evenly distributed on all three arms. In a univariate analysis, African-Americans were more likely to have a reduced survival and shorter time to relapse than other patients. Race was moderately associated with tumor size, receptor status, and type of surgery. In a multivariate analysis, after adjusting for the dose of chemotherapy, number of lymph nodes, estrogen-receptor status, and age, race was no longer of prognostic significance.

ELF-EMF European Feasibility Study Group.,5-14,"BACKGROUND: A European feasibility study on environmental exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) and cancer was conducted. The study was motivated by public health concern about possible adverse health effects associated with ELF-EMF exposure. METHODS: A review of completed research in Europe was conducted. Information on the methods and accessibility of new epidemiologic studies were requested and reviewed. RESULTS: Eight studies on environmental ELF-EMF exposure have been completed in Europe while 15 large studies are in progress. Although there is no known mechanism by which electric or magnetic fields of this frequency could play a role in the development of cancer or other adverse health effects, the results of the studies conducted so far provide some support for the hypothesis that they are associated with the incidence of childhood leukemia. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The best use of available data will be made through a pooled re-analysis of data, particularly those on childhood tumors. It is recommended to apply multiple methods for exposure assessment in view of the heterogeneity in the methods used in different studies. New multicenter case-referent studies should not be initiated until the results of the large on-going studies have been reported. Prospective cohort studies will have to be very large to identify moderate excess risks resulting from environmental exposure to ELF-EMF, and their feasibility should be discussed after the results of the on-going case-referent studies have been reported. A European collaborative approach will lead to greater statistical power and will assess the exposure-effect association under differing exposure patterns and distributions of potential confounding factors.",,,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Public Health', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['172 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.172 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 1997 Feb;23(1):5-14. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.172.,,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pericentromeres in both cells were located at the periphery during Gq (quiescent) phase, but moved towards the nuclear center in G1 and mid-S phase. During G2, the pericentromeres of PBL continued to move towards the nuclear center whereas those of HL-60 returned to the periphery. The angle defining the spatial location of two pericentromeres, in reference to the center of the nucleus, increased in PBL cells from a mean of 67 degrees during Gq phase to 106 degrees during G1 phase (P < 0.01), and the two pericentromeres remained wide apart throughout the entire cell cycle. In HL-60, the angle also increased during G1, but then decreased during mid-S and G2 phases. Both cells exhibited pericentromeric signals during Gq that were round and compact, and the entire chromatin was loosely condensed. The signal became more loose and dispersed during the G1 and mid-S phases. The pericentromere signal varied during G2 and was generally rod-like or bipartite with condensation of the entire chromatin or chromosome-like. Our results suggest that subtle but important differences in spatial localization of pericentromeres are present during the interphase between normal PBL and HL-60 cells.","['Tagawa, Y', 'Nanashima, A', 'Yasutake, T', 'Hatano, K', 'Nishizawa-Takano, J E', 'Ayabe, H']","['Tagawa Y', 'Nanashima A', 'Yasutake T', 'Hatano K', 'Nishizawa-Takano JE', 'Ayabe H']","['First Department of Surgery, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,['0 (Chromatin)'],IM,"['*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Centromere/genetics/ultrastructure', '*Chromatin/ultrastructure', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/ultrastructure', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/ultrastructure']",1997/04/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19970401)27:4<327::AID-CYTO3>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1997 Apr 1;27(4):327-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients were both female, presented with flu-like symptoms, and were noted to have hepatosplenomegaly on physical examination. The peripheral blood examination was significant for anemia (Hb 54 (A), 84(B)g/L), and thrombocytopenia (86 (A), 70(B) x 10(9)/L). The bone marrow contained 75 percent (A) and 76.8 percent (B) erythroblasts and showed myelodysplastic changes in the erythroid cell line. Cytochemical analysis was performed, and greater than 10 erythroblasts per 100 cells were periodic acid-Schiff positive. Immunophenotypes of the pretreatment bone marrow showed glycophorin-A, CD71, and CD11b positivity. The karyotypes of both patients contained complex (> 3 per clone) cytogenetic abnormalities.

During episodes of infection or inflammation, a secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) appears in the circulation along with a variety of acute-phase proteins (APP), suggesting possible common regulatory elements amongst sPLA2 and APP. Using the human hepatoma line, HepG2, regulation of sPLA2 expression was examined in relation to synthesis of HP and ACH. The patterns of induction of sPLA2, HP and ACH were distinct for each of IL- 1, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-6, oncostatin M, IL-11 and leukaemia inhibitory factor. Dexamethasone had an enhancing effect on IL-6-induced expression of HP and ACH, but inhibited sPLA2 expression by 50%. Both 8-bromo-cAMP and dibutyryl cAMP increased sPLA2 expression (48.8-fold and 64.2-fold, respectively), whereas KT5720, an inhibitor of protein kinase A, down-regulated cytokine-induced sPLA2 synthesis by 51%. These data show that a panel of cytokines induced varying patterns of up-regulation of sPLA2, ACH and HP. Although dexamethasone potentiated IL-6-induced APP expression in HepG2 cells, it suppressed sPLA2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. In several respects, sPLA2 regulation is similar to that of HP and ACH, but a notable difference is the reciprocal effect of glucocorticoids on sPLA2 expression compared with that of ACH and HP.","['Vadas, P', 'Grouix, B', 'Stefanski, E', 'Wloch, M', 'Pruzanski, W', 'Schroeder, J', 'Gauldie, J']","['Vadas P', 'Grouix B', 'Stefanski E', 'Wloch M', 'Pruzanski W', 'Schroeder J', 'Gauldie J']","['Department of Medicine, Wellesley Hospital, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Haptoglobins)', '0 (alpha 1-Antichymotrypsin)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Haptoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Phospholipases A/*biosynthesis', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'alpha 1-Antichymotrypsin/*biosynthesis']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2249.1997.d01-990.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1997 Apr;108(1):175-80. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2249.1997.d01-990.x.,,,PMC1904637,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also 40 age-matched controls were included in this study. Serum samples from all patients and controls were examined to detect anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM using indirect ELISA. Antiserum against Toxoplasma avirulent strain was prepared in New-Zealand white rabbit, then it was used after purification for detecting circulating Toxoplasma antigens in the sera of these studied groups using a double antibody sanwich ELISA technique. Positive anti-Toxoplasms IgG was detected in 45% of the female group while 19% were IgM positive. According to IgM/IgG ratio, 9 cases were considered as acutely infected-females and 25 as chronically infected ones. The mean optical density of both IgG and IgM among acutely and chronically infected females were found significantly higher than of the control groups. Ten non-leukaemic children were IgG and IgM positive cases and were considered as acutely infected patients. On the other hand, all children with leukaemia were negative for anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM. Eleven out of 19 acutely infected cases (58%) had positive Toxoplasma antigens, whereas, only one case (4%) with chronic infection had positive antigen level. The mean optical density of circulating antigen level was significantly higher among acutely infected females and children than chronically infected and control groups. No antigen level difference was found between chronically infected patients and control groups. Six children from leukaemic group (60%) had positive circulating Toxoplasma antigen levels with significantly higher mean optical density than control groups (P < 0.001).

We report a patient in whom IFN-alpha dosage was initially severely limited by bone marrow suppression but in whom continuing treatment led to a first cytogenetic response only after 53 months. Increasing Ph' negativity over a further 2 years was associated with improving haematological tolerance which permitted IFN-alpha dose escalation and complete cytogenetic remission was achieved at 7 years after diagnosis. This remission has been sustained and has thus followed the most delayed cytogenetic response to IFN-alpha so far reported.","['Whiteway, A J', 'Reid, C D', 'Cross, N C']","['Whiteway AJ', 'Reid CD', 'Cross NC']","['Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow, Middlesex, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400622 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11(4):614-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400622.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel cell line YNH-1 was established from peripheral blood cells of a 46-year-old male with AML (M1) carrying t(16;21) and t(1;16) translocations. YNH-1 has been maintained with a doubling time of 82 h for more than 20 months as a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3) dependent line.

To analyze the possible effect of social class in this difference, a study of socioeconomic factors was conducted through personal interviews with the families of 115 children with lymphoid malignancies. The patients belonged to three ethnic groups: (1) UAE; (2) other Arabs; and (3) Indian subcontinent. UAE parents had the highest income and number of rooms in their house, but the lowest level of education. Occupational categories were significantly different for the three ethnic groups. While 41% of the UAE fathers worked in the army or the police, the majority of Arab and subcontinental fathers worked as government administrators or professionals. UAE families had the highest number of children in the family, subcontinental families the lowest. The number of children per family was inversely related to the parents' education level. Multiple regression analysis showed parental education level and house size to be significantly associated with ethnicity, while parental consanguinity was significantly associated with the diagnosis of lymphoma. It is difficult to define social class in the UAE population. While income and property ownership would place the UAE nationals in the highest category and the subcontinental group in the lowest, education level and occupational category would place the Arab and subcontinental groups higher. The smaller family size and higher education level in subcontinental families corresponds to the previously found higher relative frequency of ALL in this ethnic group and could lend support to the possible infectious etiology of the disease.","['Revesz, T', 'Mpofu, C', 'Oyejide, C', 'Bener, A']","['Revesz T', 'Mpofu C', 'Oyejide C', 'Bener A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Birth Order', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Education', 'Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Male', 'Social Class', '*Socioeconomic Factors', 'United Arab Emirates/epidemiology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400601 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11(4):588-93. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400601.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Limitations of this technique include the reported low frequency of normal stem cells in CML and the difficulties in obtaining sufficient BM for manipulation. To address these problems we compared the apheresis product with the diagnostic bone marrow at diagnosis as a source of primitive BCR/ABL-negative progenitors. We analyzed the CD34+ HLA-DR- and CD34+CD38(-) populations in five CML patients to evaluate the frequency of BCR-ABL-negative progenitors and pre-progenitors in these populations. Progenitor analysis was performed by RT-PCR of individual hemopoietic colonies from a standard CFU-GM assay. Analysis of pre-progenitors involved RT-PCR of secondary colonies derived from a stroma-free pre-CFU assay. Our results show variable levels of BCR-ABL-negative progenitors in the 34+DR- population but very low levels of BCR-ABL-negative progenitors in the 34+38- population in blood. Analysis of pre-progenitors from the 34+DR- fraction of peripheral blood (PB) and BM showed 80-100% and 85-100% of colonies were BCR-ABL negative at days 14 and 28, respectively. Analysis of pre-progenitors from the 34+38- fraction of PB and BM showed 23-100% and 42-100% of colonies were BCR-ABL negative at days 14 and 28, respectively. In summary, pre-progenitors from the 34+DR- and 34+38- populations are predominantly BCR-ABL negative in both marrow and blood at diagnosis. Apheresis product collected at diagnosis is a more abundant sources of BCR-ABL-negative pre-progenitors than BM.

B-CLL cells cocultured with human CD40 ligand-expressing mouse fibroblasts rapidly up-regulated CD54 and CD58 adhesion molecules and B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) costimulatory molecules, and acquired a strong stimulatory capacity towards CD4+ as well as isolated CD8+ allogeneic T cells. Costimulation by both CD80 and CD86 proved critical for allogeneic T cell proliferation and CD25 and HLA-DR expression, since these were strongly inhibited by anti-CD80 or anti-CD86 monoclonal antibodies, and completely abrogated by CTLA4-Ig fusion protein, which blocks both CD80 and CD86. B7 costimulation also proved critical for restimulation of primed B-CLL-reactive T cells. Most importantly, priming of purified CD8+ T cells with CD40-triggered allogeneic B-CLL cells resulted in cytotoxic activity against the unstimulated B-CLL cells. These findings raise the possibility that CD40 triggering of B-CLL cells might be exploited in immunotherapeutic protocols.","['Van den Hove, L E', 'Van Gool, S W', 'Vandenberghe, P', 'Bakkus, M', 'Thielemans, K', 'Boogaerts, M A', 'Ceuppens, J L']","['Van den Hove LE', 'Van Gool SW', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Bakkus M', 'Thielemans K', 'Boogaerts MA', 'Ceuppens JL']","['Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Isoantigens)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/*analysis', 'CD40 Antigens/*analysis', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Humans', 'Isoantigens/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400598 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11(4):572-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400598.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pretreatment with GM-CSF (100 U/ml) for 48 h resulted in a significant enhancement of DNA synthesis in both cell types: 21 of 35 AML specimens were found to be responsive to GM-CSF as defined by an increase of 3H-TdR incorporation into the DNA > 1.5-fold while NBMMC from normal donors were responsive in all cases.

In parallel to U937 cell maturation, a marked production of latent TGF-beta was observed in supernatants of leukemia cells cultured with mIgG1. Myeloblastic (HL-60) leukemia cell line similarly responded to mIgG1 or mIgG2b in induction of macrophage differentiation and in the absence of neutrophil differentiation. Human blood monocytes cultured in the presence of mIgG1, exhibited higher levels of IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNAs associated with an increase in protein extracellular release, suggesting that the effect of mIgG1 on IL-1 beta and IL-6 production in human monocytes was mediated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Monocyte activation by mIgG1 and mIgG2b was associated with increased cell surface expression of HLA-DR class II molecules. Human IgG1 (and to a lesser degree hIgG2), was also capable of inducing leukemia cell growth arrest and macrophage maturation whereas F(ab')2 fragments of mIgG1 were not as efficient as intact mIgG1 in blocking cell growth. Most importantly, mAbs reactive with Fc gamma RII (CD32-specific Abs 2E.1 and IV.3) blocked the effects of mIgG1 on leukemia cell proliferation. Taken together, these data indicate that binding of IgG1 molecules, possibly through Fc gamma RII, may generate an activation signal towards myelogenous leukemia cells and normal counterpart cells, ie monocytes, leading to induction of macrophage maturation and cytokine secretion.","['Micouin, A', 'Rouillard, D', 'Bauvois, B']","['Micouin A', 'Rouillard D', 'Bauvois B']","['Unite 365 INSERM, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin G/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', '*Macrophage Activation', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/immunology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400602 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11(4):552-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400602.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The long and extensive search for a factor specifically regulating megakaryocytopoiesis led to the cloning of a hormone, here called thrombopoietin (TPO), that specifically promotes proliferation and differentiation of the megakaryocytic lineage. The availability of recombinant TPO and its imminent clinical use has made a more detailed understanding of its effects on hematopoietic cells more urgent. Normal megakaryocyto- and thrombopoiesis occurs predominantly in the bone marrow, a difficult organ to study in situ, particularly in humans, due to the low numbers of megakaryocytic progenitors and the consequent difficult isolation as pure populations. Thus, we developed an in vitro system which may allow us to address questions regarding the biology of TPO. The acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-derived cell lines HU-3, M-07e, M-MOK and TF-1 have absolute dependence on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). We cultured these cells long term (> 6 months) in the continuous presence of TPO (omitting GM-CSF). TPO alone supported the maintenance and expansion of these sister cell lines, HU-3/TPO, M-07e/TPO, M-MOK/TPO and TF-1/TPO, that displayed somewhat longer doubling times, a larger cell size, and a higher percentage of polynucleated giant cells and slightly adherent cells than the corresponding countercultures grown with GM-CSF. In the absence of TPO the cells died quickly, within a few days; thus, the TPO-grown cell lines have an absolute dependence on this factor, but could all be switched back to growth with GM-CSF. In comparison with the GM-CSF-treated cells, the receptors for GM-CSF and interleukin-3 (IL-3) were down-regulated and the receptors for stem cell factor (SCF) and TPO were up-regulated in the TPO-exposed cells. A short-term proliferation assay showed a stronger response of the TPO-cell lines to erythropoietin, GM-CSF, IL-3, PIXY-321, SCF and TPO than the GM-CSF-cell lines. Flow cytometric analysis of the GM-CSF-and TPO-cultured lines displayed an up-regulation of the megakaryocytic surface markers CD41, CD42 and CD61, and a down-regulation of the erythroid marker glycophorin A in the latter cell lines, suggesting some differentiation along the megakaryocytic lineage. Thus, in long-term exposure, TPO appears to have both a proliferative and a differentiative effect on responsive cells. Under serum-deprived culture conditions, TPO acted as a survival factor on the TPO-cell lines. Taken together, these findings indicate that the TPO-dependent cell lines represent important biological reagents for further characterization of the biology of TPO and should also provide a great aid for future in vitro experiments aimed at elucidating megakaryocyto- and thrombopoiesis.","['Drexler, H G', 'Zaborski, M', 'Quentmeier, H']","['Drexler HG', 'Zaborski M', 'Quentmeier H']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Azure Stains)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Azure Stains', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects', '*Milk Proteins', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400621 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11(4):541-51. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400621.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A significant proliferative response to MGDF alone (proliferation index > 1.5) was observed in nine of 23 cases; the responding cases belonged to all FAB subtypes. However, the greatest response (proliferation index > 7) was found in one M6 and in one M7 case. MGDF also enhanced interleukin 3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), c-kit ligand (KL) and FLT3 ligand (FL) stimulated blast cell proliferation. MGDF as a single factor induced or significantly enhanced colony formation by clonogenic precursor cells in 12 of 14 AML cases. MGDF strongly increased KL-induced leukemic colony growth in seven cases, whereas it only moderately enhanced IL-3- or GM-CSF-induced colony growth. The analysis of tyrosine phosphorylated protein(s) upon MGDF stimulation in fresh AML cells was also performed. The results demonstrated a band of approximately 90 kDa phosphorylated protein(s) upon MGDF stimulation in AML responsive cases, but not in unresponsive ones.

Among the two-factor combinations tested, SCF plus IL-3 most effectively expanded committed progenitor cells, including mixed colony-forming units (CFU-Mix). The expansion efficiency (EE) of FL for each progenitor was inferior to that of SCF in the presence of various cytokines, except TPO. IL-6 significantly increased the EE for granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) obtained with SCF + IL-3 or FL + IL-3. Interestingly, TPO markedly augmented the EE for committed progenitors, including CFU-GM, erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E), and CFU-Mix, in the presence of SCF + IL-3 or FL + IL-3. The combinations of SCF + IL-3 + TPO + IL-6 or IL-11 maximally stimulated the expansion of committed progenitors. The maximum EE for CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-Mix was respectively 197-fold (day 14), 60-fold (day 7) and 51-fold (day 14). Other combinations of cytokines without IL-3 failed to expand effectively these committed progenitors.

We employed an HL-60 cell line stably transfected with a p21MDA6 antisense construct to compare the effects of p21MDA6 dysregulation on the response of myeloid leukemia cells to differentiating and cytotoxic agents. Antisense-expressing cells (HL-60/AS5) treated with 5 nM PMA for 24 h exhibited attenuated induction of p21MDA6 compared to empty vector controls (HL-60/V2).

These observations indicate that dysregulation of p21MDA6 in p53-null human myeloid leukemia cells interferes with PMA-related G1 arrest, CDK-2 inhibition, differentiation, and loss of clonogenic survival in the absence of obvious alterations in pRB phosphorylation status or E2F complex formation.

The declines in c-Src and its PTK activity subsequently reduced the proliferation of U937-ASRC cells. To elucidate the growth signal transduction pathway downstream of c-Src, tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc was examined in U937-ASRC cells treated with Dexa. The decline in c-Src by induction of antisense src RNA expression decreased the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. Immunoprecipitated c-Src directly phosphorylated immunoprecipitated Shc on tyrosine residues in vitro. The amounts of Grb2 and Sos co-immunoprecipitated with Shc were decreased after Dexa treatment.

Taken together with all these findings, it is suggested that c-Src directly phosphorylates Shc on tyrosine residues, which in turn binds to Grb2 constitutively associated with Sos to form a Shc-Grb2-Sos complex, and that the complex formation is coupled with MAP kinase activation mediated by Ras activation in U937 cells.","['Yamaguchi, M', 'Tanaka, T', 'Waki, M', 'Kitanaka, A', 'Kamano, H', 'Kubota, Y', 'Ohnishi, H', 'Takahara, J', 'Irino, S']","['Yamaguchi M', 'Tanaka T', 'Waki M', 'Kitanaka A', 'Kamano H', 'Kubota Y', 'Ohnishi H', 'Takahara J', 'Irino S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Kagawa Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (Sos-A protein, mouse)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Oligopeptides/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Antisense/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400605 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11(4):497-503. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400605.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of these t-AML cases are associated with the use of intensive chemotherapy regimens that employ one or more agents which target eukaryotic topoisomerase II (topo II), and demonstrate non-random chromosomal translocations involving either the MLL (ALL-1, HRX) gene at 11q23 or the AML1 gene at 21q22. Although many investigators have speculated that these translocations are induced by the therapeutic use of topo II inhibitors, the molecular sequence of events by which topo II inhibitors might induce a chromosomal translocation are not well understood. We describe here the reproducible induction of highly specific, double-strand DNA cleavage at a specific site within the AML1 locus by topo II inhibitors. This DNA cleavage, which maps to a region of the AML1 locus frequently disrupted by chromosomal translocations, can be induced in several cell lines, with multiple different topo II inhibitors, indicating that this phenomenon is not restricted to a specific cell type or specific topo II inhibitor. It is conceivable that site-specific double-strand DNA cleavage within the AML1 locus induced by topo II inhibitors represents the initial molecular event leading to a chromosomal translocation and t-AML.","['Stanulla, M', 'Wang, J', 'Chervinsky, D S', 'Aplan, P D']","['Stanulla M', 'Wang J', 'Chervinsky DS', 'Aplan PD']","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Department of Molecular Medicine, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Genes, abl/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400632 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11(4):490-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400632.,,,,,['CA16056-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Forty acute leukemia samples (40% of the total), including 37 AML samples (51% of AML), showed activation of MAP kinase as revealed by the mobility shift of the phosphorylated form of the protein and by in vitro kinase assay. This activation was correlated with MAP kinase kinase activity in these cells. In contrast, none of 14 chronic myelogenous leukemia samples showed the activation of MAP kinase. These results suggest that the MAP kinase pathway is constitutively activated in a subset of primary acute leukemias, and thus indicate the possible role of the constitutively activated MAP kinase in leukemogenesis.","['Towatari, M', 'Iida, H', 'Tanimoto, M', 'Iwata, H', 'Hamaguchi, M', 'Saito, H']","['Towatari M', 'Iida H', 'Tanimoto M', 'Iwata H', 'Hamaguchi M', 'Saito H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Genes, ras/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/enzymology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400617 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11(4):479-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400617.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For each subject, information was collected on the cumulative dosages of chemotherapy and radiotherapy received, vital status and occurrence of secondary leukemia. The expected number of leukemias was estimated using age-specific incidence rates from the cancer registries in Italy and Germany. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were used to measure the risk of secondary leukemia among LCH patients. Five leukemias occurred among the 241 Italian study patients (SIR 520), whereas no cases were reported among the 363 AGDS patients. Interestingly, and in contrast to previous descriptions of epipodophyllotoxin-related leukemias which are mostly FAB M4 or M5, these leukemias showed typical FAB M3 features, and received a dose of VP-16 > 4,000 mg/m2. Among the AGDS cohort, very few subjects were exposed to high doses of VP-16. The risk of secondary acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (s-ANLL) among the Italian subjects exposed to VP-16 was more than 1,000 times greater than expected. The study suggests that high doses of VP-16 appear to increase the risk of s-ANLL in LCH patients. The fact that all the leukemias described in the Italian LCH cohort were promyelocytic, and evidence of a higher incidence of promyelocytic leukemias among Italians and Latinos, suggest that high doses of etoposide in subjects of Latino origin may lead to aberrations on chromosomes 15 and 17.","['Haupt, R', 'Fears, T R', 'Heise, A', 'Gadner, H', 'Loiacono, G', 'De Terlizzi, M', 'Tucker, M A']","['Haupt R', 'Fears TR', 'Heise A', 'Gadner H', 'Loiacono G', 'De Terlizzi M', 'Tucker MA']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Austria/ethnology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cohort Studies', 'Etoposide/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sex Factors', 'Switzerland/epidemiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1997/03/28 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/03/28 00:00'],"['1997/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19970328)71:1<9::AID-IJC3>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970328)71:1<9::aid-ijc3>3.0.co;2-y [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1997 Mar 28;71(1):9-13. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970328)71:1<9::aid-ijc3>3.0.co;2-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polysaccharides (PS) from fresh fruiting bodies of G. lucidum (PS-G) were isolated and used to potentiate cytokine production by human monocytes-macrophages and T lymphocytes. Our results had shown that the levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- alpha, and IL-6 in macrophage cultures treated with PS-G (100 micrograms/ml) were 5.1-, 9.8- and 29-fold higher, respectively, than those of untreated controls. In addition, the release of interferon (IFN)- gamma from T lymphocytes was also greatly promoted in the presence of PS-G (25-100 micrograms/ml). Furthermore, these cytokine-containing mononuclear cell-conditioned media (PSG-MNC-CM) were found to suppress the proliferation and clonogenicity of both the HL-60 and the U937 leukemic cell lines. DNA labeling and gel electrophoresis showed that treatment with PSG-MNC-CM markedly induced leukemic-cell apoptosis. Flow-cytometric analysis revealed that few (2.3 +/- 0.8%) apoptotic cells were seen in the control cultures, while PSG-MNC-CM treatment resulted in a significant increase in the apoptotic population both in the HL-60 (38.3 +/- 4.5%) and in the U937 (44.5 +/- 3.8%) cells. In addition, 40 to 45% of the treated leukemic cells were triggered to differentiate into mature monocytic cells expressing CD14 and CD68 surface antigens. However, PS-G alone had no such effects even at a higher dose of 400 micrograms/ml. Since untreated macrophages and T lymphocytes produced little or no cytokine, and normal MNC-CM did not suppress leukemic cell growth, it was suggestive that the anti-tumor activity of PSG-MNC-CM was derived from the elevated levels of cytokines. Antibody-neutralization studies further revealed that the anti-tumor cytokines in the PSG-MNC-CM were mainly of TNF- alpha and IFN- gamma, and these 2 cytokines acted synergistically on the inhibition of leukemic-cell growth.","['Wang, S Y', 'Hsu, M L', 'Hsu, H C', 'Tzeng, C H', 'Lee, S S', 'Shiao, M S', 'Ho, C K']","['Wang SY', 'Hsu ML', 'Hsu HC', 'Tzeng CH', 'Lee SS', 'Shiao MS', 'Ho CK']","['Department of Medical Research, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Basidiomycota/*chemistry', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'Macrophage Activation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Polysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Reishi', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1997/03/17 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/03/17 00:00'],"['1997/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19970317)70:6<699::AID-IJC12>3.0.CO;2-5 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970317)70:6<699::aid-ijc12>3.0.co;2-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1997 Mar 17;70(6):699-705. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970317)70:6<699::aid-ijc12>3.0.co;2-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relative risks by the father's continent of origin, and odds ratios by continent of origin of mother or both parents, adjusted for age, sex and period, were estimated. The leukaemias showed little variation in risk by birthplace, and no change between generations. For non-Hodgkin lymphoma, however, there were quite large differences in incidence, with relatively high rates in migrants from Asia and Africa. These persisted to some degree into the second generation, suggesting that inherited susceptibility may underlie some of the variation.","['Iscovich, J', 'Parkin, D M']","['Iscovich J', 'Parkin DM']","['Israel Cancer Registry, State of Israel Ministry of Health, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Africa/ethnology', 'Asia/ethnology', 'Child', 'Europe/ethnology', 'Humans', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Risk', 'Transients and Migrants']",1997/03/17 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/03/17 00:00'],"['1997/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19970317)70:6<649::AID-IJC4>3.0.CO;2-V [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970317)70:6<649::aid-ijc4>3.0.co;2-v [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1997 Mar 17;70(6):649-53. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970317)70:6<649::aid-ijc4>3.0.co;2-v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously identified a new member of this family, DLX-7. We now report that this gene is expressed in normal hematopoietic cells and leukemia cell lines with erythroid characteristics. We used an antisense oligonucleotide targeted against the translation start site of DLX-7 mRNA to inhibit its expression in a human erythroleukemia cell line K562, which expresses DLX-7 at a high level. The antisense oligonucleotide efficiently reduced the DLX-7 mRNA, while control oligonucleotides, including a mutant oligonucleotide identical to the antisense sequence except for four nucleotide mismatches, had no effect on DLX-7 mRNA level. Inhibition of DLX-7 expression decreased the plating efficiency by approximately 70% compared with control. The antisense treatment caused apoptosis, as shown by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-digoxigenin nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. Down-regulation of DLX-7 expression by antisense treatment was associated with a reduction in GATA-1 and c-myc mRNA levels. Thus, we conclude that DLX-7 is expressed in hematopoietic cells and that the inhibition of its expression results in the decreased levels of GATA-1 and c-myc genes, with an accompanying induction of apoptosis.","['Shimamoto, T', 'Nakamura, S', 'Bollekens, J', 'Ruddle, F H', 'Takeshita, K']","['Shimamoto T', 'Nakamura S', 'Bollekens J', 'Ruddle FH', 'Takeshita K']","['Department of Medicine, New York University Medical Center, NY 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dlx4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', '*Genes, Homeobox', '*Genes, myc', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.94.7.3245 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Apr 1;94(7):3245-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.7.3245.,,,PMC20354,,"['P30 CA016087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM009966/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK45118/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM9966/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Alternative chimeric proteins, p210(BCR-ABL) and p190(BCR-ABL), are produced that are characteristic of chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, respectively. Their role in the aetiology of human leukemia remains to be defined. We have previously shown that the tumorigenic effect of BCR-ABL oncogenes is mediated by Bcl-2. In addition to Bcl-2, is a protein essential for transformation by BCR-ABL. However, it is not known how Bcl-2 and Ras fit together in cell transformation by BCR-ABL. The data presented here establish that Bcl-2 is a downstream target gene of the Ras signalling pathway in cells transformed by BCR-ABL, and that constitutive Ras activation results in constitutive expression of the gene. Conversely, a truncated form of the BCR-ABL, which lacks a critical BCR region required for activation of the Ras signalling pathway, failed to induce Bcl-2 expression. These results indicate that BCR-ABL prevents apoptosis by inducing Bcl-2 through a signalling pathway involving Ras and links constitutive Ras activation and Bcl-2 gene regulation. Hence, these results further imply that Ras is involved in both mitogenic signals and survival signals.","['Sanchez-Garcia, I', 'Martin-Zanca, D']","['Sanchez-Garcia I', 'Martin-Zanca D']","['Departamento de Proliferacion y Diferenciacion, Instituto de Microbiologia Bioquimica CSIC/Universidad de Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Genes, bcl-2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection/genetics', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",1997/03/28 00:00,1997/03/28 00:01,['1997/03/28 00:00'],"['1997/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022283696907792 [pii]', '10.1006/jmbi.1996.0779 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1997 Mar 28;267(2):225-8. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1996.0779.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fru-2,6-P2 content is tightly regulated and appears to be under the control of different hormones and growth factors, acting either through covalent modification of isoenzymatic forms of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2), the bifunctional enzyme responsible for the synthesis and the degradation of the compound, or through changes in transcription rate and/or in the expression of different isoforms of the enzyme. In the present study the metabolism of Fru-2,6-P2 was investigated during the differentiation toward megakaryocytes induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment of human leukemia K562 and MEG-01 cell lines. Fru-2,6-P2 content as well as PFK-2 activity were increased in a dose-dependent manner after 4 days of incubation with PMA. MEG-01 cells resulted more sensitive to the effect of the inducer, anyway in both cell types cytostatic concentrations of the phorbol ester were able to affect Fru-2,6-P2 metabolism. The effect of PMA was maximal at 4 days of incubation in both examined cell lines. Interestingly, the effect induced by the phorbol ester at 4 days was still appreciable subculturing K562 and MEG-01 cells for 3 days in the absence of the inducer and was associated with relevant changes in the molecular properties of PFK-2: namely increased Vmax and K(m). This latter finding suggests that the rise in Fru-2,6-P2 content during the differentiation process toward megakaryocytes might result from the expression of a novel PFK-2 isoform.","['Meacci, E', 'Vasta, V', 'Farnararo, M', 'Bruni, P']","['Meacci E', 'Vasta V', 'Farnararo M', 'Bruni P']","['Department of Biochemical Sciences, University of Firenze, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Fructosediphosphates)', '79082-92-1 (fructose 2,6-diphosphate)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Fructosediphosphates/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/23 00:00,1996/03/23 00:01,['1996/03/23 00:00'],"['1996/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/23 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00426334 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1996 Mar 23;156(2):125-30. doi: 10.1007/BF00426334.,,,,,,,,,,['Mol Cell Biochem 1996 Jun 21;159(2):169'],,,,,,

The precise function of the His-1 gene is unknown, but its transcriptional activation in a series of mouse leukemias has implicated the His-1 RNA in leukemogenesis when it is abnormally expressed. To study the oncogenic potential of this gene in more detail, we have examined the normal tissue distribution of His-1 RNA during mouse embryogenesis and in various adult tissues. His-1 expression was detected at low levels in the epithelia of the adult mouse stomach, prostate, seminal vesicle, and the developing choroid plexus by in situ hybridization. All other tissues examined lacked detectable levels of hybridizing RNA, suggesting that normal His-1 gene expression is highly restricted to these epithelial sites. These transcripts were not detectable by Northern blot analysis of normal tissues but were readily identified in five mouse leukemias and in five carcinomas of the choroid plexus. These data indicate that the His-1 gene expression is highly restricted and suggest that inappropriate activation of this gene may contribute to carcinogenesis.","['Li, J', 'Witte, D P', 'Van Dyke, T', 'Askew, D S']","['Li J', 'Witte DP', 'Van Dyke T', 'Askew DS']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Cincinnati, OH 45267-0529, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '0 (Vis1 long non-coding RNA, mouse)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Carcinoma/genetics', 'Choroid Plexus Neoplasms/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*RNA, Untranslated', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1997 Apr;150(4):1297-305.,,,PMC1858164,,['R29CA61909/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

As uPAR exists in various molecular forms, it is desirable to use well defined antibodies for analyses of uPAR antigen expression in human malignant tumors by immunological methods. Therefore, twelve monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against uPAR were generated by using nonglycosylated, recombinant human uPAR (spanning amino acids 1 to 284), expressed in Escherichia coli, as the immunogen. The reaction pattern of these MAbs with the immunogen and a series of carboxyl-terminally truncated versions of uPAR demonstrated that at least six different epitopes of uPAR are recognized. All MAbs reacted under reducing conditions in immunoblot analyses with E. coli-expressed uPA and also with highly glycosylated, functionally intact, recombinant human uPAR expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Seven of the MAbs recognized CHO uPAR under nonreducing conditions as well. By flow cytofluorometric analyses, three of these MAbs were shown to bind to native human uPAR present on the cell surface of monocytoid U937 cells with MAb IIIF10 being the best. Saturation of uPAR with uPA on U937 cells completely blocked interaction of MAb IIIF10 with uPAR (mapped epitope, amino acids 52 to 60 of domain I of uPAR). In turn, preincubation of U937 cells with MAb IIIF10 efficiently reduced binding of uPA to uPAR, indicating that the epitope detected by MAb IIIF10 is located within or closely to the uPA-binding site of uPAR, and thus, this site may be a target to influence uPA/uPAR-mediated proteolysis in tumors. Binding of MAbs IID7 or IIIB11 (mapped epitope, amino acids 125 to 132 of domain II of uPAR) to uPAR is not affected when uPAR is occupied by uPA. As these MAbs reacted strongly with cellular uPAR antigen in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor sections, the domain-II-specific antibodies IID7 and IIIB11 may be useful for immunohistochemical studies of uPAR expression in tissue remodeling processes in tumor invasion. In conclusion, we have devised well defined and epitope-mapped MAbs to uPAR that are highly specific tools for detection and targeting of uPAR in tumor tissue.","['Luther, T', 'Magdolen, V', 'Albrecht, S', 'Kasper, M', 'Riemer, C', 'Kessler, H', 'Graeff, H', 'Muller, M', 'Schmitt, M']","['Luther T', 'Magdolen V', 'Albrecht S', 'Kasper M', 'Riemer C', 'Kessler H', 'Graeff H', 'Muller M', 'Schmitt M']","['Institut fur Pathologie, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Plaur protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/*chemistry', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/chemistry', 'Breast Neoplasms/*chemistry/*immunology', 'CHO Cells', 'Carcinoma/*chemistry/*immunology', 'Cricetinae', '*Epitope Mapping', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*immunology/*physiology', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1997 Apr;150(4):1231-44.,,,PMC1858180,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This transcription unit, lacking long terminal repeats, primer binding sites, and most of the retrovirus packaging signal but retaining both retroviral donor and acceptor splice sites, was cloned into a herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) amplicon plasmid, and amplicon vectors (the gag-pol-env [GPE] vectors) were generated by using a defective HSV-1 vector as helper virus. The GPE vector population was used to infect human TE671 cells (ATCC CRL 8805), harboring a lacZ provirus (TE-lac2 cells), and supernatants of infected cells were collected and filtered at different times after infection. These supernatants were found to contain infectious ecotropic lacZ retroviral particles, as shown both by reverse transcription-PCR and by their ability to transduce a beta-galactosidase activity to murine NIH 3T3 cells but not to human TE671 cells. The titer of retroviral vectors released by GPE vector-infected TE-lac2 cells increased with the dose of infectious amplicon particles. Retrovirus vector production was inhibited by superinfection with helper virus, indicating that helper virus coinfection negatively interfered with retrovirus production. Induction of retrovirus vectors by GPE vectors was neutralized by anti-HSV-1 but not by anti-MoMLV antiserum, while transduction of beta-galactosidase activity to NIH 3T3 cells by supernatants of GPE vector-infected TE-lac2 cells was neutralized by anti-MoMLV antiserum. These results demonstrate that HSV-1 GPE amplicon vectors can rescue defective lacZ retrovirus vectors and suggest that they could be used as a sort of launching ramp to fire defective retrovirus vectors from within virtually any in vitro or in vivo cell type containing defective retroviral vectors.","['Savard, N', 'Cosset, F L', 'Epstein, A L']","['Savard N', 'Cosset FL', 'Epstein AL']","['Centre de Genetique Moleculaire et Cellulaire, UMR 5534 CNRS, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon I, Villeurbanne, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Defective Viruses/*genetics', '*Genes, env', '*Genes, gag', '*Genes, pol', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.5.4111-4117.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 May;71(5):4111-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.5.4111-4117.1997.,,,PMC191567,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess LOH, it is best to study mice that are heterozygous at many loci across the genome. Accordingly, we generated a collection of 52 M-MULV-induced tumor DNAs from C57BR/cdJ x AKR/J F1 (BRAKF1) hybrid mice. By using direct hybridization with oligonucleotides specific for three different classes of endogenous MuLV-related proviruses, 48 markers on 16 of 19 autosomes were simultaneously examined for allelic loss. No allelic losses were detected, with the exception of a common loss of markers on chromosome 4 in two tumors. The three autosomes that lacked informative endogenous proviral markers were also analyzed for LOH by PCR with simple-sequence length polymorphisms (SSLPs); one additional tumor showed LOH on chromosome 15. Further screening with chromosome 4 SSLPs identified one additional tumor with LOH on chromosome 4. Therefore, in total, the average fractional allelic loss was quite low (0.002), but the LOH frequency of 6% on chromosome 4 was highly statistically significant (P < 0.0005). Detailed SSLP mapping of the three tumors with LOH on chromosome 4 localized the region of common LOH to the distal 45 centimorgans, a region syntenic with human chromosomes 1 and 9. Candidate tumor suppressor genes, Mts1 (p16INK4a) and Mts2 (p15INK4b), have been mapped to this region, but by Southern blot analysis, no homozygous deletions were detected in either gene. One of three tumors with LOH on chromosome 4 also showed a proviral insertion near the c-myc proto-oncogene. These results suggested that tumor suppressor inactivation is generally infrequent in M-MuLV-induced tumors but that a subset of these tumors may have lost a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 4.","['Lander, J K', 'Fan, H']","['Lander JK', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine 92717, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/genetics', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.5.3940-3952.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 May;71(5):3940-52. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.5.3940-3952.1997.,,,PMC191546,,"['CA09054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM07134-19/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The development of MAIDS is associated with increased B-cell lymphoblast proliferation, but there is reason to believe that T-cell function and, particularly, T-cell-derived cytokines may also play a role. We have previously shown that concurrent infection with Leishmania major (which induces a strongly polarized Th1 response in C57BL/6 mice) and LP-BM5 MuLV modulates the disease induced by both infections. Here we show by treatment of mice with anticytokine antibodies that this modulation is largely exerted through the balance of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Infected mice treated with antibodies to interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 exhibited a delayed development of MAIDS-related pathology and maintained T-cell responsiveness longer than mice treated with control antibody. Gamma interferon induced by coinfection with L. major synergized with anti-IL-4 treatment to inhibit the development of MAIDS pathology. Conversely, treatment with anti-gamma interferon led to a significant increase in splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy and slightly exacerbated loss of T-cell function. These data suggest that the production of Th2-associated cytokines may promote MAIDS pathology, while Th1-associated cytokines may help control the disease.","['Doherty, T M', 'Giese, N', 'Morse, H C 3rd', 'Coffman, R L']","['Doherty TM', 'Giese N', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Coffman RL']","['Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Female', 'Interferon-gamma/physiology', 'Interleukin-4/physiology', '*Leishmania major', 'Leishmaniasis, Cutaneous/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology']",1997/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.5.3702-3709.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 May;71(5):3702-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.5.3702-3709.1997.,,,PMC191519,,['N0I-AI-72622/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Since STLV-2(pan-p) has been found in African nonhuman primates, we investigated its infectiousness and pathogenicity in Asian monkeys. Pigtailed macaques were inoculated with human cells harboring STLV(pan-p), and infection was assessed by virus isolation, PCR analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and seroconversion against viral antigens in HTLV-1/HTLV-2 and Western blot assay.

During viral maturation, the viral protease cleaves this tail to release a 16-amino-acid R peptide, thereby rendering the envelope protein fusion competent. A series of truncations, deletions, and amino acid substitutions were constructed in this cytoplasmic tail to examine its role in fusion and viral transduction. Sequential truncation of the cytoplasmic tail revealed that removal of as few as 11 amino acids resulted in significant fusion when the envelope protein was expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, similar to that seen following expression of an R-less envelope (truncation of 16 amino acids). Further truncation of the cytoplasmic tail beyond the R-peptide cleavage site toward the membrane-spanning region had no additional effect on the level of fusion observed. In contrast, some deletions and nonconservative amino acid substitutions in the membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic tail (residues L602 to F605) reduced the amount of fusion observed in XC cell cocultivation assays, suggesting that this region influences the fusogenicity of full-length envelope protein. Expression of the mutant envelope proteins in a retroviral vector system revealed that decreased envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion correlated with a decrease in infectivity of the resulting virions. Additionally, some mutant envelope proteins which were capable of mediating cell-cell fusion were not efficiently incorporated into retroviral particles, resulting in defective virions. The cytoplasmic tail of MoMuLV envelope protein therefore influences both the fusogenicity of the envelope protein and its incorporation into virions.","['Januszeski, M M', 'Cannon, P M', 'Chen, D', 'Rozenberg, Y', 'Anderson, W F']","['Januszeski MM', 'Cannon PM', 'Chen D', 'Rozenberg Y', 'Anderson WF']","['Norris Cancer Center, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry', 'Mutation', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/analysis/*physiology']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.5.3613-3619.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 May;71(5):3613-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.5.3613-3619.1997.,,,PMC191509,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax also activates the expression of specific cellular genes involved in the control of T-lymphocyte growth via effects on cellular transcription factors, including members of the NF-kappaB/cRel family. Immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy were used to characterize the intracellular localization of Tax and identify cellular factors which are the potential targets for its transcriptional activity. These studies indicated that Tax localizes in discrete nuclear foci in T lymphocytes transformed by HTLV-1 and in cells transduced with Tax expression vectors. The Tax-containing foci are complex nuclear structures comprising a central core in which Tax colocalizes with splicing factor Sm. In addition to splicing factors Sm and SC-35, the Tax-containing nuclear structures also contain transcriptional components, including the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II and cyclin-dependent kinase CDK8.

These results suggest that transfection of annexin IV cDNA increases the expression of alpha-2,3-sialylated and/or fucosylated sugar chains on the surface.","['Satoh, A', 'Takayama, E', 'Kojima, K', 'Ogawa, H', 'Katsura, Y', 'Kina, T', 'Irimura, T', 'Matsumoto, I']","['Satoh A', 'Takayama E', 'Kojima K', 'Ogawa H', 'Katsura Y', 'Kina T', 'Irimura T', 'Matsumoto I']","['Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Ochanomizu University, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Annexin A4)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '0 (Ricinus communis agglutinin-1)', '0 (Ulex europaeus lectins)', '0 (Wheat Germ Agglutinins)', '0 (leukoagglutinins, plants)']",IM,"['Annexin A4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'DNA, Complementary', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lectins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phytohemagglutinins/metabolism', '*Plant Lectins', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, Mitogen/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wheat Germ Agglutinins/metabolism']",1997/03/17 00:00,1997/03/17 00:01,['1997/03/17 00:00'],"['1997/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(97)00161-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(97)00161-0 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1997 Mar 17;405(1):107-10. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(97)00161-0.,,,,['GENBANK/D78152'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Presently, IL-6 is regarded as the most potent mediator of acute phase protein (APP) synthesis. It was shown that IL-6 and IL-6-type cytokines activate the so-called JAK/STAT pathway and finally regulate APP expression in liver cells. Since HGF/SF is also capable of regulating APP expression, we asked whether it might also signal via the JAK/STAT pathway. Here we show that incubation of human hepatocytes as well as hepatoma cells (HepG2) with HGF/SF results in activation of the transcription factor STAT3. This STAT3 activation after HGF/SF did not occur before 5-7 h and was maintained up to 28 h. These observations are in contrast to the rapid and transient activation of STAT1 and STAT3 mediated by IL-6.","['Schaper, F', 'Siewert, E', 'Gomez-Lechon, M J', 'Gatsios, P', 'Sachs, M', 'Birchmeier, W', 'Heinrich, P C', 'Castell, J']","['Schaper F', 'Siewert E', 'Gomez-Lechon MJ', 'Gatsios P', 'Sachs M', 'Birchmeier W', 'Heinrich PC', 'Castell J']","['Institut fur Biochemie der RWTH Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (alpha 1-Antichymotrypsin)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liver/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'alpha 1-Antichymotrypsin/biosynthesis']",1997/03/17 00:00,1997/03/17 00:01,['1997/03/17 00:00'],"['1997/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014579397001671 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(97)00167-1 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1997 Mar 17;405(1):99-103. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(97)00167-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DBhy22 expressed detectable FasL mRNA 4 h after activation through TCR and the expression of FasL mRNA reached a peak after 8 h of activation. The expression level of FasL mRNA was clearly associated with the level of Fas-mediated cytotoxicity and AICD seen after activation. On the other hand, FasL mRNA and FasL molecules were constitutively expressed in DB14 irrespective of the activation state. However, DB14 exhibited the Fas-mediated cytotoxicity only after activation. The present study suggests that Fas-mediated cytotoxicity requires not only FasL expression but also other activation signals.","['Kaneda, R', 'Iwabuchi, K', 'Onoe, K']","['Kaneda R', 'Iwabuchi K', 'Onoe K']","['Section of Pathology, Institute of Immunological Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Hybridomas/*immunology', 'Ion Transport/drug effects', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'L Cells/immunology', 'Leukemia L5178/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165247896026831 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2478(96)02683-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1997 Jan;55(1):53-60. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2478(96)02683-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A dose of 10 mg/kg protected mice also from liver injury induced by TNF-alpha. Similar results were found when apoptosis was initiated via TNF-alpha or via CD95 in primary murine hepatocytes (IC50 = 1.5 nM) or in various human cell lines. In addition to prevention, an arrest of cell death by Z-VAD-FMK was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro after stimulation of apoptosis receptors.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Starting in April 1992, 17 consecutive patients with the blastic phase (BP) of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a median age of 33 years (range 10 to 45) received a new treatment regimen consisting of etoposide (100 mg/m2/d i.v. over one hour), intermediate-dose cytarabine (500 mg/m2/d i.v. over one hour, q12 hours) and carboplatin (150 mg/m2/d continuous infusion) on days 1 3 and 8 10 (VAC regimen). The BP phenotype was myeloid in 16 patients and hybrid in one. At the time of their BP diagnoses, two patients showed extramedullary involvement, in eight patients the BP was preceded by an accelerated phase. RESULTS: Overall, 11 of 17 patients (65%) achieved complete remission and 7 of 11 responding patients (64%) manifested a cytogenetic conversion ranging from 38% to 100% Ph-negative metaphases: one patient died in CR of hemothorax, three died of sepsis during induction therapy and three patients (17.5%) had resistant disease. As of April 1996, four patients are alive, three of them in first remission at +7, +10, +16 months after CR, and one in BP at +38 months after the start of VAC therapy. Profound myelosuppression was observed in all patients; extrahematologic toxicity, especially involved the gastro-intestinal tract, with grade > 2 mucositis in five patients (29.5%) and liver dysfunction in five (29.5%). No renal toxicity or ototoxicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the brief relapse-free duration, the high remission rate and tolerable toxicity indicate that the VAC combination chemotherapy has a high antileukemic efficacy, and warrants further evaluation for the treatment of CML in acute phase, provided a post-remission BMT strategy is feasible.","['Montefusco, E', 'Petti, M C', 'Alimena, G', 'Latagliata, R', 'Celesti, F', 'Capria, S', 'Amadori, S', 'Avvisati, G', 'Mandelli, F']","['Montefusco E', 'Petti MC', 'Alimena G', 'Latagliata R', 'Celesti F', 'Capria S', 'Amadori S', 'Avvisati G', 'Mandelli F']","['Department of Human Biopathology, University La Sapienza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'VAC combination']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Remission Induction']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008235213803 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)48129-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1997 Feb;8(2):175-9. doi: 10.1023/a:1008235213803.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each of these factors may be influenced by the schedule of drug administration, specifically infusional or bolus delivery. OBJECTIVE: To review the literature for selected antineoplastic drugs to analyze the relative DI and MTD for bolus vs. infusional administration schedules. METHODS: Clinical reports of bolus and infusional delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs in the categories of antimetabolites; alkylating agents; antibiotics; plant alkaloids and platinum analogues were collected focusing on phase I studies establishing the MTD per cycle and the DI. Infusional schedules were defined as continuous parenteral administration for more than 24 hours or, in some instances, daily bolus dosing for one hour for 3 to 5 days. Bolus schedules were defined as administration over minutes up to 24 hours and also included daily dosing in some cases. RESULTS: For antimetabolites, the infusional schedule generally decreases the MTD and DI relative to bolus administration but for 5-FU, the MTD and DI both increase. For alkylating agents and the platinum analogues, the MTD and DI for bolus and infusional delivery are generally comparable; but infusional administration results in a slightly increased MTD for thiotepa and for ifosfamide, the MTD is increased depending upon the duration of the infusion. For the antibiotics and the plant alkaloids, the MTD and DI of infusional administration is variable related to the specific agent and the infusion duration and may be increased, decreased or comparable to the MTD of bolus schedules. CONCLUSIONS: The MTD and DI for most cytotoxic agents administered by bolus versus infusional schedules is unpredictable and variable and is influenced by the infusion duration and the interval between treatment cycles (for example three versus four week intervals). The MTD and DI increase substantially with infusional delivery for thiotepa, 5-FU and VM26 (the latter in leukemia specifically) and decrease substantially for the antimetabolites FUDR, ara-C, methotrexate and 6MP. For most other agents and in all four drug categories, the MTD and DI are relatively comparable although for ifosfamide and topotecan, the duration of infusion determines whether the MTD and DI increases, decreases or stays the same relative to bolus administration. The use of cytokines may substantially change the MTD and DI especially for bolus administration since dose limiting toxicity is hematologic for many agents.","['Lokich, J', 'Anderson, N']","['Lokich J', 'Anderson N']","['Cancer Center of Boston in Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/classification', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008243806415 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)48077-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1997 Jan;8(1):15-25. doi: 10.1023/a:1008243806415.,,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Ribonucleic acids isolated from the isthmus, ampullary, and fimbriae portions of the human oviduct, and from buffalo rat liver cell monolayers were subjected to Northern analysis using probes for growth factors. SETTING: Academic tertiary care hospital. PATIENT(S): Two reproductive age women undergoing a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingectomy for benign gynecologic conditions consented to experimental use of their oviducts. INTERVENTION(S): Cell cultures were established from fresh human oviduct segments and commercially purchased buffalo rat liver cells. After two passages, total RNA was isolated from these confluent monolayers, fractionated on denaturing agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and analyzed by Northern hybridization using complementary DNAs from epidermal growth factor (EGF), stem cell factor, also known as Kit-ligand, colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF), leukemia inhibitory factor, and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Radioactively labeled probes were prepared by in vitro transcription or by 5' end labeling. After hybridization, blots were washed at increasing strigencies to remove nonspecifically bound radioactivity and subjected to autoradiography. RESULT(S): Human oviduct coculture cells express EGF (kit-ligand), CSF, leukemia inhibitory factor, and IL-6. Buffalo rat liver cells contain the messenger RNA transcripts for kit-ligand and CSF. CONCLUSION(S): Human oviduct and buffalo rat liver coculture cells express specific growth factors. These results support the theory that coculture systems may enhance pre-embryo growth via the production of embryotrophic factors. The identification of these ligands may provide the rationale for selecting specific growth factors for media supplementation as well as contribute to our understanding of the general mechanisms involved in regulating early embryonic growth and development.","['Barmat, L I', 'Worrilow, K C', 'Paynton, B V']","['Barmat LI', 'Worrilow KC', 'Paynton BV']","['Albert Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*genetics', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*genetics', 'Fallopian Tubes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hysterectomy', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Liver/cytology/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BUF']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0015028297813829 [pii]', '10.1016/s0015-0282(97)81382-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 1997 Apr;67(4):775-9. doi: 10.1016/s0015-0282(97)81382-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Membrane-bound INA can be indirectly activated by energy transfer from visible chromophores. We demonstrate that the efficiency of this sensitized activation is enhanced by use of triplet-forming chromophores such as eosin and by deoxygenation. Variation of sensitized activation efficiency with INA concentration indicates that the critical distance for eosin-INA energy transfer in solution is 8-14 A. We suggest that photosensitization occurs through triplet exchange and present an improved labeling protocol based on these findings. This protocol was used to examine whether different accessory proteins are associated with isolated and crosslinked Type I Fc epsilon receptors on 2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cells. 2H3 cells were incubated with eosin-conjugated IgE and irradiated at 514 nm yielding [125I]INA derivatized peptides at 53, 38, 34, and 29 kDa. Crosslinking IgE with mouse anti-rat IgE prior to irradiation labeled three additional proteins at 60, 54, and 43 kDa. These results demonstrate the utility of sensitized INA labeling in characterizing protein-protein interactions in membranes of intact cells and indicate the importance of considering photophysical factors when selecting sensitizers and reaction conditions.

HTLV-I integrates its proviruses into random sites in host chromosomal DNA. Clonal integration has been observed in patients with ATL, including smoldering, chronic, and acute states. However, random and/or polyclonal integration has only been reported in a few asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers. To clarify the clonality of HTLV-I-infected cells in carriers, we used an inverse polymerase chain reaction (IPCR), which is more sensitive than Southern blot analysis. We used the peripheral blood momonuclear cells (PBMC) from 16 asymptomatic carriers and the separated CD4-positive cells. No cases showed either a monoclonal or polyclonal integration of the HTLV-I provirus by Southern blot. But, using IPCR, 7 of 16 cases showed either mono- or oligoclonal integration. In addition, the populations of clonal provirus in the total PBMC were frequently different from those in the CD4-positive cells. Three cases showed expression of HTLV-I tax/rex mRNA in the total PBMC, but no such expression was found in CD4-positive cells. In this study, an unexpected frequency of clonal HTLV-I provirus DNA was observed in HTLV-I carriers. These findings indicate that the clonal but nonmalignant proliferation of HTLV-I-infected cells already occurs even in HTLV-I carriers, and therefore that some other step is necessary to induce malignant proliferation.","['Ohshima, K', 'Mukai, Y', 'Shiraki, H', 'Suzumiya, J', 'Tashiro, K', 'Kikuchi, M']","['Ohshima K', 'Mukai Y', 'Shiraki H', 'Suzumiya J', 'Tashiro K', 'Kikuchi M']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Carrier State/*virology', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/*isolation & purification']",1997/04/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199704)54:4<306::AID-AJH8>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199704)54:4<306::aid-ajh8>3.0.co;2-z [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1997 Apr;54(4):306-12. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199704)54:4<306::aid-ajh8>3.0.co;2-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in megakaryocytic differentiation. The finding that endogenous IL-6 levels in serum increased after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment suggests that IL-6 may play some role in the recovery of hematopoietic systems. This observation may assist the understanding of erythroid regeneration caused by antineoplastic agents such as tiazofurin. Tiazofurin inhibits the activity of IMP dehydrogenase. Its exposure to K562 cells at 10 microM tiazofurin stimulates erythroid differentiation. Stimulation of cells with tiazofurin gave a significant increase in IL-6 production. Its levels were quadrupled after 2 days of culture. Tiazofurin also caused a trivial reduction in the percentage of cells with the IL-6R. This evidence implies that tiazofurin produced no significant effect on the IL-6R. Tiazofurin also increased the percentage of benzidine-positive cells representing hemoglobin production, confirmed by GpA expression. We concluded that IL-6 is rate limiting in regard to hemoglobin production and that IL-3 could be used for clinical benefit to stimulate erythropoiesis and synergize with tiazofurin.","['Talley, C J', 'Turner, E A', 'Hatcher, F M', 'Aguinaga, P M', 'Chakrabarti, P']","['Talley CJ', 'Turner EA', 'Hatcher FM', 'Aguinaga PM', 'Chakrabarti P']","['Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee 37208, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Ribavirin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199704)54:4<301::AID-AJH7>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199704)54:4<301::aid-ajh7>3.0.co;2-z [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1997 Apr;54(4):301-5. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199704)54:4<301::aid-ajh7>3.0.co;2-z.,,,,,"['612 RR03032/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P60 HL33737/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Western blot analysis showed that in transfected cell lines, the expression of endogenous Galpha16 protein was suppressed, but the expression of Galphaq/11, Galphai2, and Galphai3 remained unaffected. Suppression of Galpha16 in transfected HEL cells did not interfere with transient elevations of intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations induced by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), platelet-activating factor, or thrombin. In parental HEL cells, UTP and ATP mobilized Ca2+ from intracellular stores with half-maximum effective concentrations of 3. 6 +/- 0.7 and 4.7 +/- 1.6 microM, respectively, apparently by stimulating P2U purinoceptors. By contrast, Ca2+ mobilization by UTP or ATP was completely abrogated in Galpha16-suppressed cells, indicating specific coupling of G16 to P2U purinoceptors. Pertussis toxin inhibited the effect of UTP in parental HEL cells by 57.6 +/- 4.9%. These data indicate that signaling by the P2U purinoceptor obligatorily requires G16 but may be modulated further by activation of Gi. Priming of HEL cells with UTP or ATP prior to stimulation with PGE1 markedly enhanced the PGE1-induced intracellular Ca2+ release. This indirect, potentiating effect of UTP and ATP was not impaired in Galpha16-suppressed cells but was inhibited by pertussis toxin, indicating that functional P2U purinoceptors are present on these cells and that the potentiating effect primarily depends on Gi. The data demonstrate (i) that Galpha16 antisense RNA selectively inhibits endogenous Galpha16 protein expression in HEL cells; (ii) that stimulation of endogenous P2U (P2Y2) purinoceptors leads to the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ by a mechanism that strictly depends on Galpha16; and (iii) that P2U purinoceptors in HEL cells can communicate with two distinct signaling pathways diverging at the G protein level.","['Baltensperger, K', 'Porzig, H']","['Baltensperger K', 'Porzig H']","['Institute of Pharmacology, University of Bern, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland. baltensperge@pki.unibe.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (P2RY2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2Y2)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'UT0S826Z60 (Uridine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'RNA, Antisense/metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2Y2', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine Triphosphate/metabolism']",1997/04/11 00:00,1997/04/11 00:01,['1997/04/11 00:00'],"['1997/04/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/11 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.15.10151 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)40865-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Apr 11;272(15):10151-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.15.10151.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a detailed study of the role of glutathione in the intracellular trapping/accumulation of ascorbic acid in HL-60 cells. Uptake studies using HL-60 cells depleted of glutathione by treatment with L-buthionine-(S,R) sulfoximine and diethyl maleate, revealed no changes in the cells' ability to transport dehydroascorbic acid and accumulate ascorbic acid. Similar transport and accumulation rates were obtained using HL-60 cells containing intracellular glutathione concentrations from 6 mM to 1 microM. HL-60 cells, containing as little as 5 microM glutathione, were able to accumulate up to 150 mM ascorbic acid intracellularly when incubated with dehydroascorbic acid. Glutathione was capable of reducing dehydroascorbic acid by a direct chemical reaction, but only when present in a greater than 10-fold stoichiometric excess over dehydroascorbic acid. The accumulation of ascorbic acid by HL-60 cells was strongly temperature-dependent and was very inefficient at 16 degrees C.

The main clinical manifestations were anemic syndrome and hemorrhage. Anemia and thrombocytopenia were present in all cases, high white blood cell count in 4, monocytosis in 5 and eosinophilia in one. Bone marrow aspirate showed myeloid and monocytic blast infiltration (43-62%), eosinophilia (5-19%) and atypical monocytic precursors (6-18%). Induction therapy consisted in one or two cycles of daunorubicin (or idarubicin), cytosine arabinoside and etoposide, followed by two cycles of consolidation treatment, the first with mitoxanthrone and cytosine arabinoside and the second with amsacrine and cytosine arabinoside. One patient died in the induction phase, while complete remission was obtained in the remaining 5. One patient died during the consolidation therapy. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) was performed to one patient and autologous BMT to another. The first patient remains in complete remission (CR) at 68 months from diagnosis, and the second relapsed 12 months after BMT. Another patient relapsed at 13 months from diagnosis and the remaining persists in CR 13 months from diagnosis. Actuarial probabilities of CR duration and survival were 50% at 5 years. The clinico-biologic characteristics and the response to therapy of patients with AML4Eo inv(16) are similar to those referred in other series. There is a high probability of CR attainment and, probably, the relapse rate is lower than that of other subtypes of AML.","['Calvo, R', 'Ribera, J M', 'Milla, F', 'Granada, I', 'Orts, M', 'Batlle, M', 'Flores, A', 'Junca, J', 'Feliu, E']","['Calvo R', 'Ribera JM', 'Milla F', 'Granada I', 'Orts M', 'Batlle M', 'Flores A', 'Junca J', 'Feliu E']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Barcelona.']",['spa'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', '*Eosinophilia', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction']",1997/02/08 00:00,1997/02/08 00:01,['1997/02/08 00:00'],"['1997/02/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/08 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1997 Feb 8;108(5):182-5.,,,,,,,Leucemia aguda mielomonocitica con eosinofilia e inversion del cromosoma 16.

Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is becoming a good candidate for virally mediated gene therapy. rAAV is likely to be a safe vector in clinical gene transfer, as it has never been associated with any disease despite previous studies showing that up to 70% of adults are seropositive for wtAAV. Seroconversion appears to occur early in life. wtAAV is an upper respiratory tract virus that is gut secreted, but little is known about the integration of latent wtAAV in hemopoietic lineages. Unlike retroviruses, which have been the most common vehicles for gene transfer to date, wtAAV appears to have a preferred integration site in the target cell which has been termed AAVS1. Several studies have shown that wtAAV can only integrate into only one of the pair of chromosome 19 in a cell. This may have implications for the use of rAAV in gene transfer because patients with latent virus would be refractory to further infection with rAAV. We used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect the presence of wtAAV in the bone marrow samples from 106 patients who presented at our institution. We were able to detect the presence of integrated virus in 18 whole marrow samples. Subsequently CD34+ and CD3+ cell subsets were sorted from the cryopreserved marrow of three PCR-positive individuals to assess integration of virus in these cell lineages. In all three samples tested, we were unable to detect wtAAV virus in the CD34+ hematological precursor cells, but a detectable level of integrated viral DNA was demonstrated in the CD3+ cell fraction. Our findings therefore suggest that CD34+ cells might remain a good target for rAAV-mediated gene transfer despite previous wtAAV infection.","['Anderson, R J', 'Galatowicz, G', 'Macdonald, I D', 'Lowdell, M W', 'Corbett, T J', 'Prentice, H G']","['Anderson RJ', 'Galatowicz G', 'Macdonald ID', 'Lowdell MW', 'Corbett TJ', 'Prentice HG']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, Hampstead, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*microbiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Defective Viruses/growth & development', 'Dependovirus/*growth & development', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/microbiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Virus Diseases/*microbiology', 'Virus Integration']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1997 Mar;25(3):256-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic blast progenitors made blast colonies in the presence of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), or interleukin-3 (IL-3). Blast colony-formation was suppressed by vesnarinone in a dose-responsive manner regardless of growth factor added. Vesnarinone suppressed the primary (PE1) and secondary (PE2) colony-formation of leukemic blast progenitors in six AML patients tested. The suppression by vesnarinone did not significantly differ between PE1 and PE2. This finding suggests that vesnarinone exerts an almost equivalent effects on the terminal divisions and the self-renewal of leukemic blast progenitors. Furthermore, this drug suppressed the growth of clonogenic cells of five AML cell lines, OCI/AML1a, OCI/AML2, OCI/AML3, OCI/AML5, and OCI/AML6. Normal hematopoietic precursors CFU-C and CFU-E were also suppressed by vesnarinone, although vesnarinone was less toxic to normal hematopoietic than to leukemic blast progenitors.

In the past few years, important progress has been made in the classification, biology, and therapy of some of these disorders of which B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia is not only the most frequent but also the model for their study. Regarding classification, entities that may be confounded with chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been identified (eg, splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, mantle-cell lymphoma in leukemic phase); these diseases should be known and clearly separated from chronic lymphocytic leukemia because their prognosis and treatment is different from that of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. On the other hand, the molecular basis of some of these diseases (eg, the overexpression of the Prad1/CCND1 gene in mantle-cell lymphomas, the relationship between bcl-2 and bax expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia homeostasis, the role of p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia progression) are increasingly well known. Cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha or IL-2, IL-4, and IL-13) also contribute to the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferative disorders by either promoting cell growth or inhibiting apoptosis. In addition, new treatment possibilities (eg, purine analogues, hemopoietic progenitors transplants) are changing the treatment objectives in some of these diseases.

In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, high-dose cytarabine in induction and in postremission treatment improves the cure rate, whereas dose reduction of daunorubicin in older patients worsens response and increases mortality. After acute promyelocytic leukemia has been successfully treated by retinoids, another subtype-specific chemotherapy containing high-dose methotrexate has overcome the primarily poor prognosis of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The leukemic stem cell of acute myeloid leukemia representing minimal residual disease, producing disease progression in the patients, and initiating long-term growth in cultures or immunodeficient mice appears as a primitive multipotent cell. Leukemic transformation is reflected either by the specific balanced chromosome translocations or by chromosome deletions or losses. They are associated with histories of cytotoxic drugs such as epipodophylotoxins and anthracyclines or alkylating agents. Alternatively, both kinds of aberrations develop spontaneously with ethnic differences in special subtypes. Cytogenetics also determine favorable and unfavorable prognosis both for chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia high-risk and nonstandard-risk patients seem to benefit from allogeneic transplantation, whereas in acute myeloid leukemia there is no adequate basis for risk-adapted stratification between treatment modalities. New prospects lie in a more successful use of the effects of treatment intensification possibly supported by autologous blood stem cell transplantation. On the basis of standardized treatment, future clinical research can address the role of biologic features of the individual leukemia such as specific chromosome aberrations, fusion genes, expression of oncogenes, and monitoring of minimal residual disease.","['Buchner, T']",['Buchner T'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001622-199701000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 1997 Jan;9(1):18-25. doi: 10.1097/00001622-199701000-00004.,,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As with other antiapoptotic signals, BCR-ABL induces cellular resistance to a wide spectrum of cytotoxic antitumor agents.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) overcomes some of these limitations, but is mainly utilized to confirm the presence of previously characterized or suspected aberrations. We have developed a novel approach, termed spectral karyotyping or SKY based on the hybridization of 24 fluorescently labelled chromosome painting probes that allows the simultaneous and differential colour display of all human chromosomes. We have used SKY to complement conventional banding techniques in haematological malignancies by analysing 15 cases with unidentified chromosome aberrations. In all instances SKY provided additional cytogenetic information, including the identification of marker chromosomes, the detection of subtle chromosomal translocations and the clarification of complex chromosomal rearrangements. Thus, SKY in combination with standard chromosome banding allows the characterization of chromosomal aberrations in leukaemia with unprecedented accuracy.","['Veldman, T', 'Vignon, C', 'Schrock, E', 'Rowley, J D', 'Ried, T']","['Veldman T', 'Vignon C', 'Schrock E', 'Rowley JD', 'Ried T']","['National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4470, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Karyotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/ng0497-406 [doi]'],ppublish,Nat Genet. 1997 Apr;15(4):406-10. doi: 10.1038/ng0497-406.,,,,,"['9512-8/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Secondary structure elements were defined on the basis of chemical shifts, NH-C alpha H coupling constants; medium-range NOEs and the location of slowly exchanging amide protons. The protein contains four alpha-helices, the relative orientations of which were determined on the basis of long-range, interhelical NOEs. The four helices are arranged in an up-up-down-down orientation, as found in other four-helical bundle cytokines. The overall topology of MH35-LIF is similar to that of the X-ray crystallographic structure for murine LIF [Robinson et al. (1994) Cell, 77, 1101-1116].

The specificity and diagnostic value of these autoantibodies for PBC have only recently become clear through cloning of the cDNA of some of the corresponding autoantigens which allowed the establishment of immunological assays with recombinant autoantigens expressed in E. coli and eukaryotic cells. In this report we summarize primarily the knowledge on the structure and putative function of two nuclear autoantigens, the Sp100 and PML proteins, which are present in so-called nuclear dots (NDs) and against which autoantibodies are present in a subpopulation of PBC patients. Furthermore, the type of autoimmune response (epitope specificity and immunoglobulin class) against both the Sp100 and PML proteins and the specificity of the anti-Sp100 and anti-PML autoantibodies for PBC patients and patients with other autoimmune diseases is reviewed. Current knowledge clearly indicates that determination of anti-Sp100 and anti-PML autoantibodies substantially improves diagnosis of PBC as these autoantibodies are highly specific for this disease even when autoantibodies against mitochondrial antigens, a hallmark of most PBC patients, are not found. The type of autoimmune response against the Sp100 and PML proteins also provides some clues about possible mechanisms which lead to autoantigenicity of both proteins.","['Szostecki, C', 'Guldner, H H', 'Will, H']","['Szostecki C', 'Guldner HH', 'Will H']","['Heinrich-Pette-Institu fur Experimentelle Virologie und Immunologie, Universitat Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Liver Dis,Seminars in liver disease,8110297,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantibodies/*analysis/blood/immunology', 'Autoantigens/analysis/blood/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Epitopes', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis/classification', 'Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary/diagnosis/*immunology', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/blood/*immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/blood', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-1007184 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Liver Dis. 1997 Feb;17(1):71-8. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-1007184.,,72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During ATRA therapy, leukocytosis and retinoic acid syndrome were observed but were resolved by dexamethasone. Two months after commencement of ATRA therapy, complete remission was achieved. During the course of consolidation chemotherapy, however, multiple cutaneous nodules developed in her trunk, the size and number of which increased despite intensive chemotherapy. Histological and immunological studies of the cutaneous nodules showed infiltration of leukemic cells. PML/RAR alpha mRNA was detected in both the cutaneous nodules and bone marrow by means of polymerase chain reaction.

From 1988 through 1994, a questionnaire was administered annually to teachers of all leukemic children in our center. The 291 questionnaire were used to compare the school functioning of children with leukemia with that of matched controls chosen by each teacher as representative of the class as a whole, excluding special education and developmentally disabled students. This approach to matching was chosen as a control for socioeconomic factors as well. The study was conducted with all patients with leukemia entering the center residing in the region of Lombardy, attending school, and either in therapy or out of therapy. After initial treatment, the children with leukemia in our center as a group attended school regularly and willingly. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted on the total scores and on scores for each of the subareas of learning, socialization, and emotionality. T-tests, were given to contrast individual item scores of patients with those of their matched controls. On most individual items, children with leukemia did not differ from their classmates. However, significant discrepancies between children with leukemia and their classmates appeared consistently year after year on overall total scores and on each of the three major subcomponents of the test (learning, socialization, and emotionality). The groups most affected were children who were cranially irradiated and children who were under 6 years of age at diagnosis.

The amphiphilic derivative C7H15MDP has been found to be a more effective stimulator of T lymphocyte proliferation and allospecific cytotoxic T cell generation in a mixed lymphocyte culture, and a more effective activator of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) production by murine peritoneal macrophages, in comparison with MDP and C16H33MDP used in equimolar concentrations. C7H15MDP also stimulated cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells: On the contrary, its lipophilic homologue C16H33MDP did not show such activities in vitro except for its influence on IL-1 and TNF production. We have found significant differences in the interaction of these two 14C-labelled MDP derivatives with model membranes and in the uptake of these preparations by erythroleukemia K562 cells.

Requirement for augmentation of natural killer cell activity and synergy with oral AZT.,633-50,"We employed the Rauscher murine leukemia virus (RMuLV) as a murine retrovirus model of AIDS, to test biological response modifiers (BRM) and antiviral agents for potential therapeutic activity against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We examined the relationship between the augmentation of natural killer (NK) cell activity and antiviral efficacy of a series of BRM, most of which are known inducers of interferon, in this model. Poly [I,C]-LC, MVE-2, and CL 246,738, but not Ampligen, soluble glucan, or 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine, consistently produced antiviral activity. In addition, the combination of suboptimal doses of oral 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) (in drinking water) and poly [I,C]-LC produced a synergistic antiviral effect. With all the BRM tested, a consistent pattern emerged, namely that antiviral activity always correlated with the augmentation of splenic NK cell activity in infected animals. For instance, poly [I,C]-LC boosted NK activity much more in infected mice treated therapeutically (treatment initiated after infection) than prophylactically (treatment initiated before infection), and it had greater antiviral activity therapeutically than prophylactically. For the BRM tested, antiviral activity did not occur without augmentation of NK activity in infected mice. In contrast, augmentation of NK activity in uninfected mice bore no relationship to antiviral activity. Furthermore, elimination of NK cells by treating mice with anti-asialo GM1 abolished the antiviral activity of poly [I,C]-LC. Although splenic NK activity was ablated by anti-asialo GM1, serum interferon levels were not affected by this treatment. These results point to a causal connection between the augmentation of NK cell activity and the antiviral efficacy of these BRM in this murine AIDS model. NK cells thus appear to play a key role in resistance to this retrovirus, as has been suggested for HIV.","['Black, P L', 'McKinnon, K M', 'Wooden, S L', 'Ussery, M A']","['Black PL', 'McKinnon KM', 'Wooden SL', 'Ussery MA']","['Southern Research Institute-Frederick Research Center, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Asialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Glucans)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '27100-68-1 (Pyran Copolymer)', '27416-86-0 (Poly U)', '37758-47-7 (G(M1) Ganglioside)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '81541-26-6 (3,6-bis(2-piperidinoethoxy)acridine trihydrochloride)', '85141ONN7O (isatoribine)', '94325AJ25N (poly(I).poly(c12,U))', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Acridines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Asialoglycoproteins/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'G(M1) Ganglioside/immunology', 'Glucans/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Guanosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*physiology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Poly I-C/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Poly U/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyran Copolymer/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Rabbits', 'Rauscher Virus/immunology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Viral Plaque Assay', 'Zidovudine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0192056196000641 [pii]', '10.1016/s0192-0561(96)00064-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 1996 Nov;18(11):633-50. doi: 10.1016/s0192-0561(96)00064-1.,,,,,['1U01AI25617/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The different preparations resulted in significantly different trough levels of parameters of asparaginase activity, asparagine depletion, and coagulation. Not even the two preparations from E. coli were interchangeable: In a subsequent study, a mere 2500 U/m2 of the E. coli preparation Asparaginase medac resulted in trough levels comparable to 10,000 U/m2 of Crasnitin.

Three patients who were continuously receiving HU had a leukemic transformation after a chronic phase of respectively 47, 81 and 90 months. One patient developed an acute leukemia with minimal myeloid differentiation (AML MO) and soon died of refractory disease; the second developed a refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (t-RAEB) and survived one year; the third patient developed a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and is alive at 21 months. The two former patients had complex nonrandom bone marrow karyotypic abnormalities, suggestive of therapy-related leukemia, whereas the latter one had a normal karyotype throughout the chronic and leukemic phase. These findings, together with recently published results on myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) treated with HU, suggest that this drug might be as leukemogenic as other myelosuppressive therapies in patients with ET. Longterm HU therapy should be reserved for patients in whom the treatment benefits obviously outweigh the risk of inducing leukemia.","['Liozon, E', 'Brigaudeau, C', 'Trimoreau, F', 'Desangles, F', 'Fermeaux, V', 'Praloran, V', 'Bordessoule, D']","['Liozon E', 'Brigaudeau C', 'Trimoreau F', 'Desangles F', 'Fermeaux V', 'Praloran V', 'Bordessoule D']","['Service de Medecine Interne, Hopital Universitaire Dupuytren, Limoges, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,"['0 (Antisickling Agents)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antisickling Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/chemically induced', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thrombocytosis/*drug therapy/genetics']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00282-997-0011-x [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1997 Feb;39(1):11-8. doi: 10.1007/s00282-997-0011-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, human erythroleukemic cell lines were screened for the expression of Evi-1 mRNA by northern blotting. Evi-1 was expressed in all the erythroid cell lines, whether undifferentiated (K 562, HEL, LAMA 84) or exhibiting spontaneous terminal erythroid differentiation (KU 812, JK-1). Evi-1 mRNA levels were constant or elevated in hemoglobin-synthesizing KU 812 or K 562 cells in response to erythropoietin or hemin treatment, respectively. In human acute myeloblastic leukemias (AML), 11/30 expressed Evi-1 by RT-PCR. Among these cases, 4/6 erythroleukemias without abnormalities of the 3q25-q28 region were found positive. The presence of acidophilic erythroblasts (15-47% of bone marrow cells) accounted for the existence of a terminal erythroid differentiation in all Evi-1-positive AML M6, whereas one negative case was poorly differentiated and referred to as AML M6 variant.

To study the mechanism of this inhibition, we investigated the effects of astemizole and one of its active metabolites, norastemizole, on different phases of Fc epsilon RI (the high affinity receptor for the immunoglobulin IgE) receptor-activated signal transduction in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3), leading to exocytosis. Cells were stimulated either through antigen, or thapsigargin, or synergistic combinations of Fc epsilon RI receptor activation with either adenosine A3 receptors or integrins, activated by fibronectin adherence. The effects of the drugs on mediator release, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation, tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and Ca2+ fluxes were investigated. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels are not affected. Astemizole increased tyrosine phosphorylation in resting cells, especially a 96-kDa protein band. Particularly tyrosine phosphorylation related to post Ca2+ processes is changed after cell triggering in the presence of astemizole. Both drugs inhibit the influx of 45Ca2+, with similar dose response curves as for the inhibition of exocytosis. Astemizole but not norastemizole, when used in resting cells, released Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Astemizole (> 15 microM) also induced exocytosis in resting cells. It did not induce additional changes in its inhibiting effect when cells were triggered with synergistic combinations of Fc epsilon RI receptor activation with either adenosine A3 receptors or integrins. Effects on haemolysis of erythrocytes and differential scanning calorimetry in liposomes showed clear differences in membrane perturbation between astemizole and norastemizole.

The B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line SUP-B2 has a t(6;12)(q23;p13) involving ETV6 at 12p13 and a submicroscopic deletion of the other ETV6 allele. The reciprocal translocation results in the fusion of ETV6 to a previously unknown gene at 6q23, which we named STL (six-twelve leukemia gene). Both reciprocal fusion transcripts can be detected: On the der(6) chromosome, the ETV6/STL mRNA shows an apparently out of frame fusion of ETV6 at nucleotide 187 to STL, which would result in the addition of 14 amino acids to the first 54 amino acids of ETV6. On the der(12) chromosome three different variants of the STL/ETV6 fusion mRNA could be detected; variable size segments were inserted at the breakpoint between STL and ETV6 exon 3. One of these variants could give rise to a protein in which the first 54 amino acids of ETV6 are replaced by 12 amino acids from one of the STL short open reading frames. Sequence analysis of a 1.4 kb STL cDNA clone from a skeletal muscle library revealed no long open reading frames. This cell line will be very useful in studying the different mechanisms by which alterations of ETV6 contribute to leukemogenesis and in testing the hypothesis that ETV6 might act as a tumor suppressor gene.","['Suto, Y', 'Sato, Y', 'Smith, S D', 'Rowley, J D', 'Bohlander, S K']","['Suto Y', 'Sato Y', 'Smith SD', 'Rowley JD', 'Bohlander SK']","['Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'RNA, Messenger', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199704)18:4<254::AID-GCC3>3.0.CO;2-# [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199704)18:4<254::aid-gcc3>3.0.co;2-# [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1997 Apr;18(4):254-68. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199704)18:4<254::aid-gcc3>3.0.co;2-#.,,,,"['GENBANK/R01052', 'GENBANK/R81836']",['CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

However, the interpretation of results is complicated by variability in the false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR). We therefore examined the effects on FNR and FPR of three factors, namely, the criteria used for defining a fusion signal, nucleus size, and the genomic position of the ABL breakpoint. We established two different criteria for BCR-ABL positivity: by criterion A cells were scored as positive when BCR and ABL signals were overlapping or touching and by criterion B cells were positive if they satisfied criterion A or if the signals were separated by up to one signal diameter. We measured nucleus size and Philadelphia (Ph) positivity in 573 cells from normal persons and 787 cells from the Ph+ SD-1 cell line and related results to FNRs and FPRs. We also assessed the FNR in Ph+ CFU-GM colonies from five patients with different ABL breakpoints. We showed that each of these factors influenced the FNR and FPR. The less strict criterion (B) for Ph positivity increased the FPR but reduced the FNR, the FPR increased as the nucleus size decreased, and the FNR was greatest in CML cells with a 5' ABL breakpoint. We conclude that these factors should be considered when evaluating the results of FISH studies to detect the BCR-ABL fusion gene and that analogous factors may influence results of FISH studies directed at other fusion genes.","['Chase, A', 'Grand, F', 'Zhang, J G', 'Blackett, N', 'Goldman, J', 'Gordon, M']","['Chase A', 'Grand F', 'Zhang JG', 'Blackett N', 'Goldman J', 'Gordon M']","['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Chromosome Breakage', 'False Negative Reactions', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome']",1997/04/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199704)18:4<246::AID-GCC2>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1997 Apr;18(4):246-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of stem cells is crucial because only these have the capacity to generate clonal populations during development or after injury. During clonal expansion the cells are affected by many sets of receptors and ligands. These belong to at least two classes: one consists of growth factors that bind cell surface receptors and initiate signalling events; the other class contains receptors which act as ligand-dependent transcription factors such as the intracellular steroid superfamily. In spite of this elaborate regulatory apparatus, control during clonal expansion is lax, perhaps stochastic, as evident from the great heterogeneity disclosed by examining the cellular compositions of haemopoietic clones. It may be that the large number of signals impinging on binary possible outcomes (for example self-renewal or determination) serve to set probabilities rather than to determine outcomes. In leukaemia, many of the features of normal haemopoiesis are retained. The disease begins as transformations in normal stem cells; after additional leukaemogenic events clonal expansion yields malignant populations which are clonal in each affected individual. These dominant clonal populations retain the hierarchical organization found in the normal, the major difference is that post-deterministic divisions in leukaemia yield descendants that retain primitive (blast) morphology although proliferative capacity is lost. In acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) cell culture methods are available that permit the measurement of clonogenic blast stem cells. These methods have shown that regulatory mechanisms active in normal haemopoiesis are retained in AML, including lax regulation during clonal expansion. The biological features of blast stems cells displayed by the culture technique reflect in part, events in vivo, as associations have been found between results in cell culture and clinical outcome. Thus, study of leukaemic populations provides a challenge for basic science and an opportunity for successful application in control of disease.","['McCulloch, E A']",['McCulloch EA'],"['Department of Medical Biophysics, the University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Steroids)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/physiology', 'Clone Cells/physiology', 'Growth Substances/physiology', '*Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', 'Steroids/physiology/therapeutic use']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.1993.tb00129.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 1993 Sep;26(5):399-425. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.1993.tb00129.x.,,240,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The truncated Tpl-2 protein and a GST fusion of the Tpl-2 carboxy-terminal tail interact when coexpressed in Sf9 cells.

To explain these data, it has been proposed that some cases of pediatric ALL arise as a rare response to a common childhood infection, and that the leukemia-inducing potential of the agent is related to the timing of infection, with a greater leukemogenic effect for later infections compared with those occurring during infancy. An alternative model for the etiology of a subset of childhood ALL is proposed that places the critical infectious event during pregnancy rather than early childhood. In this model, the etiologic agent causes a primary infection in the mother that is transmitted to the fetus, and as a consequence of this in utero infection, the child is at increased risk of developing ALL before the age of 5 years. The characteristics that the causative infectious agent of childhood ALL occurring in the 2-5-year age range should possess include (a) ability to induce genomic instability; (b) specific effects on B lymphocytes and not on T lymphocytes; (c) higher rates of infection in regions with lower socioeconomic status; (d) limited general oncogenic potential; (e) minimal symptoms associated with the primary infection; and (f) ability to cross the placenta and infect the fetus, but not cause severe fetal abnormalities. A candidate virus meeting many of these criteria is the JC virus, a member of the polyomavirus family. Implications of the possible etiologic role of JC virus for some cases of childhood ALL (especially those with hyperdiploid leukemia cells) are discussed.","['Smith, M']",['Smith M'],"['Pediatric Section, Clinical Investigations Branch, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Genome', 'Humans', 'JC Virus/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Polyomavirus Infections/*complications/epidemiology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*virology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*virology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*complications/epidemiology']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002371-199703000-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 1997 Mar;20(2):89-100. doi: 10.1097/00002371-199703000-00001.,['J Immunother. 1999 Jan;22(1):90-1.

Telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that synthesizes telomeric DNA repeats at the DNA 3' ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, can compensate for such shortening, by extending the template of the lagging strand. Telomerase activity has been identified in human germline cells and in neoplastic immortal somatic cells, but not in most normal somatic cells, which senesce after a certain number of cell divisions. We and others have found that telomerase activity is present in normal human lymphocytes and is upregulated when the cells are activated. But, unlike the immortal cell lines, presence of telomerase activity is not sufficient to make T cells immortal and telomeres from these cells shorten continuously during in vitro culture. After senescence, telomerase activity, as detected by the TRAP technique, was downregulated. A cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) cell line that was established in the laboratory has very short terminal restriction fragments (TRFs). Telomerase activity in this cell line is induced during activation and this activity is tightly correlated with cell proliferation. The level of telomerase activity in activated peripheral blood T cells, the CTL cell line, and two leukemia cell lines does not correlate with the average TRF length, suggesting that other factors besides telomerase activity are involved in the regulation of telomere length.","['Pan, C', 'Xue, B H', 'Ellis, T M', 'Peace, D J', 'Diaz, M O']","['Pan C', 'Xue BH', 'Ellis TM', 'Peace DJ', 'Diaz MO']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University at Chicago, Maywood, Illinois 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Senescence', 'DNA Replication', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/enzymology/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Telomere/*ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/03/15 00:00,1997/03/15 00:01,['1997/03/15 00:00'],"['1997/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014482797934753 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1997.3475 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1997 Mar 15;231(2):346-53. doi: 10.1006/excr.1997.3475.,,,,,"['CA49133/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60128/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have revealed that several cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6 are involved in thyroid dysfunction. Oncostatin M (OSM) is a glycoprotein belonging to the same family of cytokines as IL-6, to which it is related by sequence and structural homology and the use of the signal-transducing receptor component gp130. We, therefore, studied the effect of OSM on iodide uptake and DNA synthesis by porcine thyroid cells in culture. OSM increased c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels but did not stimulate DNA synthesis. OSM inhibited iodide uptake stimulated by TSH; while IL-6 also inhibited iodide uptake, it was only about one-tenth as potent. IL-6 had about the same potency as OSM when it was added with soluble IL-6 receptor. OSM had no effect on cAMP production but inhibited iodide uptake stimulated by 8-bromo-cAMP and forskolin. These findings suggest that OSM exerts its inhibitory effects at the post-cAMP production step(s). OSM also inhibited thyroid peroxidase mRNA levels but had little effect on thyroglobulin mRNA levels. Investigations of the signal transduction system showed that gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor beta subunit mRNA were detectable in porcine thyroid cells by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Together with the report that serum OSM and IL-6 concentrations are elevated to the same levels in patients with sepsis, these results suggest that OSM may contribute to the thyroid dysfunction in this condition.","['Isozaki, O', 'Tsushima, T', 'Miyakawa, M', 'Emoto, N', 'Demura, H', 'Arai, M', 'Sato-Nozoe, Y']","['Isozaki O', 'Tsushima T', 'Miyakawa M', 'Emoto N', 'Demura H', 'Arai M', 'Sato-Nozoe Y']","[""Department of Medicine, Tokyo Women's Medical College, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Thyroid,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,9104317,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9679TC07X4 (Iodine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 1.11.1.8 (Iodide Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Iodide Peroxidase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Iodine/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', '*Lymphokines', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Swine', 'Thyroid Gland/drug effects/*metabolism']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/thy.1997.7.71 [doi]'],ppublish,Thyroid. 1997 Feb;7(1):71-7. doi: 10.1089/thy.1997.7.71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Difficulty in eating and speaking reduced, and there was a beneficial effect on the oral mucosa and teeth. Xerophthalmia improved in one of six patients. Five patients had adverse reactions: wheezing (n = 1), and increased sweating without (n = 3) or with (n = 1) abdominal cramps (n = 1): leading to discontinuation of pilocarpine in one. Three patients stopped pilocarpine, became symptomatic again, but the benefits were reproducible on restarting pilocarpine. The ophthalmic preparation was as effective as the oral, and was one-tenth the cost of the oral. We conclude that oral pilocarpine is effective in relieving xerostomia associated with chronic GVHD and TBI.

In this context, calculation of the myelofibrosis progression index (MPI) revealed a higher score following interferon therapy compared with busulfan. In addition, in idiopathic myelofibrosis (5) the evolution of myelofibrosis was unpredictable and according to the MPI, progression occurred at a relatively low rate (6) proliferation and dilatation of sinusoids accompanying intravascular hematopoiesis and collagen type IV deposits were predominant features in later (fibro-osteosclerotic) stages in the course of disease (7) transmural migration of megakaryocytes demonstrated by three dimensional reconstruction revealed a mole-like tunneling through the thickened sinusoidal wall.

In the majority of cases, B CLL and MCL use VH genes in germline configuration. However in some cases a higher rate of random mutations is observed. These differences are not related to CD5 expression but are accounted by Ig phenotype, since less mutations are observed in CLL cases expressing membrane mu delta, when compared to forms exclusively expressing membrane mu. PLL and SLVL cases display mutated V genes independently of CD5 expression. Although there is some evidence that CD5+ B cells constitute a separate lineage, the possibility that CD5 constitutes an activation marker cannot be ruled out. Indeed, CD5- B cells can be induced to differentiate into CD5+ B cells and VH gene analyses showed no significative differences between CD5+ and CD5- B cell lymphoproliferative disorders.

The gene for its prominent IL-1 beta form produces a 31-kDa precursor protein (pro-IL-1 beta) that is biologically inactive unless cleaved to its mature form by a cytoplasmic cysteine protease termed Il- 1 beta converting enzyme (ICE). Although ICE was first thought to be a unique enzyme with a single biologic activity, several investigators have demonstrated that ICE shares sequence homology with the protein product of ced-3, the gene for cell death of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and induces apoptosis in different experimental models. It was therefore hypothesized that ICE may either augment the production of mature IL-1 beta and stimulate the proliferation of cells, in which IL-1 beta acts as an autocrine growth factor, or induce apoptosis. Recent data indicate that ICE is a member of an increasingly recognized family of cysteine proteases. Unlike ICE, the other members of this family do not cleave pro-IL-1 beta but are effective inducers of apoptotic cell death, whereas ICE acts primarily as an IL-1 beta converting enzyme. Because IL-1 beta serves as either an autocrine or paracrine growth factor in AML, we recently investigated the effect of ICE inhibition on AML colony growth and found that ICE inhibition reduced the production of mature IL-1 beta and suppressed AML progenitor proliferation. Our data suggest that ICE does not function as an apoptosis gene in AML but rather increases mature Il-1 beta production and AML cell proliferation. It is possible, therefore, that ICE inhibitors may be beneficial in AML therapy.","['Estrov, Z', 'Talpaz, M']","['Estrov Z', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspase 1', 'Cell Death/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*pathology']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199709055579 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Feb;24(5-6):379-91. doi: 10.3109/10428199709055579.,,113,,,['CA 55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

This syndrome, however, continues to account for significant morbidity and mortality after allogeneic transplantation. With the expanded use of matched unrelated as well as mismatched related donors, the increase in incidence and severity of GVHD poses a new clinical challenge. Many of the newer agents discussed in this paper may have a role in the future as therapy for acute GVHD. The evaluation of these new agents and the approach to be taken is hampered by the realization that most patients have received and are relatively refractory to standard therapies. Clinical trials must be performed earlier in the course of the syndrome to establish the role of these compounds. Newer strategies are likely to include the use of sequential therapy directed at blocking endogenous cytokines followed by blocking alloreactive donor cells, and immunologic advances such as the induction of tolerance.

In successive studies, we detected 0.5% and 1.75% Ph+ cells, respectively, confirmed by Western blot analysis for p210 protein. These readings occurred concordantly with a repopulation of host-derived diploid female cells. Standard G-band cytogenetic analyses did not detect any Ph+ cells at these time points.

SASP and SP have induced sister chromatid exchanges and micronuclei (MN) in cultured human lymphocytes in the absence of liver activation enzymes and in B6C3F1 mice (but not in rats) MN in bone marrow and peripheral RBC. Treatment with folate reduces the frequency of MN. Perhaps the short (28 days) RBC lifespan in mouse underlies the sensitivity of this species. Thus, SASP without folate supplementation is an aneuploidogen. In a 2-year study in AL fed SASP-treated (high dose 337.5 mg/kg) rats, urinary pH was increased and urinary specific gravity was reduced at 60 weeks. At the end, this SASP group showed urothelial hyperplasia and papillomas in the urinary bladders of male rats primarily. In the FR high dose SASP group, the hyperplasia was reduced from 82% to 14%. At the end of 2 years, the incidence of multi-organ leukemia was reduced in both AL and FR high dose SASP groups. Thus, SASP caused intraluminal bladder changes in the rat (especially males) consisting of chronic urothelial stimulation, concretions, hyperplasia which resulted in neoplasia. In the mouse, because of species differences in liver ratios (mouse > rat) and, increasing (3 times higher) liver perfusion in the mouse, compared to the rat, there was hepatocellular toxicity and resulting preneoplasia and neoplasia within 2 years. These findings occurred in all AL SASP groups (flat curve without dose response); but were reduced under FR conditions. In this species, the multiorgan lymphoma incidence was reduced in both AL and FR high dose SASP groups. Thus, SASP and its major metabolites are not genotoxic. Folate deficiency associated with SASP administration is probably responsible for aneuploidy in lymphocytes and erythrocytes. SASP does not induce neoplasia directly in either livers, urinary bladders or other organs. Accordingly, SASP is judged to pose no carcinogenic risk to humans.","['Iatropoulos, M J', 'Williams, G M', 'Abdo, K M', 'Kari, F W', 'Hart, R W']","['Iatropoulos MJ', 'Williams GM', 'Abdo KM', 'Kari FW', 'Hart RW']","['American Health Foundation, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Exp Toxicol Pathol,Experimental and toxicologic pathology : official journal of the Gesellschaft fur Toxikologische Pathologie,9208920,"['0 (Aminosalicylic Acids)', '0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '3XC8GUZ6CB (Sulfasalazine)', '4Q81I59GXC (Mesalamine)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'Y5V2N1KE8U (Sulfapyridine)']",IM,"['Aminosalicylic Acids/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Anti-Infective Agents/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'DNA Adducts/drug effects', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/pharmacology', 'Liver/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Mesalamine', 'Mice', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/drug effects', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sulfapyridine/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Sulfasalazine/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Urinary Bladder/*drug effects']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0940-2993(97)80052-8 [pii]', '10.1016/S0940-2993(97)80052-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Toxicol Pathol. 1997 Feb;49(1-2):15-28. doi: 10.1016/S0940-2993(97)80052-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accumulating data supports the notion that this interaction involves the matrix protein osteopontin on the bone surface interacting with a receptor of the integrin family (alpha v beta 3) at the osteoclast clear zone. Based on the recent observation that osteopontin phosphorylation appears to be required for this interaction, it is of considerable interest to delineate the structural requirements for osteopontin-mediated cell attachment. Although binding of isolated osteoclasts to osteopontin-coated surfaces involves the alpha v beta 3 integrin, this system suffers from considerable disadvantages to allow detailed studies in this respect. We have therefore turned to another cell system, HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, to address these questions. In the presence of the phorbol ester TPA (10 nM) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (100 nM), 90% of the HL-60 cells became adherent within 24 hours and exhibited a macrophage-like appearance. Under these conditions, the osteopontin mRNA levels was elevated around 60-fold compared to the control, non-adherent cells. The absolute requirement of de novo osteopontin synthesis for the TPA and 1,25-vit D3-induced HL-60 cell adhesion was demonstrated by neutralisation of adhesion using an anti-osteopontin polyclonal antibody as well as following transfection of an antisense osteopontin phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotide. Finally, inhibition of induced HL-60 cell adhesion by an RGD-containing peptide or by an antibody to the alpha v beta 3 integrin complex suggested that the cell-derived osteopontin interacts with this integrin. It is concluded that HL-60 cells induced to differentiate with the combination of TPA and 1,25-vit D3 can be utilised as a model system to delineate structural requirements involved in the interaction between osteopontin and the alpha v beta 3 integrin.","['Andersson, G', 'Johansson, E K']","['Andersson G', 'Johansson EK']","['Department of Immunology, Microbiology, Pathology and Infectious Diseases, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Connect Tissue Res,Connective tissue research,0365263,"['0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Vitronectin)', '0 (SPP1 protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', '78VO7F77PN (arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cattle', '*Cell Adhesion', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Osteopontin', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Vitronectin/*metabolism', 'Sialoglycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/03008209609029188 [doi]'],ppublish,Connect Tissue Res. 1996;35(1-4):163-71. doi: 10.3109/03008209609029188.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But it causes severe damage to the host when produced in excess. Therefore, TNF-alpha can be regarded to possess both favorable and unfavorable effects. These pleiotropic effects indicated that TNF-alpha production-enhancers in some cases and TNF-alpha production-inhibitors in other cases would be useful as biological response modifiers (BRMs) under various circumstances. A possible lead compound is thalidomide, which had been used as a hypnotic/sedative agents but was withdrawn from the market because of it's teratogenicity. Thalidomide is a specific inhibitor of TNF-alpha production, and this effect has been shown to be useful for the treatment of various immunodiseases. Recently, we found that the regulation of TNF-alpha production by thalidomide and related hthalimides was both inducer-specific and cell-type-specific, i.e., (I) the compounds enhance 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA)-induced TNF-alpha production by HL-60 cells, while they inhibit TPA-induced TNF-alpha production by another human leukemia cell line THP-1, and (II) the compounds inhibit TNF-alpha production both by HL-60 and THP-1 cells when the cells are stimulated with okadaic acid. We also found that in a optically active phthalimide analogues of thalidomide the inducer specific bi-directional regulation of TNF-alpha production is separated.

The reactivity of mNKES was tested by the indirect immunofluorescence method. The antigen defined by mNKES was expressed on Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines Raji, Daudi, and Ramos and on B lymphoblastoid cell line IM-9. In addition, mNKES reacted with T cells stimulated with recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) obtained from normal healthy donors. However, mNKES did not react with normal resting human T, B, or adherent cells (monocytes/macrophages).

Interestingly, mNKES specifically and rapidly (within 2 hr) induced homotypic cell aggregation of IM-9 cells. This mNKES-induced cell aggregation was completely blocked by the addition of EDTA and when incubated at 4 degrees C. The mAbs reactive with CD11a/CD18 (leukocyte function-associated antigen-1; LFA-1) and CD54 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1; ICAM-1) completely blocked the IM-9 cell aggregation induced by mNKES, and induction of IM-9 cell aggregation by mNKES was significantly blocked in the presence of the protein kinase C inhibitors sphingosine and H-7 and completely blocked by cytochalasin B and cytochalasin D, which inhibit microfilament formation. Regarding biological function, IM-9 cells bearing surface IgG (sIgG) effectively promoted IgG-secreting activity underlying the homotypic cell aggregation induced by mNKES. The surface antigen recognized by mNKES has a molecular size of about 55 kDa, as determined by immunoblotting analysis. These findings indicate that mNKES recognizes a novel adhesion-associated antigen distinct from any previously reported adhesion-associated antigens in terms of pattern of cellular distribution and biological function and that mNKES is the first human mAb found that rapidly induces homotypic cell aggregation and effectively promotes the IgG-secreting activity of human B lymphoblastoid cell line IM-9.","['Ikewaki, N']",['Ikewaki N'],"['Department of Microbiology, Kitasato University School of Nursing, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Aggregation/immunology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Male', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1027374331094 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 1997 Mar;17(2):127-39. doi: 10.1023/a:1027374331094.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The grossly recognizable whitish surface layer of the cerebral cortex showed overt hyperchromatism, and contained neurons more degenerative than those located in the deeper cortical layer. The total absence of inflammatory reaction may be explained by a combination of the immunocompromised state of the patient and the character of B. cereus infection, which in itself induces little inflammatory reaction.

However, the conspicuous variation in the reported frequencies indicates the necessity for analysis of their natural occurrence in the bone marrow from untreated CML patients. A total of 833 diagnostic bone marrow biopsies from patients with Ph-positive CML were examined for PGC by 7 observers. Proof of PGC was based on systematic examination of Giemsa-stained slides with and without polarization at high magnification. Birefringence within the cytoplasm turned out to be highly specific for PGC. The risk of overlooking PGC was at least 80% when the number of these storing histiocytes was 70 per slide or less, and at least 50% when the total amount per slide was < or = 250. This high risk of failure explained the disagreement among the authors. An intensive investigation by at least two observers is mandatory if results are to be evaluated in research. Under the conditions used in this study, the natural frequency of PGC within the bone marrow from untreated patients with a Ph-positive CML is much higher than assumed to date, amounting to about 70%. On the basis of these findings, the prognostic importance of PGC in CML must be evaluated critically.","['Busche, G', 'Majewski, H', 'Schlue, J', 'Delventhal, S', 'Baer-Henney, S', 'Vykoupil, K F', 'Georgii, A']","['Busche G', 'Majewski H', 'Schlue J', 'Delventhal S', 'Baer-Henney S', 'Vykoupil KF', 'Georgii A']","['Pathologisches Institut, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,,IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Gaucher Disease/*pathology', 'Histiocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Male', 'Observer Variation', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Plastic Embedding', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01008035 [doi]'],ppublish,Virchows Arch. 1997 Feb;430(2):139-48. doi: 10.1007/BF01008035.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, the 2-mer immunotoxin was 5.6 times more effective than the 1-mer immunotoxin at inhibiting protein synthesis in the CD7+ human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) cell line HSB-2 and was also more effective at inhibiting HSB-2 cell proliferation.

In therapy studies in SCID mice with disseminated HSB-2 human leukaemia, the 2-mer immunotoxin performed marginally better than the 1-mer immunotoxin, but log-rank analysis did not reveal any significant differences between the two therapy groups. We therefore conclude that, although the 2-mer immunotoxin performed better than the 1-mer immunotoxin against target HSB-2 cells in vitro, this improved performance was not reflected as an improved in vivo therapeutic outcome in the SCID mouse model.","['Flavell, D J', 'Boehm, D A', 'Noss, A', 'Flavell, S U']","['Flavell DJ', 'Boehm DA', 'Noss A', 'Flavell SU']","['The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, University Department of Pathology, Southampton General Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Saporins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antigens, CD7/*immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', '*N-Glycosyl Hydrolases', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Plant Proteins/*administration & dosage', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Saporins']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1997.177 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1997;75(7):1035-43. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1997.177.,,,PMC2222741,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The normal NF1 allele is frequently deleted in the bone marrow cells from NF1 patients with hematologic malignancies, suggesting a pathogenic role in primary leukemogenesis. The authors report monosomy 7 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) as a second malignant neoplasm (SMN) in five children with sporadic NF1, the results of molecular analysis for NF1 and ras alterations in their bone marrow, and summarize their experience with SMNs in pediatric patients with NF1. METHODS: Monosomy 7 MDS was diagnosed as an SMN in five children with NF1 by morphologic and cytogenetic studies of bone marrow specimens. DNA extracted from these malignant bone marrows was analyzed for allelic loss at the NF1 locus and for the presence of ras mutations. The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Tumor Registry was also reviewed to estimate the incidence of SMNs in pediatric NF1 patients. RESULTS: Bone marrow specimens from four patients retained constitutional heterozygosity at the NF1 locus; one specimen was uninformative. There was no evidence of activating ras mutations. The risk of an SMN was approximately 11% among the 64 NF1 registrants with primary malignancies in the CHOP registry, but was 75% (6 of 8) among patients treated for a pediatric embryonal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Children with NF1 are susceptible to the development of malignant myeloid disorders both as a primary event and as an SMN. Additional molecular genetic analysis is necessary to determine if the NF1 gene is inactivated by somatic mutation in these secondary leukemias.","['Maris, J M', 'Wiersma, S R', 'Mahgoub, N', 'Thompson, P', 'Geyer, R J', 'Hurwitz, C G', 'Lange, B J', 'Shannon, K M']","['Maris JM', 'Wiersma SR', 'Mahgoub N', 'Thompson P', 'Geyer RJ', 'Hurwitz CG', 'Lange BJ', 'Shannon KM']","['Department of Pediatrics, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Monosomy', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*genetics', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/*complications', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational']",1997/04/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19970401)79:7<1438::AID-CNCR22>3.0.CO;2-# [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1997 Apr 1;79(7):1438-46.,,,,,"['3MO1 RR01271-1351/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA9132/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK07636/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Ten years later, the authors reanalyzed the same cohort to determine whether the very promising actuarial results observed at 5 years held after longer follow-up. METHODS: Between 1977 and 1982, 61 patients with AML were treated with a protocol consisting of daunorubicin, vincristine, and cytosine arabinoside induction followed by consolidation and maintenance for a total of 2 years. The complete remission (CR) rate was 66%, 84% in males versus 47% in females (P < 0.005). At the time of the first analysis in 1984, the overall survival (OS) was 17%, the projected 5-year continuous CR rate (CCR) 32%, and the disease free survival (DFS) rate 29%, with the best results observed for males and for patients ages 40-60 years (P < 0.05). RESULTS: When the data were reanalyzed 11 years later in 1995, the results were 14% OS, 23% CCR, and 16% DFS at 5 years. However, these figures dropped to 8%, 18%, and 11% at 10 years and to 8%, 12%, and 7% at 15 years, respectively. Among the 40 CR patients, 31 relapsed (up to 13 years after CR), and all died within 1.6 years after relapse. Nine patients were in CCR: 4 died of unrelated causes (suicide, alcoholic cirrhosis, acute peritonitis, or bladder carcinoma), 1 was lost to follow-up after 11 years, 2 were alive and well at 17 years at last follow-up, and 2 were transplanted in first CR and were doing well at 13 and 14 years at last follow-up. The survival advantage for males over females persisted (P = 0.0197), but the advantage for patients age 40-60 years did not hold. CONCLUSIONS: These long term data indicate that actuarial analysis at 5 years may overestimate the cure rate of AML patients because a number of late relapses do occur. However, the picture is blurred by the incidence of death not related to leukemia or its treatment; and when these patients were censored at the time of death, 17% of CR patients were still projected to be alive and free of leukemia after 17 years.","['Beguin, Y', 'Sautois, B', 'Forget, P', 'Bury, J', 'Fillet, G']","['Beguin Y', 'Sautois B', 'Forget P', 'Bury J', 'Fillet G']","['Department of Medicine, University of Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1997/04/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19970401)79:7<1351::AID-CNCR12>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19970401)79:7<1351::aid-cncr12>3.0.co;2-z [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1997 Apr 1;79(7):1351-4. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19970401)79:7<1351::aid-cncr12>3.0.co;2-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results suggest a new mechanism by which v-Abl leads to factor-independent myeloid cell proliferation: the activation of E2F-1-mediated transcription.","['Birchenall-Roberts, M C', 'Yoo, Y D', 'Bertolette, D C 3rd', 'Lee, K H', 'Turley, J M', 'Bang, O S', 'Ruscetti, F W', 'Kim, S J']","['Birchenall-Roberts MC', 'Yoo YD', 'Bertolette DC 3rd', 'Lee KH', 'Turley JM', 'Bang OS', 'Ruscetti FW', 'Kim SJ']","['Intramural Research Support Program, SAIC Frederick, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Arid4a protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor DP1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor', 'Fungal Proteins/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Transcription Factor DP1', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1997/04/04 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/04/04 00:00'],"['1997/04/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/04/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.14.8905 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)40906-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Apr 4;272(14):8905-11. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.14.8905.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the clinical presentation, means of diagnosis, treatment and outcome of tuberculosis in a retrospective study of 6 patients among 75 with hairy cell leukemia diagnosed from 1982 to 1995. RESULTS: Hearlding symptoms of tuberculosis diagnosis were: fever (6/6), weight loss (4/6), pleural effusion (1/6), superficial adenopathy (1/6), persistence of cytopenia or splenomegaly during the treatment of hairy cell leukemia. Pulmonary symptoms were present in only two cases. Diagnosis was obtained by positive culture of mycobacteria in 2 cases (Mycobacterium tuberculosis in pleural effusion, Mycobacterium kansaii in adenopathy). Microbiological diagnosis was never obtained from sputum (6/6). Diagnosis was obtained by histopathology in all cases: from bone marrow (2 cases), lymph nodes (2 cases), liver (1 case), spleen (1 case), umbilical fat (1 case). Tuberculosis was disseminated in all cases. By clinical, biological, microbiological histopathological means and response to treatment, tuberculosis was considered as: hematopoietic in all cases, hepatic (in 4/6), pleural (1/6), pulmonary (1/6). A favorable outcome of tuberculosis was observed in all cases. No death was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis was found in 8% of hair cell leukemia patients. In hairy cell leukemia, tuberculosis is characterized by few pulmonary symptoms and scarse microbiological documentation. In contrast, histopathology is very interesting to confirm diagnosis. Tuberculosis is in most cases disseminated and in particular hematopoietic diffusions is always present. In spite of existensive localization, the prognosis remains excellent and all patients can be cured. In our opinion, this good prognosis may be linked to the improvement of hairy cell leukemia treatment observed since the advent of interferon pentostatin and 2cdA.","['Rose, C', 'Auxenfants, E', 'Noel, M P', 'Mahieu, M', 'Demory, J L', 'Croxo, C', 'Wallaert, B', 'Bauters, F']","['Rose C', 'Auxenfants E', 'Noel MP', 'Mahieu M', 'Demory JL', 'Croxo C', 'Wallaert B', 'Bauters F']","['Service des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Claude Huriez, CHRU de Lille.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,['0 (Antitubercular Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antitubercular Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycobacterium Infections/diagnosis/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Tuberculosis/diagnosis/*etiology/physiopathology']",1997/02/08 00:00,1997/02/08 00:01,['1997/02/08 00:00'],"['1997/02/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/08 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Presse Med. 1997 Feb 8;26(3):110-4.,,,,,,,"Tuberculose, infection a mycobacteries et leucemie a tricholeucocytes.",,,,,,,,,

We report four cases associated with lymphoproliferative syndromes. CASE REPORTS: We observed four patients with lymphoid hemopathies who developed acquired Willebrand's syndrome. Two patients had Waldenstrom's disease (kappa), one had a monoclonal gammapathy of undetermined signification (kappa immunoglobulin M) and the fourth had chronic lymphoid leukemia with mast cell infiltration of the skin. Anti-vWFRCo antibodies were evidenced in only 1 case. Chemotherapy, used in 3 cases, improved hemostasis in one patient. Intravenous immunoglobulins (1 patient) and desmopressin (2 patients) were ineffective. The pathogenic mechanisms and possible therapeutic approaches to acquired Willebrand's syndrome are discussed. DISCUSSION: Acquired Willebrand's syndrome rarely occurs in association with lymphoproliferative disorders appears to be uncommon but the frequency is probably underestimated because appropriate tests are not always performed. The diagnostic search is important however since the hemostasis disorders due to acquired Willebrand's syndrome could be corrected if appropriate etiological treatment is given.","['Hamidou, M', 'Agard, C', 'Fressinaud, E', 'Fiks-Sigaud, M', 'Rapp, M J', 'Grolleau, J Y', 'Harousseau, J L']","['Hamidou M', 'Agard C', 'Fressinaud E', 'Fiks-Sigaud M', 'Rapp MJ', 'Grolleau JY', 'Harousseau JL']","['Service de Medecine interne A, Hotel-Dieu, Nantes.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Aged', 'Chronic Disease', 'Emergencies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*etiology/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'von Willebrand Diseases/*complications/immunology/therapy']",1997/01/18 00:00,1997/01/18 00:01,['1997/01/18 00:00'],"['1997/01/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Presse Med. 1997 Jan 18-25;26(1):12-4.,,,,,,,Syndrome de Willebrand acquis avec desordres lymphoproliferatifs.,,,,,,,,,

The proposed solution is building efficient knowledge acquisition (KA) tools. This paper presents a set of KA tools we are developing within a European Project called GAMES II. They have been designed after the formulation of an epistemological model of medical reasoning. The main goal is that of developing a computational framework which allows knowledge engineers and domain experts to interact cooperatively in developing a medical KBS. To this aim, a set of reusable software components is highly recommended. Their design was facilitated by the development of a methodology for KBS construction. It views this process as comprising two activities: the tailoring of the epistemological model to the specific medical task to be executed and the subsequent translation of this model into a computational architecture so that the connections between computational structures and their knowledge level counterparts are maintained. The KA tools we developed are illustrated taking examples from the behavior of a KBS we are building for the management of children with acute myeloid leukemia.","['Lanzola, G', 'Quaglini, S', 'Stefanelli, M']","['Lanzola G', 'Quaglini S', 'Stefanelli M']","['Dipartimento di Informatica e Sistemistica, Universita di Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Methods Inf Med,Methods of information in medicine,0210453,,IM,"['Algorithms', '*Artificial Intelligence', 'Child', 'Expert Systems', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Problem Solving', 'Software Design', 'Therapy, Computer-Assisted']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['95010025 [pii]'],ppublish,Methods Inf Med. 1995 Mar;34(1-2):25-39.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of these vectors to transduce target cells is an important aspect of their clinical applicability and one of the factors determining their transduction efficiency is vector functional titer. Current methods for titrating retroviral vectors involve measuring the number of target cells in culture transduced by a given volume of vector solution. In this report, we describe a new procedure which allows one to estimate the actual number of infectious particles capable of transducing a permissive cell type. Vector biological titer is calculated from the fractional decline in transduction efficiency observed when a given volume of vector solution is sequentially added to multiple dishes containing permissive cells. Values determined this way are greater than those obtained from a single transduction experiment, with the difference being inversely proportional to the degree of cell permissiveness for vector entry. The present procedure is simple, reliable and expeditious. It will be useful to standardize vector biological titers determined in different laboratories, and help implement strategies for efficient gene delivery protocols.","['Tavoloni, N']",['Tavoloni N'],"['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029-6574, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Galactosides)', '0 (Gentamicins)', '0 (Indoles)', 'A08F5XTI6G (antibiotic G 418)', 'V595OG374W (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-galactoside)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay/*methods', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance', 'Galactosides/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gentamicins/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Time Factors', '*Transduction, Genetic']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3300370 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 1997 Feb;4(2):150-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3300370.,,,,,['DK-42346/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past years, we and others have developed retroviral vectors encoding the RevM10 protein, a dominant-negative mutant of the HIV-1 Rev trans-activator protein. We could demonstrate gene transfer and inhibition of HIV-1 replication in cultured T cell lines and primary T cells. However, little is known about the levels of the antiviral protein required to achieve a therapeutic effect, particularly in primary cells. In this report, we compare different vector designs with regard to expression of the antiviral gene to develop an optimal vector for clinical applications. Our results demonstrate that intracellular steady-state RevM10 protein levels expressed from the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV) or mouse embryonic stem cell virus (MESV) promoters located in the long terminal repeat (LTR) were uniformly higher than from internal promoters (eg CMV, PGK). Analysis of selected vectors in acutely and chronically HIV-infected cell lines suggested that threshold levels of RevM10 expression are required to achieve inhibition of HIV replication. LTR-driven RevM10 expression also yielded high steady-state protein levels in activated primary T cells resulting in inhibition of HIV replication, and there was no apparent difference between the MoMLV, MPSV and MESV-LTR vectors. However, RevM10 expression was down-regulated in resting primary cells and consequently anti-HIV efficacy was significantly reduced. Taken together, the data suggest that relatively high steady-state levels of RevM10 protein are required to achieve inhibition of HIV replication and that the MPSV- and MESV-derived retroviral vectors show no advantage over the MoMLV-based vectors for expression of anti-HIV genes in human T cells.","['Plavec, I', 'Agarwal, M', 'Ho, K E', 'Pineda, M', 'Auten, J', 'Baker, J', 'Matsuzaki, H', 'Escaich, S', 'Bonyhadi, M', 'Bohnlein, E']","['Plavec I', 'Agarwal M', 'Ho KE', 'Pineda M', 'Auten J', 'Baker J', 'Matsuzaki H', 'Escaich S', 'Bonyhadi M', 'Bohnlein E']","['Progenesys Program, SyStemix Inc, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Cell Line', 'Chronic Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, rev/*genetics/metabolism', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'HIV Infections/therapy', 'HIV-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae/genetics', '*Virus Replication', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3300369 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 1997 Feb;4(2):128-39. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3300369.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The best schedule in high-dose chemotherapy is not known. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of high-dose VP-16 during two different schedules (6-hour and 3 x 1-hour infusions) and the toxicity of the two application modes in patients with leukemia who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. RESULTS: A significant difference (p = 0.008) in the volume of distribution at steady state was observed. The mean Vss was 0.21 L/kg in the 6-hour group and 0.36 in the 3 x 1-hour group. The total drug exposure time with plasma levels > 100 ng/ml is significantly longer in the 'split' group (74 vs. 143 h). Other PK parameters such as plasma clearance and area under the curve were not significantly different. Leukocyte recovery to WBC levels > 0.2 and > 0.5/nl as well as platelet recovery to stable counts > 50/nl was significantly (p = 0.002, 0.009 and 0.04) prolonged in the 'split' group (3.7 vs. 12.3, 8.3 vs. 14.3 and 25 vs. 35 d). The liver toxicity as indicated by bilirubin peak levels was significantly (p = 0.02) more severe in the 'split' group (1.7 vs. 5.4 mg/dl). CONCLUSION: The area under the curve as a measure of total drug exposure cannot be correlated to the observed higher toxicity in the patient group with the 'split' application mode. The drug exposure time as well as the three high peak plasma levels may be more important.","['Mross, K', 'Reifke, J', 'Bewermeier, P', 'Kruger, W', 'Hossfeld, D K', 'Zander, A']","['Mross K', 'Reifke J', 'Bewermeier P', 'Kruger W', 'Hossfeld DK', 'Zander A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division Oncology and Hematology Bone Marrow Translantation Unit, University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/surgery']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a010486 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)65456-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1996 Jan;7(1):83-8. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a010486.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Calcein/AM is a fluorescent dye that localises intracellularly after esterase-dependent cellular trapping and which has shown cytotoxic activity against various established human tumour cell lines at relatively low concentrations. The semi-automated fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay, based on the measurement of fluorescence generated from cellular hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate to fluorescein, in microtitre plates was used for the evaluation of Calcein/AM activity in tumour cell suspensions from patients. The cytotoxicity was measured as a survival index (SI), defined as the fluorescence as a percentage of control cultures. A total of 163 evaluable samples from various tumours were tested with continuous drug exposure. The activity of Calcein/AM was compared with representatives of six major classes of standard chemotherapeutic drugs. Calcein/AM was found to induce concentration-dependent decreases in the SI of both haematological and solid tumour cells. The ratio of solid over haematological tumour activity increased at a rate that was concentration dependent. Although it was relatively less active than cisplatin against solid tumours, Calcein/AM showed higher solid tumour activity compared to leukaemic specific agents (cytarabine and amsacrine), vincristine and doxorubicin (Dox). Among the solid tumours tested, childhood tumours, non-small cell lung cancer and sarcomas were the most sensitive to Calcein/AM. The best correlation between SI values was seen between Calcein/AM and Dox, with weaker correlations to representatives of antimetabolites, platinum compounds, topoisomerase II inhibitors, tubulin interactive agents and alkylators. Non-cytotoxic concentrations of cyclosporin A significantly potentiated calcein-induced cytotoxicity. The results show that Calcein/AM is differentially active against haematological tumours, but with substantial activity against solid tumours. The drug may represent a new class of anticancer compound with a unique means of drug delivery.","['Jonsson, B', 'Liminga, G', 'Csoka, K', 'Fridborg, H', 'Dhar, S', 'Nygren, P', 'Larsson, R']","['Jonsson B', 'Liminga G', 'Csoka K', 'Fridborg H', 'Dhar S', 'Nygren P', 'Larsson R']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, Uppsala University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '148504-34-1 (calcein AM)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluoresceins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(96)00015-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(96)00015-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1996 May;32A(5):883-7. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(96)00015-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Computerised record linkage between the National Registry of Childhood Tumours and the national transplant database held and maintained by the United Kingdom Transplant Support Service Authority (UKTSSA) was used to identify patients. Verification and clinical details were then obtained from the oncology and transplant centres. 16 patients were identified from the 31992 cases of childhood malignancy diagnosed in Britain since 1970. These comprised 13 heart transplants, 2 heart/lung transplants and 1 patient who died while on the heart transplantation waiting list. All 14 potential heart transplant patients had cardiomyopathy presumed secondary to anthracycline therapy. The original diagnoses were acute myeloblastic leukaemia (3), Wilms' tumour (4), rhabdomyosarcoma (2) and one each of five different solid tumours. Median age at diagnosis was 44 months (range 4-165 months). Median anthracycline dose was 413 mg/m2 (range 240-680 mg/m2). 13 of the 14 potential cardiac transplantation patients were more than 2 years from end of their cancer treatment before requiring transplantation and the transplantation was performed 2-126 months after onset of cardiac failure at a median age of 163 months. Five year actuarial survival from transplantation was 74%. There was no recurrence of the original malignancy in any of these patients.

Defensins have been known as the major antimicrobial granular components. Recently, we have purified a novel cationic antibacterial polypeptide of 11 kDa (CAP11) from guinea pig neutrophil granules. In this study, we have examined the extracellular release and biological activity of CAP11, and compared with defensins. CAP11 was extracellularly released from neutrophils by N-formyl Met-Leu-Phe, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, accompanied by the release of lysozyme, a specific and azurophil granule component, without release of beta-glucuronidase, an azurophil granule component, whereas defensins were released by phagocytosis, accompanied by the release of beta-glucuronidase, suggesting that the localization of CAP11 and defensins is different among neutrophil granules. Defensins increased neutrophil adhesion, and inhibited phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan particles and phagocytosis-associated superoxide anion generation. In contrast, CAP11 did not affect these neutrophil functions. Both CAP11 and defensins possessed the histamine-releasing activities for mast cells, but CAP11 was 10-fold less potent than defensins. CAP11 and defensins showed the antibacterial activities against both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. However, the antibacterial activity of defensins was completely lost in the presence of physiological concentration of NaCl (0.15 M), although CAP11 retained the antibacterial activity even in the presence of NaCl. Furthermore, CAP11 exhibited the 10-fold more potent antiretroviral activity than defensins against Moloney murine leukemia viruses. Together these observations indicate that when released from neutrophils, CAP11 likely functions as an antimicrobial molecule in the extracellular milieu, whereas defensins may participate in the modulation of neutrophil function and mast cell histamine release.","['Yomogida, S', 'Nagaoka, I', 'Yamashita, T']","['Yomogida S', 'Nagaoka I', 'Yamashita T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Juntendo University, School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

In intact cells the antibody specifically decorated the nucleoli. The same pattern was maintained if nuclei were incubated at 0 degree C in a buffer containing spermine/spermidine/KCl or stabilized by means of 0.5 mM Cu++ for 10 minutes at 0 degree C in the same buffer. On the contrary, if stabilization was performed by incubating the nuclei either at 37 degrees or 42 degrees C, the immunoreactivity dispersed all over the nucleus, forming numerous speckles. This phenomenon was not detected if, in addition to spermine/spermidine/KCl, the incubation buffer also contained 5 mM Mg++ and the temperature was 37 degrees C. If the stabilization was performed at 42 degrees C, Mg++ failed to maintain the original distribution of DNA topoisomerase II beta, as seen in intact cells. The analysis on 2-D optical section showed the alteration of the nucleolar profile, particularly at 37 degrees C, even when the samples were treated with Mg++. The 3-D reconstruction figured out the irregularity of the surface at 37 degrees C and the variations of the volume occupied by the fluorescent figures. These were in close proximity to each other both in intact cells and in 0 degree C incubated nuclei; they showed a certain degree of shrinkage in 0 degree C plus Cu++ exposed samples (-20% of the volume), and, on the contrary, the labeled structures were scattered in a volume increased two- or threefold when exposed to 37 degrees or 42 degrees C, respectively. The addition of Mg++ restored the original spatial relationship and volume at 37 degrees C, but not at 42 degrees C, where the volumetric analysis showed an increase of about 50%. Our results demonstrate that heat stabilization of isolated nuclei in a buffer without Mg++ (i.e., a technique often employed to prepare the nuclear matrix or scaffold) cannot be considered an optimal procedure to maintain the original distribution of protein within the nucleus.","['Neri, L M', 'Martelli, A M', 'Maraldi, N M']","['Neri LM', 'Martelli AM', 'Maraldi NM']","['Istituto di Anatomia Umana Normale, Universita Di Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Microsc Res Tech,Microscopy research and technique,9203012,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', '660YQ98I10 (Potassium Chloride)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Copper/*pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/immunology/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', '*Heating', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Confocal/*methods', 'Potassium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Spermidine/pharmacology', 'Spermine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/physiology']",1997/02/01 00:00,2000/06/22 10:00,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/22 10:00 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19970201)36:3<179::AID-JEMT6>3.0.CO;2-K [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19970201)36:3<179::AID-JEMT6>3.0.CO;2-K [doi]']",ppublish,Microsc Res Tech. 1997 Feb 1;36(3):179-87. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19970201)36:3<179::AID-JEMT6>3.0.CO;2-K.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight patients had a superior vena cava syndrome, five had lesions residuing or relapsing after chemo-radiotherapy and six and had been treated with steroids before diagnosis; in five cases the biopsy had been previously performed at other hospitals without achieving a positive diagnosis. RESULTS: Ambulatory mediastinal biopsy allowed diagnosis in all cases. Fifty-one patients had Hodgkin disease, 28 had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and one had chronic lymphatic leukemia. There was no operative mortality. Complications were: pneumothorax and bleeding during mediastinoscopy and wound infection after anterior mediastinotomy.

The molecular basis for expression of SCL in stem cells and its subsequent modulation during lineage commitment is of fundamental importance for understanding how early ""decisions"" are made during hematopoiesis. We now compare the activity of SCL promoters 1a and 1b in erythroid cells and in CD34 positive primitive myeloid cells. SCL mRNA expression in CD34 positive myeloid cells did not require GATA-1. Promoter 1a activity was weak or absent in CD34 positive myeloid cells and appeared to correlate with the presence or absence of low levels of GATA-1. However, promoter 1b, which was silent in committed erythroid cells, was strongly active in transient assays using CD34 positive myeloid cells, and functioned in a GATA-independent manner. Interestingly, RNase protection assays demonstrated that endogenous promoter 1b was active in both erythroid and CD34 positive myeloid cells. These results demonstrate that fundamentally different mechanisms regulate the SCL promoter region in committed erythroid cells and in CD34 positive myeloid cells. Moreover these observations suggest that in erythroid, but not in CD34 positive myeloid cells, promoter 1b required integration in chromatin and/or additional sequences for its activity. Stable transfection experiments showed that both core promoters were silent following integration in erythroid or CD34 positive myeloid cells. Our data therefore indicate that additional regulatory elements were necessary for both SCL promoters to overcome chromatin-mediated repression.","['Bockamp, E O', 'McLaughlin, F', 'Gottgens, B', 'Murrell, A M', 'Elefanty, A G', 'Green, A R']","['Bockamp EO', 'McLaughlin F', 'Gottgens B', 'Murrell AM', 'Elefanty AG', 'Green AR']","['University of Cambridge, Department of Haematology, Medical Research Council Centre, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', '*Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",1997/03/28 00:00,1997/03/28 00:01,['1997/03/28 00:00'],"['1997/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.13.8781 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)35539-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Mar 28;272(13):8781-90. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.13.8781.,,,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,

For HOX monomeric binding, a major determinant of specificity is the flexible N-terminal arm. It makes base-specific contacts via the minor groove, including one to the 1st position of a 5'-TNAT-3' core by a conserved arginine (Arg-5). Here we show that Arg-5 also contributes to the stability of HOX.PBX complexes, apparently by forming the same DNA contact. We further show that heterodimers of PBX with HOXA1 or HOXD4 proteins have different specificities at another position recognized by the N-terminal arm (the 2nd position in the TNAT core). Importantly, N-terminal arm residues 2 and 3, which distinguish the binding of HOXA1 and HOXD4 monomers, play no role in the specificity of their complexes with PBX. In addition, HOXD9 and HOXD10, which are capable of binding both TTAT and TAAT sites as monomers, can cooperate with PBX1A only on a TTAT site. These data suggest that some DNA contacts made by the N-terminal arm are altered by interaction with PBX.","['Phelan, M L', 'Featherstone, M S']","['Phelan ML', 'Featherstone MS']","['McGill Cancer Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3G 1Y6, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Abd-B proteins, Drosophila)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (homeobox A1 protein)', '0 (hoxd10a protein, zebrafish)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'TATA Box', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Zebrafish Proteins']",1997/03/28 00:00,1997/03/28 00:01,['1997/03/28 00:00'],"['1997/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.13.8635 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)35520-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Mar 28;272(13):8635-43. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.13.8635.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J., Kempner, E. S., and Dennis, E. A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 9227-9233). This enzyme appears to play a key role in regulating basal phospholipid remodeling reactions. Also an iPLA2 from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells has been purified, molecularly cloned, and expressed (Tang, J., Kriz, R., Wolfman, N., Shaffer, M., Seehra, J., and Jones, S. S. (1997) J. Biol.

Polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA fragments from P388D1 cells using primers based on the CHO iPLA2 sequence, revealed a high degree of homology between the mouse and hamster enzymes at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels (92 and 95%, respectively). Identity between the two proteins was further demonstrated by using immunochemical, pharmacological, and biochemical approaches. Thus, an antiserum generated against the CHO enzyme recognized the P388D1 cell enzyme and gave similar molecular masses (about 83 kDa) for the two enzymes under the same experimental conditions. Further, the CHO enzyme has exactly the same sensitivity to inhibition by a variety of compounds previously shown to inhibit the P388D1 enzyme, including bromoenol lactone, palmitoyl trifluoromethyl ketone, and methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate. Additionally, covalent modification of the CHO enzyme by [3H]bromoenol lactone is dependent on active enzyme as is the P388D1 iPLA2. Finally, both enzymes have the same specific activities under identical experimental conditions.","['Balboa, M A', 'Balsinde, J', 'Jones, S S', 'Dennis, E A']","['Balboa MA', 'Balsinde J', 'Jones SS', 'Dennis EA']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0601, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Pyrones)', '88070-98-8 (6-(bromomethylene)tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthaleneyl)-2H-pyran-2-one)', '9BZQ3U62JX (Dithionitrobenzoic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'Dithionitrobenzoic Acid/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/enzymology', 'Macrophages/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Naphthalenes/metabolism', 'Ovary/enzymology', 'Phospholipases A/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Pyrones/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",1997/03/28 00:00,1997/03/28 00:01,['1997/03/28 00:00'],"['1997/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.13.8576 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)35513-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Mar 28;272(13):8576-80. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.13.8576.,,,,['GENBANK/U88624'],"['GM 20,501/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 26,171/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we identified the alpha subunit of the cell adhesion receptor for pp-vWF as alpha4. Human leukemia cell lines that express alpha4beta1 integrin (very late antigen-4, VLA-4), but not cell lines which lack VLA-4, attached well to pp-vWF substrate and these adhesions were completely inhibited by anti-alpha4 integrin monoclonal antibody HP2/1. Adhesion of mouse melanoma expressing alpha4 integrin was also inhibited by anti-mouse alpha4 mAb PS/2. Furthermore, transfection of human alpha4 cDNA into alpha4(-) Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in an acquisition of adhesive activity to pp-vWF, indicating that pp-vWF is a ligand for VLA-4 integrin. Using a recombinant fragment of pp-vWF, the cell attachment site was shown to be located within amino acid residues 376-455 of pp-vWF. A series of synthetic peptides covering this region were tested for the ability to promote cell attachment and a 15-residue peptide designated T2-15 (DCQDHSFSIVIETVQ, residues numbered 395-409) promoted VLA-4 dependent cell adhesion. The peptide was also capable of inhibiting cell adhesion to pp-vWF, suggesting that this sequence represents the cell attachment site. By affinity chromatography using peptide T2-15-Sepharose, it was found that alpha4beta1 integrin complex from extracts of surface iodinated B16 cells specifically bound to the peptide. These results strongly suggest that pp-vWF is a novel physiological ligand for VLA-4.","['Isobe, T', 'Hisaoka, T', 'Shimizu, A', 'Okuno, M', 'Aimoto, S', 'Takada, Y', 'Saito, Y', 'Takagi, J']","['Isobe T', 'Hisaoka T', 'Shimizu A', 'Okuno M', 'Aimoto S', 'Takada Y', 'Saito Y', 'Takagi J']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 4259 Nagatsuta-cho, Midori-ku, Yokohama 226, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Receptors, Very Late Antigen)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '0 (von Willebrand factor propolypeptide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrin beta1/*metabolism', 'Integrins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Protein Precursors/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Very Late Antigen/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'von Willebrand Factor/*metabolism']",1997/03/28 00:00,1997/03/28 00:01,['1997/03/28 00:00'],"['1997/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.13.8447 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)35496-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Mar 28;272(13):8447-53. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.13.8447.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the Abd-B-like Hox proteins in paralogs 9-13 lack this sequence, Hoxb-9 and Hoxa-10 were reported to bind with Pbx1a to DNA. We show that these interactions require a tryptophan 6 amino acids N-terminal to the homeodomain. Binding site selection for Hoxb-9 with Pbx1a yielded ATGATTTACGAC, containing a novel TTAC Hox-binding site adjacent to a Pbx site. In the presence of Pbx1a, Hoxb-9 and Hoxa-10 bound to targets containing either TTAC or TTAT. These data extend previous findings that interactions with Pbx define a Hox protein binding code for different DNA sequences across paralog groups 1 through 10. Members of the 11, 12, and 13 paralogs do not cooperatively bind DNA with Pbx1a, despite the presence of tryptophan residues N-terminal to the homeodomain in Hoxd-12 and Hoxd-13. Hoxa-11, Hoxd-12, or Hoxd-13, in the presence of Pbx1a, selected a TTAC Hox site but lacking a Pbx1a site.

EPO has been shown to activate the JAK2-STAT5 pathway in various hematopoietic cell lines, although the physiological role of this pathway is unclear. We have previously shown that epidermal growth factor activates a chimeric receptor bearing the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor linked to the cytoplasmic domain of the EPO receptor, resulting in proliferation of interleukin-3-dependent hematopoietic cells and erythroid differentiation (globin synthesis) of EPO-responsive erythroleukemia cells. In the present study, we introduced various deletion and tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution in the cytoplasmic domain of the chimeric receptor and expressed these mutant chimeras in an EPO-responsive erythroleukemia cell line, ELM-I-1. Mutant chimeric receptors retaining either Tyr343 or Tyr401 could activate STAT5, judged by tyrosine-phosphorylation of STAT5 and induction of CIS, a target gene of STAT5. These mutants were able to induce erythroid differentiation. However, a chimeric receptor containing both Y343F and Y401F mutations could not activate STAT5 nor induce erythroid differentiation. Thus, Tyr343 or Tyr401 of the EPO receptor are independently necessary for erythroid differentiation as well as STAT5 activation. Moreover, exogenous expression of dominant-negative STAT5 suppressed EPO-dependent erythroid differentiation. These findings suggest that STAT5 plays an important role in erythroid differentiation through the EPO receptor cytoplasmic domain.","['Iwatsuki, K', 'Endo, T', 'Misawa, H', 'Yokouchi, M', 'Matsumoto, A', 'Ohtsubo, M', 'Mori, K J', 'Yoshimura, A']","['Iwatsuki K', 'Endo T', 'Misawa H', 'Yokouchi M', 'Matsumoto A', 'Ohtsubo M', 'Mori KJ', 'Yoshimura A']","['Institute of Life Science, Aikawamachi 2432-3 Kurume 839, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA, Complementary/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phenylalanine/metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1997/03/28 00:00,1997/03/28 00:01,['1997/03/28 00:00'],"['1997/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.13.8149 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)35454-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Mar 28;272(13):8149-52. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.13.8149.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mice were fed standard diet Altromin 1314 supplemented either with 0.03% 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) for 7 months or with 0.03% 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) for 6 months. PhIP and IQ are heterocyclic amines formed during cooking of meat and fish and are mutagenic to bacteria and cultured mammalian cells. PhIP is a potent mouse lymphomagen, while IQ is a liver, lung and forestomach carcinogen in mice. We found that transgenic E mu-pim-1 mice are highly susceptible to PhIP induced lymphomagenesis but do not respond to IQ treatment. PhIP feeding of E mu-pim-1 mice not only increased the total number of T-cell lymphomas but also decreased the latency time compared to either transgenic or wild-type controls. The effect was most pronounced in the treated female E mu-pim-1 mice, which showed a higher incidence of PhIP induced T-cell lymphomas than transgenic males and a strongly reduced latency period after PhIP treatment compared to non-transgenic mice. Our results suggest that the transgenic E mu-pim-1 mouse may be a useful model for short-term carcinogenicity screening of potential genotoxic carcinogens having the lymphoid system as target tissue.

Treatments were performed with apheresis machines, models Haemonetics 30-S and Baxter CS3000, using the standard program. This procedure was done because AA in many cases appears as a result of the action of a T cell population that inhibits hematopoiesis. Theoretically, removal of this clonal population would produce hematopoietic recovery. Of the total of 23 patients, 9 were excluded for final evaluation of treatment results because 7 died during or shortly after treatment (0.7-3 months); one patient abandoned treatment after three LC and another died 7 months later because of transformation to acute leukemia. The remaining 14 patients were included in the final evaluation of treatment; seven females and seven males, average age 46.1 years (range 22-69); 13 with severe, and one with moderate AA; 11 with recently diagnosed, and 3 with chronic AA; 12 without previous treatment and two treated before with antilymphocyte globulin + oxymetholone (OXM) + cyclosporine A (CsA) with transient partial remission (PR). Besides lymphocytapheresis, 13 patients received OXM; 4 of them GM-CSF and one low dose CsA. Four patients had complete remission lasting > 59.5 months (range 42-78); eight PR (average duration of > 38.6 months), and two minimal remission (> 37 and 29 months). Platelet, reticulocyte and granulocyte counts increased on average at 48.7, 73.3 and 91.4 days, respectively. In conclusion, 14 (60.8%) of 23 patients with AA showed an improvement related to LC treatment, with a survival probability of 63% from the fourth month, the latter with an added beneficial effect of the other therapies used. Larger numbers of patients have to be treated with LC to determine its real usefulness, mechanism of action and the best conditions for its use.","['Morales-Polanco, M R', 'Sanchez-Valle, E', 'Guerrero-Rivera, S', 'Gutierrez-Alamillo, L', 'Delgado-Marquez, B']","['Morales-Polanco MR', 'Sanchez-Valle E', 'Guerrero-Rivera S', 'Gutierrez-Alamillo L', 'Delgado-Marquez B']","['Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico, D.F.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Med Res,Archives of medical research,9312706,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'L76T0ZCA8K (Oxymetholone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications/immunology/*therapy', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/therapeutic use', 'Autoimmune Diseases/complications/immunology/*therapy', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology/mortality', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', '*Leukapheresis', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxymetholone/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', '*T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Med Res. 1997 Spring;28(1):85-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, poorly processive RT dissociates from partially copied RNA-DNA hybrids, that are usually extended by a second RT molecule. Despite similar structures, RNase HI of Escherichia coli can degrade RNA-DNA hybrids that are resistant to RNase H of RT. E. coli RNase HI is used to determine the accessibility to and requirement for RNA-DNA hybrids in reverse transcription in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: In the presence of E. coli RNase HI, reverse transcription yields incomplete cDNA molecules due to degradation of RNA-DNA hybrids. Delivery of E. coli RNase HI to Ty1 particles via fusion to the capsid protein can reduce retrotransposition by more than 99%, also indicating inhibition of DNA synthesis in vivo. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of both reverse transcription in vitro and retrotransposition in vivo by E. coli RNase HI indicates that the poor processivity of RT exposes RNA-DNA hybrids critical for reverse transcription to degradation. Targeting a cellular RNase H to HIV may help define the site(s) of RNA-DNA hybrids that are susceptible to nonretroviral RNase H and may be useful for gene therapy to inhibit retroviral replication.","['Ma, W P', 'Crouch, R J']","['Ma WP', 'Crouch RJ']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroelements)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (ribonuclease HI)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Capsid/genetics', 'DNA, Recombinant/genetics', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology/genetics', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/pharmacology', 'Retroelements/*drug effects/genetics', 'Ribonuclease H/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/drug effects/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2443.1996.d01-265.x [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Cells. 1996 Jun;1(6):581-93. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2443.1996.d01-265.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) effect appears to play an important role in this treatment. Direct evidence for a GVL effect has been reported in Ph1-positive CML patients who relapsed after allogeneic BMT and who were treated with leukocyte transfusion from the original marrow donor. Alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) may have facilitated this GVL effect since many patients were treated with it also. We investigated whether leukemia-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can be generated from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-genotypically identical sibling bone marrow (BM) donors who donated marrow for two patients with Ph1-positive CML in CP and one patient with Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We also investigated alpha-IFN's ability to facilitate the generation of CTLs. In the absence of alpha-IFN, CTL lines with only low cytotoxicity and no CTL clones could be generated. In the presence of alpha-IFN, however, alloreactive, leukemia-reactive CTL lines with high cytotoxicity could be generated, and CD8+ CTL clones could be established with HLA class I restricted minor histocompatibility antigen (mHa)-specific recognition. In a cell-mediated clonogenic cytotoxicity assay, the CTL clones showed specific growth inhibition of leukemic precursor cells from the recipient and a second CML patient, but the clones did not inhibit growth of hematopoietic precursor cells (HPCs) from the donor. The normal HPCs from an unrelated donor with the HLA class I restriction molecule were also recognized by the CTL clones, illustrating that the antigen recognized is not leukemia-specific. The mechanism of the immunomodulating effect by alpha-IFN is not clear. Addition of alpha-IFN to medium did not alter the expression of HLA or adhesion molecules on CML cells. In the treatment of CML, administration of alpha-IFN as adjuvant immunotherapy after allogeneic BMT may increase GVL reactivity.","['Faber, L M', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, S A', 'Rijnbeek, M', 'Willemze, R', 'Falkenburg, J H']","['Faber LM', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'Rijnbeek M', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 1996 Feb;2(1):31-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the charts of patients with acute leukemia at our institution who underwent BMT between August 1992 and April 1994 after being treated for a severe fungal infection. We evaluated criteria for diagnosis of fungal infection, timing of infection in relation to BMT, and antifungal treatment modalities. We determined peritransplant complications, evidence for recurrence of fungal infection during BMT, morbidity related to antifungal drug therapy, and overall outcome in each patient. RESULTS: Fungal infection developed in eight patients. Sites of involvement included lung, liver, spleen, and skin. All patients were treated with systemic amphotericin B. Some also underwent surgical resection of infected tissue following clinical control of infection. All patients underwent BMT. Seven of eight patients engrafted and survived BMT. One patient died of recurrent pulmonary mucormycosis. Three patients are alive and free of leukemia and fungal disease. Four patients died of noninfectious causes and had no evidence of fungal disease at the time of death. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive therapy of prior fungal infection followed by ongoing anti-fungal prophylaxis in acute leukemia patients may allow BMT without reactivation of the fungus. Reports of larger series of such patients as well as studies of the efficacy of chemoprophylaxis of fungal infections are needed.","['Hoover, M', 'Morgan, E R', 'Kletzel, M']","['Hoover M', 'Morgan ER', 'Kletzel M']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, Illinois 60614, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Contraindications', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Liver Diseases/*complications/therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/*complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Mycoses/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Splenic Diseases/*complications/therapy']",1997/04/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199704)28:4<268::AID-MPO5>3.0.CO;2-G [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199704)28:4<268::aid-mpo5>3.0.co;2-g [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1997 Apr;28(4):268-73. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199704)28:4<268::aid-mpo5>3.0.co;2-g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Twenty-four children (15 males, nine females) with an age range of 1-16 years (mean, 7.7 years) diagnosed with acute leukemia (22 acute lymphocytic, two acute myeloid) were studied over 4 months. Serum EPO and hemoglobin were measured simultaneously at multiple time points in the course of their disease, and a multiple regression analysis was performed to describe the EPO-hemoglobin relationship. RESULTS: In a model adjusted for individual subject, there was a significant correlation between hemoglobin and logEPO in these leukemic children (r = -0.55, P < .01, n = 100). When measurements at hemoglobins less than 10.0 were analyzed the correlation increased significantly (r = -0.88, P < .01, n = 21). However, approximately 20% of the observations fell into one of two groups: an inappropriately low EPO for hemoglobin or an inappropriately elevated EPO for hemoglobin. The clinical characteristics of the children at each of these determinations were not different in any manner from the determinations which fell within the 95% confidence intervals for predicted mean EPO value: each of the outlying points came from a patient who at other times had an appropriate EPO for hemoglobin.

In the present study we examined the effects of a newly synthesized AdoMetDC inhibitor. 4-amidinoindan-1-one 2'-amidinohydrazone (CGP 48664), on polyamine metabolism in the mouse leukaemia cell line L1210. Treatment of the cells with 2 microM CGP 48664 led to a depletion of cellular spermidine and spermine. The putrescine content, in contrast, was markedly increased. Cells seeded in the presence of the inhibitor showed a significant decrease in growth rate, which was fully reversed by the addition of 2 microM spermidine or 1 microM spermine. The syntheses of ornithine decarboxylase and AdoMetDC were greatly increased in cells treated with CGP 48664. These increases were not correlated with similar changes in the mRNA levels, indicating the involvement of a translational mechanism. CGP 48664 was demonstrated to be a very poor competitor of spermidine uptake in the L1210 cells. L1210 cells deficient in polyamine transport were as sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of the inhibitor as were the parental cells, indicating that CGP 48664 did not enter the cells by the polyamine transport system. In addition to inhibiting AdoMetDC, CGP 48664 stabilized the enzyme against degradation. In the present study we also demonstrated that aminoguanidine (AMG), which is frequently used in cellular systems to inhibit any action of serum polyamine oxidase, apparently inhibits AdoMetDC by an irreversible mechanism that markedly stabilizes the enzyme against proteolytic degradation. CGP 48664 and the parental compound methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone), which is also a potent inhibitor of AdoMetDC, contain one or two AMG-like moieties; the importance of these residues in the inhibition of AdoMetDC is discussed.","['Svensson, F', 'Mett, H', 'Persson, L']","['Svensson F', 'Mett H', 'Persson L']","['Department of Physiology and Neuroscience, University of Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Amidines)', '0 (Indans)', '0 (Polyamines)', ""149400-88-4 (4-amidinoindan-1-one 2'-amidinohydrazone)"", 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/*antagonists & inhibitors/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Amidines/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Stability/drug effects', 'Indans/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/metabolism', 'Polyamines/metabolism']",1997/02/15 00:00,1997/02/15 00:01,['1997/02/15 00:00'],"['1997/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3220297 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1997 Feb 15;322 ( Pt 1):297-302. doi: 10.1042/bj3220297.,,,PMC1218191,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effect of 8BrcAMP addition on the G-CSF-stimulated extracellular signal-related protein kinase 1 (Erk-1), p21ras and Raf-1 activation. The Erk-1 activity was not down-regulated by the increase in intracellular cAMP levels, whereas p21ras and Raf-1 activities were, suggesting that Erk-1 activity might not be dependent on upstream p21ras and/or Raf-1 activity in this system. To explore this possibility further, we sought to determine whether there were downstream substrates of Raf-1 that were distinguishable from those of Erk-1 by using two-dimensional SDS/PAGE analysis of the protein phosphorylation patterns of NFS-60 cell cytosolic extracts treated with exogenous Raf-1 or Erk-1 in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP. The two phosphorylation patterns were found to have many differences. To gain further insights into the possible relevance of these phosphorylation patterns and as an approach to exploring in more detail the inhibitory effect of 8BrcAMP, two-dimensional SDS/PAGE analysis was performed on the cytosolic extracts of 32P-labelled NFS-60 cells treated with G-CSF, in the absence or presence of 8BrcAMP. It was found that the phosphorylated proteins whose appearance was specific to the action of exogenous Raf-1 were sensitive to the action of 8BrcAMP in vivo, whereas those whose appearance was specific to the action of exogenous Erk-1 alone, or common to the actions of Raf-1 and Erk-1, were 8BrcAMP-insensitive. The results are consistent with a Raf-1-independent pathway for Erk-1 activation in G-CSF treated myeloid cells, and a number of potential downstream substrates of these kinases have been identified for further characterization.","['Csar, X F', 'Ward, A C', 'Hoffmann, B W', 'Guy, G G', 'Hamilton, J A']","['Csar XF', 'Ward AC', 'Hoffmann BW', 'Guy GG', 'Hamilton JA']","['University of Melbourne, Department of Medicine, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Cell-Free System/metabolism', 'DNA/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/02/15 00:00,1997/02/15 00:01,['1997/02/15 00:00'],"['1997/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3220079 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1997 Feb 15;322 ( Pt 1):79-87. doi: 10.1042/bj3220079.,,,PMC1218161,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Records of 20,686 women hospitalized with endometriosis during the period 1969 to 1983, as identified through the nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register, were linked against the National Swedish Cancer Registry through 1989 to identify all subsequent diagnoses of cancer. The study subjects were followed up for a mean of 11.4 years, with the cohort contributing 216,851 woman years of follow-up. Standardized incidence ratios were computed by the use of age- and period-specific incidence rates derived from the Swedish population. Because of the high proportion of subjects with gynecologic operations (55.6%), evaluation of the risk of gynecologic cancers involved truncation of person years at the time of any such operation. RESULTS: The overall cancer risk was 1.2 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.3). Significant excesses were observed for breast cancer (standardized incidence ratio = 1.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.4), ovarian cancer (1.9, 1.3 to 2.8), and hematopoietic malignancies (1.4, 1.0 to 1.8); this latter excess was largely driven by an excess risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (1.8, 1.2 to 2.6). The risk of ovarian cancer was particularly elevated among subjects with a long-standing history of ovarian endometriosis (4.2, 2.0 to 7.7). Cervical cancer risk was slightly reduced (0.7, 0.4 to 1.3) whereas no association was observed for cancer of the endometrium (1.1, 0.6 to 1.9). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that further attention be given to the risk of breast, ovarian and hematopoietic cancers among women with endometriosis and to exploring possible hormonal and immunologic reasons for the excess risks.","['Brinton, L A', 'Gridley, G', 'Persson, I', 'Baron, J', 'Bergqvist, A']","['Brinton LA', 'Gridley G', 'Persson I', 'Baron J', 'Bergqvist A']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Obstet Gynecol,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,0370476,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Endometriosis/*complications/diagnosis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk Factors']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9378(97)70550-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9378(97)70550-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1997 Mar;176(3):572-9. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9378(97)70550-7.,['Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1997 Nov;177(5):1274-5.

The runt protein (Runt) contains an evolutionarily conserved domain (the Runt domain) that is found in several mammalian proteins including the human protein AML1, which is involved in many chromosome translocations associated with leukaemia. Specific DNA binding activity of a mammalian Runt domain is enhanced by a partner protein called PEBP2beta/CBFbeta. DNA binding activity of Drosophila Runt is also stimulated by this protein, suggesting the existence of a similar Runt partner protein in Drosophila. RESULTS: We report here the cloning of two closely linked Drosophila genes, runt domain partner (rp) beta1 and beta2, that encode homologues of mouse PEBP2beta/CBFbeta. They are highly homologous to each other and to the mammalian counterpart. Either of the rpb proteins is capable of forming a complex with Runt and stimulating its DNA binding activity, but their temporal and spatial distributions are quite dissimilar, suggesting that functional specificity of Runt may be conferred by the interacting partner. Runt represses transcription dominantly when coexpressed with either partner in cultured cells, a function consistent with a direct role for Runt in regulating expression of the even-skipped gene in Drosophila embryos. CONCLUSIONS: Drosophila Runt can interact with either of two Runt domain partners, and the resulting complex functions as an active repressor of transcription.","['Fujioka, M', 'Yusibova, G L', 'Sackerson, C M', 'Tillib, S', 'Mazo, A', 'Satake, M', 'Goto, T']","['Fujioka M', 'Yusibova GL', 'Sackerson CM', 'Tillib S', 'Mazo A', 'Satake M', 'Goto T']","['Kimmel Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,"['0 (Bgb protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Bro protein, Drosophila)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (run protein, Drosophila)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Drosophila/*genetics/metabolism', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2443.1996.tb00014.x [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Cells. 1996 Aug;1(8):741-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2443.1996.tb00014.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesize that membrane lipid-derived free radical formation is an early event in this process. In the presence of iron and ascorbate, lipid free radicals are generated during cellular photosensitization of L1210 cells as detected by electron paramagnetic resonance spin-trapping techniques. Tocopherol levels decline in an inverse manner to lipid radical formation. Trypan blue dye exclusion by membranes also decreases inversely to lipid radical formation but at an initially slower rate than alpha-tocopherol depletion. Propidium iodide nuclear staining as an alternative measure of cell integrity was a later event, occurring when alpha-tocopherol levels had fallen by 90%, trypan blue survival had decreased to below 10%, and lipid radical formation was nearing plateau levels. Likewise, the formation of cellular debris did not occur substantially until alpha-tocopherol was virtually exhausted and radical intensity had nearly reached a maximum. These temporal observations suggest the following sequence of events that leads to Photofrin photosensitization-induced cytotoxicity in the presence of iron and ascorbate: (1) singlet oxygen-derived lipid hydroperoxide formation and subsequent radical production; (2) cellular alpha-tocopherol depletion; (3) trypan blue-detectable membrane leakage; (4) nuclear exposure to propidium; (5) cell disintegration. These observations are consistent with membrane lipid-derived free radical formation being an early and perhaps seminal event in photosensitization by Photofrin, which leads to a concatenated series of events terminating in cell destruction.","['Kelley, E E', 'Buettner, G R', 'Burns, C P']","['Kelley EE', 'Buettner GR', 'Burns CP']","['Department of Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '68335-15-9 (Hematoporphyrin Derivative)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Free Radicals', 'Hematoporphyrin Derivative/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lipids/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1997.tb08608.x [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1997 Mar;65(3):576-80. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1997.tb08608.x.,,,,,['P01 CA 66081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that their presence in this location is accompanied by an intense mastocytosis. We have investigated the potential relationships between IgE responses, the allergenicity of schistosome antigens, mast cell responsiveness, and worm elimination. Total and specific IgE were measured using an ELISA and a functional assay based on 3H serotonin release from activated rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-SRA), respectively. Both assays revealed that infected rats produced elevated IgE titres relative to naive animals. At days 28 and 35, mixed-sex infections stimulated a higher total IgE than male-only infections. IgE was affinity purified from rat infection serum and used to probe a fractionated soluble worm antigen preparation (SWAP) by Western blotting. Two allergenic products were detected of M(r) 67 and 36-38 kDa, the former having the same molecular weight as a previously identified secretory protein. IgE from mixed-sex schistosome infections bound strongly to the 36-38 kDa molecule, compared to the relatively weak binding exhibited by IgE from male-only infection serum. Since eggs were not recovered from the infected rats, this reactivity was attributed to the greater release of allergens from female worms. Results from the RBL-SRA showed that female SWAP was a more effective trigger of mast cell degranulation in vitro, for equal amounts of protein. This enhanced allergenicity was ascribed to the relative abundance of carbohydrate moieties. Our results support a role for IgE, and mast cell degranulation in the elimination of a primary schistosome burden from rats.","['Cutts, L', 'Wilson, R A']","['Cutts L', 'Wilson RA']","['Department of Biology, University of York, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Parasite Immunol,Parasite immunology,7910948,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antibodies, Helminth)', '0 (Carbohydrates)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Allergens', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Helminth/*immunology', 'Biomphalaria', 'Carbohydrates', '*Cell Degranulation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Schistosoma mansoni/*immunology', 'Schistosomiasis mansoni/blood/*immunology']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-3024.1997.d01-184.x [doi]'],ppublish,Parasite Immunol. 1997 Feb;19(2):91-102. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-3024.1997.d01-184.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of specific and nonspecific leukocyte esterase activities showed that STL induced monocytotic differentiation while MEL induced granulocytic differentiation. STL and MEL markedly increased common differentiation-associated characteristics in monocytes and granulocytes, such as nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reducing ability, expression of Fc receptors, and phagocytic activities in HL60 cells, respectively. Neither sugar moieties nor fatty acids in the free form, the individual components of STL and MEL, were effective at inducing the differentiation of HL60 cells. The induction of differentiation was not due to surface activities of STL and MEL on the basis of the complete ineffectiveness of the analogues tested. The composition of cell surface glycosphingolipids (GSL) changed such that the GM3/LacCer ratio increased in STL-treated cells, whereas it decreased in MEL-treated cells. HL60 cells treated with STL and MEL exhibited a significant decrease in the activity of the intracellular phospholipid- and Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C). Furthermore, the serine/threonine phosphorylations in intact HL60 cells were clearly inhibited by the presence of GM3 and MEL, but not by LacCer and STL. These results suggest that the differentiation-inducing activity of STL and MEL is not due to a simple detergent-like effect but due to a specific action on the plasma membrane. The inhibitory effect of STL on protein kinase activity was through increasing GM3, but MEL had a direct inhibitory effect.","['Isoda, H', 'Shinmoto, H', 'Kitamoto, D', 'Matsumura, M', 'Nakahara, T']","['Isoda H', 'Shinmoto H', 'Kitamoto D', 'Matsumura M', 'Nakahara T']","['Institute of Applied Biochemistry, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Lipids,Lipids,0060450,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Succinates)', 'AB6MNQ6J6L (Succinic Acid)', 'B8WCK70T7I (Trehalose)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.- (leukocyte esterase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Candida/metabolism', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Fatty Acids/pharmacology', 'Glycolipids/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Glycosphingolipids/chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Rhodococcus/metabolism', 'Succinates/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Succinic Acid', 'Trehalose/chemistry/pharmacology']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11745-997-0033-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Lipids. 1997 Mar;32(3):263-71. doi: 10.1007/s11745-997-0033-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 17 ML cases, i.e. 5 cases of neutron-induced and 12 cases of photon- (3 gamma-ray and 9 x-ray) induced ML were included in the study along with 12 DNA samples from the bone marrow cells of control mice. Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphisms (PCR-SSCP) and the direct sequencing of PCR products were used to analyze three regions of the N-ras gene: (i) a 120 base-pair (bp) long portion of exon I (codons 2-37); (ii) a 103 bp long portion of exon II (codons 48-82); and (iii) a 107 bp long portion of exon III (codons 118-150). PCR-SSCP mobility shifts indicated mutations within only exon II of the N-ras gene. Such mutations were more prevalent in samples from mice exposed to fast neutrons. The exact type and location of these mutations were then determined by direct DNA sequencing. Silent point mutations, i.e. base transitions at the third base of codons 57 (GAC-->GAT), 62 (CAA-->CAC), or 70 (CAG-->CAA) were present only in mice that developed ML after exposure to fast neutrons. A base transversion at the third base of codon 61 (CAA-->CAC) was also observed in some ML cases. DNA sequencing demonstrated that ML samples contained normal as well as mutated DNA sequences. The higher frequency of N-ras mutations in neutron-induced ML suggested that fast neutrons are more effective in inducing genomic instability at the N-ras region of the genome. More importantly, N-ras mutations are not the initiating event in radiation leukemogenesis. This conclusion was supported by the finding that N-ras mutations were detected only in mice with an overt leukemic phenotype but not in mice with minimal tissue infiltration of leukemic cells, suggesting that the disease may be present prior to the presence of N-ras mutations. Alternatively, N-ras may be present in these mice but a large number of normal spleen cells in these mice interferes with the detection of mutation in a small population of leukemic cells.","['Rithidech, K N', 'Dunn, J J', 'Gordon, C R', 'Cronkite, E P', 'Bond, V P']","['Rithidech KN', 'Dunn JJ', 'Gordon CR', 'Cronkite EP', 'Bond VP']","['Medical Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973-5000, USA. rithidech@bnlarm.bnl.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,,IM,"['Animals', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mutagenesis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(96)90110-2 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.1996.0110 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 1996;22(3):271-80. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.1996.0110.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While many full-length sequences of HTLV-1 are known, data on the p12 regions of African STLV-I are unavailable. We have undertaken to sequence the p12 gene in STLV-I from Central and West Africa naturally infected primates, and have compared them to known p12 sequences of HTLV-I. Our data on sequence and in vitro transcription-translation analyses indicate that p12 is a 91-amino acid (aa) protein among STLV-I strains from Central and West Africa, in contrast to the 99-aa protein found among HTLV-I strains around the globe. The p12 sequences of STLV-I exhibit a marked genetic variability at the level of both nucleotide and peptide sequences. Hydropathic and helical wheel analyses reveal that 60% of residues in HTLV-I p12 are hydrophobic, in contrast to 55% in STLV-I from Africa. Although HTLV-I and STLV-I show a similar putative antigenic site, a second potential site was located exclusively in STLV-I from Africa. There are differences in the predicted transmembrane domains in p12 between STLV-I and HTLV-I.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia-associated thrombocytopenia, which may also contribute to the hemorrhagic risk, is generally caused by decreased production and immune-mediated destruction. This is the case of a 56-year-old man with longstanding chronic lymphocytic leukemia who developed thrombocytopenia (platelet counts of approximately 50,000/microL) with an associated abnormal platelet morphology. Although the patient did not suffer clinically significant bleeding, several tests of platelet function were grossly abnormal. Electron microscopic examination of the platelets revealed virtually complete absence of dense granules. Platelet aggregation did not occur with adenosine diphosphate (10 microM), collagen (2 micrograms/mL), or ristocetin (1 mg/mL). Doubling the agonist concentrations produced only minimal agglutination with ristocetin. The bleeding time was mildly prolonged at 9.0 and 10.5 minutes. Von Willebrand antigen and ristocetin cofactor levels were normal. Collagen-induced adenosine triphosphate secretion was less than 10% that of a matched normal control. In contrast, platelet force development was virtually normal, reaching 4,800 dynes at 1,200 seconds compared with 5,800 dynes for the healthy control. The patient's clots demonstrated enhanced clot modulus 44,000 dynes/cm2 versus 22,400 dynes/cm2 for the healthy control. The latter finding was primarily because of high fibrinogen concentration. This third report of storage pool disease in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia demonstrates that dense granule release is not required for normal platelet-mediated force development.","['Carr, M E Jr', 'Hines, S', 'Carr, S L', 'Todd, W M', 'Taylor, T L', 'Mohanty, L']","['Carr ME Jr', 'Hines S', 'Carr SL', 'Todd WM', 'Taylor TL', 'Mohanty L']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Medical College of Virginia/Virginia Commonwealth University, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Med Sci,The American journal of the medical sciences,0370506,['8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)'],IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Platelet Aggregation', 'Platelet Storage Pool Deficiency/*blood']",1997/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9629(15)40086-2 [pii]', '10.1097/00000441-199703000-00009 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med Sci. 1997 Mar;313(3):176-81. doi: 10.1097/00000441-199703000-00009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 10-mile area around TMI was divided into 69 study tracts, which were assigned radiation dose estimates based on radiation reading and models of atmospheric dispersion. Incident cancers from 1975 to 1985 were ascertained from hospital records and assigned to study tracts. Associations between accident doses and incidence rates of leukemia, lung cancer, and all cancer were assessed using relative dose estimates calculated by the earlier investigators. Adjustments were made for age, sex, socioeconomic characteristics, and preaccident variation in incidence. Considering a 2-year latency, the estimated percent increase per dose unit +/- standard error was 0.020 +/- 0.012 for all cancer, 0.082 +/- 0.032 for lung cancer, and 0.116 +/- 0.067 for leukemia. Adjustment for socioeconomic variables increased the estimates to 0.034 +/- 0.013, 0.103 +/- 0.035, and 0.139 +/- 0.073 for all cancer, lung cancer, and leukemia, respectively. Associations were generally larger considering a 5-year latency, but were based on smaller numbers of cases. Results support the hypothesis that radiation doses are related to increased cancer incidence around TMI. The analysis avoids medical detection bias, but suffers from inaccurate dose classification; therefore, results may underestimate the magnitude of the association between radiation and cancer incidence. These associations would not be expected, based on previous estimates of near-background levels of radiation exposure following the accident.","['Wing, S', 'Richardson, D', 'Armstrong, D', 'Crawford-Brown, D']","['Wing S', 'Richardson D', 'Armstrong D', 'Crawford-Brown D']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7400, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,,IM,"['Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Pennsylvania/epidemiology', '*Power Plants', '*Radioactive Hazard Release']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.9710552 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1997 Jan;105(1):52-7. doi: 10.1289/ehp.9710552.,"['Environ Health Perspect. 1997 Jan;105(1):12.

Oxidative metabolites of vitamin A (retinol) are natural retinoids present at low levels in the peripheral blood. Synthetic retinoids are classified into 3 generations including nonaromatic, monoaromatic and polyaromatic compounds. They are detectable in plasma 30-60 minutes after systemic administration, and reach maximum concentrations 2 to 4 hours later. Elimination half-life is 10 to 20 hours for isotretinoin, 80 to 175 days for etretinate and 2 to 4 days for, trans-acitretin; the latter, however, partially converts into etretinate. Retinoid concentrations in skin are rather low in contrast to subcutaneous fat tissue. Intracellularly, retinoids interact with cytosolic proteins and specific nuclear receptors. Two classes of nuclear receptors have been suggested to mediate retinoid activity at the molecular level, RARs and RXRs. The expression of retinoid receptors is tissue specific; skin mainly espresses RAR gamma and RXR alpha. Retinoids affect epidermal cell growth and differentiation as well as sebaceous gland activity and exhibit immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Current retinoid research targets the development of receptor-selective retinoids for tailoring and/or improving their therapeutic profile. Currently, tretinoin is used systemically for acute promyelocytic leukaemia, etretinate and acitretin for psoriasis and related disorders, as well as other disorders of keratinisation and isotretinoin for seborrhoea, severe acne, rosacea and acneiform dermatoses. Systemic retinoids are also applied for chemoprevention of epithelial skin cancer and cutaneous T cell lymphoma. The major adverse effect of retinoids is teratogenicity; all other adverse effects are dose-dependent and controllable. Contraception is, therefore, essential during retinoid treatment in women of child-bearing age. Clinical monitoring requires physical examination for adverse effects every 3 to 4 weeks and proper laboratory investigations, also including analysis of retinoid bioavailability in selected cases. Topical retinoids are rapidly developing at present and seem promising for the future; their clinical application includes acne, aging, photodamage, precanceroses, skin cancer and disorders of skin pigmentation. The development of receptor-specific retinoids for topical treatment of psoriasis and/or acne may lead to interesting new compounds based on our current concepts of retinoid function.","['Orfanos, C E', 'Zouboulis, C C', 'Almond-Roesler, B', 'Geilen, C C']","['Orfanos CE', 'Zouboulis CC', 'Almond-Roesler B', 'Geilen CC']","['Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center Benjamin Franklin, Free University of Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,['0 (Retinoids)'],IM,"['Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Retinoids/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Skin Diseases/*drug therapy']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003495-199753030-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 1997 Mar;53(3):358-88. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199753030-00003.,,262,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The differentiation-inducing activities of various hemin-related compounds, including hematoporphyrin IX, mesoporphyrin IX, deuteroporphyrin IX and protoporphyrin IX dimethyl ester, suggested certain structural requirements for the activity: 1) the iron moiety of hemin is not essential, and 2) the propionic acid side chains of hemin play an important role. In addition, we have examined the influence of some bioactive factors on hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation of K562 cell line. Retinoids and tubulin-disruptors dose-dependently enhanced hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation of K562 cells, though they did not themselves induce differentiation. Retinoid antagonists suppressed hemin-induced differentiation. The effects of hemin and/or retinoids on the mRNA expressions of oncogenes (c-myc and c-myb) and retinoic acid receptor genes (rar alpha and rar beta) of K562 cells were analyzed. We also examined the possible involvement of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation of K562 cells by the use of its ligands. Diazepam itself was revealed to possess differentiation-inducing activity on K562 cells. The PBR-specific ligands modified hemin-induced differentiation. These results suggest a requirement for retinoids (or retinoid-like cofactors) for hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation of K562 cells and the involvement of PBR in erythroid differentiation of K562 cell line.","['Nakajima, O', 'Iwasaki, S', 'Hashimoto, Y']","['Nakajima O', 'Iwasaki S', 'Hashimoto Y']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, GABA-A)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tubulin)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Structure', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Protoporphyrins/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, GABA-A/*metabolism', 'Retinoids/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 1997 Feb;43(1):115-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These treatments caused a rapid increase in intracellular peroxide levels. Preincubation of HL-60 cells with the hydrogen peroxide-scavenging enzyme catalase (500 U/ml) inhibited apoptosis due to UV irradiation or low concentrations of camptothecin, etoposide or melphalan, but did not protect against higher concentrations. In contrast, superoxide anion levels in the cells remained unchanged upon treatment with cytotoxic drugs, while UV irradiation led to a transient doubling in superoxide levels. Exogenous superoxide dismutase (400 U/ml) provided modest protection against UV irradiation and had no effect on cytotoxic drug-induced apoptosis. The results suggest that both hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion may be involved in the induction of apoptosis by UV irradiation. On the other hand, while exposure to cytotoxic drugs induces a large increase in intracellular peroxide levels, catalase is able to protect the cells from apoptosis only when low concentrations of these compounds are used, thus indicating the involvement of other factors in this process, particularly at higher drug concentrations.","['Gorman, A', 'McGowan, A', 'Cotter, T G']","['Gorman A', 'McGowan A', 'Cotter TG']","['Department of Biochemistry, University College, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Peroxides)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)']",IM,"['Anions', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Peroxides/*metabolism/pharmacology/radiation effects', 'Superoxides/*metabolism/pharmacology/radiation effects', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1997/03/03 00:00,1997/03/03 00:01,['1997/03/03 00:00'],"['1997/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(97)00069-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(97)00069-0 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1997 Mar 3;404(1):27-33. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(97)00069-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As assessed by Western blot analysis, following electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions, the antibody specifically reacts with LAP upon forced expression of the protein in simian COS-7 fibroblasts. In addition, the 1B12.1 antibody recognizes partially purified LAP isolated from peripheral blood granulocytes. With this antibody we developed a quantitative flow-cytometry-based method for the determination of LAP. Double fluorescence flow cytometry demonstrated that the LAP protein was present in relatively high amounts in neutrophilic granulocytes, but not in monocytes, natural killer cells, or B and T lymphocytes of normal individuals. The protein was completely absent in granulocytes obtained from chronic myeloid leukaemia and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria patients. Higher than normal levels of LAP protein were evident in neutrophilic granulocytes of patients suffering from polycythaemia vera, essential thrombocythaemia and severe aplastic anaemia.

On the other hand, T-cell-mediated graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) observed after transplantation of unmanipulated BM graft causes substantial morbidity and mortality. The aim of the present study was to determine the antileukaemic potential of enriched IL-2 activated NK cells administered 2 h after BMT. Balb/c (H-2d) mice were given a dose of A20 (H-2d, B-cell leukaemia) cells 2 d prior to lethal total body irradiation (TBI) and transplantation of either syngeneic or allogeneic anti-Thy1.2 (CD90) depleted bone marrow cells. Either syngeneic (Balb/c, H-2d) or allogeneic (C57BL/6, H-2b) enriched and IL-2 (200 U/ml for 24 h) activated NK cells were given 2 h after BMT. Injection of A20 leukaemia into normal Balb/c recipients led to death after a median of 14 d. A lethal dose of TBI followed by either syngeneic or allogeneic Thy1.2-depleted BMT resulted in a modest antileukaemic effect. The adoptive transfer of syngeneic enriched and IL-2 preincubated NK cells given at time of BMT exerted a significantly better GVL effect. However, the infusion of allogeneic enriched NK cells resulted in a stronger GVL effect. These results clearly demonstrate that allogeneic NK cells are superior to syngeneic NK cells in their potential to eradicate residual leukaemia cells after BMT without mediating clinical overt GVHD. This experimental setting may offer a strategy for treatment of haematological malignancies in a phase of minimal residual disease.","['Zeis, M', 'Uharek, L', 'Glass, B', 'Steinmann, J', 'Dreger, P', 'Gassmann, W', 'Schmitz, N']","['Zeis M', 'Uharek L', 'Glass B', 'Steinmann J', 'Dreger P', 'Gassmann W', 'Schmitz N']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*transplantation', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phenotype', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.d01-2101.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Mar;96(4):757-61. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.d01-2101.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to establish whether the normal homologue in B-cell ontogeny of B-CLL also expressed the multidrug resistance (mdr) phenotype. Human tonsillar lymphocytes were sorted to yield two B-cell subsets based on the expression of CD19, CD5 and CD10. The normal homologue was represented by a population of B cells that was CD19 positive, CD10 negative and weakly expressed CD5. Based upon functional analysis and the detection of mdr1 mRNA by semi-quantitative PCR, these cells expressed the mdr phenotype. In contrast, functional multidrug resistance could not be demonstrated in CD19-positive CD10-positive cells with strong expression of CD5, nor could mdr1 mRNA be found in these cells. MRP was variably expressed in both B-cell subsets with no discernable differences in the pattern of expression. We conclude that normal B cells with a phenotype resembling that of B-CLL cells express the multidrug resistance phenotype.","['Wall, D M', 'el-Osta, S', 'Tzelepis, D', 'Bertoncello, I', 'Kantharidis, P', 'Chou, S T', 'Zalcberg, J R', 'Parkin, J D']","['Wall DM', 'el-Osta S', 'Tzelepis D', 'Bertoncello I', 'Kantharidis P', 'Chou ST', 'Zalcberg JR', 'Parkin JD']","['Department of Haematology, Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9EI49ZU76O (multidrug resistance protein 3)']",IM,"['*ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.d01-2090.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Mar;96(4):697-707. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.d01-2090.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is now also increasing evidence that some family members may act as oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes. The characterization of these proteins in human primary haemopoietic cells and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) blasts may thus give an insight to the molecular mechanisms governing proliferation and leukaemogenesis in these cells. Therefore we analysed the expression of E2F-DNA binding activity and the constituent proteins found in the complexes in human primary haemopoietic cells of various lineages. We also studied blasts from 18 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). On electromobility shift assays (EMSA) a single E2F-DNA binding complex was detected in T cells, B cells and monocytes which was shown to contain E2F-4, DP-1 and p130, indicating that all quiescent haemopoietic cells have the same complex. Examination of 18 AML samples by EMSA revealed the presence of E2F binding and no gross abnormalities were detected. An E2F-4/p130 complex was detected in representative samples of all FAB types analysed. Thus abnormalities of E2F function are unlikely to play a primary pathogenic role in AML.","['Williams, C D', 'Linch, D C', 'Sorensen, T S', 'La Thangue, N B', 'Thomas, N S']","['Williams CD', 'Linch DC', 'Sorensen TS', 'La Thangue NB', 'Thomas NS']","['Department of Haematology, University College London Medical School.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (E2F4 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F4 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p107)', '0 (TFDP1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor DP1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', '*Carrier Proteins', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'DNA/metabolism', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'E2F4 Transcription Factor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1', 'Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p107', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor DP1', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.d01-2086.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Mar;96(4):688-96. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.d01-2086.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a consistent chimaeric fusion transcript NUP98-HOXA9 was found in several cases of t(7;11). Four AML cases with the chromosome abnormality in Taiwan are described. They were all adults with ages ranging from 30 to 41 years (median 36 years). Three of them were diagnosed as having AML M2; the remaining one as M4. Marked dyserythropoiesis was demonstrated in two patients. All four patients showed pan-myeloid antigen CD13 on the leukaemic cells, but none coexpressed lymphocyte-associated antigens and neither of the two patients studied for CD34 expression had positive staining. NUP98-HOXA9 fusion transcript was detected in both patients who had molecular analysis and the breakpoints on chromosome 11 and 7 respectively were similar to those previously reported. They all received conventional induction chemotherapy, but only one achieved a complete remission (CR) with short duration. This study and others reported in the literature suggest a racial or geographical predisposition among oriental patients to AML with t(7;11) and that this is associated with a poor prognosis. The molecular detection of NUP98-HOXA9 fusion transcript would be a useful method for the diagnosis of t(7;11) and also for monitoring disease status after treatment.","['Huang, S Y', 'Tang, J L', 'Liang, Y J', 'Wang, C H', 'Chen, Y C', 'Tien, H F']","['Huang SY', 'Tang JL', 'Liang YJ', 'Wang CH', 'Chen YC', 'Tien HF']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', '*Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.d01-2100.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Mar;96(4):682-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.d01-2100.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The usual asparaginase dose as prescribed in the ALL-BFM-86/90 treatment protocol for the therapy of ALL is 10,000 IU/m2 at 3 d intervals and had been developed on the basis of the E. coli asparaginase preparation Crasnitin from the Bayer company. Using the described schedule the E. coli asparaginase preparation from the Medac company shows significantly higher biological activity than the Bayer preparation. These findings prompted an attempt to reduce the dose of the Asparaginase medac under careful pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic monitoring. At the first step of dose reduction in ALL treatment protocol I, 11 children received 5000 IU/m2 of Asparaginase medac. Another 15 children were given 2500 IU/m2 of the enzyme at the second step of dose reduction. Prior to each asparaginase dose, blood samples were taken to determine amino acids and trough enzyme activity. Concurrent with the asparaginase monitoring, the coagulation parameters were measured. 96% of samples from the first step of dose reduction (5000 IU/m2 every third day) showed complete L-asparagine depletion (< 0.1 microM), the median trough enzyme activity was 265 IU/l. At the second step of dose reduction (2500 IU/m2) complete L-asparagine depletion was seen in 97% of samples, and the median trough enzyme activity was 102 IU/l. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) depletion was complete in all samples tested (11/11). We concluded that an Asparaginase medac dose reduced from the usual 10000 IU/m2 down to 5000 IU/ m2 or 2500 IU/m2, applied at 3 d intervals, was sufficient to achieve complete L-asparagine depletion in serum.
