Considering a 10% positive cell cut-off value, a heterogeneous expression of P-glycoprotein was observed in 5/22 (22.7%) de novo acute leukaemias, 7/22 (31.8%) relapse or secondary acute leukaemias, 14/27 (51.8%) acute transformation of myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic syndromes and 5/16 (31.2%) multiple myelomas. This expression was not associated with specific cytogenetic abnormalities, especially alterations of chromosome 7q. Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, has been demonstrated to circumvent the multidrug resistance in cell lines, possibly by interfering with P-glycoprotein function. Using the microculture tetrazolium assay, verapamil was demonstrated to increase the sensitivity of fresh leukaemic or myeloma cells to doxorubicin in 19/43 (43.1%) samples. The doxorubicin IC50 level and the capacity of verapamil to increase the sensitivity of blast cells to doxorubicin in vitro did not correlate with the expression of P-glycoprotein.

This kinase is activated in a rapidly reversible fashion during ligation of CD3/Ti by a process which involves tyrosine phosphorylation of the enzyme itself. We show that the stimulatory anti-CD2 mAb combination, anti-(T11(2) + T11(3), stimulates MAP-2K activity in Jurkat cells with kinetics that are more prolonged than during anti-CD3 treatment. The principal difference is not in the rate of response induction, but in the decline of the response beyond the peak, to which end anti-CD2 stimulation resembles the sustained phytohaemagglutin (PHA) response. Parallel immunoblotting, utilizing anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, also revealed differences in the rate at which tyrosine phosphorylation of pp43 (MAP-2K) disappears after induction. In spite of these differences, CD2 was absolutely dependent on the presence of CD3 for inducing a MAP-2K response in Jurkat cells. These results indicate that, even though CD2 and CD3 are using a common signalling pathway in Jurkat cells, additional differences such as the involvement of a tyrosine phosphatase may have to be considered in response generation. We also demonstrate that the common CD45 isoform, when cross-linked to CD2 by mAb, could inhibit the MAP-2K response during both induction as well as the disappearing phase of the response.","['Nel, A E', 'Ledbetter, J A', 'Williams, K', 'Ho, P', 'Akerley, B', 'Franklin, K', 'Katz, R']","['Nel AE', 'Ledbetter JA', 'Williams K', 'Ho P', 'Akerley B', 'Franklin K', 'Katz R']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1680.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']","['AI15332/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM41576/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1384454,,,,,,,,,,,,

The spectrum of possible chemotherapeutic intervention for viral infectious diseases is very small, which usually makes specific treatment impossible. The most important infective viruses epidemiologically, which lead to persistent complications, are discussed in detail as follows: influenza virus, measles virus, human T-cell leukaemia virus, human immuno-deficiency virus, hepatitis B and C virus. In a discussion conclusions are drawn from the virologist's point of view for a possible long-range prognosis, which depends on the one hand on the infective agent and on the other on individual reactivity. The last chapter talks about insurance medical aspects of the most important infective viruses, which have already been discussed virologically. Some scientific developments are shown which could be future solutions of problems in diagnosis and prognosis. Such new developments could help insurance medical officers to important decision parameters for long-range prognosis, which are still largely missing at present.","['Gurtler, L', 'Jilg, W', 'Kraus, H K']","['Gurtler L', 'Jilg W', 'Kraus HK']","['Max-von-Pettenkofer-Institut, Universitat Munchen.']",,,,,,Mogliche Langzeitprognose bei epidemiologisch bedeutsamen Virusinfektionen.,34,,,,,,,,

Various lines of evidence suggest that Ph-negative cells, albeit in a suppressed state, must still be present. As recently suggested, the expansion of 'putative' normal Ph-negative hemopoietic stem cells might have, in certain circumstances, a proliferative advantage over the Ph clone in CML. This suggests that the treatment of CML with intensive chemotherapy might allow the collection of Ph-negative hemopoietic cells in the early phase of recovery. Eight patients with acute phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (AP-CML) were treated with idarubicin, intermediate dose cytarabine and etoposide. During recovery from bone marrow aplasia, when the white blood cell count reached 0.3-1 x 10(-9), blood cells were collected with 2-5 (median 3) consecutive leukapheresis. In 5/8 patients, these peripheral cells were Ph-negative at the cytogenetic analysis. Moreover, in one case the polymerase chain reaction analysis performed to detect the presence of minimal residual disease in the cells collected by leukapheresis was negative, further confirming that this approach may induce a very high degree of suppression of the Ph-positive clones. After complete recovery, these five patients were subsequently treated with high-dose etoposide, cyclophosphamide and total body radiation (10 Gy, single dose) followed by reinfusion of Ph-negative peripheral blood stem cells. All these patients received cyclosporine A post-autotransplant in an attempt to induce acute graft-versus-host-disease. Three of 5 patients remain in clinical and cytogenetic remission 5-15 months post-transplant. It is concluded that Ph-negative peripheral blood stem cells can be recovered from patients with AP-CML and used successfully to restore Ph-negative hemopoiesis after high dose therapy.","['Carella, A M', 'Gaozza, E', 'Raffo, M R', 'Carlier, P', 'Frassoni, F', 'Valbonesi, M', 'Lercari, G', 'Sessarego, M', 'Defferrari, R', 'Guerrasio, A']","['Carella AM', 'Gaozza E', 'Raffo MR', 'Carlier P', 'Frassoni F', 'Valbonesi M', 'Lercari G', 'Sessarego M', 'Defferrari R', 'Guerrasio A', 'et al.']","['Oncohematologic and ABMT Unit, Ospedale S.

Both conventional karyotyping and X-inactivation analysis demonstrated the persistence of a monoclonal pattern of hematopoiesis in the two patients with refractory anemia (RA) treated either with GM-CSF or with IL-3. The partial restoration of non-clonal hematopoiesis was observed in one patient with RA and an excess of blasts following treatment with a combination of GM-CSF and low dose cytosine arabinoside. In a fourth patient with RA and in the patient with ET, treatment with IL-3 resulted in the complete restoration of a non-clonal pattern of peripheral blood cells. In contrast, the bone marrow cells remained monoclonal by Southern blot analysis in the patient with RA in whom it could be tested. Non-clonal lymphocytes appear to have been released into the peripheral blood in the two latter cases and are responsible for the non-clonal RFLP pattern. These results suggest that cytokine therapy may have diverse effects on hematopoiesis, including the release of residual normal cells into the peripheral blood.","['Ganser, A', 'Janssen, J W', 'Ottmann, O G', 'Seipelt, G', 'Eder, M', 'Becher, R', 'Lindermann, A', 'Herrmann, F', 'Schulz, G', 'Mertelsmann, R']","['Ganser A', 'Janssen JW', 'Ottmann OG', 'Seipelt G', 'Eder M', 'Becher R', 'Lindermann A', 'Herrmann F', 'Schulz G', 'Mertelsmann R', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, University of Frankfurt, Germany.']","['0 (Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.2.3 (Phosphoglycerate Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Distinct subsets of neural, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and immune cells bear specific high-affinity receptors for VIP, which are associated with a guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein capable of activating adenylate cyclase. A cDNA clone (GPRN1) encoding the human VIP receptor was identified in libraries prepared from the Nalm 6 line of leukemic pre-B lymphoblasts and the HT-29 line of colon carcinoma cells. The deduced 362-amino acid polypeptide sequence encoded by GPRN1 shares a seven-transmembrane-segment hydropathicity profile with other G protein-coupled receptors. Northern blot analyses identified a 2.7-kilobase transcript of the VIP receptor in Nalm 6 and HT-29 cells as well as in tissues from rat brain, colon, heart, lung, kidney, spleen, and small intestine. COS-6 cells transfected with GPRN1 bound 125I-labeled VIP specifically with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.5 nM. VIP--and less effectively secretin, peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI), and glucagon competitively displaced bound 125I-VIP from transfected COS-6 cells, with potencies in the order VIP greater than secretin = PHI much greater than glucagon. VIP stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells, inducing a 3-fold increase in the intracellular level of cAMP. When the antisense orientation of the VIP receptor clone was introduced into HT-29 cells, there was a 50% suppression of the specific binding of 125I-VIP and of the VIP-induced increase in cAMP level, relative to untransfected cells. The VIP receptor cloned exhibits less than or equal to 24% homology with other receptors in the same superfamily and thus represents a subset of G protein-coupled receptors for peptide ligands.","['Sreedharan, S P', 'Robichon, A', 'Peterson, K E', 'Goetzl, E J']","['Sreedharan SP', 'Robichon A', 'Peterson KE', 'Goetzl EJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of California Medical Center, San Francisco 94143-0724.']","['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Gastrointestinal Hormone)', '0 (Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)']",,PMC51792,"['GENBANK/M59224', 'GENBANK/M59225', 'GENBANK/M59226', 'GENBANK/M60611', 'GENBANK/M64649', 'GENBANK/M64650', 'GENBANK/M64651', 'GENBANK/M64652', 'GENBANK/M64653', 'GENBANK/M64749']",,,,['Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1993 Oct 1;90(19):9233'],,,,,,,

VZV-DNAs from patients with complicated clinical courses related to vaccination were examined to determine whether they were vaccine-derived or wild-type. A virus was isolated from a one year-old boy with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) who developed typical varicella 28 days after vaccination (case A). Another virus was isolated from a four-year-old boy without clinical symptoms following household contact with varicella patients at the age of two months, and he developed zoster 14 months after vaccination (case B). Also, two strains (OK1 and OK2) were isolated from household contacts (mother and sister) with a vaccine with ALL in Oklahoma who developed varicella 18 days after vaccination (case C). In case C, BgII-REFP did not determine conclusively whether the two strains (OK1 and OK2) were vaccine-derived or wild-type because the patterns obtained were different from both the Oka varicella vaccine strain and American wild-type strains [Gelb et al., Journal of Infectious Diseases, 155:633-640, 1987]. All VZV strains examined in the present study were identified as wild-type by our method using HpaI-K and EcoRI-P fragments as marker fragments. Thus it is becoming evident that REFP using HpaI and EcoRI endonucleases is a convenient and reliable means of distinguishing between the Oka vaccine virus strain and wild-type viruses isolated from individuals developing vesicular rashes shortly and long after varicella vaccination.","['Shiraki, K', 'Horiuchi, K', 'Asano, Y', 'Yamanishi, K', 'Takahashi, M']","['Shiraki K', 'Horiuchi K', 'Asano Y', 'Yamanishi K', 'Takahashi M']","['Department of Virology, Osaka University, Japan.']","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '0 (glycoprotein E, varicella-zoster virus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Northern blot analysis of RNA extracted from these tissues revealed two distinct aminopeptidase N transcripts: a 3.7-kilobase (kb) transcript expressed by normal monocytes, myeloid leukemia cells, and fibroblasts and a 3.4-kb transcript expressed by intestinal epithelium and kidney cells. In intestinal epithelial cells, transcripts originated 47 base pairs upstream from the initiation codon and 22 base pairs downstream from a TATA box. By contrast, the longer transcripts found in myeloid cells and fibroblasts originated from several sites clustered in an upstream exon located 8 kb from the exon containing the initiation codon. Functional promoter activity was demonstrated by fusing sequences approximately 1 kb upstream from each transcription origin to bacterial reporter genes and transfecting the resultant constructs into murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. A novel feature of this system is that regulatory elements of the epithelial cell promoter, including the TATA box and transcription origin, are included within the 5'-untranslated region of the longer myeloid cell transcript. Both aminopeptidase N transcripts encode the same polypeptide, indicating that the physically distinct promoters must have evolved to regulate expression of this cell-surface peptidase by cells of different tissues.","['Shapiro, L H', 'Ashmun, R A', 'Roberts, W M', 'Look, A T']","['Shapiro LH', 'Ashmun RA', 'Roberts WM', 'Look AT']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]","['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']","['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42804/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['GENBANK/M55522', 'GENBANK/M55523', 'GENBANK/M63255', 'GENBANK/M63926', 'GENBANK/M63973', 'GENBANK/M63974', 'GENBANK/M63975', 'GENBANK/M63976', 'GENBANK/M63977', 'GENBANK/M63978']",,,,,,,,,,,

Freshly frozen tumor tissues from (1) human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I)-positive adult T-cell lymphoma (ATL) (7 cases), (2) HTLV-I-negative aggressive T-cell lymphoma (12 cases), and (3) HTLV-I-negative nonaggressive T-cell lymphoma (11 cases) were studied for the expression of several growth-related genes or proliferation antigens including interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), Ki-67, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), topoisomerase, and the multidrug resistance (MDR) gene by immunohistochemistry and Northern blot hybridization. Our results showed that tumor cells associated with HTLV-I and anaplastic morphology had an enhanced expression of Ki-67, TGF-beta, and topoisomerase, as compared to nonaggressive T-cell lymphoma. The expression of IL-2R was limited to ATL and one Ki-1 lymphoma. The MDR gene was frequently expressed in ATL, but only infrequently in other, HTLV-I-negative, malignancies.

Screening of blood donors for HTLV-I, now routine in North America, does not distinguish this retrovirus from HTLV-II. To find out more about the seroepidemiology of and risk factors for HTLV I and II, blood from 480,000 volunteer donors in five geographically separate US urban centres was tested for antibodies to HTLV-I/II and HIV-1. Confirmed HTLV-I/II seropositive donors were then followed up by DNA amplification to distinguish type I from type II and by interviews focusing on possible risk factors. HTLV seroprevalence was 3.3 times greater than that for HIV-1 (0.043% vs 0.013%). DNA amplification on 65 of the 207 HTLV-I/II seropositive donors revealed that 34 (52%) had HTLV-II infection and 28 (43% had HTLV-I; 3 samples were uninformative. Interviews of 49 donors showed that whereas HTLV-I was principally associated with donor origin from endemic regions, the major risk factor for HTLV-II infection was intravenous drug use. The surprisingly high rate of HTLV-II infection in US blood donors raises important public health and donor counselling issues since HTLV-I infection is associated with adult T-cell leukaemia and a neurological disorder while the pathogenicity of HTLV-II is as yet unclear.","['Lee, H H', 'Swanson, P', 'Rosenblatt, J D', 'Chen, I S', 'Sherwood, W C', 'Smith, D E', 'Tegtmeier, G E', 'Fernando, L P', 'Fang, C T', 'Osame, M']","['Lee HH', 'Swanson P', 'Rosenblatt JD', 'Chen IS', 'Sherwood WC', 'Smith DE', 'Tegtmeier GE', 'Fernando LP', 'Fang CT', 'Osame M', 'et al.']","['Abbott Laboratories Diagnostic Division, North Chicago, IL 60064.']","['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight patients were in the first late chronic phase, five were in the second chronic phase, one was in the accelerated phase, and one was in the blastic phase. Autologous bone marrow cells (median, 2.5 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg) were stored at a median of 30 months after diagnosis. Patients were treated with cyclophosphamide (1.5 g/m2 daily for 4 days), carmustine (BCNU) (300 mg/m2), and etoposide (VP-16) (250 mg/m2 daily for 3 days) (CBV), followed by reinfusion of autologous bone marrow. Hematopoietic recovery was rapid, and toxicity was mild to moderate in 14 patients. One patient died of cytomegalovirus pneumonitis. Eight of 15 patients showed Ph suppression to less than 90% Ph-positive metaphases after autologous BMT. Major cytogenetic responses (Ph suppression to less than 35% Ph-positive metaphases) developed in four patients. Cytogenetic responses were observed in 4 of 11 patients infused with 100% Ph-positive marrows, and in all 4 patients infused with Ph-mosaic marrows (mixture of diploid and Ph-positive cells). Better results were observed when autologous BMT was performed in the chronic phase compared with the advanced phases. The major cytogenetic responses have lasted for 3, 4, 12, and 15+ months, whereas minor cytogenetic responses lasted for only a short time (less than 2 months). Three of seven patients (43%) in the chronic phase with previous resistance to alpha-interferon therapy became sensitive to alpha-interferon therapy after autologous BMT. The authors concluded that intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT produced cytogenetic remissions in patients with Ph-positive CML and reinduced disease sensitivity to alpha-interferon therapy in patients previously resistant to it. This is particularly useful when treatment is given during the chronic phase and stem cells are collected at a time of previous cytogenetic remission.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Talpaz, M', 'LeMaistre, C F', 'Spinolo, J', 'Spitzer, G', 'Yau, J', 'Dicke, K', 'Jagannath, S', 'Deisseroth, A B']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Talpaz M', 'LeMaistre CF', 'Spinolo J', 'Spitzer G', 'Yau J', 'Dicke K', 'Jagannath S', 'Deisseroth AB']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']","['0 (Interferon Type I)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review focuses on such efforts involving daunorubicin and cytarabine, the two most effective agents currently available for treatment of the disease. Most current published studies of daunorubicin have focused on detecting the classic form of multidrug resistance. For cytarabine, pharmacologically directed treatment approaches and enhancement of cytarabine leukemic cell kill by increasing the distribution of cells in S-phase and manipulating cellular cytarabine transport are currently under investigation.","['Ross, D D']",['Ross DD'],"['University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore.']","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",['R0-1-CA40188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,['mdr1'],,38,,,,,,,,

To determine if multidrug resistance may contribute to chemoresistance in these disorders, we studied bone marrow specimens for P-glycoprotein expression (P-GP) by immunocytochemical staining with monoclonal antibodies reactive with cytoplasmic (C219) or surface epitopes (MRK16) of P-GP. Forty-five case specimens from 43 patients were studied, including 32 cases of primary MDS, seven cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) following MDS, and six therapy-related haematological disorders. Cytogenetic analysis was available on 36 specimens. Two staining patterns were detected: (1) cytoplasm and plasma membrane, and (2) staining restricted primarily to the nuclear-cytoplasmic junction. P-GP was detected in seven (22%) cases of primary MDS, four (57%) cases of AML evolving from MDS, and five (83%) cases of therapy-related haematological disorders. Expression of P-GP was restricted to blasts and leukaemic monocytes, and was otherwise absent from terminally differentiated blood cells. Analysis of the relation between P-GP expression and reactivity with the human progenitor cell antigen CD34, revealed a highly significant association (P = 0.001). P-GP reactivity was distributed equally among normal and abnormal karyotypes and did not correlate with specific cytogenetic abnormalities. These findings indicate that multidrug resistance in MDS and karyotypically-related haematological disorders is closely linked to a stem cell phenotype and may contribute to chemoresistance in these disorders.","['List, A F', 'Spier, C M', 'Cline, A', 'Doll, D C', 'Garewal, H', 'Morgan, R', 'Sandberg, A A']","['List AF', 'Spier CM', 'Cline A', 'Doll DC', 'Garewal H', 'Morgan R', 'Sandberg AA']","['University of Arizona Health Sciences Center, Tucson.']","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the success of this therapy is critically dependent on the ability to procure large numbers of functionally active T cells. Previous studies in animal models have shown that the limited therapeutic efficacy of a small number of immune T cells can be greatly enhanced by expansion of T cells in vitro to greater numbers before transfer in vivo. Optimal regimens for T cell expansion in vitro have generally employed the use of intermittent stimulation of the TCR with specific Ag followed by exogenous IL-2. The use of IL-2 alone does not provide for requisite episodic up-regulation of IL-2R. Stimulation of the invariant CD3 portion of the TCR/CD3 complex with antibody to CD3 (anti-CD3) represents an alternative method of up-regulating IL-2R and has been used to nonspecifically induce the growth of Ag-specific T cell lines and clones long-term in vitro with maintenance of function and specificity. The current study examined whether resting T cell populations containing small numbers of memory tumor-specific T cells could be rendered more effective in tumor therapy by nonspecific expansion in vitro with anti-CD3 plus IL-2. Spleens from C57BL/6 mice previously immunized to FBL-3, a syngeneic virus-induced leukemia, were nonspecifically stimulated with anti-CD3 plus IL-2. The resultant T cells were expanded in number, were nonlytic to FBL-3 but retained the ability to become lytic upon specific stimulation by FBL-3, and were effective in specific tumor therapy. The Ag-specific anti-tumor immune function declined on a per cell basis after each cycle of anti-CD3-induced T cell expansion. However, the approach resulted in a substantial increase in total T cell number and an overall net increase in the function of the effector T cell population. Thus, stimulation of tumor-immune T cell populations with anti-CD3 plus IL-2 represents a nonspecific method for expanding the number of specific effector T cells for cancer therapy.","['Crossland, K D', 'Lee, V K', 'Chen, W', 'Riddell, S R', 'Greenberg, P D', 'Cheever, M A']","['Crossland KD', 'Lee VK', 'Chen W', 'Riddell SR', 'Greenberg PD', 'Cheever MA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']","['CA09515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunocytochemical staining of these cells confirmed the decreased production of lactoferrin in malignancy. MspI restriction enzyme fragment patterns demonstrated genetic polymorphism which occurred in DNA from both normal and malignant cells. Polymorphism was also noted with XbaI. In this case, there were two fragment patterns that were only found in DNA from malignant cells. The degree of DNA methylation was also evaluated. The methylation pattern of DNA extracted from malignant cells was highly variable and generally less methylated than DNA extracted from normal WBCs. It is possible that the decrease in lactoferrin associated with cancer is multifactorial and includes gene structural changes as well as altered regulation.

It is now clear that a major factor responsible for its development is increased expression of a membrane glycoprotein--P-glycoprotein, which functions as an energy-dependent efflux pump. Recent data, particularly in haematological malignancies such as acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia, myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, indicate that P-glycoprotein may be involved in the development of clinical drug resistance. The potential therefore exists for new therapeutic studies aimed at circumventing resistance which develops through this mechanism, by using modulators, such as verapamil, quinidine and several others, which prevent cellular drug efflux by competitive binding to P-glycoprotein.","['Kaye, S B', 'Kerr, D J']","['Kaye SB', 'Kerr DJ']","['CRC Department of Medical Oncology, University of Glasgow, UK.']","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,['mdr-1'],,27,,,,,,,,

We correlated these results with the patients' remission status based on cytogenetic analysis and BM morphology, and with evidence of mixed hematopoietic chimerism by analysis of RBC antigen and DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns. Thirteen of the 19 patients had detectable bcr-abl RNA at some time following BMT. Twelve of these patients have remained in remission by morphologic and karyotypic criteria from 16.6 to 63.7 months following BMT.

Only two patients have evidence for mixed chimerism of normal hematopoietic elements by either RBC antigen or DNA RFLP patterns. These results suggest that, in some patients transplanted for CML in CP, small numbers of residual leukemic cells may persist or reappear transiently without leading to clinical relapse.

However, the mechanistic aspects of UV-induced apoptosis remain ill-defined. In this study the effects of varying periods of UV-irradiation on the human leukaemia HL-60 cell line and on five other human cell lines were investigated. HL-60 cells were found to rapidly undergo apoptosis en masse after short periods of UV-irradiation, whereas prolonged exposure of these cells to this form of radiation induced a more rapid form of cell death which was suggestive of necrosis, the pathological mode of cell death. Similar effects were observed on the U937 (myelomonocytic), Molt-4 (T-lymphoblastoid), and Molt-3 (T-lymphoblastoid) cell lines, whereas the K562 (pre-erythroid) and Daudi (B-lymphoblastoid) cell lines proved to be relatively resistant to the death-inducing properties of UV-irradiation by comparison. UV-induced apoptosis in cell lines was characterized by morphological changes as well as DNA fragmentation into unit multiples of approximately 200 bp, which was indicative of endogenous endonuclease activation. This DNA fragmentation pattern was not detected in cells immediately after UV-irradiation, and was therefore not the result of direct UV-induced DNA damage. UV-induced apoptosis of the HL-60 cell line was found to require extracellular calcium and to be inhibited in a dose-dependent way by zinc added to the culture medium.","['Martin, S J', 'Cotter, T G']","['Martin SJ', 'Cotter TG']","[""Department of Biology, St Patrick's College, Maynooth, Co.

A second analysis of a further set of radon measurements (October, 1990, to January, 1991), in both living rooms and bedrooms, and repeated mutant frequency determinations also showed a significant relation, which remained significant even after exclusion of the highest frequency and adjustment for subject's age and cloning efficiency.

Use of vincristine, etoposide, or doxorubicin for purging could be rendered ineffective by the presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumor cells. To circumvent this particular problem, we investigated whether 17F9, a monoclonal IgG2b antibody directed against the cell surface product of the MDR gene, P-glycoprotein, is effective in selective removal of MDR cells from BM when used with rabbit complement (C'). Using two different cell lines we have demonstrated that 17F9 + C' selectively lyses MDR-positive cells. Three rounds of antibody + C' resulted in 96.4% +/- 3.6% kill of K562/DOX and 100% +/- 0% of CEM/VLB cells. Mixtures of malignant cells and normal BM resulted in 99.85% removal of K562/DOX and 99.91% removal of CEM/VLB clonogenic cells. This treatment did not affect normal committed precursors compared with C' alone. The addition of the cytotoxic agent etoposide (VP-16) following antibody purging results in a 4.6 log reduction of malignant cells. Furthermore, this antibody was effective when used against patients' leukemic blasts. These results suggest the use of 17F9 + C' is effective and selective for removal of MDR cells from BM before ABMT and the addition of VP-16 enhances the purging efficacy.","['Aihara, M', 'Aihara, Y', 'Schmidt-Wolf, G', 'Schmidt-Wolf, I', 'Sikic, B I', 'Blume, K G', 'Chao, N J']","['Aihara M', 'Aihara Y', 'Schmidt-Wolf G', 'Schmidt-Wolf I', 'Sikic BI', 'Blume KG', 'Chao NJ']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA.']","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",['CA 49605/01-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

MS-073 administered i.p. daily for 5 days with VCR enhanced the chemotherapeutic effect of VCR in VCR-resistant P388-bearing mice. Increases in life span of 19-50% were obtained by the combination of 100 micrograms/kg of VCR with 3-100 mg/kg of MS-073, as compared to the control. The ability of MS-073 to reverse MDR was remarkably higher, especially at low MS-073 doses, than that of verapamil, both in vitro and in vivo.

Cells that contain high affinity EGF-R are at approximately the BFU-E stage, and their long-term renewal can be induced by TGF alpha. Upon addition of insulin and erythropoietin, they can be induced to terminally differentiate into red cells. We previously demonstrated that v-erbA blocks differentiation of chicken erythrocytic progenitors but does not abrogate their growth factor dependence for proliferation.

To test whether autocrine growth stimulation via cMGF is the essential contribution of the tyrosine kinase oncogene v-erbB in avian myeloid leukemogenesis we constructed another retrovirus containing both the non-leukemogenic v-myb and the cMGF cDNA. This virus induced myeloid leukemia at high efficiency. In a third construct we combined v-myb with the human EGF-receptor gene. Myeloid cells transformed by this construct could be stimulated to grow by the addition of cMGF or EGF. Growth stimulation with EGF was blocked by a cMGF antiserum indicating that activation of a normal tyrosine kinase-type receptor induces cMGF expression but does not bypass the cMGF requirement.

The ability of CEM/VLB100 cells to accumulate [3H]vinblastine ([3H]-VLB) is also greatly reduced. Multiple drug-resistant cells whose mode of resistance is not associated with P-170 do not have reduced enzyme content, and their rate of secretion is the same as that of their drug-sensitive parents. Linkage of drug and enzyme elimination is suggested by the observation that verapamil inhibits both the efflux of [3H]VLB and the secretion of lysosomal enzymes in CEM/VLB100 cells; the content of both [3H]VLB and enzyme increases in these cells when chronically exposed to verapamil. Further, both secretion of N-acetylglucosaminidase and efflux of [3H]VLB by CEM/VLB100 cells are enhanced by the addition of NaCl to the suspending, sucrose-containing medium. When cells have taken up [3H]VLB and are then fractionated by means of a Percoll centrifugation gradient, the distribution of drug among the various populations of vesicles is similar to that of N-acetylglucosaminidase. Losses of both enzyme and drug take place from these vesicular populations to varying degrees, when CEM/VLB100 cells are induced to secrete. It is proposed that, in a multiple drug-resistant cell such as CEM/VLB100, the presence of P-170 in the plasma membrane may, in some indirect manner, lead to increased exocytosis of lysosomal enzyme, ultimately resulting in a significant depletion of enzyme. Further, a toxic, cationic drug such as vinblastine, accumulating in lysosomes and acidic vesicles, is also eliminated from the cell by exocytosis. This pathway may supplement the known, major mode of efflux directly involving P-170.","['Warren, L', 'Jardillier, J C', 'Ordentlich, P']","['Warren L', 'Jardillier JC', 'Ordentlich P']","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.']","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (Acetylglucosaminidase)']","['CA 10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-19130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific oligonucleotides for hybridization were synthesized homologous to tandemly repetitive core sequences of regions with a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs). Polymorphisms at such loci result from allelic differences in the number of repeats. Primers flanking the repeat region of each of the corresponding VNTRs were used for amplification. Recipient and donor pretransplant DNA and recipient posttransplant DNA were amplified. The resultant fragments were analyzed after gel electrophoresis either by hybridization in-gel or after Southern transfer. To confirm our findings, we also performed standard assays of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Evaluation of 13 selected cases indicated mixed chimerism (4), complete chimerism (5), recurrence of leukemia (2), and endogenous repopulation of hematopoiesis (2) after marrow transplantation. Sensitivity of the method was determined by mixing various proportions of recipient and donor DNA; the limit of detection of the minor component in a mixture was 0.1%. PCR data correlated with RFLP data in all cases except two in which PCR proved more sensitive than RFLP. PCR amplification of VNTRs combined with oligonucleotide hybridization is a novel technique for documenting posttransplant chimerism and has advantages over RFLP analysis: high sensitivity, use of small amounts of DNA (250 ng), ease of preparation of DNA, elimination of need for restriction enzymes, and the ability to complete studies in 2 days.","['Ugozzoli, L', 'Yam, P', 'Petz, L D', 'Ferrara, G B', 'Champlin, R E', 'Forman, S J', 'Koyal, D', 'Wallace, R B']","['Ugozzoli L', 'Yam P', 'Petz LD', 'Ferrara GB', 'Champlin RE', 'Forman SJ', 'Koyal D', 'Wallace RB']","['Department of Molecular Biochemistry, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.']",['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)'],"['CA23175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The precise mechanism of action of MDL 73811 was not clear because a rapid disappearance of trypanosomes from the bloodstream of treated rats occurred before significant depletion of spermidine. Administration of MDL 73811 to Trypanosoma brucei brucei-infected rats resulted in a 70% decrease in parasitaemia within 1 h and a complete disappearance of parasites by 5 h. The reduction in parasitaemia was accompanied by complete inhibition of AdoMetDC activity by 10 min after injection of MDL 73811; inhibition was sustained for at least 4 h. Polyamine levels in trypanosomes were unaffected during the first 1 h in which the marked decrease in parasitaemia was observed, but parasite AdoMet levels increased 20-fold within this time. In contrast, exposure of cultured mammalian cells to MDL 73811 resulted in only a 1.5-2-fold increase in AdoMet levels over a 6 h time course. Experiments with inhibitors of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) also suggested that the increased AdoMet levels might be an important factor for antitrypanosomal efficacy. Trypanosomes taken from rats treated for 36 h with eflornithine, an inhibitor of ODC, were depleted of putrescine and had markedly decreased spermidine levels. These organisms also had less than 10% of control AdoMetDC activity, and had elevated decarboxy AdoMet (greater than 4000-fold) and AdoMet (up to 50-fold) levels. The methyl ester of alpha-monofluromethyl-3,4-dehydro-ornithine (delta-MFMO-CH3), which cures murine T. b. brucei infections, and the ethyl ester analogue of this compound (delta-MFMO-C2H5), which does not cure this infection, become ODC inhibitors upon hydrolysis and thus were tested for their effects on trypanosomal polyamines, AdoMet and decarboxy AdoMet levels. Although both esters of delta-MFMO depleted trypanosomal polyamines, AdoMet and decarboxy AdoMet levels were elevated in T. b. brucei from infected mice treated with delta-MFMO-CH3 but not in parasites from mice treated with the delta-MFMO-C2H5. These data suggest that inhibition of AdoMetDC, either directly with MDL 73811 or indirectly with inhibitors of ODC, apparently leads to a trypanosome-specific elevation of AdoMet. It is possible that major changes in AdoMet, rather than changes in polyamines, may be responsible for the antitrypanosomal effects of these drugs.","['Byers, T L', 'Bush, T L', 'McCann, P P', 'Bitonti, A J']","['Byers TL', 'Bush TL', 'McCann PP', 'Bitonti AJ']","['Merrell Dow Research Institute, Cincinnati, OH 45215.']","['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Trypanocidal Agents)', '7GI49JB39O (MDL 73811)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)']",,PMC1150171,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a subsequent trial with an MCNU/VP-16/Ara-C/CY (MCVAC) regimen in which the dose of MCNU was reduced, the risk of IP diminished. This study is still in progress, but the clinical response has so far been encouraging.

Endogenous Akv viruses were found only in northern Chinese mice, Korean mice, and Japanese (Mus musculus molossinus) mice. The Fv-4r gene, which is a truncated endogenous MuLV with ecotropic interference properties, was carried by Southeast Asian (M. m. castaneus) mice, Korean mice, and M. m. molossinus. Sequences related to Fv-4r MuLV env were found only in M. m. castaneus. These findings suggest that endogenous Akv viruses were acquired by northern Chinese mice and that the Fv-4r gene or its related endogenous MuLVs were acquired independently by M. m. castaneus. The Fv-4r gene appears to have been generated hundreds of thousands of years ago, before the amplification of the Fv-4r-related endogenous MuLVs in M. m. castaneus. The coexistence of Akv viruses and the Fv-4r gene in M. m. molossinus may be explained by the hybrid origin of M. m. molossinus in crosses between northern Chinese mice and M. m. castaneus, as described in other articles. The absence of the Fv-4r-related endogenous MuLVs in M. m. molossinus may indicate that the ancestral mice of this subspecies either were an ancient type of M. m. castaneus that had acquired the Fv-4r gene but had not yet acquired the Fv-4r-related endogenous MuLVs or were a rare fraction of a mixed population of M. m. castaneus and northern Chinese mice.","['Inaguma, Y', 'Miyashita, N', 'Moriwaki, K', 'Huai, W C', 'Jin, M L', 'He, X Q', 'Ikeda, H']","['Inaguma Y', 'Miyashita N', 'Moriwaki K', 'Huai WC', 'Jin ML', 'He XQ', 'Ikeda H']","['Laboratory of Experimental Pathology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']","['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,PMC239987,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the receptors which allow infection of human and murine cells by various retroviruses, only three have been identified at the molecular level. These receptors include CD4 for human immunodeficiency virus, Rec-1 for murine ecotropic virus, and GLVR1 for gibbon ape leukemia virus. These three proteins show no homology to one another at the DNA or protein level. Therefore, work to date has not shown any general relationship or structural theme shared by retroviral receptors. Genes for two of these receptors (CD4 and Rec-1) and several others which have not yet been cloned have been localized to specific chromosomes. In order to assess the relationship between GLVR1 and other retroviral receptors, we mapped the chromosome location of GLVR1 in human and mouse. GLVR1 was found to map to human chromosome 2q11-q14 by in situ hybridization and somatic-cell hybrid analysis. This location is distinct from those known for receptors for retroviruses infecting human cells. Glvr-1 was then mapped in the mouse by interspecies backcrosses and found to map to chromosome 2 in a region of linkage conservation with human chromosome 2. This mouse chromosome carries Rec-2, the likely receptor for M813, a retrovirus derived from a feral Asian mouse. These data raise the interesting possibility that Rec-2 and Glvr-1 are structurally related.","['Kaelbling, M', 'Eddy, R', 'Shows, T B', 'Copeland, N G', 'Gilbert, D J', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Klinger, H P', ""O'Hara, B""]","['Kaelbling M', 'Eddy R', 'Shows TB', 'Copeland NG', 'Gilbert DJ', 'Jenkins NA', 'Klinger HP', ""O'Hara B""]","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461.']","['0 (Receptors, Virus)']","['CA16720/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43951/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC239979,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two E2A-pbx1 transcripts have been cloned. They encode the putative fusion proteins, p85(E2A-Pbx1) and p77(E2A-Pbx1), which differ in Pbx1 sequences alone, containing unique carboxyl termini whose sequences diverge after the Pbx1 homeo box. In this study, an antiserum to Pbx1 was used to investigate the identity and abundance of E2A-Pbx1 fusion proteins in both the pre-B ALL cell line, 697, and in cryopreserved leukemic bone marrow cells, obtained from six children with t(1;19)-positive pre-B ALL. Five species of E2A-Pbx1 proteins were identified in all cells containing t(1;19), two of which were indistinguishable from in vitro-translated p85(E2A-Pbx1) and p77(E2A-Pbx1). To assess the biological properties of p85(E2A-Pbx1) and p77(E2A-Pbx1) in fibroblasts, the cDNAs encoding these proteins were cloned into retroviral vectors, and each was introduced into NIH-3T3 cells. Both p85(E2A-Pbx1) and p77(E2A-Pbx1) are localized in the nucleus, and expression of either resulted in malignant conversion of NIH-3T3 cells as assayed by tumor formation in nude mice. When scored by focus formation, density-independent growth, and growth in agar assays, p77(E2A-Pbx1) was a much more potent transforming protein than was p85(E2A-Pbx1). Because subtle mutations in p85(E2A-Pbx1) converted its transforming activity into that of p77(E2A-Pbx1), we suggest that a sequence within the unique carboxyl terminus of p85(E2A-Pbx1) serves to negatively regulate its biochemical activity.","['Kamps, M P', 'Look, A T', 'Baltimore, D']","['Kamps MP', 'Look AT', 'Baltimore D']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142.']","['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)']","['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42804/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM39458/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proliferative response to CD3 ligation was modulated by the presence of antibodies to the CD2, CD4, or CD8 accessory T-cell receptors. The effect of these accessory receptors on signal transduction mediated by CD3/Ti was next investigated by monitoring cytoplasmic calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) and by measuring tyrosine phosphorylation after stimulation. Crosslinking CD3, CD2, CD4, or CD8 alone did not induce cytoplasmic calcium mobilization in T-ALLs, but crosslinking the accessory receptors with CD3/Ti induced calcium responses in three of the T-ALLs and enhanced calcium responses in three of the T-ALL cell lines, including HPB-ALL, MOLT-4, and CEM.

MELC variants, derived from this parental cell line, selected for resistance to vincristine (VC), can be induced to differentiate with little or no latent period. This study shows that accelerated HMBA-induced commitment is characteristic of MELC with a low level (2- to 5-fold) of VC resistance in four independently derived cell lines. Both resistance to VC and accelerated differentiation are stable phenotypes for at least 50 passages (approximately 5 months) in the absence of VC. Low-level VC-resistant MELC do not display increased levels of P-glycoprotein or mdr1, mdr2, and mdr3 mRNAs, nor do they exhibit cross-resistance to colchicine or doxorubicin. These cells do show (i) increased level of protein kinase C activity, (ii) reduced accumulation of [3H]VC, and (iii) restoration of VC sensitivity in the presence of verapamil. MELC selected for higher levels of VC resistance (approximately 500-fold) do express high levels of P-glycoprotein and the mdr3 gene. During HMBA-induced differentiation, DS19/Sc9 decrease [3H]VC accumulation, but P-glycoprotein content does not change. A VC-transport-associated protein, also critical for the process of induced differentiation, may be constitutively present in VC-resistant MELC, accounting for their enhanced sensitivity to inducer. This protein accumulates by exposure of VC-sensitive cells to HMBA, contributing to their differentiation and decreased level of VC accumulation.","['Richon, V M', 'Weich, N', 'Leng, L', 'Kiyokawa, H', 'Ngo, L', 'Rifkind, R A', 'Marks, P A']","['Richon VM', 'Weich N', 'Leng L', 'Kiyokawa H', 'Ngo L', 'Rifkind RA', 'Marks PA']","['DeWitt Wallace Research Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",['CA-31768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC51085,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test this hypothesis, 22 Ghanaian patients with HMS and/or lymphocytosis were categorised by degree of response to proguanil according to standard clinical criteria, and DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells and screened for rearrangements of the Jh region of the immunoglobulin gene with a DNA probe. Clonal rearrangements of the Jh region were found in all 3 patients with no response, in none of 13 patients with sustained response, and in 2 of 6 patients with moderate response or relapse on proguanil therapy.

In this study of 31 children with acute leukemia, the only dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression. At the highest dose level, three of seven patients developed fatal systemic bacterial or fungal infections. At dose levels above 6.2 mg/m2/d, significant oncolytic responses occurred in all patients. In addition, there was a significant correlation between both the responsiveness by cell type and dose of 2-CDA, such that more oncolytic responses were noted in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients than acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients (P = .02). Although this was a phase I trial in heavily pretreated patients with refractory disease, two AML patients treated at 5.2 and 10.7 mg/m2/d, respectively, had complete hematologic responses, and one patient treated at 10.7 mg/m2/d had a partial response. In addition, there was a dose-response relationship in all patients with improved cytoreduction of peripheral blast cells at higher doses of 2-CDA. In vitro evaluation of 2-CDA uptake and anabolism by leukemic blast cells from 22 patients demonstrated that 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (Cld-AMP) and 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-striphosphate (CldATP) reached concentrations close to steady-state levels within 1 hour. Intracellular nucleotide disappearance rates were high with half-lives of 1.29 and 2.47 hours for CldAMP and CldATP, respectively. This suggests that continuous infusion is necessary to maintain the desired plasma concentration. The results of this study confirm the antileukemic activity of 2-CDA and the lack of prohibitive nonhematologic toxicity.

Anti-tetanus F(ab')2 fragments were iodinated and then conjugated to transferrin with a newly developed acid-labile cleavable cross-linking reagent, bismaleimidoethoxy propane, following thiolation of both proteins. Noncleavable conjugates were also prepared. At saturating conjugate concentrations, the uptake rate for both conjugates averaged over the first 2 h is about 6.5 fmol/million cells/min. Incubation of loaded cells in fresh medium for 30 min and analysis of cell pellets and supernatants reveal that 1) of the previously cell-associated label, only intact conjugate (about 50% of the label) is returned to the medium; 2) most of the remaining cell-associated material for the cleavable conjugate is chromatographically coincident with free Fab with some contribution from free F(ab')2 fragments. In contrast, the cell pellets loaded with noncleavable conjugates contained intact transferrin-F(ab'), conjugates. These results are consistent with transferrin receptor-mediated uptake of acid-labile conjugate followed by hydrolysis in acidified endosomes and resulting in concentration of free F(ab')2 and Fab within a prelysosomal intracellular compartment. A protein shuttle such as transferrin may therefore be used with ketal based acid-labile cross-linkers to load foreign molecules into an intracellular compartment. In addition, these data provide independent confirmation of the low pH compartment within the transferrin cycle. This new methodology is applicable to other cases of receptor/ligand trafficking to report low pH compartments independent of morphological analysis. Since transferrin receptors are overexpressed in tumors, antineoplastic agents could be targeted to tumors as transferrin acid-labile conjugates. This import system might be particularly useful in combatting the tumor cell export of antitumor agents occurring in multidrug resistance.","['Wellhoner, H H', 'Neville, D M Jr', 'Srinivasachar, K', 'Erdmann, G']","['Wellhoner HH', 'Neville DM Jr', 'Srinivasachar K', 'Erdmann G']","['Section on Biophysical Chemistry, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']","['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Tetanus Toxoid)', '0 (Transferrin)', '118377-62-1 (bis(maleimidoethoxy)propane)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A multidrug-resistant (MDR), P-glycoprotein-positive cell line, RL-1210/.1 [11], was exposed to potential MDR modulators in the absence or presence of MMC. The following compounds did not reverse MMC-induced MDR: quinine, quinidine, lidocaine, procaine, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, prednisolone, estradiol, and testosterone. Three agents were capable of reversing MMC resistance: progesterone, cyclosporin A, and verapamil. The R- and S-isomers of verapamil were equipotent, although they showed a 10-fold difference in cardiovascular potency (S greater than R). Some agents produced cytotoxic effects in MDR cells in the absence of MMC, including progesterone, quinine, and quinidine. The results suggest that R-verapamil and progesterone may have clinical utility in reversing MMC resistance in human tumors. Progesterone may be uniquely efficacious due to (a) its low toxicity in normal cells, (b) its selective cytotoxicity in MDR cells (in the absence of MMC), and (c) its ability to reverse MMC resistance in vitro. The findings also suggest that the P-glycoprotein induced by MMC differs from that induced by doxorubicin, which is highly sensitive to modulation by lysosomotropic amines such as quinine and quinidine.","['Dorr, R T', 'Liddil, J D']","['Dorr RT', 'Liddil JD']","['University of Arizona, College of Medicine, Pharmacology Department, Tucson.']","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'A7V27PHC7A (Quinine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",['CA-17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Anti-HIV-1-negative intravenous drug users receiving methadone maintenance therapy (n = 24) were studied in a Veterans Administration drug abuse treatment center. These subjects were compared to 38 age- and sex-matched control subjects who did not abuse drugs. HIV-1 and HTLV serostatus was determined by repetitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by immunoblot. Lymphocyte subsets were determined by two-color flow cytometry. Lymphocyte function was measured by proliferative response to plant mitogens and by natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity to a tumor cell target. RESULTS: Significant differences were seen in lymphocyte phenotype in the methadone-treated group, with elevations in the T-cell helper subset CD4+CD26+; in CD8 and CD8+I2+ cells, suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and activated suppressor/cytotoxic T cells; and in CD2+CD26+ cells and activated total T lymphocytes. Lymphocyte function was suppressed in the methadone group, with poor responses to pokeweed mitogen and phytohemagglutinin in culture. Moreover, NK-cell cytotoxicity was significantly reduced in the methadone group. None of these immunologic differences were attributable to HTLV serostatus. CONCLUSION: The immune abnormalities seen suggest that a clinically significant degree of immune impairment exists in methadone-treated intravenous drug users. However, these abnormalities could not be explained by the presence of other retroviruses in this HIV-1-negative study group, as there was no significant difference in immune function when HTLV-seropositive patients were compared to HTLV-seronegative subjects treated with methadone.","['Klimas, N G', 'Blaney, N T', 'Morgan, R O', 'Chitwood, D', 'Milles, K', 'Lee, H', 'Fletcher, M A']","['Klimas NG', 'Blaney NT', 'Morgan RO', 'Chitwood D', 'Milles K', 'Lee H', 'Fletcher MA']","['Center for the Biopsychosocial Study of AIDS, Miami, Florida.']","['0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (Illicit Drugs)', 'UC6VBE7V1Z (Methadone)']",['P50-MH/DA42455/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

After timed incubation in media with fetal bovine serum, 29% of erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E), 24% of erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E), and 52% of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) bone marrow progenitors expressed ICAM-1. This finding, which is consistent with the detection of ICAM-1 on acute non-lymphoblastic leukemic blasts, is at variance with recent reports. ICAM-1 was also detected on bone marrow blasts, proerythroblasts, promyelocytes, and cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage, but was not detected on erythroblasts, normoblasts, neutrophilic myelocytes, metamyelocytes, bands, or on most lymphocytes. These results indicate that maturation of cells of the erythroid and myeloid lineage is associated with loss of ICAM-1. The distribution of ICAM-1 on bone marrow progenitors, early precursor cells, and accessory cells in conjunction with the function of this molecule in cell-cell interactions suggests that ICAM-1 may play a role in the cell-cell and cell-stromal interactions that regulate hematopoiesis.","['Arkin, S', 'Naprstek, B', 'Guarini, L', 'Ferrone, S', 'Lipton, J M']","['Arkin S', 'Naprstek B', 'Guarini L', 'Ferrone S', 'Lipton JM']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']","['CA37959/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AM35551/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The t(1;19) juxtaposes the E2A gene from chromosome 19 with the PBX1 gene on chromosome 1, leading to the production of fusion transcripts and resultant chimeric proteins that contain the transcriptional-activating motif of E2A and the DNA-binding homeodomain of PBX1. To investigate the molecular nature of E2A/PBX1 fusion in patients with t(1;19) ALL we used an RNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure to amplify a portion of the chimeric transcript. We detected E2A/PBX1 fusion transcripts in cells from 97% (37 of 38) of cases in which the t(1;19) had been observed cytogenetically.

Clones comprising the entire HCII gene were isolated from a human leukocyte genomic library in EMBL-3 lambda phage. The sequence of the gene was determined on both strands of DNA (15,849 bp) and included 1749 bp of 5'-flanking sequence, five exons, four introns, and 476 bp of DNA 3' to the polyadenylation site. Ten complete and one partial Alu repeats were identified in the introns and 5'-flanking region. The HCII gene was regionally mapped on chromosome 22 using rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, carrying only parts of human chromosome 22, and the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562. With the cDNA probe HCII7.2, containing the entire coding region of the gene, the HCII gene was shown to be amplified 10-20-fold in K562 cells by Southern analysis and in situ hybridization. From these data, we concluded that the HCII gene is localized on the chromosomal band 22q11 proximal to the breakpoint cluster region (BCR). Analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis indicated that the amplified HCII gene in K562 cells maps at least 2 Mbp proximal to BCR-1. Furthermore, the HCII7.2 cDNA probe detected two frequent restriction fragment length polymorphisms with the restriction enzymes BamHI and HindIII.","['Herzog, R', 'Lutz, S', 'Blin, N', 'Marasa, J C', 'Blinder, M A', 'Tollefsen, D M']","['Herzog R', 'Lutz S', 'Blin N', 'Marasa JC', 'Blinder MA', 'Tollefsen DM']","['Institut fur Humangenetik, Universitat des Saarlandes, Homburg/Saar, BRD.']","['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '81604-65-1 (Heparin Cofactor II)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",['HL-14147/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['GENBANK/J05309', 'GENBANK/M58600', 'GENBANK/M82849', 'GENBANK/M82850', 'GENBANK/M82851', 'GENBANK/M82852', 'GENBANK/M82853', 'GENBANK/M82854', 'GENBANK/M82855', 'GENBANK/S62774', 'GENBANK/S71031']",,,,,,,,,,,

In contract, IL-2 treatment alone did not significantly inhibit the development of FLC metastases. A synergistic antitumor effect was observed after combined IL-1/IL-2 therapy of these mice. The antitumor action of IL-1/IL-2 treatment was abolished or markedly reduced in mice treated with antibodies to CD4 or CD8 antigens, whereas antibodies to asialo-GM1 were ineffective. A clear-cut increase in the percentage of CD4+ cells was observed in the spleens of cytokine-treated mice on days 17 and 23. On day 23 of cytokine therapy, CD8+ cells were increased in both spleens and lymph nodes. On day 17, infiltrates of host-reactive cells (i.e., lymphocytes, granulocytes, and monocytes) were observed in both spleen and liver from FLC-injected mice treated with IL-1/IL-2, in association with tumor cells. On days 17 and 23, spleen cells and cells recovered from mesenteric lymph nodes of IL-1/IL-2-treated mice exerted a potent antitumor effect as determined by Winn assay experiments. This antitumor activity was abolished by preincubation of spleen cells with anti-CD8 antibody, but not by treatment with antibodies to asialo-GM1; antibodies to CD4 exerted only a slight effect. Combined IL-1/IL-2 therapy was more effective on established (i.e., 6-7-d) FLC tumors than on early (i.e., 1-d) tumor-transplanted mice. IL-1/IL-2 treatments were also highly effective in increasing survival time of mice from which the subcutaneous primary tumors were excised 7 d after FLC injection. These data indicate that in mice injected with FLC, the antitumor effects of IL-1/IL-2 are mediated by CD4+ and CD8+ cells (but not NK cells), and suggest that this combined cytokine treatment may be effective against established metastatic tumors.","['Ciolli, V', 'Gabriele, L', 'Sestili, P', 'Varano, F', 'Proietti, E', 'Gresser, I', 'Testa, U', 'Montesoro, E', 'Bulgarini, D', 'Mariani, G']","['Ciolli V', 'Gabriele L', 'Sestili P', 'Varano F', 'Proietti E', 'Gresser I', 'Testa U', 'Montesoro E', 'Bulgarini D', 'Mariani G', 'et al.']","['Department of Virology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,PMC2118774,,,,,,,,,,,,

In drug-sensitive (S) and 5-fold doxorubicin (DOX)-resistant (R0) L1210 mouse leukemia cells, no obvious differences in mdr mRNA or P-glycoprotein expression or alterations in cellular uptake, retention, or cytotoxicity of vincristine (VCR) were observed. However, in the 10-fold (R1) and 40-fold (R2) DOX-resistant sublines, expression of P-glycoprotein was correlated with the level of resistance (R2 greater than R1). An RNase protection assay revealed that elevated levels of mdr1 and mdr2 mRNA were detected in R1 and R2 cells, with an additional increase in mdr3 mRNA in the R2 subline. Further, in the R1 and R2 sublines, no VCR dose-dependent cytotoxicity was apparent, and cell kill of greater than 40% was not achievable following a 3-hr drug exposure. Cellular uptake and retention of VCR were 2- to 4-fold lower in the R1 and R2 sublines, compared with similarly treated S or R0 cells. Potentiation of VCR cytotoxicity by a noncytotoxic concentration of 5 microM trifluoperazine (TFP) was greater than 2-fold in S and R0 cells and less than 1.3-fold in the R1 and R2 sublines. Modulation of VCR uptake by 5 microM TFP in the S and R0 cells was 2-fold and it was 4- to 7-fold in the R1 and R2 sublines. The presence of 5 microM TFP, by competing for efflux, enhanced VCR retention 1.5-fold in S and R0 cells and 2- to 4-fold in the R1 and R2 sublines. In contrast to these results with VCR, dose-dependent cytotoxicity of DOX was apparent in all the resistant sublines, and modulation of DOX cytotoxicity by 5 microM TFP was dependent on the level of resistance.

We constructed expression plasmids containing these cDNAs in full length with pUC plasmids and produced lacZ'-IMP dehydrogenase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. Both synthesized proteins exhibited IMP dehydrogenase activity and were partially separated from endogenous E. coli IMP dehydrogenase. By injecting the fusion proteins into mice we generated a polyclonal antibody specific to type I IMP dehydrogenase and an antibody which reacted with both types. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the total amounts of types I and II enzymes increased in human leukemic cell lines K562 and HL-60 in agreement with the increase in IMP dehydrogenase activity to 7.8- and 9.4-fold, respectively, above that of normal lymphocytes. The extent of expression of type I IMP dehydrogenase was similar in these cells, however, indicating that the increase in IMP dehydrogenase amount in leukemic cells was due to specific up-regulation of type II enzyme. Northern blot analysis also showed specific and predominant expression of type II in the leukemic cells.

To determine whether such RA resistance is related to altered RA receptor structure or function, we performed a detailed analysis of nuclear RA receptors in RA-resistant K-562 cells. These cells exhibit RA receptors of the same approximate molecular weight and similar kd as those exhibited by the RA-sensitive HL-60 leukemia cell line, but the number of RA receptors in the RA-resistant K-562 cells (80 per cell) is significantly lower than that exhibited by RA-sensitive HL-60 cells (550 per cell). Retroviral-mediated transduction of RAR-alpha cDNA into K-562 significantly increased the number of RA receptors to 2,000 per cell. These RAR-alpha-transduced K-562 cells, when incubated with RA, exhibit diminished cell proliferation associated with decreased c-myc expression and an accumulation of cells in G0/G1. In addition, these RA-treated cells exhibit downregulation of the CD15 surface antigen and a slight increase in hemoglobin production but manifest no other evidence of significant erythroid, megakaryocytic, or myeloid differentiation. These results indicate that an elevated number of nuclear RA receptors can be involved in altering proliferation but not necessarily the differentiation of certain RA-treated myeloid leukemia cells.","['Robertson, K A', 'Mueller, L', 'Collins, S J']","['Robertson KA', 'Mueller L', 'Collins SJ']","['Molecular Medicine Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pleomorphic lymphoreticular cells resembling Reed-Sternberg cells have been observed in Richter's syndrome. Although most observers have favored the view that these cells are a component of a pleomorphic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, some cases of histologically typical Hodgkin's disease have been described. We have studied two cases that appear to represent composite CLL and Hodgkin's disease, providing evidence for an interrelationship of these two disorders. Classic Reed-Sternberg cells and variants (RS-H) were seen in a background that was otherwise typical of CLL. Both patients initially presented with characteristic findings of CLL in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. The first patient was found to have RS-H cells within lymph nodes at initial presentation, and ultimately progressed to develop a disseminated lymphoma characteristic of Hodgkin's disease. In the second patient, RS-H cells were not discovered until 5 years later. Immunophenotypic studies confirmed these morphologic impressions. The predominant lymphocyte population had a phenotype consistent with B-cell CLL. By contrast, the RS-H cells were strongly positive for CD15 (Leu M1) with staining of the Golgi region and cell membrane. Additionally, the RS-H cells were surrounded by rosettes of lymphocytes that marked as T cells. In both of the patients, a small percentage of RS-H cells expressed positivity for the B-cell marker L-26, which may indicate an origin from the underlying CLL. These findings support a B-cell origin for the malignant cell in some cases of Hodgkin's disease and suggest that Hodgkin's disease in some patients may be related to or derived from a coexisting lymphoid malignancy.","['Williams, J', 'Schned, A', 'Cotelingam, J D', 'Jaffe, E S']","['Williams J', 'Schned A', 'Cotelingam JD', 'Jaffe ES']","['Department of Pathology, National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland.']","['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the same year Candida krusei emerged as the chief candida pathogen among patients with bone marrow transplants. METHODS: To determine whether there was a correlation between the introduction of fluconazole and the increased incidence of C. krusei, we conducted a retrospective study based on the medical, mycologic, and autopsy records of all adult inpatients who had undergone bone marrow transplantation (n = 296) or who had leukemia (n = 167) at the study center during 1989 and 1990. RESULTS: The 84 patients who received antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole had a sevenfold greater frequency of C. krusei infection than the 335 patients who did not receive fluconazole (8.3 percent vs. 1.2 percent, P = 0.002), despite having a lower frequency of disseminated C. albicans and C. tropicalis infections (0 vs. 6.0 percent, P = 0.02). Ten of the 11 C. krusei infections were controlled by a combination of amphotericin B and flucytosine. Colonization by C. krusei was found in 40.5 percent of the patients who received fluconazole but in only 16.7 percent of those who did not receive it (P less than 0.0001). Colonization was independently associated with the prophylactic use of both fluconazole (odds ratio, 3.50; P less than 0.001) and norfloxacin (odds ratio, 2.53; P = 0.04). C. krusei was not susceptible to fluconazole in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: In patients at high risk for disseminated candida infections, suppression of bacterial flora and the more common candida pathogens may permit some less pathogenic, but natively resistant candida species, such as C. krusei, to emerge as systemic pathogens.","['Wingard, J R', 'Merz, W G', 'Rinaldi, M G', 'Johnson, T R', 'Karp, J E', 'Saral, R']","['Wingard JR', 'Merz WG', 'Rinaldi MG', 'Johnson TR', 'Karp JE', 'Saral R']","['Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322.']","['7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']","['CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These were: squamous cell carcinoma, leukaemia cells in muscle and outgrowths of prostate carcinoma cells grown in three dimensional collagen gels. The presence of the bound biotinylated affinity probe was demonstrated by its ability to bind Texas-red labelled streptavidin with the results that the tumour cells exhibited red fluorescence. This binding was shown to be competitive with 9-amino acridine, a compound known to bind to the active centre of the target protease. This technique depends upon the affinity of the active centre of an enzyme for a competitive inhibitor and therefore should be applicable to other enzyme systems employing suitable ligands for their active centres.","['Steven, F S', 'Griffin, M M', 'Williams, L A', 'Clarke, N W', 'Maier, H']","['Steven FS', 'Griffin MM', 'Williams LA', 'Clarke NW', 'Maier H']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, UK.']","['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '70J407ZL5Q (Agmatine)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The estimated regression coefficients for the effect of the first dose compared to that of the second dose support the premise that cisplatin is not schedule dependent. Unlike cisplatin, the second dose of etoposide was shown to be more effective than the first dose in the human small cell carcinoma line. This agrees with known clinical results where multiple etoposide dosing has been shown to be more effective and confirms schedule dependency.

Over the past eight years a wide variety of oncogenes and proto-oncogenes from viral and cellular sources have been inserted into the germline of mice with subsequent development of neoplasia. Many of the published reports describe similarities between morphologic features of the transgenic mice tumors and those occurring naturally in humans. We discuss the morphologic features of selected transgenic models carrying viral genes and review their applicability to investigations directed toward understanding cancer in general and specifically gastric cancer, neurofibromatosis and leukemia. Examples of the impact of nutrition, interaction with growth factors and initiation with chemical carcinogens are presented. In one of the models functional similarities to the mechanism of oncogenesis in human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) lymphoma may exist with activation of cytokine production and subsequent autocrine stimulation. The transgenic model of proximal gastric cancer demonstrates features similar to those seen in carcinogen-induced neoplasia. These studies underscore the vast potential of transgenic models for inquiry into the genetic and epigenetic basis of human carcinogenesis. However, many features of transgenic cancer models differ from cancer in humans and the specific criteria for judging the value of transgenic models remain unclarified. For example, although the tumors arising in the HTLV-1 Tax transgenic mice show numerous similarities to human neurofibromatosis including development of lesions of the iris, the similarities do not necessarily extend to the molecular involvement of neurofibromatosis-1 (NF-1), a gene with structural and functional homology to GTPase activating proteins. Transgenic experiments of the future will ask questions beyond whether a particular gene is capable of initiating the neoplastic process. The ability to construct systems in vivo with a defined starting point that facilitate further controlled manipulation of events resulting in cancer provide great opportunities to dissect the various molecular pathways involved in such a process. Therefore, gene knockout experiments and disruption of gene function will further enhance our ability to understand the multi-factorial process of tumor development.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Hinrichs, S H', 'Fontes, J D', 'Bills, N D', 'Schneider, P D']","['Hinrichs SH', 'Fontes JD', 'Bills ND', 'Schneider PD']","['Department of Pathology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198.']","['0 (Adenovirus E1A Proteins)', '0 (Adenovirus E1B Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,46,,,,,,,,

The experimental model included cultures of T and B lymphocytes obtained from 20 healthy blood donors. The cultures were exposed to various concentrations of thioproline for determining the incorporation of 3H-thymidine into the DNA of these cells, their viability and intracellular concentrations of cAMP and cGMP. The lymphocytes from these healthy donors served also as a control for B-cells isolated from 24 patients with lymphoproliferative syndromes. It was found that at low concentrations thioproline added to the culture of T-cells from healthy donors caused a slight increase of 3H-thymidine incorporation, but at high concentrations a strong cytotoxic effect on T-cells was noted.

From Oct 1988 to Nov 1989, 121 episodes of fever (F+) and granulocytopenia (G+) in LR Group and 119 in HR Group were studied: the HR had 51.3% documented infections and the LR 58.7%. In the HR Group the following organisms were isolated from the blood cultures: Gram + 52%, Gram - 20% and fungal 28%. In the LR Group 78% of the organisms were Gram+. Positive blood cultures was 21% for the HR Group and 8.3% for the LR Group. There were 23.5% superinfections in the HR Group vs 5.7% in the LR. The mean time and the median time of granulocytopenia was 11.5 and 8 days (HR) and 6.9 and 6.0 days (LR), respectively. There were 14.5% (LR) and 45.4% (HR) modifications to the initial empirical antibiotic regimen (Amphotericin B, Vancomycin and Amikacin). The overall success rate was 97.6% (LR) and 94.2% (HR) and for documented infection the success rate was 95.7% (LR) and 91.8% (HR). We conclude that: a) The allocation of patients to two risk groups aiming to use distinguished therapy, allowed us to delineate two different populations, predominantly based on time of granulocytopenia, disappearance of fever, rate of superinfection, causative organisms and need of additional drugs to the initial scheme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Petrilli, A S', 'Melaragno, R', 'Bianchi, A', 'Kusano, E', 'Barros, K V', 'Silva, A A']","['Petrilli AS', 'Melaragno R', 'Bianchi A', 'Kusano E', 'Barros KV', 'Silva AA']",['Dep. de Oncol.

In extensive studies of the feline leukemia (FeLV) virus, which can induce profound immunodeficiency disease, are generative anemia and lymphoid, myeloid and erythroid neoplasia, the immunosuppressive effects of this retrovirus could be attributed to the actions of the retroviral envelope protein p15E. We found that a highly conserved, synthetic 17 amino acid peptide synthesized by Cianciolo and co-workers that is homologous to the hydrophilic portion of the otherwise hydrophobic transmembrane envelope protein can suppress polyclonal activation of B-cells, impair production of gamma- and alpha-interferon, inhibit production of interleukin-2, inhibit expression of IL-2 receptors, and suppress responses of cytotoxic lymphocytes. In analyses with inactivated preparations of the human immunodeficiency virus, with Pahwa et al. we demonstrated that purified non-infectious retrovirus and also retroviral proteins, in particular gp120, appeared to produce some of the immunosuppressive properties of HIV, particularly suppression of B-cell activation in response to known B-cell stimulants irrespective of T-cell influence, suppression of T-helper cell functions essential to B-lymphocyte responsiveness, and impaired function of immunoglobulin-secreting cells. Other investigators have also reported strong immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory influences for components of the HIV retrovirus and also gp120 through yet poorly elucidated but certainly complex actions on both T- and B-lymphocyte-mediated immune functions.","['Good, R A', 'Haraguchi, S', 'Lorenz, E', 'Day, N K']","['Good RA', 'Haraguchi S', 'Lorenz E', 'Day NK']","[""Department of Pediatrics, All Children's Hospital, University of South Florida, St Petersburg 33701.""]",,,,,,,40,,,,,,,,

The addition of this metabolite to sensitive cell cultures inhibits proliferation and induces monocytic-macrophagic differentiation. Alpha interferon may also inhibit proliferation and increase the expression of some surface antigens in some neoplastic cells. In the present report, we describe the synergistic activity of these two drugs on U-937 and on cultured cells from a leukemic patient. METHODS: Proliferation was studied by 3H-thymidine incorporation; differentiation markers were evaluated immunologically by monoclonal antibodies and by cytochemical tests. Phagocytosis and NBT reduction test were also performed in order to confirm the differentiating properties of these drugs. Finally, the expression of the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor was evaluated by immunochemical methods. RESULTS: After culturing these cells for 72 hours in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3, cell proliferation was reduced and the expression of some phenotypic and functional markers suggested monocytic-macrophagic differentiation. Alpha interferon and 1,25(OH)2D3 synergistically inhibit the proliferation of U-937 cells. Alpha interferon increased the expression of the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor in U-937 cells.

In five patients, lung aspergillomas disappeared completely, while significant improvement was observed in a further two patients. Itraconazole appeared to contribute significantly to the result, but the drug did not work during granulocytopenic episodes.

All 11 patients suffered from pulmonary invasive aspergillosis. Two patients also had cerebral aspergillosis; in one of these patients the paranasal sinuses were also invaded. Underlying diseases were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 3), acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 4); one patient underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation before he developed aspergillosis; another was transplanted after successful aspergillosis treatment, liver cirrhosis (n = 1), lung infarction after pulmonary embolism (n = 1), chronic bronchitis after pulmonary tuberculosis (n = 1) and AIDS (n = 1). In five cases initial diagnosis was established by means of mycological methods and clinical signs. In six patients invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was initially diagnosed due to the clinical criteria presented in this paper. Secondary mycological confirmation after onset of therapy was achieved in five out of these six patients. All of the patients initially responded to therapy. One female patient experienced a relapse of aspergillosis and died of cerebral involvement and relapsing leukaemia. Two further patients died due to underlying diseases (pulmonary embolism, relapsing leukaemia). Nine patients (82%) were cured of the mycosis, including the patient with cerebral involvement; two underwent surgical resection of residual pulmonary lesions. Itraconazole is a very effective drug for treatment of invasive aspergillosis. Therapeutic efficacy can be optimized by early diagnosis using clinical criteria and prompt start of treatment.","['Kreisel, W', 'Kochling, G', 'von Schilling, C', 'Azemar, M', 'Kurzweil, B', 'Dolken, G', 'Lindemann, A', 'Blum, U', 'Windfuhr, M', 'Muller, J']","['Kreisel W', 'Kochling G', 'von Schilling C', 'Azemar M', 'Kurzweil B', 'Dolken G', 'Lindemann A', 'Blum U', 'Windfuhr M', 'Muller J']","['Abteilung Gastroenterologie und Hepatologie, Universitat Freiburg, Germany.']","['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This agent induces differentiation and 1,25-(OH)2D3-24-hydroxylase activity in the mitochondria of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60, via a steroid-hormone receptor mechanism. HL-60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% normal or uremic serum. Treatment of these cells with 10(-8)M 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 5 days in a medium containing 10% uremic serum from 4 patients with chronic renal failure resulted in a maturation of the cells amounting to 30.3 +/- 18.7% (mean +/- SD) and 32.5 +/- 11.2%, as obtained by NBT reduction assay and NSE assay, respectively. These values were significantly lower than those obtained with 10% serum from 3 normal controls (66.6 +/- 12.8%, 58.3 +/- 10.9%, p less than 0.02). The treatment of HL-60 cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 in a mixture of 5% normal plus 5% uremic serum caused cell differentiation to an extent similar to that in 10% uremic serum, which suggests the presence of a substance(s) having 1,25-(OH)2D3-inhibitory activity in the uremic serum. Exposure of HL-60 cells to uremic serum significantly impaired their responsiveness to 1,25-(OH)2D3 as assessed by the induction of the cell's ability to hydroxylate the C-24 position of 1,25-(OH)2[3H]D3. The mechanism by which uremic serum confers an impaired cellular response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 seemed to be due, in part, to a decrease in 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor levels. A significant positive correlation was observed between intracellular cAMP levels and 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced HL-60 cell maturation. In summary, the mechanism by which uremic serum confers 1,25-(OH)2D3 resistance upon HL-60 cells seemed to be due to the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3-inhibitory activity in uremic serum, which may modulate cellular responsiveness to 1,25-(OH)2D3 by such mechanisms as reducing 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor levels in the cells, in part through alteration in cAMP metabolism.","['Inaba, M', 'Okuno, S', 'Koyama, H', 'Nishizawa, Y', 'Morii, H']","['Inaba M', 'Okuno S', 'Koyama H', 'Nishizawa Y', 'Morii H']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka City University Medical School, Japan.']","['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease is associated with a specific translocation between chromosome 17 and chromosome 15 t (15; 17) and with a bleeding diathesis previously attributed to a disseminated intravascular coagulation which is recently also related to a primary fibrinolysis. The high percentage of early deaths, around 20% experienced by APL patients, is generally due to the haemorrhagic syndrome. A new feature is the highly effectiveness of all-trans retinoic acid treatment, a vitamin A derivative, for inducing complete remission in patients. The induction of cellular maturation by this agent represents the first model of differentiation therapy. Furthermore recent molecular studies revealed that the breakpoints of the t(15; 17) translocation are clustered in the gene of retinoic acid receptor a, generating a hybrid gene product. Gene transfection experiments disclosed the impairment of gene transactivation due to the hybrid gene products, opening new concepts for the leukemogenesis. The abnormal program made by the aberrant transcript might be overcome by pharmacological concentration of RA which induces an over expression of the normal allele and a normal activity of the aberrant product.","['Degos, L']",['Degos L'],"['INSERM U 93, Centre Hayem, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,31,,,,,,,,

Ovine virus-non-producing clonal cells NP-2 were used as the immunogen. The NP-2 cells synthesized only the env gene products--glycoprotein gp51 and gp30 and main structural protein p24 of BLV. The NP-2 cells, inoculated into rats, induced an antibody response directed against envelope glycoproteins of BLV. The antibodies neutralized the infectivity of BLV as determined by the VSV/BLV pseudotype neutralization test. Similar results were obtained by vaccination of cattle with these cells. A dose of less than or equal to 2 x 10(6) live cells inoculated subcutaneously induced an antibody response in cattle, while a high dose of killed cells was ineffective. The antibodies in cattle were directed against env products of BLV. A group of 92 cows was vaccinated and followed up for 4 years. The antibody levels fluctuated slightly during the 4-year observation period, generally decreasing with time, but revaccination always increased the antibody titre. No transfer of seropositivity was observed to seronegative animals which were kept in contact with vaccinated ones. In a separate experiment a group of young heifers, after repeated vaccination, were challenged with a high dose of infectious virus and/or virus-producing cells. The response to BLV infection was followed by syncytial induction assay after co-cultivation of white blood cells with indicator cells CC81.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Altaner, C', 'Ban, J', 'Altanerova, V', 'Janik, V']","['Altaner C', 'Ban J', 'Altanerova V', 'Janik V']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.']","['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In order to verify the diagnostic relevance of such an approach, the immunocytochemical detection of MPO by means of the APAAP technique and a monoclonal antibody directed against an antigenic determinant of MPO (MPO7) was performed in 10 patients with undifferentiated or biphenotypic (myeloid and lymphoid) acute leukemia. All the cases were negative for conventional cytochemical staining of MPO. RESULTS: Positive cells (15 to 65%) were found in three patients. Some clinical data and biomolecular studies of T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin genes, available in five patients, indirectly confirmed these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Although some technical and biological aspects remain to be better characterized, immunocytochemical methods which utilize monoclonal antibodies against MPO may represent a simple and reliable tool for improving the diagnostic capacity to identify undifferentiated myeloid blasts in difficult cases of acute leukemia.","['Musto, P', 'Cascavilla, N', 'Melillo, L', 'Matera, R', 'Carotenuto, M']","['Musto P', 'Cascavilla N', 'Melillo L', 'Matera R', 'Carotenuto M']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, Rotondo (FG), Italy.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was noted that anti-HCV antibody response, seen to be relatively stable during the follow-up, lowered dramatically in coincidence with the hepatocytolytic peak. A diagnostic liver biopsy taken at the time of the acute phase of hepatitis demonstrated a typical feature of lobular hepatitis with widespread lymphocytic infiltrates, the predominant type of which expressed CD8 immunophenotype. Cytotoxic and immunosuppressive drugs may interfere with hepatitis virus infections. However, at variance from hepatitis B virus infection in which acute liver decompensation develops after withdrawal of chemotherapy in our HCV chronically infected patient it appeared during the course of the treatment, suggesting a different hepatocytolytic mechanism. Although the actual frequency of the phenomenon is presently unknown, this observation seems to indicate that immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents should be used with caution in HCV chronic infection in which cell-mediated immune response seems to play a major role in the production of the liver damage.","['Sansonno, D', 'Procaccio, P', 'Dammacco, F']","['Sansonno D', 'Procaccio P', 'Dammacco F']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, University of Bari Medical School, Italy.']",['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The milk dot blot test was highly repeatable; the concordance rate, compared with the agar gel immunodiffusion test performed on serum, was 83.5%. All herds contained BLV-positive cows; the prevalence rate was 36%. BLV-positive cows tended to come from larger herds and were older and more often later in lactation. Fourteen production and related variables (herd size, age, days open, days in milk, milk somatic cell count, milk, fat, and protein produced in the current lactation, projected production of milk, fat, and protein, and breed class average deviations for milk, fat, and protein) were compared between BLV-positive and BLV-negative cows. Although somatic cell count, milk produced, and projected production of milk and protein were related significantly to BLV status using simple tests of association, once the variables herd size, age and days in milk were controlled, these differences were removed. Further analyses using logistic (outcome: individual cow BLV status) and least-squares regression (outcome: herd proportion of BLV-positive cows) failed to show an association between any of the measured production or related variables and BLV-positivity. We concluded that the effect of BLV on production and related variables in dairy cows was below the sensitivity of our analytical techniques or was non-existent.","['Jacobs, R M', 'Heeney, J L', 'Godkin, M A', 'Leslie, K E', 'Taylor, J A', 'Davies, C', 'Valli, V E']","['Jacobs RM', 'Heeney JL', 'Godkin MA', 'Leslie KE', 'Taylor JA', 'Davies C', 'Valli VE']","['Department of Pathology, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.']","['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutagenized untransformed cells of this line were infected with recombinant murine retrovirus containing the src gene of Rous sarcoma virus and the selective marker gene, neo. After reaching confluence, cells transformed by the src gene tend to overgrow and die. Utilizing this property of src transformed rat cells and the selective marker gene, we could easily select untransformed cell clones containing the retrovirus genome. Expression of the src gene product in the flat clones selected was examined by in vitro assay of src kinase activity. To determine whether the mutations of these flat clones were viral or cellular, the susceptibilities of the clones to transformation were examined after superinfection with the wild-type virus and also characterized the retroviruses recovered from these clones. With this system, two novel clones were isolated. One had a defect in viral information affecting the transformed phenotype, but still retained src kinase activity like fully transformed cells. The other showed low src kinase activity but retained wild-type transforming virus, suggesting that a cellular gene involved in viral gene expression was mutated.","['Inoue, H', 'Isaka, M', 'Takeda, S', 'Hakura, A']","['Inoue H', 'Isaka M', 'Takeda S', 'Hakura A']","['Department of Tumor Virology, Osaka University, Japan.']","['EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, persistent viremia developed after oronasal challenge exposure with FeLV in 39 of 45 (87%) age-matched nonvaccinated control cats. Transient viremia, indicated by early detection of p27 by ELISA in serum of cats protected from persistent viremia at 12 weeks after challenge exposure, was found in 10 of 132 (8%) vaccinates. Cats that were aviremic 12 to 16 weeks after challenge exposure were examined for reactivation of latent FeLV infection; 4 weekly doses of methylprednisolone were administered, followed by in vitro culture of bone marrow cells. Latent infection was readily reactivated in 6 of 8 (75%) nonvaccinated control cats that had been transiently viremic after challenge exposure. However, latent infection was reactivated in only 5 of 48 (10%) protected vaccinates, and in none of 38 vaccinates in which transient viremia had not been detected.

Included as controls were parallel groups of cats inoculated with adjuvants alone or with an established commercial FeLV vaccine. After each inoculation and after virulent virus challenge exposure, sera from all cats were assayed for ELISA-reactive antibody against purified FeLV, FeLV neutralizing (VN) antibody, and FeLV antigenemia/viremia--viral p27 antigen in serum and within circulating leukocytes. Immunity was challenged by oral/nasal exposure of vaccinated and control cats with FeLV-FAIDS-61E-A or FeLV-05821-AB, an infective, noncloned, tissue-origin, FeLV field isolate containing subgroup-A and -B viruses. Vaccine-induced immunity was assessed by comparing the postchallenge-exposure incidence of persistent viremia and the pre- and postchallenge exposure titers of VN and ELISA antibody in cats of the control and vaccine groups. The percentage of cats, that resisted development of persistent viremia after FeLV challenge exposure and the preventable fraction (PF) for the vaccine groups (which adjusts for the severity of the challenge and the degree of innate resistance in the controls) were as follows: adjuvant controls, 26%; FeLV-FAIDS-61E-A inactivated virus vaccine, 95% (PF = 93.2%); FeLV-GA-B peptide vaccine, 5% (-28.4%); FeLV-05821-AB noninactivated vaccine, 67% (55.4%); and commercial FeLV vaccine, 35% (12.2%). The prechallenge exposure mean VN antibody titer for each group was: less than 1:8 in the adjuvant controls; 1:43 in the FeLV-FAIDS-61E-A-vaccinated cats; less than 1:8 in the peptide-vaccinated cats; 1:38 in the noninactivated virus-vaccinated cats group; and 1:12 in the cats vaccinated with the commercial vaccine. Thus, induction of VN antibody in the vaccinated cats, although modest, appeared to be correlated with induction of protective immunity as defined by resistance to FeLV challenge exposure. Results of these studies indicate that inoculation of cats with an experimental inactivated virus vaccine prepared from a molecularly cloned FeLV isolate was most effective in stimulating protective immunity against heterologous and homologous FeLV challenge exposure.","['Hoover, E A', 'Perigo, N A', 'Quackenbush, S L', 'Mathiason-DuBard, C K', 'Overbaugh, J M', 'Kloetzer, W S', 'Elder, J H', 'Mullins, J I']","['Hoover EA', 'Perigo NA', 'Quackenbush SL', 'Mathiason-DuBard CK', 'Overbaugh JM', 'Kloetzer WS', 'Elder JH', 'Mullins JI']","['Department of Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']","['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Vaccines, Inactivated)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '0 (feline leukemia virus vaccine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Test kits were generally highly sensitive and specific, compared with the IFA test performed at a commercial laboratory. Feline heterophile antibody, specific for mouse immunoglobulin, was detected in approximately 0.14 to 0.57% of the cat population. Test kits B, E, and D contain reagents that correct for antimouse antibodies.

Results for 32 (1.4%) samples were interpreted as equivocal (color development slightly exceeded that of the negative control, but was much less than that of the positive control). Collectively, the data indicate that when testing serum or saliva, a negative test result may be a good predictor that a cat is not infected. In populations of cats in which FeLV prevalence is low, a positive test result may not be reliable and thus, a confirmatory test should be performed.","['Jacobson, R H', 'Lopez, N A']","['Jacobson RH', 'Lopez NA']","['Diagnostic Laboratory, New York State College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca 14853.']","['0 (Antibodies, Heterophile)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant differences were not found among the 4 ELISA kits. Marked decrease in sensitivity of the ELISA kits was detected when virus isolation was used as the standard of positivity rather than the IFA test. Virus isolation was a more sensitive indicator of early infection, with marked discrepancy among results obtained by virus isolation, ELISA, and the IFA test. Results became progressively more concordant as infection became fully established. Cats FeLV-positive by virus isolation alone were more likely to eliminate viremia. All cats FeLV-positive by IFA testing remained persistently viremic. Virus isolation, ELISA, and IFA testing appear to differ in their prognostic value. The use of blood rather than serum for the ELISA resulted in several discordant results. Six cats were FeLV-positive by ELISA when blood was tested but were FeLV-negative when serum was tested. Positive ELISA results were obtained for 4 of these cats when serum was tested, using extended incubation to increase sensitivity.

Veterinarians must fully understand the characteristics--strengths and weaknesses--of the FeLV tests so that the information gained from them can be used properly. Any FeLV ELISA or immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test is a method for detection of FeLV infection (the virus) and is not a diagnostic test for leukemia or other feline disease. From previous studies, it was determined that the most accurate test for detection of persistent FeLV infection is the IFA test, which detects FeLV antigens in cytoplasm of leukocytes in the blood of infected cats. In the study reported here, 1,142,600 FeLV IFA tests were performed between June 1972 and December 1990. During this period 19.8% of the IFA test results were positive and 78% were negative. Evaluation was not possible for the remaining 2.2% of the tests because of lack of enough leukocytes in the smears to evaluate, or nonspecific staining reactions. In 1979, 7 years after introduction of the IFA test, in-hospital FeLV ELISA were introduced, which enabled veterinarians to test for FeLV in their hospitals. Ever since that time, continual discrepancies have been reported between results of FeLV ELISA and IFA tests, particularly between positive ELISA results and their IFA test confirmation. A 10-year comparison was made between practitioner-performed in-hospital FeLV ELISA (n = 20, 240 tests) results and FeLV IFA test performed by a commercial laboratory. All samples tested by ELISA were submitted (for confirmation of results) by veterinarians from the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, and Australia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Hardy, W D Jr', 'Zuckerman, E E']","['Hardy WD Jr', 'Zuckerman EE']","['Laboratory of Veterinary Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']","['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it is known that both viruses are capable of infecting T lymphocytes and that infected cats are lymphopenic, it was not known how infection with either virus might alter specific lymphocyte subpopulations. Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies to feline lymphocyte subpopulations, we examined, by use of flow cytometric analysis, lymphocyte changes in cats naturally infected with FeLV or FIV and explored the early stages in the immunopathogenesis of experimentally induced infection with these viruses. Both groups of naturally infected cats had T-cell lymphopenia. In the FIV-infected cats, the T-cell decrease was principally attributable to loss of CD4+ cells, whereas CD8+ and B-cell numbers remained normal. This led to inversion of the CD4+ to CD8+ ratio in these cats. In contrast, the T-cell lymphopenia in FeLV-infected cats resulted from decrease in CD4+ and CD8+ cells, which led to a CD4+ to CD8+ ratio within normal limits. Experimentally induced infection with these 2 viruses supported these findings. Infection with FIV induced early (10 weeks after infection), chronic inversion of the CD4+ to CD8+ ratio. In contrast, infection with FeLV did not alter CD4+ to CD8+ ratio in the first 20 weeks after infection.","['Tompkins, M B', 'Nelson, P D', 'English, R V', 'Novotney, C']","['Tompkins MB', 'Nelson PD', 'English RV', 'Novotney C']","['Department of Microbiology, Pathology, and Parasitology, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh 27606.']",,"['AI-27665/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43676/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,18,,,,,,,,

The effects of FeLV are paradoxical, causing cytoproliferative and cytosuppressive disease (eg, lymphoma and myeloproliferative disorders vs immunodeficiency and myelosuppressive disorders). In the first few weeks after virus exposure, interactions between FeLV and hemolymphatic system cells determine whether the virus or the cat will dominate in the host/virus relationship--persistent viremia and progressive infection or self limiting, regressive infection will develop. The outcome of these early host/virus interactions is revealed in the diagnostic assays for FeLV antigenemia and viremia. The latter, in turn, predict the outcome of FeLV infection in cats. Known host resistance factors include age and immune system functional status. Known virus virulence factors are magnitude of exposure and virus genotype. Molecular analysis of FeLV strains indicated that natural virus isolates exist as mixtures of closely related virus genotypes and that minor genetic variations among FeLV strains can impart major differences in pathogenicity. The genetic coding regions responsible for cell targeting and specific disease inducing capacity (eg, thymic lymphoma, acute immunosuppression, or aplastic anemia) have been mapped to the virus surface glycoprotein and/or long terminal repeat regions for several FeLV strains. Infection by specific FeLV strains leads to either malignant transformation or cytopathic deletion of specific lymphocyte and hemopoietic cell population, changes that prefigure the onset of clinical illness. Another notable feature of the biology of FeLV is that many cats are able to effectively contain and terminate viral replication, an important example of host immunologic control of a retrovirus infection and a process that can be selectively enhanced by vaccination. Thus, FeLV infection serves as a natural model of the multifaceted pathogenesis of retroviruses and as a paradigm for immunoprophylaxis against an immunosuppressive leukemogenic retrovirus.","['Hoover, E A', 'Mullins, J I']","['Hoover EA', 'Mullins JI']","['Department of Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",,,,,,,124,,,,,,,,

However, 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited the proliferation of LG cells to the same degree as that of ATCC cells. 1,25-(OH)2D3 also induced (1) the ability to metabolize 1,25-(OH)2D3 to 1,24,25-(OH)3D3, and (2) up-regulation of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor in LG as well as ATCC cells. Furthermore, the proportion of mature LG cells was 78% after treatment with 10(-7) M 1,25-(OH)2D3 for the first 48 h and 10(-7) M dbcAMP for the second 48 h, which was greater than that when treated only with 10(-7) M dbcAMP for the second 48 h (24.2%). These results indicate that 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor complexes function normally in LG cells at commitment step in cell differentiation. ATCC cells had a serine proteinase to destroy specific 1,25-(OH)2D3-binding activity of the unoccupied receptor and digest 53-kD receptor to a small fragment with a MW of 16.3 kD, while not affecting the level of the specific binding of the occupied receptor. Other cells, such as murine leukemia cells, M1, and human chronic myeloid leukemia cells, the differentiation of which is induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3, seemed to have the same type of proteinase, suggesting the physiological significance of this proteinase in 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced cell differentiation.","['Inaba, M', 'Morii, H', 'DeLuca, H F']","['Inaba M', 'Morii H', 'DeLuca HF']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka City University Medical School, Osaka, Japan.']","['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study did not reveal any common intrafamilial pattern of MS and HTLV-I infections.

None of the four clones which were sequenced exhibited intact gag, pol, or env open reading frames. Only IAP family II sequences were present in purified extracellular particles of CHO cells. Several cDNA sequences related to mammalian C-type retrovirus genomes were isolated and cloned from gradient-purified, extracellular particles of recombinant CHO cells. All were homologous to the conserved endonuclease domain of murine leukemia virus. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the largest cDNA revealed multiple interruptions of the endonuclease encoding reading frame providing one possible explanation for the non-infectious nature of the particles observed in CHO cells. Both types of retrovirus-like sequences identified in purified extracellular particles of CHO cells (CHO IAP family II and C-type) were present as conserved, moderately repetitive sequences in DNA of all CHO cell lines examined, as well as in DNA from a Chinese hamster liver. It is therefore likely that the extracellular retrovirus-like particles of CHO cells are the products of endogenous provirus elements present in the germline of Chinese hamsters.","['Anderson, K P', 'Lie, Y S', 'Low, M A', 'Williams, S R', 'Wurm, F M', 'Dinowitz, M']","['Anderson KP', 'Lie YS', 'Low MA', 'Williams SR', 'Wurm FM', 'Dinowitz M']","['Department of Medicinal and Analytical Chemistry, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080.']","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This assay also provides for simultaneous characterization of these colonies as belonging to a chronic myelogenous leukemic (bcr-abl positive) or nonleukemic population (bcr-abl negative). Using these techniques, we assessed transduction of the LNL6 retrovirus into the normal and leukemic cells of a blast-crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patient. This work was designed to support the use of the LNL6 retroviral marker to help identify the origin of relapse after autologous marrow infusion. The data from these experiments show that the majority of CML blast crisis cells that, following exposure to the LNL6 virus, produce colonies under rigorous G418 selection are indeed transduced by the virus, as shown by the presence of the neo retroviral gene. Most of these colonies are also shown to be leukemic by PCR detection of the bcr-abl RNA. This demonstrates the feasibility of the study of CML marrow for retroviral marking. These procedures will be of use in establishing if relapse arises from leukemic blasts which contaminate purged autologous bone marrow infused following intensive therapy for leukemia.","['Claxton, D', 'Suh, S P', 'Filaccio, M', 'Ellerson, D', 'Gaozza, E', 'Andersson, B', 'Brenner, M', 'Reading, C', 'Feinberg, A', 'Moen, R']","['Claxton D', 'Suh SP', 'Filaccio M', 'Ellerson D', 'Gaozza E', 'Andersson B', 'Brenner M', 'Reading C', 'Feinberg A', 'Moen R', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)']",['P01 CA49639-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['bcr-abl', 'neo']",,,,,,,,,,

Attempts to measure PKC in soluble extracts of synovial fibroblasts by standard techniques failed. Western blotting with anti-PKC antibodies detected only a low level of PKC in synovial cells compared to rat basophilic leukemia cells and crude brain extracts. However, synovial PKC could be detected by measuring the Ca(2+)- and phospholipid-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous substrates. In this way, a 35 kDa protein was identified as the major endogenous cytosolic substrate for PKC. Treatment of synoviocytes with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) strongly induced the synthesis of neutral metalloproteinases (NPs) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Both Western blotting and assays based upon phosphorylation of the 35 kDa protein confirmed translocation of PKC from the cytosol in response to PMA. Although IL-1 induced the NPs and PGE2, it did so without detectable translocation of PKC. There thus appear to be PKC-dependent and PKC-independent routes of synovial cell activation. Our data suggest that IL-1 uses the latter.","['Hulkower, K I', 'Sagi-Eisenberg, R', 'Traub, L M', 'Georgescu, H I', 'Evans, C H']","['Hulkower KI', 'Sagi-Eisenberg R', 'Traub LM', 'Georgescu HI', 'Evans CH']","['Ferguson Laboratory for Orthopaedic Research, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, PA 15261.']","['0 (Histones)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.23.1 (Pepsin A)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Gelatinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",['AR 36891/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autoradiography showed that shortly after intraventricular injection of radio-iodinated NGF (125I-NGF), substantial amounts of radioactivity had penetrated the ventricular wall surfaces; this binding was transient and nonspecific. The 125I-NGF was progressively cleared from the central nervous system (CNS), presumably via the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the blood. A relatively small proportion of the injected 125I-NGF was taken up by NGF receptor-positive neurons in the CNS. Retrograde accumulation of radiolabel was observed within the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons at 5 hours after intraventricular injection. Labeling intensity was maximal at 18 hours and much reduced by 30 hours. This labeling was blocked by co-injection of an excess of unlabeled NGF. Specific and saturable retrograde labeling was also observed within other NGF receptor-bearing neurons, including the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus and the raphe obscurus nucleus. When epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA), PDGF-BB, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), or IGF-II was radiolabeled and injected intraventricularly, specific labeling of neurons was observed for 125I-IGF-II and 125I-LIF within separate subpopulations of the dorsal and medial raphe. No retrograde accumulation within neurons was observed for EGF, TGF-beta 1, PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, or IGF-I. This study describes an in vivo method for identifying putative neuromodulatory factors and their responsive neurons.","['Ferguson, I A', 'Schweitzer, J B', 'Bartlett, P F', 'Johnson, E M Jr']","['Ferguson IA', 'Schweitzer JB', 'Bartlett PF', 'Johnson EM Jr']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Pharmacology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.']","['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Wheat Germ Agglutinins)']","['NS 01230/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 24679/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 25122/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conjugate consists of a monoclonal anti-bovine IgG1 and IgG2 labelled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The indirect ELISA was calibrated with EEC reference serum E 4. Standard serum E 4 was scored positive when diluted 8192 times in negative milk and between 12,800 and 25,600 times in negative serum. The sensitivity and specificity of the indirect ELISA relative to the agar gel immunodiffusion test (AGID) were 100% and 99.8%, respectively. ELISA results for milk and sera from 614 dairy cows agreed to 100%. The absorbance value in bulk milk could be used to roughly predict the rate of BLV infection among lactating cows in a herd. An infection rate of 4 to 5% in a herd could be detected in the ELISA. Results were applied in a nation-wide screening of more than 24,000 bulk-milk samples, and the subsequent introduction of an eradication programme for BLV. The aim is to eliminate the infection from Swedish herds in 5 to 10 years.","['Klintevall, K', 'Naslund, K', 'Svedlund, G', 'Hajdu, L', 'Linde, N', 'Klingeborn, B']","['Klintevall K', 'Naslund K', 'Svedlund G', 'Hajdu L', 'Linde N', 'Klingeborn B']","['Department of Virology, National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Propylene Glycols)', '6PU1E16C9W (bronopol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two others are cytoplasmic and consist of crystalline microtubular arrays and of confronting cisternal complexes of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). This latter is uniquely complex and not found in previous descriptions. Tumors of mesenchymal origin and experimental virus-induced tumors are known to contain short segments of confronting cisternae and TRS. Tubuloreticular structures and TCC are well documented in cases of lupus, in human immunodeficiency virus infections, in T-cell leukemia, and in experimental viral hepatitis in chimpanzees.

The method contrasts with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and its modified approaches, that have as their objective the amplification of unique or homologous sequences. SISPA requires the directional ligation of an asymmetric linker/primer oligonucleotide onto the target population of blunt ended DNA molecules. The common end sequence allows one strand of the double-stranded linker/primer to be used in repeated rounds of annealing, extension and denaturation in the presence of thermostable Taq DNA polymerase. The linker/primers contain restriction endonuclease sites to facilitate the molecular cloning of as little as 1 pg of starting material after amplification. SISPA is especially useful when the nucleotide sequence of the desired molecule is both unknown and present in limited amounts making its recovery by standard cloning procedures technically difficult. These conditions are present in the initial isolation and cloning of previously uncharacterized viral genomes. The application and quantitation of SISPA is described, together with its utility in the cloning and recovery of low abundance genetic sequences, as illustrated here with the hepatitis C virus.","['Reyes, G R', 'Kim, J P']","['Reyes GR', 'Kim JP']","['Molecular Virology Department, Genelabs Incorporated, Redwood City, CA 94063.']","['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other nonrandom numeric and structural chromosomal abnormalities have also been identified. Oncogene studies suggest a potential role for n-ras mutations in GCT transformation. The role of loss of tumor suppressor genes and increased genomic dosage of growth promoter genes remain areas of great interest. Leukemias and differentiated malignancies that arise in the setting of GCT appear to be clonally derived from GCT cells, with evidence of karyotypic progression and acquisition of other tumor-specific cytogenetic markers. Identification of i(12p) in poorly differentiated midline carcinomas of uncertain histogenesis can assist in the diagnosis of GCT. The presence of three or more copies of 12p may predict resistance to chemotherapy and portend a higher likelihood of treatment failure.

The knowledge of ligand-receptor-signal pathways is not only important in understanding the pathophysiology of malignant disease but also essential for devising future therapeutic strategies. The advent of recombinant technology has made it possible to test the efficacy of selective differentiation therapy, and haemopoietic growth factors are undergoing clinical trials for a number of indications. In addition, increasingly the receptors for haemopoietic growth factors and cytokines have come under scientific scrutiny. Recently receptors for IL-2 alpha, IL-2 beta, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, erythropoietin, G-CSF and GM-CSF have been isolated and cloned. It has become apparent that they have structural homology that is shared by receptors for growth hormone and prolactin, and this receptor group makes up the new cytokine receptor superfamily. The finding of sequence homology within these receptors suggests their evolutionary relationship. These receptors are transmembrane proteins 257-856 amino acids and their extracellular ligand-binding domain contains four conserved cysteine residues and a Trp-Ser-X-Trp-Ser motif. The secondary structure of the extracellular domain is made up of alpha-helices. High and low affinity binding forms exist for all these receptors. Binding affinity may depend on the formation of receptor heterodimers or multimers, association with other membrane proteins or differential glycosylation. Soluble receptor forms have been described for IL-2 alpha, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-7. It is not known whether they are actively secreted or represent the degradation products of cell turnover. Their function may be to mop up excess cytokines and thereby confine the cytokine response. There is no sequence homology of the intracytoplasmic domains although several are rich in proline and serine residues, which may be important in mechanisms of signal transduction. No receptor in this superfamily functions as a receptor tyrosine kinase or has intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity. Detailed study of individual receptors holds clues to the regulation of receptor expression, ligand-receptor interactions and mechanisms involved in signal transduction. Such knowledge might explain the pleotropic effects cytokines may have on different cell types and their overlap in biological functions. Elevated levels of soluble IL-2 alpha receptor (Tac) are detected in hairy cell leukaemia, lymphomas and adult T-cell leukaemia (TL), and levels reflect tumour burden.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Kaczmarski, R S', 'Mufti, G J']","['Kaczmarski RS', 'Mufti GJ']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.""]","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",,,,,,98,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the capacity of PMEA to inhibit the replication of FeLV-FAIDS in vitro and to inhibit the progression of FeLV-FAIDS infection in vivo. We found that PMEA inhibited replication of FeLV-FAIDS by greater than or equal to 50% at concentrations of greater than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml (1.63 microM) in feline fibroblasts and prevented T lymphocyte killing at concentrations of 3 micrograms/ml. PMEA administered to cats at dosages of greater than or equal to 6.25 mg/kg/day from 0 to 49 days after FeLV-FAIDS infection prevented the development of persistent antigenemia and the induction of immunodeficiency disease. In contrast to placebo treated controls, cats successfully treated with PMEA contained viral infection, developed neutralizing antibody, and resisted a second virulent virus challenge without further therapy. Manifestations of PMEA toxicity produced by higher dosages (25 or 12.5 mg/kg/day) were anemia, leukopenia, and diarrhea. These results indicate PMEA to be a potent antiretroviral agent effective in aborting fatal progression of FeLV-FAIDS infection when therapy is initiated at the time of virus exposure.","['Hoover, E A', 'Ebner, J P', 'Zeidner, N S', 'Mullins, J I']","['Hoover EA', 'Ebner JP', 'Zeidner NS', 'Mullins JI']","['Department of Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']","['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '6GQP90I798 (adefovir)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",['N01-AI-62524/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient was successfully treated with interferon-alpha (IF-alpha). In the fifth year of treatment with IF-alpha the morphology of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and of bone marrow infiltration changed with the appearance of numerous small to intermediate shaped lymphocytes of a T-helper phenotype. Frank leukemia, resistant to IF-alpha treatment and ultimately aggressive chemotherapy, developed.

In this study, the potential RNA pseudoknots just downstream from the known and suspected retroviral frame-shift sites were predicted in the Rous sarcoma virus, primate immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV), equine infectious anemia virus, visna virus, bovine leukemia virus, human T-cell leukemia virus (types I and II), mouse mammary tumor virus, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, and simian SRV-1 type-D retrovirus. Also, the putative RNA pseudoknots were detected in the gag-pol overlaps of two retrotransposons of Drosophila, 17.6 and gypsy, and the mouse intracisternal A particle. For each sequence, the thermodynamic stability and statistical significance of the secondary structure involved in the predicted tertiary structure were assessed and compared. Our results show that the stem-loop structures in the pseudoknots are both thermodynamically highly stable and statistically significant relative to other such configurations that potentially occur in the gag-pol or gag-pro and pro-pol junction domains of these viruses (300 nucleotides upstream and downstream from the possible frameshift sites are included). Moreover, the structural features of the predicted pseudoknots following the frameshift site of pro-pol overlaps of the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 retroviruses are structurally well conserved. The occurrence of eight compensatory base changes in the tertiary interaction of the two related sequences allow the conservation of their tertiary structures in spite of the sequence divergence. The results support the possible control mechanism for frameshifting proposed by Brierley et al. and Jacks et al.","['Le, S Y', 'Shapiro, B A', 'Chen, J H', 'Nussinov, R', 'Maizel, J V']","['Le SY', 'Shapiro BA', 'Chen JH', 'Nussinov R', 'Maizel JV']","['Institute of Biological Sciences, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa.']","['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,PMC7128882,,,,,,,,,,,,

A series of novel synthetic retinoids (called retinobenzoic acids), which include retinoid antagonists, have been developed and have been shown to be useful tools to investigate retinoidal action molecular mechanisms. Retinoids elicit their biological effects by binding to specific nuclear receptors (RARs) belonging to a steroid/thyroid nuclear receptor superfamily. RARs act as retinoid-dependent transcription factors which bind to a specific gene site and control the gene's expression. The diversity of retinoidal actions can possibly be interpreted by considering the following characteristics, all of which are quite diversified: the structure and spatial/temporal distribution of RARs, the base sequences which interact with RARs, the cell type specifically determined hierarchy of gene expression, and the nuclear coregulators which interact with RARs. Abnormality of an RAR gene which might cause acute promyelocytic leukemia is also discussed.","['Hashimoto, Y', 'Shudo, K']","['Hashimoto Y', 'Shudo K']","['Institute of Applied Microbiology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']","['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Retinoids)']",,,,,,194,,,,,,,,

Fusion was monitored by fluorescence dequenching of octadecylrhodamine (R-18) incorporated in the viral membrane. For one virus isolate (Z/G), the overall rate of fusion (at 37 degrees C) increased as the pH was lowered, reaching a maximum at about pH 5, the lowest pH tested. For another isolate (Z/SF) the rate and extent of fusion were lower at pH 5 than at neutral pH. Lowering the pH from neutral to 5 after several minutes of incubation of either isolate with HL-60 cells resulted in an enhanced rate of fluorescence dequenching. Nevertheless, experiments utilizing NH4Cl indicated that fusion of the virus with cells was not enhanced by the mildly acidic pH of the endosome lumen. Analysis of the kinetics of fusion by means of a mass action model resulted in good simulation and predictions for the time-course of fusion. For the isolate which showed maximal fusogenic activity at pH 5, the rate constant of fusion (approx. 0.1 s-1) at neutral pH was in the range found previously for virus-liposome fusion, whereas the rate constant of adhesion was close to the upper limit for diffusion-controlled processes (1.4.10(10) M-1 s-1). However, for the other isolate (Z/SF) the rate constant of fusion at neutral pH was very small (less than 0.01 s-1), whereas the rate constant of adhesion was larger (greater than or equal to 2.10(10) M-1 s-1). Lowering the temperature decreased the fusion rate. Experiments involving competition with excess unlabeled virions indicated that not all binding sites for Sendai virus on HL-60 cells are fusion sites. The virus fusion activity towards HL-60 cells at neutral pH was not altered significantly by pre-incubation of the virus at pH 5 or 9, in contrast to earlier observations with liposomes and erythrocyte ghosts, or results based on erythrocyte hemolysis or cell-cell fusion.","['Pedroso de Lima, M C', 'Nir, S', 'Flasher, D', 'Klappe, K', 'Hoekstra, D', 'Duzgunes, N']","['Pedroso de Lima MC', 'Nir S', 'Flasher D', 'Klappe K', 'Hoekstra D', 'Duzgunes N']","['Cancer Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco.']","['0 (Liposomes)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)']","['AI-25534/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-31506/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consistently intense cleavage, both in the presence and in the absence of drugs, occurred in the nuclear matrix-associated region. Since topoisomerase II is a major constituent of the nuclear matrix, and cleavage complexes include a covalent link between topoisomerase II and DNA, the findings suggest that topoisomerase II may function to attach DNA to the nuclear matrix. Cleavage usually occurred on both DNA strands with the expected four base-pair 5' stagger, and strong sites tended to occur within A/T runs such as have been associated with binding to the nuclear scaffold. Intense cleavage was present also in the replication termination region, but was absent from the vicinity of the replication origin. Cleavage intensities were found to change with time in a manner that depended both on the site and on the drug, suggesting that topoisomerase II can move along the DNA from a kinetically preferred site to a thermodynamically preferred site.","['Pommier, Y', 'Capranico, G', 'Orr, A', 'Kohn, K W']","['Pommier Y', 'Capranico G', 'Orr A', 'Kohn KW']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '1F1959S062 (elliptinium)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'P910685S6G (5-iminodaunorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dosage of 4.8 mg/kg/day was subtoxic but did not prevent the induction and persistence of FeLV viremia. The results demonstrate that DS by continuous intravenous infusion is excessively toxic at high doses and ineffective at preventing FeLV infection at a subtoxic dose in the FeLV cat model.","['Mathes, L E', 'Hayes, K A', 'Swenson, C L', 'Polas, P J', 'Weisbrode, S E', 'Kociba, G J']","['Mathes LE', 'Hayes KA', 'Swenson CL', 'Polas PJ', 'Weisbrode SE', 'Kociba GJ']","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']","['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '9042-14-2 (Dextran Sulfate)']",['N01-AI 62525/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],PMC245344,,,,,,,,,,,,

These mice are usually predisposed to a specific type of neoplastic growth. The tumors that arise are usually monoclonal in origin and become only apparent after a variable latency period, suggesting that additional events are required for tumor formation. Identification of these additional events is highly relevant: it might give access to the genes that can synergize with a preselected oncogene in tumorigenesis and could facilitate the identification of the biochemical pathways in which these genes act. Retroviruses can be instrumental in identifying cooperating oncogenes. Proto-oncogene activation or tumor suppressor gene inactivation by insertional mutagenesis is an important mechanism by which the non-acute transforming retroviruses can induce tumors in several species. Owing to the sequence tag provided by the provirus, the relevant proto-oncogene can be directly identified by cloning of the DNA flanking the proviral insertion site. We have exploited this potential of retroviruses by infecting E mu-pim-1 and E mu-myc transgenic mice, which are predisposed to lymphomagenesis, with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV). A strong acceleration of tumor induction ensued upon infection of these mice with MuLV. More importantly, it allowed us to identify a number of additional common insertion sites marking both previously known as well as new (putative) oncogenes. In a significant portion of the tumors more than one oncogene was found to be activated, indicating that within this system the synergistic effect of at least three genes can be established.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Berns, A']",['Berns A'],"['Division of Molecular Genetics, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)'],,,,"['bla-1', 'bmi-1', 'myc', 'pal-1', 'pim-1']",,24,,,,,,,,

IgG antibodies to CMV showed a marked increase in the HD-IVIG and a less pronounced rise in the CMV-IVIG group. IgM antibodies to CMV were present initially or became detectable in five patients, unrelated to the IVIG preparation. HD-IVIG induced a significant increase of IgG antibodies to streptococcal group A carbohydrate (A-CHO) and to smooth strain lipopolysaccharides (LPS) but not of antibodies against lipid-A. When the Ig treatment was discontinued, levels of total IgG and of IgG antibody to CMV decreased with an apparent half-life of 30 days.

We have further shown that, in these AML3 cells, the gene of the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR alpha) is translocated from chromosome 17 to chromosome 15, and fused to a new gene, PLM. This results in the expression of both normal and chimeric RAR alpha transcripts in AML3 cells. The PLM-RAR alpha protein may account for the impairment of differentiation and thus leukemogenesis, but not for the paradoxical efficacy of RA in these cells. In an attempt to elucidate RA's differentiative effect in AML3 patients, the present work examined the in vitro and in vivo modulation of the normal RAR alpha transcripts by all-trans RA in seven cases of AML3. In all samples, Northern blot analysis revealed a low expression of the two normal RAR alpha transcripts compared with other human myeloid leukemic cells. No modulation was observed after 4-8 d of in vivo therapy with all-trans RA 45 mg/m2 per d. In vitro incubation with all-trans RA, however, increased the level of expression of the normal RAR alpha transcripts in AML3 cells but not in other AML leukemic subtypes. This modulation of the two normal RAR alpha transcripts appeared to be an early and primary event of RA's differentiating effect.

Most striking is the role of retinoic acid as a morphogenic substance in vertebrate limb development, but equally important is its role in the maintenance of epithelial integrity in most superficial linings of the body. The similarity of the mode of action of retinoids to that of the steroid and thyroid hormones has recently been demonstrated with the discovery of the nuclear receptors for retinoic acid, which belong to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. These receptors act as transcriptional activators by binding as heterodimers to specific nucleotide sequences in the response elements of target genes. Response elements for retinoic acid have so far been identified for the rat growth hormone and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the mouse complement H and laminin B1, the human and mouse retinoic acid receptor beta, the human osteocalcin, and the human alcohol dehydrogenase genes. The retinoic acid response element (RARE) for the rat growth hormone gene is also a thyroid hormone response element (TRE), and the AP-1 binding site of the human osteocalcin promoter is also a vitamin D response element (VDRE) and a RARE. Both these elements are palindromic. Other RAREs have a direct repeat configuration of the half-site motif AGGTCA separated by five nucleotides (AGGTCA xxxxx AGGTCA). The direct repeat arrangement of the same core motif AGGTCA separated by three or four nucleotides becomes a VDRE or TRE, respectively. A point mutation has been identified in the RAR alpha gene of embryonal carcinoma cells resistant to retinoic acid. In addition to the three retinoic acid receptors (alpha, beta, gamma) belonging to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, a second class of retinoid receptors (RXR) alpha, beta, gamma has also been characterized and its relatedness to a gene, XR2C, of the locus ultraspiracle required for pattern formation in Drosophila has been established. That would suggest that both vertebrates and invertebrates may require similar transcriptional activators during morphogenesis. An RXRE has been identified in the CRBPII gene promoter and it contains five repeats of the canonical sequence AGGTCA separated by one nucleotide. The importance of retinoids, both as chemopreventive agents of tumorigenesis and potent differentiation inducers of neoplastic cells, can only be emphasized by the recent finding that the t(15;17) (q21- q11-22) translocation, specifically associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia, also causes translocation of the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene and its fusion with with a new locus, myl, of unknown function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['De Luca, L M']",['De Luca LM'],"['Laboratory of Cellular Carcinogenesis and Tumor Promotion, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)']",,,,,,102,,,,,,,,

These hens were divided into 3 groups as no antibody and non-viremic (NANV) (49 hens), antibody-positive and non-viremic (APNV) (21 hens) and no antibody and viremic (NAV) (2 hens) by testing the sera for the presence of ALV and anti-ALV antibody. Egg albumen and embryos were tested for the presence of ALV and ALV antigens. As a result, no ALV was detected in both albumen and embryos in the NANV group. On the other hand, all albumen samples collected repeatedly from 3 hens of the APNV group and 2 hens of the NAV group contained infectious ALV, although the infectivity differed with the individual. Also, these 5 hens produced infected embryos at varying frequencies. However, on AP hen which shed neither ALV nor ALV antigens into the albumen produced an infected embryo at a lower rate. These results indicate that testing for infectious ALV in albumen from a newly laid egg per hen is effective to identify the transmitters to some extent. When virus titers in each of 8 tissue samples from the 6 transmitting hens were determined, the highest virus titers were found in washing from the ampulla of the oviducts in most of the shedders, suggesting that embryo infection is closely correlated with ALV produced at the oviduct, but not with ALV transferred from the other parts of the body.","['Tsukamoto, K', 'Hasebe, M', 'Kakita, S', 'Hihara, H', 'Kono, Y']","['Tsukamoto K', 'Hasebe M', 'Kakita S', 'Hihara H', 'Kono Y']","['Poultry Disease Laboratory, National Institute of Animal Health, Gifu, Japan.']","['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pretreatment with hydrocortisone (HC) reduced formation of the various inositol phosphates (IPs) and degradation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by an average of 50%. Maximal inhibition of hydrolysis of PIP2 and reduction in stimulation of IP3 formation was reached after 4 h of preincubation with 2.10(-6) M of HC. Cycloheximide and RU486, a GC receptor antagonist, completely prevented the inhibitory effect of HC on IP formation. Other GC, dexamethasone (DEX) and triamcinolone (each at 2.10(-7) M) markedly suppressed antigen induced IP3 production, while aldosterone and sex steroids such as estradiol and progesterone (each at 2.10(-6) M) were virtually inactive. Antigen-stimulated phosphorylation of a 18 kDa and other proteins was inhibited by about 60% following pretreatment with the GC. This inhibition was in turn prevented by cycloheximide. DEX also doubled the activity of cellular acid phosphatase activity. The results suggest that the inhibitory effect of GC is specific, receptor-mediated, dependent on protein synthesis and possibly mediated by protein phosphatase activity.","['Her, E', 'Reiss, N', 'Braquet, P', 'Zor, U']","['Her E', 'Reiss N', 'Braquet P', 'Zor U']","['Department of Hormone Research, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']","['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '4L6452S749 (Inositol)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C)', 'EC 4.6.1.13 (Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we demonstrated that Mg2+ deprivation blocked the process of differentiation before the induction of lysozyme mRNA and that the process of HL-60 cell differentiation could be divided into two steps, i.e., a commitment step and a phenotypic expression step. We studied the effects of protein kinase A (PKA) and calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PKC) modulators at each step. The results indicated that agonists of PKA enhanced both steps but that N-(2-[methylamino]ethyl-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide inhibited them. On the other hand, 1-oleyl-2-acetylglycerol and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate enhanced the commitment step but inhibited that of phenotypic expression. Staurosporine and 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine inhibited the commitment step and enhanced that of phenotypic expression. These results indicate that PKA acts as a positive regulatory signal and that PKC has a dual role in the process of HL-60 cell differentiation, i.e., as a positive regulatory signal in the commitment step and as a negative one in the phenotypic expression step. Recently, we have also shown that in K-562 cell differentiation into erythroid lineage, PKA may serve as a negative regulatory signal in both steps; however, PKC may act dually, namely as a negative regulatory signal in the commitment step and as a positive one in the phenotypic expression step.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Okuda, T', 'Sawada, H', 'Kato, Y', 'Yumoto, Y', 'Ogawa, K', 'Tashima, M', 'Okuma, M']","['Okuda T', 'Sawada H', 'Kato Y', 'Yumoto Y', 'Ogawa K', 'Tashima M', 'Okuma M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']","['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '84478-11-5 (N-(2-(methylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)', '86390-77-4 (1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous procedures for isolating probes from amplified DNA sequences have relied on tissue culture cells, limiting the range of tumors that can be studied and raising questions of in vitro artifact. We have circumvented these problems by combining in gel renaturation of amplified sequences with the polymerase chain reaction.

These vascular structures, ranging from small capillaries to cavernous vascular dilatations, were lined by one to several layers of neoplastic endothelial cells. Thick papillary outgrowths of the neoplastic endothelium extended into and often occluded the vessel lumens. The fibrous component consisted mostly of spindle cells and granulocytes, which provided the stroma for the vascular structures. The vascular and fibrous components appeared to have arisen independently.

The blood of SV7-infected mice had a much higher level of circulating granulocytes than did that of MPSV-infected mice.

Hemorrhagic, necrotizing tubulitis with intranuclear inclusion bodies was observed in the kidneys of five bone marrow transplant recipients and five patients treated with intensive chemotherapy for malignancies (four cases of leukemia and one case of lung cancer). It was histopathologically demonstrated that necrobiotic tubular cells had inclusion-bearing cells of three types: ""smudge cells,"" Cowdry A intranuclear inclusion cells, and full-type intranuclear-containing cells. Immunofluorescent examination with anti-ADV antibody demonstrated specific fluorescence on the affected tubular cells of all 10 kidneys. Specific antigens for ADV type 11 were also revealed in all but one case by an immunofluorescent test using type-specific antiserum and convalescent serum containing high titer antibody to this serotype. Electron microscopy revealed intranuclear crystalline arrays of viral particles, 75 to 80 nm in diameter, in each of the seven cases examined. Extrarenal involvement, indicated by ADV-induced cytopathologic change, was confined to bladder or prostate. Hemorrhagic cystitis was recorded in all the bone marrow transplant cases as well as in one leukemia case. Adenovirus type 11 was isolated from urine in all five cases tested during these episodes. Renal failure was ascribed to ADV infection in two of five patients who died from renal dysfunction. The presence of hemorrhagic cystitis and localization of invasive infection in urogenital organs suggested that renal infection might occur by ascending route from the bladder. We propose that ADV should be added as a viral agent to the pathogenetic list of tubulointerstitial nephritis.","['Ito, M', 'Hirabayashi, N', 'Uno, Y', 'Nakayama, A', 'Asai, J']","['Ito M', 'Hirabayashi N', 'Uno Y', 'Nakayama A', 'Asai J']","['First Department of Pathology, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clonally derived cell lines capable of growing in 2-4 mg/ml of the aminoglycoside antibiotic, G418 (Geneticin), were established and transfected with pHIVCat, a plasmid expressing the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) activity under the control of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) LTR. All of the G418 resistant (neo(r)) U937 cell lines and 10 of 14 neo(r) NT2/D1 cell lines exhibited reduced basal levels of CAT expression or impaired responses to activation of the HIV-1 LTR by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) when compared to the parental lines. Other differences included inhibition of tat activation of the HIV-1 LTR and increased sensitivity of U937 cells to human tumor necrosis factor alpha. The expression of other eukaryotic promoters including the HTLV-1 LTR, SV40 ori sequences, and the human beta-actin gene promoter was similarly affected. However, differentiation of the neo(r) U937 cells into macrophages was neither delayed nor impaired. Because PMA is an activator of protein kinase C (PKC) and a potent inducer of HIV-1 directed gene expression, the amounts, sensitivity to G418, and cytosol to membrane translocation of this enzyme were determined in the wild type and neo(r) U937 cells. G418 at concentrations too low to affect cell growth (12-150 micrograms/ml) inhibited PMA-induced transactivation responses in wild type cells but did not inhibit PKC-dependent protein phosphorylation in vitro. PKC activities in the wild type and neo(r) cells were similar in absolute amounts and in the cytosol-membrane distribution of the enzyme. In contrast with wild type cells, however, all of the cytosolic Ca(2+)-phospholipid-dependent form of PKC disappeared from the neo(r) cells within 30 min after PMA induction. The results suggested that, depending upon the cell type, gene cotransfer using aminoglycoside resistance as a selectable marker may seriously perturb important cellular control mechanisms such as the PKC pathway leading to activation of gene expression.","['Maio, J J', 'Brown, F L']","['Maio JJ', 'Brown FL']","['Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461.']","['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['AI27111/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'MH45654/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several molecular probes of this region are presently available, and this makes the molecular diagnosis of CML a useful approach which can be particularly important in those cases in which cytogenetic analysis does not reveal the presence of a Ph1 chromosome. Here we report the problems and our experience during the molecular analysis of the 478 patients examined so far. METHODS: Molecular analyses were performed after digestion of the DNA with 2 to 4 restriction enzymes and hybridization with different probes. Individual samples were subjected to PCR since no rearrangements had been obtained with Southern blotting. RESULTS: Rearrangement bands were detected in all the samples examined. In 473 cases the breakpoint was located within the bcr. In one of these cases, it was detected only after PCR analysis, and in two cases only after the use of the PHL/BCR probe. In 5 cases the breakpoint was localized either 5' or 3' with respect to the bcr. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, the criteria for a correct molecular diagnosis of CML are presented. The ""PHL/BCR"" probe appeared to be very specific and time-saving, since it required only one digestion to evidence the rearrangement. Our results confirm the high specificity of the breakpoint on chromosome 22 in CML and the relatively rare incidence of molecular variants.","['Zaccaria, A', 'Tassinari, A', 'Guerrasio, A', 'Rosso, C', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Diverio, D', 'Testoni, N', 'Celso, B', 'Buzzi, M', 'Tura, S']","['Zaccaria A', 'Tassinari A', 'Guerrasio A', 'Rosso C', 'Lo Coco F', 'Diverio D', 'Testoni N', 'Celso B', 'Buzzi M', 'Tura S', 'et al.']","['Istituto di Ematologia Lorenzo e Ariosto Seragnoli, Universita di Bologna, Italy.']","['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",,,,"['ABL', 'BCR']",,,,,,,,,,

Thus, although PMA stimulates protein kinase C and staurosporine inhibits this enzyme, it is unlikely that the actions of either on topoisomerase II-reactive, drug-induced DNA cleavage are mediated directly via protein kinase C. Furthermore, it is likely that the mechanisms by which PMA and staurosporine inhibit topoisomerase II-reactive drug-induced cleavage are different.","['Zwelling, L A', 'Altschuler, E', 'Mayes, J', 'Hinds, M', 'Chan, D']","['Zwelling LA', 'Altschuler E', 'Mayes J', 'Hinds M', 'Chan D']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']","['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",['CA 40090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new drug was cytotoxic to both lines at doses as low as 50 nM for 1 h. N-(5,5-Diacetoxypentyl)doxorubicin produced DNA interstrand cross-linking in both lines. The cross-linking appeared to increase in both lines following drug treatment, but the increase was greater in the resistant line. This appeared to be due to an underestimation of cross-linking, particularly in sensitive HL-60, secondary to time-dependent DNA fragmentation that followed drug removal. This time-dependent DNA fragmentation was probably endonucleolytic cleavage (a feature of apoptosis) as characteristic nucleosomal ladders were produced by N-(5,5-diacetoxypentyl)doxorubicin treatment in a cotemporal time-dependent fashion. This novel anthracycline is the first of a family of alkylating anthracyclines designed to be water soluble, easy to formulate, and capable of producing DNA interstrand cross-linking. Because this last characteristic has previously been associated with doxorubicin analogues of great potency and low toxicity, these newer, more readily formulated drugs may have great clinical utility.","['Zwelling, L A', 'Altschuler, E', 'Cherif, A', 'Farquhar, D']","['Zwelling LA', 'Altschuler E', 'Cherif A', 'Farquhar D']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']","['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '138967-27-8 (N-(5,5-diacetoxypentyl)doxorubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",['CA40090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Erythropoietin interacts with high-affinity cell surface receptors (EpoR) present on developing progenitors and is required for their survival. Previously we characterized the gene for EpoR and demonstrated that its promoter acts in a cell-specific manner. Here we show that the hematopoietic-specific transcription factor GATA-1 is necessary, and indeed is sufficient as the sole cell-restricted regulator, for activation of the EpoR promoter in fibroblast transfection assays. Hence, GATA-1, which participates in transcriptional control of the majority of erythroid-expressed genes, also acts on the promoter of an essential lineage-restricted receptor (EpoR). This central contribution of GATA-1 to EpoR promoter function provides a mechanism whereby a cell-restricted regulator may ensure the viability and subsequent maturation of progenitor cells during hematopoietic differentiation.","['Zon, L I', 'Youssoufian, H', 'Mather, C', 'Lodish, H F', 'Orkin, S H']","['Zon LI', 'Youssoufian H', 'Mather C', 'Lodish HF', 'Orkin SH']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA.""]","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']","['5PO1HL33262/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL02277/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL02347/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC52985,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surveillance cultures of throat, urine, feces and vagina or prepuce were performed regularly. Four patients died, two patients due to heart failure, two patients due to staphylococcal pneumonia. Only in one case Candida albicans was cultured from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. No systemic mycosis or Aspergillus fumigatus pneumonia was documented. In a similar group of patients treated in the preceding 18 months nystatin was used as antifungal prophylaxis. In this group of patients six cases of Aspergillus fumigatus pneumonia, two cases of Candida albicans fungemia and one case of Candida glabrata pneumonia occurred of which six patients died. Itraconazole seems to be effective in preventing fungal infections in neutropenic patients and is well tolerated.","['Thunnissen, P L', 'Sizoo, W', 'Hendriks, W D']","['Thunnissen PL', 'Sizoo W', 'Hendriks WD']","['Department of Hematology, Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']","['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '1400-61-9 (Nystatin)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concomitant cell cycle kinetic analysis correlated the proliferation and transcription patterns. Transcription, cell cycle phases and rate of DNA synthesis were examined for up to 5 days of induction and, at 1-day intervals, analyzed during a 24-h reculture without the inducer. DMSO suppressed transcription of the c-myc and MPO genes with a t1/2 of 16 min and 7 h, respectively. The ability to recover transcription following reculture diminished with the progression of the induction and ultimately was lost; concomitantly, the cells irreversibly lost the capacity to divide. This indicated that the differentiation and proliferation processes are inseparable and that terminal differentiation accompanies irreversible proliferation arrest in HL-60 cells. We also studied the kinetics of the block to transcription elongation at the exon 1-intron 1 boundary of the c-myc gene. This block produces a 0.38 kb truncated transcript that is constitutively expressed in somatic cells (Re et al., Oncogene 5, 1247, 1990). During induction the level of the 0.38 kb RNA increased, while that of the complete c-myc mRNA decreased, indicating that this truncated RNA is generated instead of message through a monotonously initiated transcriptional process. Transcription initiation and synthesis of the 0.3 kb RNA persisted in terminally differentiated cells, suggesting a role for this RNA in non-proliferating cells.","['Antoun, G R', 'Re, G G', 'Terry, N H', 'Zipf, T F']","['Antoun GR', 'Re GG', 'Terry NH', 'Zipf TF']","['Department of Experimental Pediatrics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']","['0 (Actins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,"['MPO', 'c-myc']",,,,,,,,,,

Three of the four BMT patients subsequently developed CMV pneumonia. In two cases, CMV-DNA was detected in the sera at about the time the pneumonia occurred, and the amount of DNA increased with disease progression. The serum of the third patient became positive for CMV-DNA before he developed pneumonia. The fourth patient did not develop CMV pneumonia, but his urine became persistently positive for CMV-DNA soon after the BMT, whereas the serum was negative. A relationship was found between the occurrence of pneumonia and the serum level of CMV-DNA. CMV-DNA was also detected in three of six pneumonia patients whose anti-CMV IgM antibodies were elevated in the circulation. Sera from the 16 normal subjects were negative for CMV-DNA, regardless of their being seropositive or seronegative for CMV. While it had been previously thought that CMV did not exist in serum, we detected CMV-DNA in serum by PCR in the active disease stage.

In this report the contribution of the receptors Fc gamma III (CD16) and CR3 (CD11b/CD18) in the lytic process was investigated. In neutrophils CD16 and CR3 are up-regulated by the phorbol ester up to 4 and 10 times, respectively. As expected, lysis of non-immunized K562 targets is not affected by the treatment of neutrophils with anti CD16, AB8.28, whereas lysis of immunized targets is decreased by 50%. In addition, the interaction of CD16 and AB8.28 induces calcium mobilization and increases granule secretion. Surprisingly, the simultaneous binding of AB8.28 and anti-CR3 OKM1 to neutrophils completely abolishes the lysis of antibody-coated targets. Unlike CD16, CR3 does not possess a functional role and binding of OKM1 to CR3 does not affect cytotoxicity of immunized K562 targets, but it blocks lysis of non-coated target almost completely, indicating a function as adhesion protein for CR3. These studies demonstrate a distinct role of CD16 and CR3 in mediating antibody-dependent and antibody-independent cellular cytotoxicity, respectively.","['Gavioli, R', 'Spisani, S', 'Giuliani, A L', 'Cosulich, E', 'Risso, A', 'Traniello, S']","['Gavioli R', 'Spisani S', 'Giuliani AL', 'Cosulich E', 'Risso A', 'Traniello S']","['Istituto di Chimica Biologica, Universita degli Studi di Ferrara, Italy.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell cycle analysis after a 24-hr recovery revealed blocks in G2 (4N DNA) or greater than G2 (up to 8N DNA) polyploid stages. The relative percentages of cells in either stage was a function of drug concentration and cell cycle stage at time of exposure: typically, cells exposed during S phase became blocked in G2, whereas those exposed during G2/M progressed into greater than G2 polyploid stages. G2-blocked cells exhibited a 2- to 3-fold increase in nuclear protein content and cellular/nuclear volume (i.e. unbalanced growth) and approximately 5% more DNA stainability (as a consequence of nuclear conformational changes rather than redundant DNA synthesis). In all cases, at the drug concentrations studied, mitotic figures were absent and G2 and greater than G2 blocks were irreversible, indicating that the mechanism of polyploidy induction differs from that of microtubule inhibitors. These findings suggest that although topoisomerase inhibitors interfere with DNA synthesis in the S phase, their induction of greater than G2 polyploid blocks may involve direct or indirect inhibition of chromosome condensation.","['Zucker, R M', 'Adams, D J', 'Bair, K W', 'Elstein, K H']","['Zucker RM', 'Adams DJ', 'Bair KW', 'Elstein KH']","['ManTech Environmental Technology, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.']","['0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We showed previously a decrease in adenylate cyclase activity in the presence of histamine, prostaglandin E1 and forskolin in RA-treated HL-60 cells as compared to untreated cells. We examined the elements of the signal transduction pathway utilized by RA in the human myeloid cell line HL-60 and the human monocytic cell line THP-1. We therefore studied the effect of RA on the activity of the stimulatory G-protein (Gs). We demonstrate that addition of RA to two human myeloid leukemia cell lines, HL-60 and THP-1, does not induce a reduction of the 2 subunit of Gs (Gs alpha) RNA or Gs alpha protein in the plasma membrane but leads to a rapid decrease in the cholera toxin (CTX)-catalysed ADP-ribosylation of Gs alpha. In addition, this effect seems to be specific to RA, since there was no modification in Gs alpha ADP-ribosylation in the membranes of cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), another inducer of differentiation in HL-60 cells.","['de Cremoux, P', 'Zimber, A', 'Calvo, F', 'Lanotte, M', 'Mercken, L', 'Abita, J P']","['de Cremoux P', 'Zimber A', 'Calvo F', 'Lanotte M', 'Mercken L', 'Abita JP']","['Pharmacology Laboratory, Paris 7 University, France.']","['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human cancers associated with papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human T cell leukemia-lymphoma virus infections are responsible for approximately 15 percent of the worldwide cancer incidence. Cancer of the cervix and hepatocellular carcinoma account for about 80 percent of virus-linked cancers. Because experimental and epidemiologic data imply a causative role for viruses, particularly in cervical and liver cancer, viruses must be thought of as the second most important risk factor for cancer development in humans, exceeded only by tobacco consumption.","['zur Hausen, H']",['zur Hausen H'],"['Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany.']",,,,,,,84,,,,,,,,

DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded NHL tissue and specific viral gene sequences were sought using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). EBV sequences were found in 10 NHL samples (50%), with five tumors showing A-type and five B-type sequences. By serologic testing, 18 of 19 patients had antibodies to EBV, with 14 patients having antibodies to A-type EBV and 11 to B-type EBV. Serology confirmed the high prevalence of type B EBV in HIV-infected patients, but was not a reliable indicator of the EBV subtype present in the lymphomas. HIV sequences were present in biopsy tissue but at a level consistent with an origin from bystander HIV-infected cells. All 20 patients were negative by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to human T-cell leukemia virus-type I. The high prevalence of type B EBV in these tumors is similar to the findings in endemic Burkitt's lymphoma, where 40% of the tumors have type B viral sequences. In normal populations, type B EBV is rarely found outside the nasopharynx. These studies support the hypothesis that EBV is an important cofactor in NHL in HIV-infected persons. The finding that B-type EBV is present in 25% of HIV-associated NHL suggests that this EBV subtype may be an important human pathogen with a wider geographic distribution than originally thought.","['Boyle, M J', 'Sewell, W A', 'Sculley, T B', 'Apolloni, A', 'Turner, J J', 'Swanson, C E', 'Penny, R', 'Cooper, D A']","['Boyle MJ', 'Sewell WA', 'Sculley TB', 'Apolloni A', 'Turner JJ', 'Swanson CE', 'Penny R', 'Cooper DA']","[""Department of Anatomical Pathology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia.""]","['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)']",['1 RO1 CA52250-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Platelets isolated from the controls produced mainly LXA4, but also 6(S)-LXA4 and the all-trans isomers of lipoxins A4 and B4, as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and computerized UV spectroscopy. In comparison to control levels, the mean LX synthesis was significantly lower in platelets from the MPD patients (438.7 +/- 62.8 and 157.4 +/- 31.2 pmol LXA4 per 10(9) platelets, respectively; mean +/- SEM; P = .0001). Platelets from six of the patients showed a particularly low capacity to produce LXs, resulting in LX levels below the detection limit or less than 7% of mean control levels. Notably, all these patients were in blastic crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). This severely deficient LX production was paralleled by a dramatically attenuated conversion of arachidonic acid to 12-HETE (12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid), a product formed via the prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase pathway, was normal. In addition, longitudinal studies of CML patients showed that blastic metamorphosis was associated with a markedly reduced capability to synthesize LXs, while this capacity improved after retransformation into a second chronic phase. The results reveal deficient LX synthesis as a novel platelet dysfunction in MPD, particularly in blastic crisis of CML in which an essentially abolished 12-lipoxygenase activity may be a general phenomenon.","['Stenke, L', 'Edenius, C', 'Samuelsson, J', 'Lindgren, J A']","['Stenke L', 'Edenius C', 'Samuelsson J', 'Lindgren JA']","['Department of Physiological Chemistry, Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']","['0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '0 (Leukotriene A4)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Lipoxins)', '0 (SRS-A)', '0 (lipoxin A4)', '50683-78-8 (12-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid)', '59985-28-3 (12-Hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic Acid)', '92950-25-9 (lipoxin B4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic oral carriage of FCV was present in about one-fifth of the cats in each of the groups. FIV infection was not present in the purebred cattery, was moderately prevalent (8%) in the pet population of cats examined at the VMTH for various complaints and was rampant in the cat shelter (21%). Unexpectedly high FeLV infection rates were found in the hospital cat population (28%) and in the purebred cattery (36%), but not in the cat shelter (1.4%). FCV and FeLV infections tended to occur early in life, whereas FIV infections tended to occur in older animals. From 43 to 100% of the cats in these environments had oral cavity disease ranging from mild gingivitis (23-46%), proliferative gingivitis (18-20%), periodontitis (3-32%) and periodontitis with involvement of extra-gingival tissues (7-27%). Cats infected solely with FCV did not have a greater likelihood of oral lesions, or more severe oral disease, than cats that were totally virus free. This was also true for cats infected solely with FeLV, or for cats dually infected with FeLV and FCV. Cats infected solely with FIV appeared to have a greater prevalence of oral cavity infections and their oral cavity disease tended to be more severe than cats without FIV infection. FIV-infected cats that were coinfected with either FCV, or with FCV and FeLV, had the highest prevalence of oral cavity infections and the most severe oral lesions.","['Tenorio, A P', 'Franti, C E', 'Madewell, B R', 'Pedersen, N C']","['Tenorio AP', 'Franti CE', 'Madewell BR', 'Pedersen NC']","['Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis 95616.']",,"['AI-25802-03/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-50179-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the asymptomatic period preceding immunodeficiency disease, we were unable to detect any deficits in concanavalin A-induced blastogenesis, xenogeneic mixed-lymphocyte reaction assays, stimulation of lymphocytes by soluble protein antigen, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte assays. However, during this period humoral immune responses in the FeLV-FAIDS-infected cats were dramatically impaired. As early as 9 weeks after virus inoculation, the ability to mount either an IgM or IgG response to soluble protein antigens was lost. Neither B cell function, as assessed by lipopolysaccharide-induced blastogenesis or circulating B cell numbers, as assessed by immunofluorescence, differed between infected and control cats. These results suggest that FeLV-FAIDS infection may impair a subpopulation of T helper cells, that provides help for the production of antibody. Consistent with earlier observations of cats naturally infected with FeLV, our results indicate that early impairment of humoral immunity is an important component of the immunodeficiency syndrome induced by FeLV in cats.","['Pardi, D', 'Hoover, E A', 'Quackenbush, S L', 'Mullins, J I', 'Callahan, G N']","['Pardi D', 'Hoover EA', 'Quackenbush SL', 'Mullins JI', 'Callahan GN']","['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']","['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']","['CA-39054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

One c-fos-expressing retrovirus, chosen for its ability to express high levels of proteins in fibroblast-like cells, was shown to potentiate long-term cultures of mouse bone marrow stromal cells in vitro and therefore constitutes a potential tool for immortalizing such cells. Moreover, when tested in an in vitro differentiation assay, stromal cells constitutively expressing c-fos favor the granulocyte differentiation of hematopoietic precursors. Interestingly, retroviruses expressing v-src and v-abl oncogenes, included as controls in our experiments, do not produce any detectable effects, whereas those expressing polyoma virus middle T antigen facilitate long-term growth in vitro of stromal cells that favor the macrophage differentiation pathway of bone marrow stem cells. Our observation supports the idea that constitutive expression of some oncogenes, including c-fos and polyoma virus middle T antigen, may influence cytokine production by bone marrow stromal cells.","['Roux, P', 'Verrier, B', 'Klein, B', 'Niccolino, M', 'Marty, L', 'Alexandre, C', 'Piechaczyk, M']","['Roux P', 'Verrier B', 'Klein B', 'Niccolino M', 'Marty L', 'Alexandre C', 'Piechaczyk M']","['UA CNRS 1191 Genetique Moleculaire, USTL, Montpellier, France.']","['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)']",,,"['GENBANK/S59631', 'GENBANK/S59635', 'GENBANK/S59842', 'GENBANK/S65138', 'GENBANK/S65140', 'GENBANK/S74923', 'GENBANK/S74924', 'GENBANK/S74925', 'GENBANK/S74926', 'GENBANK/X59065']",['c-fos'],,,,,,,,,,

Using GAL4-ATF/CREB fusions, we have investigated the regulatory functions of three members of this family. CREB1 (CREB) is strongly activated by cAMP and weakly activated by the E1A protein. In contrast, CREB2 (CRE-BP1, ATF2) is strongly activated by E1A but is insensitive to cAMP stimulation. ATF1 is weakly activated by cAMP but is not activated by E1A. All three proteins are insensitive to activation by the HTLV1 tax protein. The N-terminal region of CREB2, from amino acid residues 19 to 112, is both necessary and sufficient for E1A activation. This region contains a putative C2H2 metal-binding finger, and single amino acid substitutions of the cysteine residues severely decreased CREB2 activity. In contrast, mutations affecting a potential protein kinase A and casein kinase II phosphorylation site within this region had little effect.","['Flint, K J', 'Jones, N C']","['Flint KJ', 'Jones NC']","['Gene Regulation Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK.']","['0 (Activating Transcription Factors)', '0 (Adenovirus Early Proteins)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An analogous E mu N-myc transgene is expressed preferentially in pre-B and B cells and provokes the development of B-cell neoplasias. Animals with an E mu pim-1 construct express the transgene in both B and T cells, but succumb to T-cell lymphomas. Complementation of the E mu N- and L-myc transgenic mice by breeding with E mu pim-1 animals leads to much more rapid development and a dramatically higher incidence of lymphoid malignancies, but the lineage specificity prescribed by the E mu N- and L-myc transgenes is maintained. The different oncogenic potential of myc genes is illustrated by the average latency period of tumor manifestation in double transgenics. Whereas c-myc/pim-1 animals develop pre-B-cell leukemia prenatally, the mean latency period for N-myc/pim-1 and L-myc/pim-1 mice is 36 and 94 days respectively.

METHODS: We examined the incidence of zoster, risk factors for it, and measures of immune response in children with leukemia who received the vaccine and in appropriate controls. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 4.1 years, zoster was documented in 13 of the 548 vaccinated children with leukemia (2.4 percent). In a subgroup of 96 vaccinated children matched prospectively with 96 children with leukemia who had had natural varicella infections, there were 4 cases of zoster among the vaccinated children and 15 among the controls, for crude incidence rates of 0.80 and 2.46 cases per 100 person-years, respectively (P = 0.01). Of the total of 13 vaccinated children who had zoster, 11 had a skin rash due to varicella-zoster virus, either from the vaccine itself or from breakthrough varicella after household exposure in the period between immunization and the documentation of zoster. In the 268 children who had any type of rash caused by varicella-zoster virus after vaccination, as compared with those who did not have a rash, the relative risk of subsequent zoster was 5.75. For the 21 vaccinated children who received bone marrow transplants, as compared with those who did not, the relative risk of zoster was 7.5. Cell-mediated immunity as assessed by lymphocyte stimulation was lower in 4 children in whom zoster later developed than in 29 controls who had been vaccinated but who did not have zoster (mean stimulation index, 5.1 vs. 23.8; P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In children with leukemia who receive the live attenuated varicella vaccine, the subsequent incidence of zoster is lower than in children who have natural varicella infections.","['Hardy, I', 'Gershon, A A', 'Steinberg, S P', 'LaRussa, P']","['Hardy I', 'Gershon AA', 'Steinberg SP', 'LaRussa P']","['Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032.']","['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)', '0 (Vaccines, Attenuated)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']","['AI 24021/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 62529/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

An excessive growth of stromal fibroblastic cells and an excessive deposition of their product, the reticulin fibers, are the hallmark of myelofibrosis.

A series of experiments was performed to test whether sequences within the R regions of the murine leukemia viruses Akv and SL3-3 affect viral expression. By using plasmid clones of the viral LTRs linked to a reporter gene, deletion of the R region was found to decrease expression to variable extents in a series of mammalian cell lines, with the largest effects being detected in murine fibroblasts. R-region sequences from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 LTR or a random sequence were unable to substitute for the murine leukemia virus sequences. Transcripts from the R-region-deleted templates were initiated at the proper site in the LTR, but their levels were decreased at least 10-fold. Nuclear run-on assays showed that the decrease caused by the R-region deletions was due, in part, to an effect on RNA polymerase loading, suggesting an effect on transcriptional initiation. The remainder of the activity was presumably due to a posttranscriptional effect. Analysis of the R-region sequences of murine leukemia viruses and related retroviruses led to the prediction of a conserved secondary structure in the transcribed RNA that might have a role in activity. We conclude that R-region sequences are of importance for the expression of a variety of retroviruses.","['Cupelli, L A', 'Lenz, J']","['Cupelli LA', 'Lenz J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461.']","['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']","['5P30CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44822/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07491/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC250808,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we analyzed the composition of the bovine leukemia virus (BLV) gag proteins and examined their RNA-binding properties in gel mobility shift assays, using various genomic RNA probes synthesized in vitro. Results obtained in amino acid sequence and composition analyses indicate that the matrix-associated protein MA(p15) is further processed by the BLV protease (PR) to generate MA(p10), a short peptide of seven amino acid residues, and p4. The gag precursor is now mapped as NH2-MA(p10)-p4-CA(p24)-NC(p12)-COOH. MA(p15) formed a specific complex with the dimer RNA of the U5-5' gag region presumed to contain the BLV packaging signal but not with other RNAs.

These results suggest a possible interaction of the NH2 terminus of the gag precursor with the 5' terminus of the genomic RNA in an early phase of particle assembly, when the conserved structure between the MA and CA domains might be involved.","['Katoh, I', 'Kyushiki, H', 'Sakamoto, Y', 'Ikawa, Y', 'Yoshinaka, Y']","['Katoh I', 'Kyushiki H', 'Sakamoto Y', 'Ikawa Y', 'Yoshinaka Y']","['Department of Viral Diseases, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokushima, Japan.']","['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (RNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",,PMC250779,,['gag'],,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that this virus induced an oligoclonal proliferation of infected cells and suggested that this cell expansion was an important event in the pathogenesis of MAIDS. To identify these target cells, we constructed novel defective viruses whose genomes could be detected with specific probes. Helper-free stocks of these viruses induced MAIDS. Using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry and Southern analysis, we found that most infected cells belong to the B-cell lineage. Transformation of these B cells appears to be the primary event responsible for the development of immunodeficiency. This animal model may be relevant to our understanding of AIDS, of the immunodeficiencies associated with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, and of the role of B-cell proliferation and transformation in the effects of superantigens, since Pr60gag appears to be a superantigen.","['Huang, M', 'Simard, C', 'Kay, D G', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Huang M', 'Simard C', 'Kay DG', 'Jolicoeur P']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']","['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,PMC250712,,,,,,,,,,,,

To begin an analysis of this issue, several recombinant FeLVs were produced by using two different approaches: (i) the regions of the viral envelope (env) gene of a cloned FeLV (subgroup B virus [FeLV-B], Gardner-Arnstein strain) and those of two different endogenous proviral loci were exchanged to create specific FeLV chimeras, and (ii) vectors containing endogenous env and molecularly cloned infectious FeLV-C (Sarma strain) DNA sequences were coexpressed by transfection in nonfeline cells to facilitate recombination. The results of these combined approaches showed that up to three-fourths of the envelope glycoprotein (gp70), beginning from the N-terminal end, could be replaced by endogenous FeLV sequences to produce biologically active chimeric FeLVs. The in vitro replication efficiency or cell tropism of the recombinants appeared to be influenced by the amount of gp70 sequences replaced by the endogenous partner as well as by the locus of origin of the endogenous sequences. Additionally, a characteristic biological effect, aggregation of feline T-lymphoma cells (3201B cell line), was found to be specifically induced by replicating FeLV-C or FeLV-C-based recombinants. Multiple crossover sites in the gp70 protein selected under the conditions used for coexpression were identified. The results of induced coexpression were also supported by rapid generation of FeLV recombinants when FeLV-C was used to infect the feline 3201B cell line that constitutively expresses high levels of endogenous FeLV-specific mRNAs. Furthermore, a large, highly conserved open reading frame in the pol gene of an endogenous FeLV provirus was identified. This observation, particularly in reference to our earlier finding of extensive mutations in the gag gene, reveals a target area for potentially productive homologous recombination upstream of the functional endogenous env gene.","['Pandey, R', 'Ghosh, A K', 'Kumar, D V', 'Bachman, B A', 'Shibata, D', 'Roy-Burman, P']","['Pandey R', 'Ghosh AK', 'Kumar DV', 'Bachman BA', 'Shibata D', 'Roy-Burman P']","['Department of Pathology, University of Southern California, School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033.']","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']","['CA51485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA09320/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC250696,,"['env', 'pol']",,,['J Virol. 1992 Jun;66(6):3976.

Thus the identification of cattle infected with BLV is of significant concern to the U.S. cattle industry. For this reason, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was used to examine seropositive and seronegative cattle for the presence of BLV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Using an amplification protocol able to detect 1 viral genome in 100,000 cells, BLV was not detected in 7 seronegative cattle in an infected herd.

The oligonucleotides were derived from the sequence of the major camptothecin-induced cleavage site in SV40 DNA (Jaxel, C., Kohn, K. W., and Pommier, Y. (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16, 11157 to 11170) with the cleaved bond in their center. DNA length was critical since cleavage was detectable only in 30 and 20 base pair-(bp) oligonucleotides, but not in a 12-bp oligonucleotide. Cleavage was at the same position in the oligonucleotides as in SV40 DNA. Its intensity was greater in the 30- than in the 20-bp oligonucleotide, indicating that sequences more than 10 bp away from the cleavage site may influence intensity. Camptothecin-induced DNA cleavage required duplex DNA since none of the single-stranded oligonucleotides were cleaved. Analysis of base preferences around topoisomerase I cleavage sites in SV40 DNA indicated that camptothecin stabilized topoisomerase I preferentially at sites having a G immediately 3' to the cleaved bond. Experiments with 30-bp oligonucleotides showed that camptothecin produced most intense cleavage in a complementary duplex having a G immediately 3' to the cleavage site. Weaker cleavage was observed in a complementary duplex in which the 3'G was replaced with a T. The identity of the 3' base, however, did not affect topoisomerase I-induced DNA cleavage in the absence of drug. These results indicate that camptothecin traps preferentially a subset of the enzyme cleavage sites, those having a G immediately 3' to the cleaved bond. This strong preference suggests that camptothecin binds reversibly to the DNA at topoisomerase I cleavage sites, in analogy to a model previously proposed for inhibitors of topoisomerase II (Capranico, G., Kohn, K.W., and Pommier, Y.

These results indicate that this resistance is not due to an altered interaction between the drug and cellular transport machinery, i.e. MDR1, associated with the ""classic"" multiple drug resistance phenotype, but rather is due to the existence of other mechanism(s) of resistance, decreased transport of the drug and decreased target enzyme, DNA topoisomerase II.","['Sugawara, I', 'Iwahashi, T', 'Okamoto, K', 'Sugimoto, Y', 'Ekimoto, H', 'Tsuruo, T', 'Ikeuchi, T', 'Mori, S']","['Sugawara I', 'Iwahashi T', 'Okamoto K', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Ekimoto H', 'Tsuruo T', 'Ikeuchi T', 'Mori S']","['Department of Pathology, Saitama Medical School.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,PMC5918605,,['mdr1'],,,,,,,,,,

Here we have studied the localization of RSV sequences integrated into the genome of cell lines derived from six independent hamster tumors. We have found that integration occurred in the isochores richest in guanine + cytosine, of the host genome, as it had been previously observed for bovine leukemia and hepatitis B viral sequences. The integration of RSV proviral sequences is, therefore, 'isopycnic' (i.e., it takes place in host genome sequences which compositionally match the viral sequences) and compartmentalized (i.e., it occurs in a small compositional compartment of the host genome). The hamster genome compartment hosting RSV sequences precisely corresponds to a compartment of the human genome which is the most active in both transcription and recombination. The notion of a compartmentalized, isopycnic integration of RSV proviral sequences fits, therefore, with the viral integration into transcriptionally active and recombinogenic regions of the host genome observed by other authors, but is broader, in that it includes, in addition, the requirement for a compositional match between host genome sequences and expressed viral sequences.","['Rynditch, A', 'Kadi, F', 'Geryk, J', 'Zoubak, S', 'Svoboda, J', 'Bernardi, G']","['Rynditch A', 'Kadi F', 'Geryk J', 'Zoubak S', 'Svoboda J', 'Bernardi G']","['Laboratoire de Genetique Moleculaire, Institut Jacques Monod, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we analyzed whether nucleoside diphosphokinase present in these membranes and capable of forming GTP[S] from GDP and adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP[S]) can contribute to nucleotide regulation of agonist receptor binding. Using GDP and ATP[S] at concentrations causing by themselves only small reductions in receptor binding of the labelled formyl peptide, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine ([3H]FMLP), a marked potentiation (up to 30-fold) was observed when both nucleotides were combined. Under conditions in which the combination of GDP and ATP[S] induced 70-90% of maximal inhibition of [3H]FMLP binding, a total concentration of about 7 nM GTP[S] formed was measured. The synergistic effect of GDP and ATP[S] on [3H]FMLP binding was not seen in the presence of UDP (1 mM), which blocked formation of GTP[S] from GDP and ATP[S]. Furthermore, no potentiation was observed when instead of GDP and ATP[S], guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) and adenylyl-5'-imidodiphosphate, respectively, were used. Finally, regulation of [3H]FMLP binding by ATP[S] plus GDP (or GTP) was a time-dependent process, reaching maximal inhibition after 20-30 min of incubation at 25 degrees C. The data indicate that nucleoside diphosphokinase present in membranes of HL 60 cells can transfer the thiophosphate group of ATP[S] to GDP leading to formation of GTP[S] and that the GTP[S] thus formed efficiently binds to G proteins interacting with formyl peptide receptors and thereby regulates their agonist binding affinity.","['Wieland, T', 'Bremerich, J', 'Gierschik, P', 'Jakobs, K H']","['Wieland T', 'Bremerich J', 'Gierschik P', 'Jakobs KH']","['Pharmakologisches Institut der Universitat Heidelberg, F.R.G.']","['0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '146-91-8 (Guanosine Diphosphate)', ""35094-46-3 (adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate))"", ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '58-98-0 (Uridine Diphosphate)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The experiments were performed in the presence or in absence of various stimulators of adenylate cyclase (AC) such as forskolin (FK), cholera toxin (CT) or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). OKT3 increased inositol phosphate (IP) production; in parallel, it induced a slight accumulation of cAMP. The effect was markedly potentiated in presence of FK or CT, and to a lesser extent in the presence of PGE2. FK stimulated adenylate cyclase of Jurkat cell membranes, but the effect was not potentiated by OKT3, suggesting that potentiation of cAMP accumulation requires intact cells and is not mediated by direct receptor coupling. On the other hand, elevated cAMP accumulation induced a negative feedback on IP production. The effect of OKT3 on cAMP was mimicked by A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, and abolished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. PMA had the same effect as OKT3 on basal or FK- and CT-induced accumulation of cAMP. In contrast, it inhibited the PGE2 effect on the cyclic nucleotide. After desensitization of PKC by pretreatment with a high concentration of PMA, the phorbol ester was no longer effective. Under those conditions, facilitation by OKT3 of FK-induced accumulation of cAMP was preserved, whereas potentiation by the monoclonal antibody of the PGE2 stimulation of AC was even enhanced. The data indicate that cAMP accumulation indirectly elicited by phospholipase C activation is, at least partly, mediated by IP-dependent Ca2+ mobilization, while PKC is preferentially effective as an inhibitor of PGE2 stimulation.","['Bihoreau, C', 'Heurtier, A', 'Enjalbert, A', 'Corvaia, N', 'Bensussan, A', 'Degos, L', 'Kordon, C']","['Bihoreau C', 'Heurtier A', 'Enjalbert A', 'Corvaia N', 'Bensussan A', 'Degos L', 'Kordon C']","['Unite de recherche sur la dynamique des Systemes, Neuroendocriniens U.159 INSERM, Paris.']","['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a RA responsive element (beta RARE) was previously identified in the promoter of the RAR beta 2 gene which contains two direct repeats of the motif GTTCA spaced by a six nucleotide gap. We now demonstrate the ability of RAR alpha, beta and gamma to bind to and transactivate through this element and that the two direct repeats comprise the beta RARE. Surprisingly, the GTTCA motifs rearranged to form a palindrome do not confer RA responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. Furthermore, no significant level of transactivation is detected by ligand-activated RAR through the Moloney murine leukaemia virus T3RE, which comprises two direct repeats of the sequence GGTCA/C spaced by a five nucleotide gap. Similarly, T3R does not induce gene expression through the beta RARE. This study establishes the preference of T3R to transactivate through direct repeats spaced by a five nucleotide gap as opposed to a six nucleotide gap. In contrast, RAR appears to be more flexible with respect to spacing requirements between repeats, although higher levels of transactivation are obtained through direct repeats spaced by a six nucleotide gap. Interestingly, although some elements mediate either RA or T3 induction, changing a single nucleotide in the MoMLV T3RE with a five nucleotide spacing creates a promiscuous RA/T3 responsive element.","['Vivanco Ruiz, M M', 'Bugge, T H', 'Hirschmann, P', 'Stunnenberg, H G']","['Vivanco Ruiz MM', 'Bugge TH', 'Hirschmann P', 'Stunnenberg HG']","['EMBL, Gene Expression Program, Heidelberg, FRG.']","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,PMC453120,,['RAR&bgr;2'],,,,,,,,,,

However, detailed studies of the effects exerted by cAMP analogues on cell cycle kinetics have been lacking. We have examined the effects of 8-Cl-cAMP and N6-benzyl-cAMP on the cell cycle kinetics of the HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line. A cell cycle study was performed by univariate DNA analysis after 24-72 h of treatment with noncytotoxic concentrations of 8-Cl-cAMP and N6-benzyl-cAMP capable of inducing 50-60% growth inhibition in these cells. HL-60 cells treated with 5 microM 8-Cl-cAMP showed no significant change in the cell distribution in the cycle as compared to the untreated control cells, whereas the treatment with 10 microM N6-benzyl-cAMP transiently increased the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase after 48 h, followed by a partial recovery at 72 h. Combined treatment with low doses of 8-Cl-cAMP and N6-benzyl-cAMP, each of which alone produced 20% growth inhibition, exerted a growth inhibitory effect of 65% and delayed increase of the G0/G1 phase by 72 h. To better understand the cell cycle effects induced by 8-Cl-cAMP, flow cytometric analysis of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation was also performed. 8-Cl-cAMP treatment exhibited a slowing down of the cell cycle; thus, the delayed appearance of the G0/G1 cell accumulation after combined treatment could be due to this effect of 8-Cl-cAMP on the HL-60 cell cycle. At a toxic dose, 8-Cl-cAMP brought about a G2M block, whereas N6-benzyl-cAMP brought about an increase of the G0/G1 compartment. G2M block produced by toxic doses of 8-Cl-cAMP was not related to its adenosine metabolite since 8-Cl-adenosine did not produce any specific block in the cell cycle. Our results show, for the first time, that these site-selective cAMP analogues could affect cell cycle kinetics at different points. These data may provide the basis for combination treatments involving cAMP analogues and other agents in the treatment of human leukemia.","['Pepe, S', 'Tortora, G', 'Noguchi, P D', 'Marti, G E', 'Washington, G C', 'Cho-Chung, Y S']","['Pepe S', 'Tortora G', 'Noguchi PD', 'Marti GE', 'Washington GC', 'Cho-Chung YS']","['Cellular Biochemistry Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', ""32115-08-5 (N(6)-benzyl-cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate)"", 'BQ94Z7E5OR (8-chloro-cyclic adenosine monophosphate)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have characterized topotecan in terms of its effect upon gamma-radiation-induced cell killing. In colony formation experiments, subtoxic concentrations of topotecan (2 microM) potentiated radiation-induced killing of exponentially growing Chinese hamster ovary or P388 murine leukemia cultured cells. Survival curve shoulders were reduced; the slopes of the exponential portions of the curves were decreased to a small extent. D37 and D10 (radiation dose resulting in 37 and 10% survival of colony-forming ability) values were reduced by approximately 60 and 50%, respectively, in the case of Chinese hamster ovary cells. In P388 cells, topotecan reduced D37 by 35 to 40% and D10 by 20 to 25%. Potentiation of radiation-induced cell killing by topotecan was absolutely dependent upon the presence of the topoisomerase I inhibitor during the first few (less than 30) min after irradiation. Association of topoisomerase I with this effect was confirmed in studies of Chinese hamster ovary cells previously made resistant to camptothecin (and cross-resistant to topotecan), resulting in decreased cellular content of topoisomerase I. These cells were found to be 2- to 3-fold hypersensitive to gamma-radiation-induced killing. P388 camptothecin-resistant cells were further sensitized to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation by nontoxic treatment with the topoisomerase II inhibitor novobiocin, consistent with increased dependence of topoisomerase I-deficient cells upon topoisomerase II.","['Mattern, M R', 'Hofmann, G A', 'McCabe, F L', 'Johnson, R K']","['Mattern MR', 'Hofmann GA', 'McCabe FL', 'Johnson RK']","['Department of Biomolecular Discovery, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",['CA40884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

One or two courses of consolidation chemotherapy with the same regimen as induction chemotherapy were given subsequently. No maintenance chemotherapy or central nervous system prophylaxis was administered. These patients included 23 men and 11 women, and had a mean age of 39. Eight of them older than 60 years of age were defined as elder age group. The overall complete remission (CR) rate was 62% (21/34), with elder versus younger age group 12.5% (1/8) vs. 77% (10/26). In patients who got CR after chemotherapy (3 cases with bone marrow transplantation and 1 case with only one course of chemotherapy were excluded), the median remission duration was 8 months, the median survival was 11.4 months, and the 2-year survival rate was 13.8%. Five cases died of complication of chemotherapy (2 septic shock and 3 intracerebral hemorrhage), and four of them were older than 60 years of age. In conclusion, this combined chemotherapy was as effective as that reported in western literature in treating AML in terms of CR rate. However, the 2-year survival rate was lower. The toxicity was acceptable, but the dosages of daunorubicin should be reduced in patients older than 60 years of age.

After 20 hours, there was a rapid decline in the EPO receptor mRNA level through the 45-hour culture period. Levels of actin and beta-globin mRNAs were monitored as two representative proteins that are actively synthesized in early versus late stages of terminal erythroid differentiation. A general decrease of actin mRNA level was apparent, whereas globin mRNA levels increased throughout the culture period. The greatest decrease in both EPO receptor and actin mRNA was observed when the cell population was at the stage of basophilic and polychromatophilic erythroblasts. The half-life for EPO receptor mRNA was approximately 75 minutes, as determined using the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. The half-life measured at several times during the 48-hour culture period remained constant. These results indicate that EPO receptor mRNA must be transcribed continuously until late in the maturation process of FVA cells in order to maintain the levels seen by Northern analysis. The number of copies of EPO receptor mRNA at 0 hours was determined to be 25 copies per cell. This low number and the decline of EPO receptor mRNA correlate with the low receptor numbers on FVA cells, as well as the decline of binding sites with cell maturation.","['Wickrema, A', 'Bondurant, M C', 'Krantz, S B']","['Wickrema A', 'Bondurant MC', 'Krantz SB']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232.']","['0 (Actins)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']","['DK-15555/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK07186/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously described cell cycle accumulations, after incubation with drugs (25 microM) for two cell doublings (36 hr), were localized to G1 and G2 after incubation with c3Ado and c3Ari, respectively. cAMP levels were elevated in cells treated with c3Ado (35%) and c3Ari (92%) for 36 hr. Addition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor theophylline, increased cAMP levels further, while cAMP responsiveness to the beta-adrenergic stimulator isoproterenol was attenuated after c3Ado and c3Ari incubation. Homocysteine thiolactone (Hcy) alone reduced cell growth slightly (5%) and increased cAMP levels (17%). Hcy increased the growth inhibitory effects of c3Ado, while no modulating effect was seen in combination with c3Ari, nor did Hcy counteract the effects on the cell cycle perturbations. The results suggest that c3Ado- and c3Ari-induced cell cycle accumulation is, at least in part, mediated through cAMP elevation, possibly due to PDE inhibition secondary to S-adenosyl-homocysteine hydrolase inhibition and S-adenosyl-homocysteine build-up.","['Prytz, P S', 'Bang, B E', 'Endresen, P C', 'Moller, C', 'Aarbakke, J']","['Prytz PS', 'Bang BE', 'Endresen PC', 'Moller C', 'Aarbakke J']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Tromso, Norway.']","['037V4520IY (3-deazaadenosine)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '58316-88-4 (3-deazaaristeromycin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'M351LCX45Y (Tubercidin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The enzyme was not released into the supernatant after stimulation of HL-60 cells with phorbol myristate acetate (100 ng) or Ca2+ ionophore (7.5 microM).

In one herd new infections were confined almost entirely to calves of uninfected dams. Following the end of feeding bulk milk to calves, a common practice in dairy herds, no more calves in this herd became infected. In laboratory experiments, neither prolonged housing of susceptible calves with infected cattle, consumption of drinking water contaminated with infected blood, nor inoculation of sheep with saliva from infected cattle resulted in transmission of BLV infection. Sheep were infected by subcutaneous inoculation of a suspension of purified lymphocytes from an infected heifer. The minimum infective dose was 10(3) lymphocytes, equivalent to the number of lymphocytes in approximately 0.1 microliter blood. Thus, procedures involving the transfer of a very small volume of blood from animal-to-animal have the potential to transmit infection.","['Dimmock, C K', 'Chung, Y S', 'MacKenzie, A R']","['Dimmock CK', 'Chung YS', 'MacKenzie AR']","['Department of Primary Industries, Animal Research Institute, Yeerongpilly, Queensland.']","['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RAR's have been established to be retinoid-dependent transcription factors which belong to the steroid/thyroid nuclear receptor superfamily. Recently, retinoic acid has been reported to be extremely effective in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) giving more than 70% complete remission efficiency. APL has been characterized by the specific chromosomal translocation, t(15;17). Analysis of the t(15;17) breaking point revealed that (i) either RAR-alpha on chromosome 17 or the gene named myl on chromosome 15 is abnormal in APL cells, and (ii) the abnormal fused protein myl/RAR-alpha is expressed, which is suspected to cause the APL.

Starting at the time of primary infection we collected six samples of serum from each patient over a period of 5 years. Ninety-four cDNA clones (50 of patient 1 and 44 of patient 495) of part of the envelope coding region including the principal neutralization domain (PND) were sequenced. Around the time of antibody seroconversion, genomic RNA levels reached a peak and the population of sequences was highly homogeneous. In the course of the infection, the number of amino acid substitutions accumulated, which led to a higher genomic diversity within successive samples and a drift in the consensus sequence, progressively differing from the first found consensus sequence. Fixation of a substitution at glycoprotein 120 amino acid 308 was observed in both patients between two time points (patient 1, H----P; patient 495, P----H). With the use of 16-meric synthetic peptides, differing only at the 308 position (H308 versus P308), antibody binding specificity was found to be dependent on this difference. In patient 495, the nonconservative (P308----H) substitution reduced the binding affinity with the patient's antibodies. Furthermore, antibody competition assays showed that the observed substitution at position 308 elicited a new antibody population, indicating antigenic variation. After the decline of V3-specific antibodies, the simultaneous increase in genomic RNA levels and progression to AIDS in patient 495, a new variant with major changes in the PND emerged, again forming a homogeneous population of sequences.","['Wolfs, T F', 'Zwart, G', 'Bakker, M', 'Valk, M', 'Kuiken, C L', 'Goudsmit, J']","['Wolfs TF', 'Zwart G', 'Bakker M', 'Valk M', 'Kuiken CL', 'Goudsmit J']","['Human Retrovirus Laboratory, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,"['GENBANK/M74591', 'GENBANK/M74592', 'GENBANK/M74593', 'GENBANK/M74594', 'GENBANK/M74595', 'GENBANK/M74596', 'GENBANK/M74597', 'GENBANK/M74598', 'GENBANK/M74599', 'GENBANK/M74600', 'GENBANK/M74601', 'GENBANK/M74602', 'GENBANK/M74603', 'GENBANK/M74604', 'GENBANK/M74605', 'GENBANK/M74606', 'GENBANK/M74607', 'GENBANK/M74608', 'GENBANK/M74609', 'GENBANK/M74610', 'GENBANK/M74611', 'GENBANK/M74612', 'GENBANK/M74613', 'GENBANK/M74614', 'GENBANK/M74615', 'GENBANK/M74616', 'GENBANK/M74617', 'GENBANK/M74618', 'GENBANK/M74619', 'GENBANK/M74620', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

During normal cell growth, keratinocytes expression the alpha 1 (connexin 43) and beta 2 (connexin 26) proteins. Within 5 min of TPA treatment, the alpha 1 protein became rapidly phosphorylated on serine residues and its expression was dramatically reduced by 24 h. The beta 2 protein, after an initial increase in expression, was also significantly reduced 24 h after treatment with TPA. ras transformation caused changes similar to those induced by TPA. The alpha 1 protein underwent an increase in serine phosphorylation, although its expression declined only slightly, while beta 2 expression was greatly reduced. The effects of TPA and ras on alpha 1 expression were additive; treatment of ras-transformed cells with TPA resulted in increased alpha 1 phosphorylation, with greatly decreased protein levels, much lower than those generated by either agent alone. These data provide a likely explanation for the similar and synergistic inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication by phorbol esters and ras.","['Brissette, J L', 'Kumar, N M', 'Gilula, N B', 'Dotto, G P']","['Brissette JL', 'Kumar NM', 'Gilula NB', 'Dotto GP']","['Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']","['0 (Connexins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['AR39190/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM37904/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC361610,,['ras'],,,,,,,,,,

Although the high prevalence of HHV-6 infection in early childhood seems to result from cell-free infectious virus shedded in saliva of healthy adults, latent HHV-6 infection is supposed to occur in lymphocytes. Therefore, we performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with DNA from PBMC of 44 healthy adults, 31 HIV-seropositive individuals and 33 patients with leukaemia or lymphoproliferative disorders. As positive control served PBMC from 11 children with exanthema subitum and as negative control PBMC from 20 newborns. Whereas HHV-6-specific sequences were detected in PBMC from all children with exanthema subitum and never in PBMC from newborns, they were found in PBMC of 9% of healthy adults and HIV-seropositive individuals and in 16% of the patients with lymphoproliferative disorders. Apparently detection of HHV-6 DNA in PBMC was neither limited by low sensitivity of the HHV-6 PCR assay, which detected less than ten copies of cloned HHV-6 DNA, nor by a low rate of latently infected individuals, but was limited by the number of lymphocytes subjected to PCR.

Treatment of 4- to 6-week-old AKR/J mice with the carcinogen N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) results in thymic lymphomas that arise as early as 3 to 4 months of age and contain novel somatically acquired MuLV provirus integrations. The AKR/J strain develops MNU-induced lymphoma with a higher incidence and shorter latency than has been observed for other inbred mouse strains. To determine whether provirus integrations of endogenous MuLV account for the enhanced susceptibility of the AKR strain, the incidence and latency of MNU-induced lymphoma development was compared in AKR/J and AKR.Fv-1b mice. The restrictive b allele of the Fv-1 locus restricts integration and replication of endogenous N-tropic MuLV; therefore, AKR-Fv-1b mice have a very low incidence of spontaneous lymphoma. In contrast, AKR.Fv-1b mice develop MNU-induced lymphomas with an incidence and latency similar to those of the AKR/J strain. Furthermore, thymic lymphomas from both strains express an immature CD4-8+ phenotype, indicating neoplastic transformation of the same thymocyte subset. Southern blot analysis confirmed that lymphoma DNA from AKR.Fv-1b mice did not contain somatically acquired provirus integrations. These results demonstrate that provirus integration does not contribute to the predisposition of AKR mice to develop a high incidence of early MNU-induced lymphomas. Nevertheless, MNU treatment stimulated high-level expression of infectious ecotropic MuLV in AKR.Fv-1b as well as in AKR/J mice, suggesting that viral gene products might enhance lymphoma progression.","['Richie, E R', 'Angel, J M', 'Cloyd, M W']","['Richie ER', 'Angel JM', 'Cloyd MW']","['University of Texas M.

Murine leukaemia virus (MuLV) has been detected at a high titre in the spinal cord of affected mice. In this study, we have analysed the possible role of MuLV in the induction of neurological disease by LDV. Immunofluorescent staining, autoradiography and an infectivity assay of virus yield have shown that LDV replicated in continuous mouse and rat cell lines that had been infected with an ecotropic MuLV isolated from C58 mice, but did not replicate in cells not infected with MuLV. No significant differences in infection were observed among the various ecotropic MuLVs employed, except for Friend leukaemia virus which rendered the cells susceptible to LDV least efficiently. The infectivity of the neurovirulent strain, LDV-C, to MuLV-infected cells was 50- to 100-fold greater than that of the avirulent strains (LDV-N, -Nu, -R and -P). The infectivity to macrophages was almost the same for virulent and avirulent strains. Adsorption studies using a radiolabelled virus revealed that LDV-C was adsorbed to MuLV-infected cells more efficiently than the avirulent strain, LDV-N.

This may suggest differences in the interaction of the viral proteins with MuLV-infected cells from those with macrophages at the initiation of virus infection.

Developmental restriction (or death) of stem cells during ex vivo infection has contributed to these difficulties. In these studies we report that the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) directly or indirectly supported the survival of hematopoietic stem cells during culture of bone marrow with vector-producing fibroblasts, resulting in efficient recovery of stem cells able to compete for engraftment in irradiated recipient animals. The infection efficiency of hematopoietic stem cells recovered from these cultures was approximately 80%; and all recipients (20/20) of the LIF-treated marrow were stably engrafted with the progeny of provirus-bearing stem cells. Expression of vector-encoded human adenosine deaminase (hADA) was detected in all recipients at levels averaging 15-50% of endogenous murine ADA in all their hematolymphoid tissues. Survival of stem cells in untreated cultures was approximately 10% of that observed from LIF-treated cultures, resulting in poor engraftment of recipient animals with transplanted cells. The infection efficiency of the few stem cells recovered from untreated cultures, however, was high (approximately 80%), suggesting that LIF did not have an effect on infection efficiency per se, but acted at the level of stem cell survival. Consistent with the poor engraftment observed in the control animals, expression of vector-encoded ADA was only approximately 4-20% of the endogenous levels. These results support the postulated role of LIF as a regulator of hematopoiesis and suggest that cytokine stimulation can positively affect inefficient retroviral vector transduction in hematopoietic stem cells.","['Fletcher, F A', 'Moore, K A', 'Ashkenazi, M', 'De Vries, P', 'Overbeek, P A', 'Williams, D E', 'Belmont, J W']","['Fletcher FA', 'Moore KA', 'Ashkenazi M', 'De Vries P', 'Overbeek PA', 'Williams DE', 'Belmont JW']","['Institute for Molecular Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030.']","['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",['R29 HD22880/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2118965,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report the extension of this technique to isolate and characterize chromatin that is enriched in active genes. In this approach, DNA in nuclei isolated from MEL cells was nicked with DNase I at a concentration that does not digest the active beta-globin gene, followed by repair of the nicks with a cleavable biotinylated nucleotide analog, 5-[(N-biotin-amido)hexanoamido-ethyl-1,3'-dithiopropionyl-3- aminoallyl]-2'- deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate (Bio-19-SS-dUTP), during a nick-translation reaction. After shearing and sonication of the nuclei to solubilize chromatin, chromatin fragments containing biotin were separated from non-biotinylated fragments by sequential binding to streptavidin and biotin cellulose. The bound complex contained approximately 10% of the bulk DNA. Reduction of the disulfide bond in the biotinylated nucleotide eluted approximately one-half of the affinity isolated chromatin. Hybridization analysis of DNA revealed that whereas inactive albumin sequences were equally distributed among the chromatin fractions, virtually all of the active beta-globin sequences were associated with chromatin fragments which had bound to the affinity complex. Western blot assessment for ubiquitinate histones revealed that ubiquitinated histone H2A (uH2A) was uniformly distributed among active (bound) and inactive (unbound) chromatin fractions.","['Dawson, B A', 'Herman, T', 'Haas, A L', 'Lough, J']","['Dawson BA', 'Herman T', 'Haas AL', 'Lough J']","['Department of Anatomy and Cellular Biology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)']","['GM 34009/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 39829/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

At presentation, myeloperoxidase and nonspecific esterase-positive myelomonocytic cells had proliferated up to 12.2 x 10(9)/liter in the peripheral blood. Bone marrow cell differentials revealed the coexistence of myelomonocytic cells (30%) and atypical plasmacytoid cells (26%). Myelomonocytic cells in peripheral blood expressed both myeloid antigens (CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33) and T/B-lymphoid antigens (CD2, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD10, PCA-1). Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) could be divided into PCA-1 strongly positive and PCA-1 weakly positive populations, which were considered to represent myeloma cells and myelomonocytic cells, respectively; the former were CD2-positive (CD2+), CD14-, and CD15-, whereas the latter were CD2+, CD14+, and CD15+. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that, in addition to plasmacytoid cells, a minority of myelomonocytic cells showed a positive reaction for IgG staining, and production of IgG was observed in the culture supernatant of CD14+ myelomonocytic cells in peripheral blood. Southern blot analysis revealed the presence of two identical rearrangement bands of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene in both BMMC containing myeloma cells and myelomonocytic cells and CD14+ myelomonocytic cells in peripheral blood. In a long-term methylcellulose assay, peripheral blood mononuclear cells produced large compact colonies consisting of macrophages and IgG+ plasmacytoid cells (M phi/P colonies), while BMMC produced a different type of colonies consisting of CD14+ myelomonoblasts, macrophages, and IgG+ plasma cells (Mb/M phi/P colonies) in addition to M phi/P colonies. Recloning experiments showed that primary Mb/M phi/P colonies gave rise to both secondary M phi/P and Mb/M phi/P colonies. These observations strongly suggest that common leukemic progenitors provide both myeloma and myelomonocytic leukemia cells, and the mechanism of ""lineage infidelity"" is probably involved in the development of their ""bilineal"" differentiation.","['Akashi, K', 'Harada, M', 'Shibuya, T', 'Fukagawa, K', 'Kimura, N', 'Sagawa, K', 'Yoshikai, Y', 'Teshima, T', 'Kikuchi, M', 'Niho, Y']","['Akashi K', 'Harada M', 'Shibuya T', 'Fukagawa K', 'Kimura N', 'Sagawa K', 'Yoshikai Y', 'Teshima T', 'Kikuchi M', 'Niho Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, light microscopic observation may not be sufficient to clarify precisely the effects of hematopoietic growth factors on the morphological differentiation of leukemic blasts. In this study, using cell culture techniques and electron microscopic cytochemistry for platelet peroxidase (PPO), we studied the effects of interleukin-3 (IL-3) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), both of which are considered to play an important role in normal megakaryocytopoiesis, on the growth and differentiation of blast cells from two patients with childhood acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). In both of the two cases, IL-3 stimulated leukemic colony formation in methylcellulose culture, whereas IL-6 showed little such activity. However, in suspension culture, IL-6 was active in promoting megakaryocytic differentiation, although incomplete, as detected by increase in the number of PPO-positive cells, some having demarcation membrane-like structure. This effect was evident in culture with IL-6 alone in one patient, but it was detectable only when IL-6 was used in combination with IL-3 in the other patient. In contrast, IL-3 alone stimulated differentiation towards myeloid but not megakaryocytic lineage. These results indicate that IL-3 and IL-6 have a distinct role in leukemic megakaryocytopoiesis (IL-3 stimulates growth, whereas IL-6 promotes morphological differentiation) and that cooperation between these two cytokines functions most effectively for megakaryocytic differentiation of AMKL cells in a fashion similar to that for normal megakaryocytopoiesis.","['Miyauchi, J', 'Sugita, K', 'Okui, M', 'Taguchi, N', 'Clark, S C', 'Shimizu, K']","['Miyauchi J', 'Sugita K', 'Okui M', 'Taguchi N', 'Clark SC', 'Shimizu K']","[""Central Laboratory, National Children's Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.""]","['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells can be induced to differentiate from their immature state to form cells resembling more morphologically and functionally mature monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. During differentiation, expression of gene products such as myeloperoxidase and the integrin cell surface antigen CD11b is decreased or increased, respectively. Thus, these cell lines constitute an excellent model system in which to study the regulation of such differentially expressed genes. However, these myeloid cell lines are refractory to transfection by calcium phosphate or diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) dextran. Here we have optimized the transient transfection of myeloid cell lines using electroporation and the firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by viral promoters. The luciferase assay is extremely sensitive; transcription that is not detectable by Northern blot or run-on assays can be measured with this system. The system can be used in combination with the inducing agent 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), thus allowing analysis of developmentally regulated genes in these cells.

Such stimulation can be markedly reduced by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml, 2 h). In membranes obtained from differentiated HL-60 cells, guanine nucleotides stimulate the formation of IP2 and IP3. Calcium ions also induce phosphoinositide breakdown in this preparation independent of the presence of guanine nucleotides. In HL-60 cell membranes, mastoparan inhibited GTP gamma S-stimulation of phosphoinositide breakdown with an IC50 value of 3 microM. Such inhibitory activity of mastoparan also was present in membranes from cells pretreated with pertussis toxin. Calcium-induced stimulation of phosphoinositide breakdown was not significantly inhibited by mastoparan. The analogs mastoparan-X and polistes mastoparan had similar inhibitory activity, whereas the analog des-Ile1-Asn2-mastoparan was inactive. In permeabilized HL-60 cells mastoparan also inhibited phosphoinositide breakdown. Another amphiphilic peptide, melittin, was inactive in HL-60 intact cells, but similar to mastoparan, inhibited guanine nucleotide-induced phosphoinositide breakdown in HL-60 cell membranes and permeabilized cells. Thus, mastoparan peptides can stimulate phosphoinositide breakdown in intact HL-60 cells, probably through the interaction with a guanine nucleotide binding protein. In permeabilized cells and in cell membranes, mastoparan induces inhibition of guanine nucleotide-mediated phosphoinositide breakdown presumably through an interaction with an intracellular site. The inhibitory action of mastoparan and melittin is probably related to the amphiphilic character of these peptides.","['Gusovsky, F', 'Soergel, D G', 'Daly, J W']","['Gusovsky F', 'Soergel DG', 'Daly JW']","['Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']","['0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Wasp Venoms)', '20449-79-0 (Melitten)', '72093-21-1 (mastoparan)', '72093-22-2 (mastoparan X)', '74129-19-4 (polistes mastoparan)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TNF alpha cytolytic activity in the supernatant of THP-1 cells stimulated by PMA began to appear at 4 hr, reached a peak at 8 hr, and declined by 12 hr. For THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS, the peak of TNF alpha activity appeared at 4 hr and then declined. TNF alpha-binding sites on the cell membrane were down-regulated within 1 hr after PMA and LPS treatment and then reappeared 12 hr later. Fifty-five-kilodalton TNF-R mRNA expression during this time period did not correlate with the level of membrane TNF-binding site expression. Additional studies indicated the presence of a 30-kDa TNF-BF in the supernatants which appeared after 24 hr.

Jansen et al., Cancer Res., 49: 1959-1963, 1989). In this study we used L1210-B73 and L1210 cells as a model system to study the affinity of the RF/MTX-carrier and the mFBP for the natural folate compounds folic acid and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-CHO-THF), as well as a number of antifolate compounds. Furthermore we studied the contribution of the RF/MTX-carrier and the mFBP in membrane transport of these (anti)folates, and finally we analyzed the role of the mFBP and RF/MTX-carrier in the cytotoxic effects of the antifolates. The antifolates used were either inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase, including methotrexate (MTX) and 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin (10-EdAM), or two folate-based inhibitors of thymidylate synthase, N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (CB3717) and 2-deamino-2-methyl-N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (ICI-198,583). The affinity of the RF/MTX-carrier for natural and antifolate compounds declined in the order 10-EdAM greater than or equal to ICI-198,583 greater than or equal to 5-CHO-THF greater than MTX much greater than CB3717 much greater than folic acid. The mFBP exhibited a high binding affinity for CB3717 and ICI-198,583 but a poor binding affinity for MTX and 10-EdAM. Binding affinities of the mFBP decreased in the order CB3717 greater than or equal to folic acid = ICI-198,583 greater than or equal to 5-CHO-THF much greater than MTX = 10-EdAM. Over 24 h, at 25 nM, [3H]folic acid uptake in L1210-B73 cells was found to proceed for more than 98% via the mFBP. Uptake of [3H]-5-CHO-THF, at 50 nM extracellular concentration, occurred via both the mFBP (81%) and the RF/MTX-carrier (19%). With respect to antifolates, the mFBP in L1210-B73 cells contributed for less than 30% in the uptake of [3H]MTX but was the predominant route (92%) in the uptake of [3H]ICI-198,583. Results from affinity and membrane transport observations were consistent with growth inhibition studies on L1210-B73 cells demonstrating that the mFBP played only a minor role in the cytotoxic effects of MTX or 10-EdAM. On the other hand, L1210-B73 cells were significantly more sensitive to CB3717 (220-fold) and ICI-198,583 (10-fold) than parental L1210 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Westerhof, G R', 'Jansen, G', 'van Emmerik, N', 'Kathmann, I', 'Rijksen, G', 'Jackman, A L', 'Schornagel, J H']","['Westerhof GR', 'Jansen G', 'van Emmerik N', 'Kathmann I', 'Rijksen G', 'Jackman AL', 'Schornagel JH']","['Department of Oncology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Formyltetrahydrofolates)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'N8VP1Y24AU (ICI 198583)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 65 cases included 56 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (86%) and 9 Hodgkin's disease (HD) (14%). The NHL could be classified into the following groups: Group I, small noncleaved cell lymphoma (20 cases); Group II, lymphoblastic lymphoma (17 cases); Group III, large cell lymphoma (17 cases); and miscellaneous (2 cases). There was no follicular lymphoma case. Immunohistochemical study on paraffin sections and/or frozen specimens in 47 cases of NHL showed that all the Group I cases belonged to B-cell neoplasm (17 of 17 cases); most of the Group II cases belonged to T-cell neoplasm (9 of 14 cases); and most of the Group III cases were peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTL) (8 of 16 cases), including 2 cases of Ki-1 lymphoma. The majority of childhood NHL belonged to high-grade malignancy with an aggressive clinical course (median survival time, 8 months). The EBV DNA could be detected from the tumor tissues in 4 of 6 PTL, but in none of the remaining 19 cases of NHL including 6 Burkitt's type lymphomas.

The apparent ATP-dependent multicatalytic proteinase activity decreased in the Me2SO-treated cells with ATP-dependent incorporation of [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate decreasing notably after Me2SO-treatment. This decrease in activity does not seem to arise from a cessation of cell-proliferation, because no significant changes in proteinase activity were observed under different culture conditions. Hydroxyapatite column chromatography was employed to analyze the form of multicatalytic proteinase. It was clearly demonstrated that the 26S form of the proteinase decrease in the differentiated cells relative to normal cells. Multicatalytic proteinase-associated proteins that bind to the proteinase in an ATP-dependent manner were purified on an anti-multicatalytic proteinase IgG conjugated column.

These results suggest that the decrease in multicatalytic proteinase-associated proteins that occurs upon cell-differentiation abolishes the ATP-dependent activity of the proteinase.","['Tsukahara, T', 'Sugita, H', 'Ishiura, S']","['Tsukahara T', 'Sugita H', 'Ishiura S']","['National Institute of Neuroscience, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Tokyo, Japan.']","['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Hydroxyapatites)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '12UHW9R67N (Isoflurophate)', '91D9GV0Z28 (Durapatite)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resistant cells (HL-60/MX2) retain sensitivity to the Vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, drugs that are typically associated with the classical multidrug resistance phenotype. Mitoxantrone accumulation and retention are equivalent in the sensitive and resistant cell types, suggesting that mitoxantrone resistance in HL-60/MX2 cells might be associated with an alteration in the type II DNA topoisomerases. We discovered that topoisomerase II catalytic activity in 1.0 M NaCl nuclear extracts from the HL-60/MX2 variant, as measured by the decatenation of Crithidia fasciculata kinetoplast DNA, was reduced 4- to 5-fold compared to that in the parental HL-60 cells. Total cellular topoisomerase II activity in HL-60/MX2 cells was only 50% lower than that in HL-60 cells, however, because the ""cytosolic fraction"" of the HL-60/MX2 nuclear preparation contained high levels of decatenating activity. Antisera to calf thymus topoisomerase II defined a distinctive immunoreactive pattern of topoisomerase II proteins in crude nuclear extracts from the HL-60/MX2 cells. Both alpha (170 kDa) and beta (180 kDa) forms of topoisomerase II were detected in the HL-60 cell extracts, but only the alpha form was detected in extracts from HL-60/MX2 cells. This finding was associated with the appearance of a new 160-kDa immunoreactive species in nuclear extracts from HL-60/MX2 but not HL-60 cells.

Replication-defective viral particles were obtained by transfection of vector DNA into the packaging cell line psi2 and were used to infect C6 rat glioma-derived cell lines in culture. The sensitivity of these cells to the toxic effects of the nucleoside analog ganciclovir was found to be significantly increased by transfer of the HSV-1 tk gene. The difference in sensitivity between infected and uninfected cells defined ganciclovir concentrations that could be used to selectively kill essentially all infected cells while sparing uninfected ones. C6 glioma cells introduced subcutaneously into nude mice were highly tumorigenic. Growth of tumors produced from C6-derived cells bearing the HSV-1 tk gene, but not parental C6 cells, could be inhibited by intraperitoneal administration of ganciclovir. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the thymidine kinase expressed by the HSV-1 ks gene in sensitizing brain tumor cells to the toxic effects of nucleoside analogs.

Since these three genes are active sites of rearrangement in precursor B cell neoplasms, it seemed that the recently discovered fourth TCR gene, delta, might be similarly rearranged. To investigate this possibility, a series of precursor B cell leukaemias was analysed for rearrangements at the delta chain gene locus, using probes of the variable, joining, and constant regions of the delta chain gene. The majority of precursor B cell ALLs in this series (25/32, 78%) showed rearrangement or deletion of one or more TCR delta genes. This contrasts sharply with a series of 16 mature B cell neoplasms (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) in which no TCR delta gene rearrangements were detected. An unusual TCR delta rearrangement, rarely observed in normal or neoplastic T cells, was seen in the majority (14/18) of precursor B cell ALLs with TCR delta rearrangements. In contrast to the utilization ov V delta 1 in T cell ALL, detailed restriction mapping of precursor B ALL revealed an incomplete rearrangement without involvement of J delta segments. Direct genomic sequencing was performed on one example and demonstrated a nonproductive V delta 2-D delta 2-D delta 3 recombination in this precursor B ALL. We conclude that the TCR delta chain gene is an active locus in precursor B cell neoplasia, involves an unusual type of rearrangement and provides a clonal tumour marker for diagnosis of precursor B ALL.","['Yano, T', 'Pullman, A', 'Andrade, R', 'Uppenkamp, M', 'de Villartay, J P', 'Reaman, G', 'Crush-Stanton, S', 'Cohen, D I', 'Raffeld, M', 'Cossman, J']","['Yano T', 'Pullman A', 'Andrade R', 'Uppenkamp M', 'de Villartay JP', 'Reaman G', 'Crush-Stanton S', 'Cohen DI', 'Raffeld M', 'Cossman J']","['Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incidence rates could not be calculated and so relative frequencies were analysed by the log-linear modelling method of Kaldor et al. (1990) with allowance made for regional variations in the ages and diagnostic groups of the children included in the study. Children of Asian (Indian sub-continent) and West Indian ethnic origin had similar patterns of incidence for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia to White Caucasians. There was a significant excess of Hodgkin's disease among Asian children compared with Caucasians with an estimated relative risk (RR) of 2.09; this excess was greatest in the 0-4 age group (RR = 6.67). There were significant deficits of Wilms' tumour and rhabdomyosarcoma among Asian children, each with a frequency around half that among Caucasians, whereas West Indians had a significant excess of Wilms' tumour (RR = 2.55). Asian and West Indian children each had a non-significant twofold RR for unilateral retinoblastoma. The results suggest that the incidence of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is associated with environmental determinants in the country of residence which are most likely to relate to lifestyle factors. The occurrence of retinoblastoma, Wilms' tumour and Hodgkin's disease in early childhood is apparently related more to ethnicity than to geographical location and may reflect genetic factors or environmental exposures specific to the lifestyle of particular ethnic groups.","['Stiller, C A', 'McKinney, P A', 'Bunch, K J', 'Bailey, C C', 'Lewis, I J']","['Stiller CA', 'McKinney PA', 'Bunch KJ', 'Bailey CC', 'Lewis IJ']","['University of Oxford, Department of Paediatrics, UK.']",,,PMC1977662,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physicochemical properties of this drug suggested that the high cytotoxic effect of F860191 could be related to its capacity to induce free radicals and to generate DNA breaks through its interaction with topoisomerase II.","['Nafziger, J', 'Auclair, C', 'Florent, J C', 'Guillosson, J J', 'Monneret, C']","['Nafziger J', 'Auclair C', 'Florent JC', 'Guillosson JJ', 'Monneret C']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Faculte des Sciences Pharmaceutiques et Biologiques, Paris, France.""]","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '107430-03-5 (moflomycin)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all patients but one (5/6), the delta rearrangement was accompanied by other immunoassociated gene rearrangements. Molecular size analysis revealed specific delta rearranged band(s) (19.5 kb-BamHI and/or 6.9 kb-EcoRI), as commonly detected in B-acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). All the patients with the delta rearranged band, however, had a germline configuration of J delta gene loci, suggesting a DD or V(D)D (probably V delta 2(D)D) pattern.

In order to see whether ICRF-154 and ICRF-193 affect cellular topoisomerase II in situ or not, we examined the effect of these drugs on etoposide (VP-16)-induced, topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breaks in RPMI 8402 cells by alkaline sedimentation analysis. When RPMI 8402 cells were exposed to VP-16 in the presence of ICRF-154 or ICRF-193 for 1 h, VP-16-induced DNA strand breaks were greatly inhibited by both ICRF compounds. In parallel with this observation, VP-16-induced growth inhibition was also reversed by ICRF-193. Exposure of cells to ICRF-154 resulted in a progressive accumulation of cells with 4C DNA content. Although mitotic index did not significantly increase, mitotic abnormalities were seen in cells exposed to ICRF-193 or ICRF-154: all mitotic cells exhibited early mitotic figures with fewer condensed and entangled chromosomes. The most sensitive phase of the cell cycle to ICRF-154 was the G2-M. ICRF-154 did not affect the spindle formation. However, abnormally oriented spindles were observed in drug-treated cells in parallel with the appearance of multinucleated cells. The results suggest that ICRF-154 and -193 inhibit topoisomerase II activity in RPMI 8402 cells, and this effect resulted in the appearance of cells in G2 and early M phase with fewer condensed and entangled chromosomes and of cells with multilobed nuclei.","['Ishida, R', 'Miki, T', 'Narita, T', 'Yui, R', 'Sato, M', 'Utsumi, K R', 'Tanabe, K', 'Andoh, T']","['Ishida R', 'Miki T', 'Narita T', 'Yui R', 'Sato M', 'Utsumi KR', 'Tanabe K', 'Andoh T']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']","['0 (Diketopiperazines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', ""21416-68-2 (4,4'-(1,2-dimethyl-1,2-ethanediyl)bis-2,6-piperazinedione)"", '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', 'QML51S42CD (1,2-bis(3,5-dioxopiperazin-1-yl)ethane)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retinoid action on gene regulation is mediated by three distinct nuclear retinoic acid receptor subtypes, RA receptors alpha, beta, and gamma. The existence of multiple RA receptors has raised the possibility that receptor subtype-specific retinoids with reduced side effects can be developed. To analyze the activity of retinoids at the molecular level, we used a receptor activation assay. RA and 22 retinoids were compared on the three receptor subtypes. We found the alpha receptor to be least sensitive to activation by RA and the gamma receptor to be most sensitive. Compared with RA, one of the retinoids showed increased activity for the alpha and beta receptors. Three retinoids revealed no gene activation activity and showed no antagonistic effects when assayed in the presence of RA. Surprisingly, several of the retinoids were efficient activators of the beta and gamma receptors but poor activators or nonactivators of the alpha receptor. Our data demonstrate that the three RA receptor subtypes have differential ligand activation specificities and that the design of receptor subtype-selective retinoids is possible.","['Lehmann, J M', 'Dawson, M I', 'Hobbs, P D', 'Husmann, M', 'Pfahl, M']","['Lehmann JM', 'Dawson MI', 'Hobbs PD', 'Husmann M', 'Pfahl M']","['Cancer Center, La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, California 92037.']","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)']","['CA32428/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50676/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK35083/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The calcium ionophore ionomycin and the tumor promoter thapsigargin stimulated leukotriene production and translocation of 5-lipoxygenase to the membrane. Both agents elicited prolonged rises in [Ca2+]i. Leukotriene C4 production associated with [Ca2+]i in cells stimulated with various concentrations of ionomycin and thapsigargin suggests that a threshold [Ca2+]i level of approximately 300-400 nM is required. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, both the ionomycin- and thapsigargin-induced rises in [Ca2+]i were transient, indicating that the prolonged [Ca2+]i elevation is due to an influx of extracellular Ca2+. Addition of EGTA to the external medium before, or at different times during, the treatment with ionomycin or thapsigargin instantaneously inhibited 5LO translocation and leukotriene synthesis, indicating that Ca2+ influx plays an essential role in 5LO membrane translocation and leukotriene synthesis.

In 226 of 261 patients who died with metastatic disease there were 25 cases of ILC, 195 cases of IDC, 4 cases of mixed IDC-ILC, and 2 cases of mucinous carcinoma. There was no statistically significant difference in frequency of metastases to common metastatic sites, such as the liver, bone, and pleura, with the exception of the lungs, in which IDC metastases prevailed (P less than 0.006). By contrast, a statistically highly significant prevalence of ILC metastases to the peritoneum/retroperitoneum, hollow viscera, internal genital organs, leptomeninges, and myocardium was found (P values of less than 0.006- less than 10(-6). The metastases to these sites were characterized by diffuse growth of neoplastic cells that infiltrated in a lymphoma or leukemia-like fashion. Such metastases may remain clinically silent for a long time, in spite of their extensiveness. The difference of metastatic pattern between ILC and IDC is insufficiently appreciated in most of the published studies on ILC.","['Lamovec, J', 'Bracko, M']","['Lamovec J', 'Bracko M']","['Department of Pathology, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Slovena, Yugoslavia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exercise-induced haemolysis has been implicated in the sub-optimal iron status of endurance-trained athletes. Accordingly, erythrocyte survival studies using 51Cr were performed on male and female distance runners (n = 20) and sedentary control subjects (n = 10) in order to determine whether the rate of erythrocyte destruction was altered as a consequence of repetitive exercise training. 2. The chromium half-disappearance time of the male (25.4 +/- 3.6 days, mean +/- SD) but not the female (28.3 +/- 4.6 days) athletes was significantly lower than that of the male (33.1 +/- 4.5 days) and female (32.3 +/- 2.6 days) control subjects (P less than 0.01). The mean erythrocyte lifespan of the male and female distance runners (67.2 +/- 22.2 and 72.4 +/- 26.0 days, respectively) was significantly shorter than that of the non-exercising male and female subjects (113.4 +/- 31.0 and 114.1 +/- 29.0 days, respectively) (P less than 0.01). 3. There was no correlation between the mean erythrocyte lifespan and the haemoglobin concentration, serum ferritin levels, body mass, weekly training distance, number of years running or daily protein intake. The mean cell volume and reticulocyte count measured in the same athletes before and after completing a standard 42 km marathon race were within the normal range, whereas the plasma haemoglobin levels were elevated (77.0 +/- 50.5 mg/l) and the serum haptoglobin levels were decreased (0.89 +/- 0.4 g/l) at rest, with a further significant decrease after running (0.69 +/- 0.4 g/l) in the latter measurement (P less than 0.05). 4. It is concluded that the demonstrated increase in erythrocyte turnover may be sufficient to precipitate an iron deficiency in endurance athletes when dietary intake or absorption does not meet the accelerated erythropoietic demands.","['Weight, L M', 'Byrne, M J', 'Jacobs, P']","['Weight LM', 'Byrne MJ', 'Jacobs P']","['University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre, South Africa.']","['0 (Haptoglobins)', '0 (Hemoglobins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 13 cases of early erythroid leukemias, we investigated whether erythropoietin (Epo) autocrine stimulation was responsible for the growth factor autonomy. Epo transcripts were detected by Northern blotting in cells from one patient. These cells also expressed an Epo receptor (1,000 receptors per cell) with a 420-pM affinity and Epo was detected in the supernatant of cultured cells. In 8 of the 13 cases, Epo transcripts were revealed by the polymerase chain reaction ranging from 0.5 to 500 copies per cell. In situ hybridization proved that these Epo transcripts were present in the blast cells. No Epo gene abnormalities were detected by Southern blotting. In two cases, leukemic cells were grown in the presence of Epo-neutralizing antibodies or Epo antisense oligomers. In one case, the antibody significantly reduced autonomous growth. In contrast, the antibody had no effect in the second case in which blast cells transcribed the Epo gene at a low level. However, Epo antisense oligomers partially inhibited autonomous growth. This inhibition was reversed by addition of exogenous Epo. Overall, these results suggest that an extracellular or intracellular autocrine Epo stimulation occurs in some cases of erythroid malignancies.","['Mitjavila, M T', 'Le Couedic, J P', 'Casadevall, N', 'Navarro, S', 'Villeval, J L', 'Dubart, A', 'Vainchenker, W']","['Mitjavila MT', 'Le Couedic JP', 'Casadevall N', 'Navarro S', 'Villeval JL', 'Dubart A', 'Vainchenker W']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U 91, Hopital Henri-Mondor, Creteil, France.']","['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,PMC295463,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reactive sera were also tested by recombinant immunoblotting assay to define the specificity of the results obtained by ELISA. Twelve cases (24%) were persistently positive (group A), 11 (22%) were transiently anti-HCV+ positive (group B), and 27 (54%) were negative.

The monocytic cell line THP-1 was used as a model system to study the production of a particular gelatinase. Upon stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) the cells differentiated to the adherent phenotype and produced significant amounts of a 96-kD gelatinase in a dose-dependent way. The secretion rate was maximal between 12 and 24 h after induction. Study of gelatinase mRNA steady state levels showed that the synthesis of THP-1 gelatinase is regulated by PMA at transcriptional or posttranscriptional levels. Stimulation of signal transduction pathways with other substances, including calcium ionophore A 23187, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and dexamethasone, were ineffective in inducing gelatinase mRNA or enzyme activity. However, THP-1 cells were responsive to the cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 beta, to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the lectin concanavalin A (Con A), the kinetics of gelatinase induction being similar to those of induction by PMA. The THP-1 cells did not synthesize and/or secrete detectable levels of IL-6 after stimulation with PMA, Con A, LPS, or IL-1 beta. The 96-kD monocytic THP-1 gelatinase was shown to be a neutral metalloproteinase that cross-reacted with hepatoma-derived and neutrophil gelatinases in immunoprecipitation experiments. The active enzyme produced by THP-1 cells consistently showed, however, a molecular mass different from that of normal granulocyte-, monocyte-, and tumor cell-derived gelatinases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Van Ranst, M', 'Norga, K', 'Masure, S', 'Proost, P', 'Vandekerckhove, F', 'Auwerx, J', 'Van Damme, J', 'Opdenakker, G']","['Van Ranst M', 'Norga K', 'Masure S', 'Proost P', 'Vandekerckhove F', 'Auwerx J', 'Van Damme J', 'Opdenakker G']","['Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, Belgium.']","['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', 'EC 3.4.23.1 (Pepsin A)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Gelatinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,['SWISSPROT/P14780'],,,,,,,,,,,

Cultivation of differentiated HL-60 cells with TNF induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in superoxide production following stimulation with f-Met-Leu-Phe. An increase in the respiratory burst response could be detected as early as 1 h, and was maximally enhanced at 24 h. TNF enhanced superoxide production by increasing the initial rate of production without altering the time over which HL-60 cells produced superoxide following f-Met-Leu-Phe stimulation. The dose-response to f-Met-Leu-Phe in TNF-primed cells demonstrated the same half-maximal and maximal concentrations of f-Met-Leu-Phe as seen in untreated cells.

When virus titration was performed, virus infectivity could be determined by the ELISA within 7 days after cultivation. The titer was similar to that obtained by the RIF test on 19 days after 3 subcultures.

Segal (Nature (1987) 326, 88-91) for purification of cytochrome b558 from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Spectral characteristics of cytochrome b558 were determined and found to be independent of cell type and specific heme b content of the preparation. To increase the sensitivity of the spectral assay, analysis in the gamma band were used and delta epsilon 427-413 was determined to be equal to 158 mM-1 cm-1. An alpha beta type heterodimeric cytochrome b558 was found for PMN and MN by the concordant elution of heme b spectral activity from heparin agarose and the detection of two polypeptide chains by SDS-PAGE. The expression of the lighter polypeptide alpha chain in the various human monocyte-like cell lines was assessed and its identity, as a component of cytochrome b, was confirmed by immunodetection using a rabbit polyclonal antibody reacting with the alpha subunit of PMN cytochrome b558. Immunoblotting studies detected the alpha subunit in monocyto-macrophagic differentiated HL-60 and U 937 cells and mature MN at 22 kDa, but not in uninduced cells which did not express the respiratory burst. Whatever the specific content or the cell origin of the cytochrome b558-enriched preparations, the heme b binding site was shown to be associated with the alpha subunit defined by a constant molecular mass of 22 kDa, as evidenced by the finding of a constant ratio between the silver stained band intensity and the corresponding heme b amount. The heavy polypeptide beta chain from MN cytochrome b was found to have a significantly higher molecular weight than the beta subunit from PMN at 94 +/- 5 kDa instead of 90 +/- 4 kDa. In contrast, in cytochrome b preparations from induced monocyto-macrophagic cells, isolated with a low heme specific content, the variability in the detection of the staining intensity of the beta band either in SDS-PAGE or immunodetection reactivities precludes accurate definition of its molecular mass and estimation of the stoichiometry between the alpha and beta subunits in the differentiated cells. However, wheat-germ agglutinin binding studies indicated the presence of N-glycosylated protein in the range of 85-110 kDa.","['Capeillere-Blandin, C', 'Masson, A', 'Descamps-Latscha, B']","['Capeillere-Blandin C', 'Masson A', 'Descamps-Latscha B']","['INSERM U 25, CNRS URA 122, Hopital Necker, Paris, France.']","['0 (Cytochrome b Group)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (heme receptor)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '9064-78-2 (cytochrome b558)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD45 is a transmembrane protein-tyrosine-phosphatase. An internal segment comprises two domains each of which is homologous to other protein-tyrosine-phosphatases; the extracellular segment has the hallmarks of a ligand-binding motif. Since tyrosine phosphorylation is an early signal resulting from stimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor and CD45 is required for proper activation through the receptor, we explored whether CD45 might be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Treatment of a T-cell leukemia line (Jurkat) with either phytohemagglutinin or anti-CD3 antibodies induced phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in CD45; treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not. Phosphorylation of CD45 was transient, disappearing within 40 min after phytohemagglutinin treatment. The requirement for stringent conditions of phosphatase inhibition suggests that CD45 is capable of autodephosphorylation in vivo. These observations support recent reports indicating CD45 is involved in an early step in the T-cell activation cascade. They also suggest that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues in CD45 should be explored further as a possible regulatory mechanism.","['Stover, D R', 'Charbonneau, H', 'Tonks, N K', 'Walsh, K A']","['Stover DR', 'Charbonneau H', 'Tonks NK', 'Walsh KA']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['AM07902/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07270/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM15731/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC52370,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ATP concentration required for equivalent activity in a DNA-unknotting assay is 2- to 8-fold higher in nuclear extracts from drug-resistant cell lines as compared with the parental line. When adenosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate is substituted for ATP in complex-formation assays, no significant change is seen with drug-sensitive cells, but a 50-65% reduction is seen with VM-26-resistant cells. Collectively, these results indicate that an alteration in ATP binding may be involved in the resistance phenotype. Therefore, we identified regions of the topoisomerase II sequence that conform to previously identified nucleotide-binding sites. Starting with cDNA as the template we determined the sequence of the topoisomerase II mRNA surrounding these sites by sequencing DNA fragments produced by the polymerase chain reaction. In the region corresponding to the consensus B ATP-binding sequence described by Walker et al. [Walker, J. E., Saraste, M., Runswick, M. J. & Gay, N. J. (1982) EMBO J. 1, 945-951], the cDNA from the two VM-26-resistant sublines contained an altered sequence having a G----A base change. This base substitution results in the replacement of the conserved arginine at position 449 with a glutamine. Hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides confirmed the presence of both the normal and the altered sequence in the resistant cell lines, whereas only the normal sequence was found in the sensitive CEM cells. A chemical mismatch cleavage procedure for the detection of mispaired bases in DNA duplexes identified no other alterations in the 5' third of the mRNA coding sequence, which contains the complete ATP-binding domain of topoisomerase II. The presence of mRNA encoding topoisomerase II with Gln449 correlates both with the presence of a topoisomerase II protein whose interaction with ATP is altered and with increased resistance to the cytotoxicity of VM-26.","['Bugg, B Y', 'Danks, M K', 'Beck, W T', 'Suttle, D P']","['Bugg BY', 'Danks MK', 'Beck WT', 'Suttle DP']","[""Department of Biochemical and Clinical Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]","['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']","['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47941/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC52360,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells contained monoclonally integrated, full length BLV provirus, indicating that each culture resulted from clonal expansion of a single cell. They expressed high levels of all BLV specific mRNAs and showed intracellular reactivity to antibodies directed to viral gag and env proteins. Viral particle morphogenesis was highly restricted as determined by low levels of reverse transcriptase activity in cell supernatants and the paucity of viral particles on the cell surface. Analysis of cellular antigenic determinants, using monoclonal antibodies to bovine leukocyte differentiation and major histocompatibility complex antigens, was inconclusive. Cytochemical, morphologic, and ultrastructural analyses were consistent with endothelial cells and they exhibited the distinctive functional capacity of endothelial cells derived from specialized postcapillary venules, which constitute sites of lymphocyte extravasation.

PML contains a cysteine-rich region present in a new family of apparent DNA-binding proteins that includes a regulator of the interleukin-2 receptor gene (Rpt-1) and the recombination-activating gene product (RAG-1). Accordingly, PML may represent a novel transcription factor or recombinase. The aberrant PML-RAR fusion product, while typically retinoic acid responsive, displays both cell type- and promoter-specific differences from the wild-type RAR alpha. Because patients with APL can be induced into remission with high dose RA therapy, we propose that the nonliganded PML-RAR protein is a new class of dominant negative oncogene product.

In this assay, clonal rearrangements are amplified from the DNA of diagnostic tumor specimens using a consensus V segment primer and a consensus J segment primer to which the promoter for T7 RNA polymerase has been appended. The PCR product from this amplification is transcribed into a radiolabeled RNA probe. Test RNA transcribed from the opposite DNA strand is synthesized by similar methods from TCRG genes of a subsequent biopsy specimen. The test RNA is hybridized with the probe, and mismatched nucleotide sequences in the RNA hybrids are digested by RNase A. Detection of fully protected probe by means of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography indicates the presence of malignant cells in the test specimen. Dilution experiments with DNA of cell lines from acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) show that detection of one tumor cell among 10(5) normal bone marrow cells is usually possible. Residual disease was also successfully detected in several cases of ALL during clinical remission, including detection in one case at the 10(-5) level. The procedure described here may provide a simplified and rapid method for the sensitive diagnosis and monitoring of lymphoid malignancies. This procedure should be applicable to most antigen receptor genes, and unlike most comparable methods, requires neither analysis of nucleotide sequence nor synthesis of tumor-specific oligonucleotide probes or primers.","['Veelken, H', 'Tycko, B', 'Sklar, J']","['Veelken H', 'Tycko B', 'Sklar J']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.""]","['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA Probes)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']","['CA 38621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GA 34183/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

When phorbol myristate acetate was used as a stimulus, the rates of superoxide production by dimethylsulphoxide and butyrate differentiated HL60 cells was not significantly different from those observed in neutrophils and monocytes isolated from normal peripheral blood. Similar results were obtained when luminol-dependent chemiluminescence was measured in the presence of horseradish peroxidase using phorbol myristate acetate as the stimulus. However, in the absence of horseradish peroxidase, the luminol-dependent chemiluminescence in the dimethylsulphoxide and butyrate-differentiated HL60 cells was significantly lower than that of the control cells isolated from human blood, reflecting the absence of myeloperoxidase in the differentiated cells. In contrast, HL60 cells differentiated by phorbol myristate acetate failed to show any increased generation of superoxide or luminol-dependent chemiluminescence upon stimulation. Impaired release of lysosomal enzymes by the chemically differentiated cells suggests impairments in the extent of differentiation resulting in cells with defective azurophilic degranulation processes.

OND, a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist which is used as an anti-emetic during chemotherapy, was not found to be cytotoxic in the co-cultures at concentrations as high as 100 microM. Since OND has been particularly useful in relieving vomiting induced by cisplatin (cisPt) chemotherapy, we also examined the effect of cisPt on K562 cells in the presence and absence of OND, and found no evidence that OND significantly enhances the cytotoxic effect of cisPt on these cells alone or in co-cultures with induced HepG2 cells. The induced HepG2 co-culture system uses cells of human origin and clearly has considerable potential for examining the effects of drugs and their metabolites on indicator cells derived from a tissue of choice.

Cells infected by ecotropic MuLV synthesize envelope protein, gp70, which binds to this receptor, thereby preventing additional infections. The consequences of envelope-MuLV receptor binding for the infected host cell have not been directly determined, partly because the cellular function of the MuLV receptor protein is unknown. Here we report a coincidence in the positions of the first eight putative membrane-spanning domains found in the virus receptor and in two related proteins, the arginine and histidine permeases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fig. 1), but not in any other proteins identified by computer-based sequence comparison of the GenBank data base.

Previously, we have shown that the topoisomerase II from HL-60/AMSA is also resistant to inhibition by amsacrine and other intercalating agents. We therefore sought the molecular basis for the resistance of the topoisomerase II of HL-60/AMSA and, by inference, of the HL-60/AMSA line itself. We report the cloning and sequencing of the topoisomerase II genes from both the sensitive and resistant leukemia cell lines using polymerase chain reaction technology. We have identified a single base change associated with the drug-resistant form of topoisomerase II. This mutation is present in both cloned HL-60/AMSA complementary DNA and extracted HL-60/AMSA genomic DNA. A rapid assay for this mutation in clinical samples has been developed and applied to the DNA of cells from both normal volunteers and leukemia patients. Thus far, the HL-60/AMSA genotype has not been identified in the cells from any individual, suggesting that this genotype is indeed a mutation and not an allelic form of topoisomerase II. The novel assay developed will allow a rapid search for the prevalence of this mutation in clinical samples from patients with leukemia who have relapsed following intercalator therapy.","['Hinds, M', 'Deisseroth, K', 'Mayes, J', 'Altschuler, E', 'Jansen, R', 'Ledley, F D', 'Zwelling, L A']","['Hinds M', 'Deisseroth K', 'Mayes J', 'Altschuler E', 'Jansen R', 'Ledley FD', 'Zwelling LA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",['CA40090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effects of various compounds on growth and differentiation of these cells. Megakaryocytic differentiation of C1 cells was not induced by cytokines that stimulate megakaryocytic maturation of normal progenitor cells, such as interleukin 3 and 6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. However, the cells were induced to differentiate into megakaryocytes by treatment with some protein kinase inhibitors. The inhibition of v-abl tyrosine kinase activity preceded induction of differentiation of the cells treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as genistein, herbimycin A, and erbstatin. Treatment of C1 cells with a v-abl antisense oligomer inhibited their proliferation and induced acetylcholinesterase activity, a typical marker of megakaryocytic differentiation. These results suggest that inhibition of v-abl function is associated with induction of megakaryocytic differentiation of C1 cells. Among the compounds tested, 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), a potent inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-dependent and Ca(2+)-phospholipid-dependent (protein kinase C) protein kinases, was the most potent inducer of differentiation of C1 cells. However, the differentiation-inducing effect of H-7 was unlikely to be mediated through inhibition of protein kinase C or cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases, because other types of inhibitors of these kinases were not effective, and a protein kinase activator (phorbol ester) induced differentiation of C1 cells. Moreover, neither v-abl mRNA expression nor v-abl kinase activity in C1 cells was affected by treatment with H-7. These findings indicate that induction of megakaryocytic differentiation by H-7 is not related to inhibition of v-abl kinase, but rather to some novel function of H-7.","['Honma, Y', 'Okabe-Kado, J', 'Kasukabe, T', 'Hozumi, M', 'Kajigaya, S', 'Suda, T', 'Miura, Y']","['Honma Y', 'Okabe-Kado J', 'Kasukabe T', 'Hozumi M', 'Kajigaya S', 'Suda T', 'Miura Y']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']","['0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)']",,,,['v-abl'],,,,,,,,,,

The component of dose due to pure radon is dependent on the fat content of the marrow, since the solubility of radon in fat is about 16 times that in tissue. The mean dose equivalent muSv to the total active marrow is estimated for a range of fat cell diameters from 25 to 200 microns, taking account of the percentage cellularity and distribution of active marrow as a function of age. Similarly, the dose due to the inhalation of short-lived radon daughters was estimated, based on measurements in blood and marrow, modified to allow for the greater deposition of daughter products expected in children. An estimate of the age-dependent dose from long-lived radon daughters was made from uranium miner and natural exposure data. Dose estimates were made for the average UK indoor exposure to radon gas of 20 Bq/m3 and an equilibrium equivalent thoron concentration of 0.3 Bq/m3. The annual radon and thoron derived dose to the active marrow of the newborn was calculated as 30 and 40 muSv, respectively. For a 10-year-old child, the radon and thoron derived annual dose are 70 and 40 muSv, and for a 40-year-old adult 90 and 30 muSv, respectively. The above values exhibit wide range limits due principally to uncertainties in the accumulation of 210Pb in bone, and 210Po in marrow. These data indicate that at the average UK exposure, the alpha-particle dose to active marrow is dominated by that derived from inhaled radon and thoron compared with dietary intake. In infants the dose is dominated by thoron daughters. At the UK radon Action Limit of 200 Bq/m3, the radon and associated thoron derived dose is similar to that from all low LET sources. This work shows that the dose to red bone marrow from radon and thoron is significant, and that the possibility of leukaemia induced by these radiation sources warrants further investigation.","['Richardson, R B', 'Eatough, J P', 'Henshaw, D L']","['Richardson RB', 'Eatough JP', 'Henshaw DL']","['H.

In addition, both agents demonstrate antiproliferative activity against human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells in culture. Treatment of log-phase Daudi cells with doses of 6 U/ml of IFN or 1 mM DFMO resulted in a 50% reduction of cell number 72 h after drug addition. Combination of IFN with DFMO against DAUDI cells using the isobologram method showed that the two demonstrate true antiproliferative synergy. Analysis of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2,5A) activity in treated cells showed that both IFN alone and IFN/DFMO combination result in equivalent 2,5A induction (1800 mmol/mg/20 h) compared to control (300 mmol/mg/20 h). While 2,5A activity decreased by 50% at 48 h in cells after treatment with IFN alone, the IFN/DFMO combination remained elevated (1700 mmol/mg/20 h). Phosphodiesterase (PdE) activity in these cells showed no substantial changes with IFN, DFMO, or IFN/DFMO treatment over 72 h compared to control values. In contrast, the activity of the 68-kDa interferon induced protein kinase (PK) in IFN/DFMO-treated cells was 1.6-fold greater at 48 and 72 h than that found for IFN alone. These studies demonstrate that the synergistic antiproliferative activity of IFN/DFMO combination may be due, in part, to modification of the activity of IFN-inducible enzymes.","['Rosenblum, M G']",['Rosenblum MG'],"['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, University of Texas System, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']","['0 (Interferon Type I)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)"", 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Open non-randomized study of 148 consecutive patients referred to the Charing Cross Hospital between 1979 and 1989. SETTING: Trophoblastic disease centre in a London teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: 148 consecutive patients with high risk GTT were treated with the EMA/CO regimen. 76 patients had received no prior chemotherapy and 72 had received prior chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival, causes of treatment failure and toxicity were analysed. RESULTS: Of 76 patients who had received no prior chemotherapy, 62 (82%) are in remission; an overall survival of 85% for the 148 patients. Ten of the 76 patients without prior chemotherapy died from extensive disease within 3 weeks of starting chemotherapy. The complete and partial response rates to EMA/CO chemotherapy were 80% and 18% respectively. The addition of cisplatin salvaged 9 of 11 (82%) who developed drug resistance and did not require surgery. Salvage surgery alone resulted in 7 of 8 (87%) having complete remissions. Relapse after EMA/CO chemotherapy is uncommon (5.4%) but survival is still relatively good with further chemotherapy and/or surgery with 6 (75%) of 8 patients obtaining a further sustained remission. Complications from EMA/CO chemotherapy are acceptable with myelosuppression being dose-limiting. Late sequelae are uncommon: menstruation usually returns with a few months, and no fetal abnormalities have been recorded in subsequent pregnancies. One patient developed what we presume to be a therapy-induced acute myeloid leukaemia. CONCLUSION: At present EMA/CO chemotherapy is our treatment of choice for patients with high risk GTT. Its toxicity is predictable and reversible. In patients developing drug resistance, salvage surgery is important. Future developments may include further dose intensification with the addition of haemopoietic growth factors, earlier diagnosis and the separation of gestational from non-gestational trophoblastic tumours.","['Newlands, E S', 'Bagshawe, K D', 'Begent, R H', 'Rustin, G J', 'Holden, L']","['Newlands ES', 'Bagshawe KD', 'Begent RH', 'Rustin GJ', 'Holden L']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Charing Cross Hospital, London.']","['1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'EMA-CO protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All 7 astrocytomas were supratentorial, with 6 occurring in the diencephalon. Five of the seven patients with astrocytomas survived more than 5 years. The 6 primitive neuroectodermal tumors were located equally between the supra- and infratentorial spaces. Four of the 6 infants with these tumors received chemotherapy (2 received chemotherapy alone; 2 received chemotherapy and radiation therapy) and are tumor free 2 to 9 years later. A fifth child received radiation therapy alone early in the series and survived only 4 months. The family of the other child refused adjunctive treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Haddad, S F', 'Menezes, A H', 'Bell, W E', 'Godersky, J C', 'Afifi, A K', 'Bale, J F']","['Haddad SF', 'Menezes AH', 'Bell WE', 'Godersky JC', 'Afifi AK', 'Bale JF']","['Division of Neurosurgery, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The contributions of the viral regulatory proteins Tax and Rex during clinical latency and disease are incompletely understood. To learn about Rex expression in the host, we used a sensitive immunoprecipitation assay to detect Rex antibodies throughout the course of BLV infection in sheep. Sixty percent of the infected animals produced Rex antibodies in intermittent episodes. This pattern differed markedly from that of antibodies to virion structural proteins, which were maintained in all animals throughout infection. Only one of two animals that developed tumors had detectable Rex antibodies at the time, although the other had previously demonstrated an especially strong Rex antibody response. We examined the Rex response in the context of BLV infection by comparing it with the frequency of circulating mononuclear blood cells that could transcribe BLV RNA or produce infectious virus. Episodes of Rex antibody occurrence followed some but not all increases in the number of BLV-transcribing cells. Since the appearance of circulating antibodies requires that the intracellular Rex protein be available to serve as antigen, the episodic pattern of occurrence of Rex antibodies could result from intermittent killing by virus-specific cytotoxic cells. Fluctuations in titer that were observed during some episodes of Rex response could be due to antibody retention by antigen present in lymphoid tissue.","['Powers, M A', 'Grossman, D', 'Kidd, L C', 'Radke, K']","['Powers MA', 'Grossman D', 'Kidd LC', 'Radke K']","['Department of Avian Sciences, University of California, Davis 95616-8532.']","['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)']","['CA-46374/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07377/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC248958,,['Rex'],,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrated that the relaxation of SV40 DNA plasmids by type I DNA topoisomerase prepared from P388 murine leukemia cells was inhibited by 50% by SN-38 at approximately 1 microM, although CPT-11 at 1 mM slightly inhibited the relaxation. SN-38 and CPT showed strong, time-dependent inhibitory activity against DNA synthesis of P388 cells. However, CPT-11 weakly inhibited DNA synthesis independently of time with coincident inhibition of the total thymidine uptake by the cells. By alkaline and neutral elution assays, it was demonstrated that SN-38 caused much more frequent DNA single-strand breaks in P388 cells than did CPT-11. The same content of SN-38 and a similar frequency of single-strand breaks were detected in the cells treated with SN-38 at 0.1 microM or with CPT-11 at 100 microM. Therefore, single-strand breaks by CPT-11 seem to be due to SN-38 produced from CPT-11 in cells. These results indicate that CPT-11 itself possesses a marginal antiproliferative effect but that SN-38 plays an essential role in the mechanism of action of CPT-11.","['Kawato, Y', 'Aonuma, M', 'Hirota, Y', 'Kuga, H', 'Sato, K']","['Kawato Y', 'Aonuma M', 'Hirota Y', 'Kuga H', 'Sato K']","['Exploratory Research Laboratories 1, Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proportion of shedders was 13.1 to 16.7% in the AS line in 1984-88, 16.3% in the ASS line in 1984 (before culling of the shedders), and 6.1% and 6.6% in the AC line in 1984 and 1988, respectively. 3.

In the ASS line (1984 only), the differences between shedders and non-shedders were in the same direction, but in magnitude greater for rate of lay and smaller for oviposition interval. 4. The shedders were favoured by the artificial selection because of their shorter oviposition interval and this appeared to be responsible for the higher levels of ALV shedding in the selection lines.","['Yoo, B H', 'Sheldon, B L']","['Yoo BH', 'Sheldon BL']","['CSIRO Division of Animal Production, Blacktown, NSW, Australia.']","['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The differentiating leukemic cells could be rescued from apoptosis by a hematopoietic growth factor such as interleukin-3 (IL-3) and by the tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetra-decanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), but not by the nonpromoting phorbol ester 4-alpha-TPA. IL-3 and TPA rescued differentiating myeloid leukemic cells by different pathways and also rescued normal myeloid precursor cells from apoptosis. The rescue of differentiating leukemic and normal myeloid cells by IL-3 or TPA was blocked by amiloride inhibitors of the Na+/H+ antiporter.

We have studied the operation of this pathway during the early stages of retionic acid (RA)-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL60 myeloid leukemia cells. The autonomous breakdown of inositol lipids that occurred in HL60 cells labeled with [3H] inositol was completely abolished following 48 hours of RA treatment. The rate of influx of 45Ca2+ was also significantly decreased at 48 hours, consistent with the role of inositol lipid-derived second messengers in regulating Ca2+ entry into cells. The downregulation of inositol lipid metabolism clearly preceded the onset of reduced proliferation induced by RA treatment, and was therefore not a consequence of decreased cell growth. The generation of InsPs in RA-treated cells was reactivated by the fluoroaluminate ion, a direct activator of guanine nucleotide-binding protein(s) (G proteins) that regulate the inositol lipid signalling pathway. Subtle alterations to a regulatory mechanism may therefore mediate the RA-induced downregulation of this pathway. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the autonomous generation of inositol lipid-derived second messengers may contribute to the continuous proliferation of HL60 cells, and that the RA-induced downregulation of this pathway may, in turn, play a role in signalling the cessation of proliferation that preceedes granulocytic differentiation.","['Porfiri, E', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Wickremasinghe, R G']","['Porfiri E', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Wickremasinghe RG']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']","['0 (Calcium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '21330-18-7 (fluoroaluminum)', '284SYP0193 (Fluorine)', '4L6452S749 (Inositol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'CPD4NFA903 (Aluminum)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 4.6.1.13 (Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Purification of the leukemic granulocytes by density gradient centrifugation revealed three neutrophil and neutrophil precursor populations with different densities. Comparison of cell morphology and density showed that cell density increased with increasing maturity. The control dog possessed only one neutrophil population, with a density greater than 1.077. Analysis of cellular contents of the granular enzymes, elastase, myeloperoxidase and lysozyme showed that leukemic neutrophils were quantitatively markedly different from normal neutrophils with respect to enzyme activities. There were no major differences between leukemic and normal cells as regards aggregatory and migratory responses to different stimuli. The phagocytic capacity of the leukemic cells, however, was dramatically increased compared with the control, and exceeded all previously encountered responses in the assay employed. In a similar fashion, superoxide generation and secretion of elastase and lysozyme in response to zymosan and phorbol myristate acetate were substantially higher than in the control dog. Priming of cell function to a level exceeding that normally attainable in neutrophils appears to have taken place in peripheral blood of the leukemic dog. The only endogenous mediator known to prime neutrophil functions to the extent seen in the present case is the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is intimately involved in regulation of myelopoiesis in mammals. On the basis of the enzymological and functional findings in the leukemic dog, we hypothesize that a lactoferrin deficiency in leukemic neutrophils leads to enhanced GM-CSF synthesis, which is ultimately the cause of the observed cellular hyperresponsiveness and contributes to the monocytosis seen in the patient.","['Thomsen, M K', 'Jensen, A L', 'Skak-Nielsen, T', 'Kristensen, F']","['Thomsen MK', 'Jensen AL', 'Skak-Nielsen T', 'Kristensen F']","['Department of Pharmacology, Leo Pharmaceutical Products, Ballerup, Denmark.']","['11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.36 (Pancreatic Elastase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The EC50 for LTC4 to elicit the half maximum accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates (IPs) was around 20 nM. The increase in the formation of [3H]inositol bisphosphate (IP2) and [3H]inositol trisphosphate (IP3) was detectable at 2 min after the stimulation and progressed up to 30 min. Accumulation of [3H]inositol monophosphate (IP1) was observed only during the late phase of 5-30 min in the presence of LiCl. When cells were stimulated with LTC4 and LTD4 together, there was no additive accumulation in [3H]IPs. Pretreatment of cells with either LTC4 or LTD4 resulted in a decrease in production of [3H]IPs on further stimulation with the same agonist. The desensitization appeared to be heterologous since pretreatment of cells with LTC4 attenuated the responsiveness to LTD4. Conversely, pretreatment with LTD4 also diminished the responsiveness to LTC4 markedly. These results suggest that both LTC4- and LTD4-induced hydrolysis of phosphoinositides are mediated through the same effector in RBL-1 cells.","['Chau, L Y', 'Hsu, Y S', 'Sun, G Y']","['Chau LY', 'Hsu YS', 'Sun GY']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']","['0 (Borates)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (SRS-A)', '0 (serine-borate complex)', '15421-51-9 (inositol 1-phosphate)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '47055-78-7 (inositol 1,4-bis(phosphate))', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', '9FN79X2M3F (Lithium)', 'G4962QA067 (Lithium Chloride)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, an effect of prostaglandins (PGs) on the activity of this enzyme has not been demonstrated previously. In this study, we found that PGE1 could stimulate PLD in human erythroleukemia cells, as measured by phosphatidylethanol formation, with an ED50 of 3.5 x 10(-7) M. PGE2 was also active, but other PGs including prostacyclin, PGD2 and PGF2, had no effect. PGE1 also elicited cyclic AMP production over the same concentration range that activated PLD. However, it is unlikely that cyclic AMP per se is responsible for PGE-induced PLD activation, because PLD could be substantially activated by PGE2 at concentrations (0.1-1 microM) which did not stimulate cyclic AMP production. Furthermore, no increase of phosphatidylethanol formation could be observed when cells were treated with other adenylyl cyclase-activating agents such as prostacyclin, forskolin and vasoactive intestinal peptide. In Ca+(+)-free medium, PLD activation by PGE1 and PGE2 was greatly reduced, indicating that their effect was through a Ca+(+)-dependent pathway. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin abolished PGE1- and PGE2-stimulated PLD activity, implying the involvement of a G protein in the PGE-mediated signal transduction pathway. Our results not only indicate that E-series PGs may initiate some of their cellular effects through a novel pathway, activation of PLD, but also suggest that PGE-stimulated PLD activity in human erythroleukemia cells is Ca+(+)-dependent and is regulated via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein.","['Wu, H', 'Turner, J T', 'Halenda, S P']","['Wu H', 'Turner JT', 'Halenda SP']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of Missouri-Columbia.']","['0 (Glycerophospholipids)', '0 (Phosphatidic Acids)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)', '0 (phosphatidylethanol)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']","['DE07389/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HL38406/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myeloablative consolidation treatment with ABMT in second CR is thought to benefit ""high risk"" patients thus allowing the escalation of cytoreductive treatment into a lethal range. In three patients with relapsed ALL bone marrow was collected in the very early second remission phase. The autografts were incubated with a panel of monoclonal antibodies bound to magnetobeads (DYNABEADS M450). The pretransplant regimen consisted of total body irradiation (TBI) (14.4 Gy) and cyclophosphamide (CY) (50 mg/kg b.w. x4). Following autologous transplantation of those immunomagnetobead purged marrow grafts, complete hematologic reconstitution was seen in all three patients. They are alive and disease-free for +26, +24 and +17 months post transplant, which is also proven by the absence of detectable gene rearrangements after transplantation. In two of them disease-free survival exceeds the duration of the preceding remission y 20 and 12 months respectively, which is a definitive parameter for therapy effectiveness. Therefore, ""high dose"" consolidation treatment in very early second CR followed by autologous transplantation of purged bone marrow seems to allow long-term disease-free survival.

Using acridine orange staining, we found that the RNA content of the cells also decreased following differentiation. Stathmokinetic analysis of HL-60 cell populations following dbcAMP treatment showed no effect on the total number of cells in the G0/G1 or S phases, or the rate of progression of cells through these cell cycle compartments. In contrast, dbcAMP was found to induce a transient arrest of the cells in the G2 phase. We also found that differentiation induced by dbcAMP did not require progression of the cells through the cell cycle. Cells arrested in either G1/S by hydroxyurea or G2 + M by colcemid eventually expressed markers of mature granulocytes. These results demonstrate that dbcAMP modulates cell cycle progression.

The expression of erythropoietin receptor on the cell membrane of the progenitor cells is a critical event during the erythroid differentiation process. In order to clarify the tissue-specific and differentiation stage-specific expression of the erythropoietin receptor gene, its transcriptional regulation was examined by transient expression assay, gel mobility shift assay and DNase I footprinting. The results clearly showed that GATA-1 transactivates the gene expression through a single GATA motif located around -200 bp upstream from the ATG codon in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, Northern blot analysis revealed that erythropoietin receptor-mediated signals strongly enhanced GATA-1 gene expression in accordance with the appearance of hemoglobin-positive cells. Taken together with other observations, these results suggested the following scheme of erythroid differentiation: 1)GATA-1 is expressed in the early stage of blood cell development; 2) GATA-1 transactivates the erythropoietin receptor gene; 3) erythropoietin binds its receptor and the receptor-mediated signals enhance GATA-1 gene expression in erythroid progenitor cells; and 4) GATA-1 finally transactivates hemoglobin synthesis-related genes and globin genes in relatively matured erythroid cells.","['Chiba, T', 'Ikawa, Y', 'Todokoro, K']","['Chiba T', 'Ikawa Y', 'Todokoro K']","['Tsukuba Life Science Center, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Ibaraki, Japan.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",,PMC328472,,"['EpoR', 'GATA-1']",,,,,,,,,,

By isolating both normal myl and APL myl/RAR alpha cDNAs, we showed that the myl/RAR alpha mRNA encodes for a putative fusion protein with a molecular weight of about 103 kDa, which is made up of 530 amino acids derived from the myl N-terminus and 402 amino acids originating from the RAR alpha C-terminus. The protein includes the RAR alpha DNA and retinoid-binding regions but lacks the A portion of the N-terminal region (A/B region) which is thought to contain one of the RAR alpha transactivation domains. The myl/RAR alpha protein acted as a retinoid-inducible transcription factor with both ligand-independent repressor and ligand-dependent activator functions in transactivation experiments of a retinoic acid-responsive gene. Myl/RAR alpha exerted this dual function three times more effectively than RAR alpha and had about 10-fold greater affinity for RA than RAR alpha. Comparison of myl/RAR alpha genomic and cDNA sequences from the same case demonstrated that both chromosome 15 and 17 breakpoints occurred within introns and the myl and RAR alpha sequences are spliced in the same polyadenylated RNA.","['Pandolfi, P P', 'Grignani, F', 'Alcalay, M', 'Mencarelli, A', 'Biondi, A', 'LoCoco, F', 'Grignani, F', 'Pelicci, P G']","['Pandolfi PP', 'Grignani F', 'Alcalay M', 'Mencarelli A', 'Biondi A', 'LoCoco F', 'Grignani F', 'Pelicci PG']","['Istituto Clinica Medica I, University of Perugia, Policlinico Monteluce, Italy.']","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '141911-69-5 (my1 protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect is specific, as none of the protein tyrosine phosphatases alters transcriptional activation by either the estrogen receptor, GAL4, or a GAL4-VP16 fusion protein.

The present study has used a human colonic epithelial cell line to examine mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Acute addition of mixed mast cell mediators (as a lysate of rat basophilic leukemia cells) to epithelial cells led to prompt and sustained chloride secretion. The response was partially inhibitable by an antihistaminic drug and an adenosine antagonist, suggesting that histamine, adenosine, and possibly other mediators are responsible for producing the acute effect. Supernatants from immunologically activated rat basophilic leukemia cells had similar effects. Chronic exposure of epithelial cells to the lysate mediator preparation, followed by washing, had no effect on their basal electrical or electrolyte-transporting properties. However, the chloride secretory response of the cells to subsequent addition of vasoactive intestinal peptide, carbachol, and heat-stable enterotoxin of Escherichia coli was significantly enhanced, whereas responses to an adenosine agonist or PGE1 were unaffected. This study has, therefore, demonstrated two ways in which mast cell mediators can directly influence intestinal epithelial cells to secrete more chloride and, hence, to enhance fluid secretion in the gut.

Of the cells in a RadLV-induced lymphoma, 0.3% were large macrophages packed with infected lymphoma cells. These thymic lymphoma macrophages (TLM) also ingested RadLV-induced lymphoma cells in vitro. Cultured RadLV-induced lymphoma lines could activate and fix C3 fragments through the alternative complement pathway (ACP). C3-bound lymphoma cells elicited an oxidative burst (OB) response in TLM but not in bone-marrow macrophages (BMM). However, IL4 treatment of BMM rendered them capable of responding with an OB following triggering by C3-opsonized cells. Thymic macrophages (TM) responded moderately with OB to C3-opsonized cells and this response was elevated if the TMs were treated by rIL4. The OB reaction of the TLMs could be partially inhibited by anti-LFA-I or anti-MALA-2 antibodies, and was completely inhibited by anti-CR3 antibodies.

In autologous BMT, the negative effect on platelet recovery was present in patients with lymphomas, but absent in patients with acute leukemias. Patients with acute leukemias had a very delayed recovery of platelets and granulocytes after autologous BMT, irrespective of the CMV status, probably due to the original stem cell disorder.

Reported here are three aspects of tiazofurin induction of myeloid differentiation in HL60 human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. First, inductive efficacy was evaluated for analogues ara-tiazofurin, xylo-tiazofurin, and selenazofurin, for dinucleotide anabolites thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD) and selenazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (SAD), and for a phosphodiesterase-resistant TAD analogue, beta-methylene TAD. The results showed that the parent compounds are more effective inducers than the dinucleotide derivatives and that the selenazole analogues are more effective inducers than the thiazole compounds. Second, HL60 cell induction by tiazofurin was shown to be synergistic with that produced by the antiviral agent ribavirin. Finally, tiazofurin was found to induce expression of a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-sensitive Fc gamma-receptor III (FcRIII) on HL60 cells, a feature consistent with neutrophilic, but not monocytic, differentiation.","['Goldstein, B M', 'Leary, J F', 'Farley, B A', 'Marquez, V E', 'Levy, P C', 'Rowley, P T']","['Goldstein BM', 'Leary JF', 'Farley BA', 'Marquez VE', 'Levy PC', 'Rowley PT']","['Department of Biophysics, University of Rochester School of Medicine, NY 14642.']","['49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C)', 'EC 4.6.1.13 (Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",['CA-45145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of costimulants, rhIL-7 stimulated the in vitro proliferation and colony formation of freshly isolated leukemic blasts from six to eight T-lineage ALL patients with a mean plating efficiency of 196 +/- 53 (background subtracted) colonies/10(5) blasts plated. Stimulation of T-lineage ALL blasts with rhIL-7 resulted in markedly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of six distinct phosphoproteins with molecular weights of 57, 72, 98, 123, 150, and 190 Kd, and induced a rapid increase in the production of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3), which was inhibitable by the tyrosine-specific protein kinase inhibitor genistein, but not by the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase C inhibitor H7. Similarly, rhIL-7 stimulated Ins-1,4,5-P3 production in CEM-1.3 T-lineage ALL cells and this stimulation was inhibitable by the tyrosine-specific protein kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A, but not by H-7. Thus, the transmembrane signal triggered by engagement of the IL-7R is intimately linked to a functional tyrosine-specific protein kinase pathway and stimulates the phosphoinositide (PI) turnover and proliferation of T-lineage ALL blasts. The presented data confirm and extend previous studies on the expression of functional IL-7R on T-lineage ALL blasts and support the hypothesis that IL-7 may play an important regulatory role in the biology of T-lineage ALL.","['Dibirdik, I', 'Langlie, M C', 'Ledbetter, J A', 'Tuel-Ahlgren, L', 'Obuz, V', 'Waddick, K G', 'Gajl-Peczalska, K', 'Schieven, G L', 'Uckun, F M']","['Dibirdik I', 'Langlie MC', 'Ledbetter JA', 'Tuel-Ahlgren L', 'Obuz V', 'Waddick KG', 'Gajl-Peczalska K', 'Schieven GL', 'Uckun FM']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, Minneapolis 55455.']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']","['R01 CA-42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-51425/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA-42111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects and their time-dependences are correlated with those on cell growth parameters previously published (Just G and Holler E, Cancer Res 49: 7072-7078, 1989). The effects of cis-DDP are strong and irreversible, whereas those of trans-DDP are marginal and reversible, in parallel with similar effects on cell growth parameters. Concentrations of nucleoside 5'-di- and 5'-triphosphates increase in parallel with cellular DNA and protein content by three- to four-fold after 60 hr of treatment. The nucleoside monophosphates dAMP, dGMP and dTMP reveal concentration maxima during exponential cell growth that are two- to six-fold higher than in the control cultures. Levels of cyclic AMP, adenosine(5')tetraphospho(5')adenosine (Ap4A) and CDP rise three- to five-fold above those in the control cultures within a few hours of the start of treatment. The level of coenzyme NAD+ falls below that of the control, concomitantly with an arrest of cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and with the appearance of giant cells. Due to the high reactivity of cis-DDP and the continuous concentration increase during the treatment, purine nucleoside 5'-triphosphates provide a possibility for the acquisition of resistance to cis-DDP. The correlation of responses of metabolically and regulatory active nucleotides with biological effects suggests their function in antitumorigenesis.","['Just, G', 'Holler, E']","['Just G', 'Holler E']","['Institut fur Biophysik und physikalische Biochemie, Universitat Regensburg, Germany.']","['0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '14913-33-8 (transplatin)', '5542-28-9 (diadenosine tetraphosphate)', '63-38-7 (Cytidine Diphosphate)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sindbis virus was significantly more sensitive than MCMV. The inactivated MCMV, when used to infect cells, was incapable of synthesizing early or late viral antigens. In addition to this direct virucidal effect, when hypericin was added to cells infected with viable MCMV, inhibition was also observed, particularly when the compound was added in the first two hours of infection. Again the antiviral effect was augmented by visible light. At effective antiviral concentrations, there were no discernible adverse effects on cultured cells. Thus hypericin appears to have two modes of antiviral activity: one directed at the virions, possibly on membrane components (although other virion targets cannot be ruled out), and the other directed at virus-infected cells. Both activities are substantially enhanced by light. Other recent studies on the antiviral activities of hypericin have not considered the role of light, and it is conceivable that apparent discrepancies between their results may have reflected different conditions of light exposure.","['Hudson, J B', 'Lopez-Bazzocchi, I', 'Towers, G H']","['Hudson JB', 'Lopez-Bazzocchi I', 'Towers GH']","['Division of Medical Microbiology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']","['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '5QD5427UN7 (Perylene)', '7V2F1075HD (hypericin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that increased transcription and expression of the gene for the Na+/H+ antiporter precedes phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced HL60 cell differentiation. PMA increased steady-state Na+/H+ antiporter mRNA levels approximately 50-fold within 8 h (at which time less than 15% of cells had differentiated). This increase was due to an increased transcriptional rate as determined by nuclear run on. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled Na+/H+ antiporter using an antiporter fusion protein antibody (RP1-c28) showed an equivalent increase in Na+/H+ antiporter protein synthesis. The synthetic diacylglycerol, 1-oleolyl-2-acetylglycerol, an activator of protein kinase C, which unlike PMA did not cause differentiation, failed to induce Na+/H+ antiporter mRNA. Furthermore, inhibition of PMA-induced differentiation by either sphingosine or cycloheximide prevented accumulation of Na+/H+ antiporter mRNA.

The mechanism for this selective action is not understood. OCT has been shown to have a diminished ability to mobilize calcium from bone in vivo, but in vitro findings are contradictory. Little is known about the effect of OCT on bone forming cells. Therefore, the present studies were designed to investigate the actions of OCT at the molecular level in the osteoblast-like cell line, ROS 17/2.8. 3H-OCT was bound to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in intact cells at the same rate as 3H-1,25-(OH)2D3. As previously found for 1,25-(OH)2D3, the time course of specific binding of OCT was biphasic, with an initial plateau at 1 h and a further increase from 2-8 h. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that exposure to 3H-1,25-(OH)2D3 increased VDR from 24 fmol/mg protein at 2 h to 85 fmol/mg protein at 8 h. Exposure to 3H-OCT increased VDR from 22 to 76 fmol/mg protein, indicating that OCT is also capable of up-regulating the VDR in ROS 17/2.8 cells. In contrast to the lower affinity of OCT for VDR reported for chick intestine and HL-60 cells, the Kd for OCT in intact ROS 17/2.8 cells was identical to that for 1,25-(OH)2D3. The effect of OCT on osteocalcin secretion and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in ROS 17/2.8 cells was also determined. Pretreatment for 24 h with either 1,25-(OH)2D3 or OCT resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of osteocalcin secretion. A 2-fold stimulation by both compounds was observed with 10(-7)M. ALP activity was measured after a 72-h incubation with 10(-7)M 1,25-(OH)2D3 or OCT. Both compounds increased ALP activity to the same extent. Stimulation by OCT of VDR levels, ALP activity, and osteocalcin secretion were inhibited by the addition of 5 microM cycloheximide, indicating that these actions of OCT require new protein synthesis. Thus, OCT, like 1,25-(OH)2D3, up-regulates the vitamin D receptor, stimulates osteocalcin secretion, and increases ALP activity in ROS 17/2.8 cells, suggesting that the analog may be as active as 1,25-(OH)2D3 in stimulating bone formation in vivo. The low activity of OCT in mobilizing calcium from bone in vivo does not appear to be due to an inability of this compound to act on osteoblasts.","['Pernalete, N', 'Mori, T', 'Nishii, Y', 'Slatopolsky, E', 'Brown, A J']","['Pernalete N', 'Mori T', 'Nishii Y', 'Slatopolsky E', 'Brown AJ']","['Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.']","['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'N2UJM5NBF6 (maxacalcitol)']","['DK-07126/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-09976/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-30178/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 has the potential, under the appropriate culture conditions, to differentiate into cells that have morphological and functional characteristics of osteoclasts, including multinucleation, presence of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, cross-reactivity with monoclonal antibodies that preferentially recognize osteoclasts, and capacity to resorb bone and respond to calcitonin. The multinucleated cells also contain high affinity receptors to calcitonin, in contrast to wild-type undifferentiated HL-60 cells.

Treatment with splenectomy and subsequently interferon produced temporary remissions. In July 1985, the patient began intravenous deoxycoformycin (DCF) therapy, and after 1 year complete peripheral blood and bone marrow remission was achieved. Fourteen months after cessation of therapy, the patient developed a skin rash and was found to have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and Sezary syndrome. Morphologic study of the hairy cells (HC) in the peripheral blood at presentation and the Sezary cells was distinct by light and electron microscopic study. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed clearly that the HC were of B-cell origin (CD20+, sIg+), whereas the lymphoid population at second presentation was T-cell (CD3+, CD4+, HLA-DR-). Clonal rearrangement of T-cell antigen receptor beta-chain gene was detected by Southern analysis of the Sezary cell population, whereas immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes remained in germ line configuration. This is the first case of Sezary syndrome developing in a patient previously treated for HCL where studies have confirmed distinct B-cell and T-cell origin of the two neoplasms. The authors suggest that treatment and disease-related immunosuppression are possible etiologic factors in the development of this second lymphoid neoplasm.","['Crump, M', 'Sutton, D M', 'Pantalony, D']","['Crump M', 'Sutton DM', 'Pantalony D']","['Department of Medicine, Toronto Hospital, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the specific activity of cytochrome c oxidase doubles in the course of the G1 phase of the cell cycle in control cells, in the presence of Ara-C G1 phase cells begin to increase the enzyme activity earlier and show a 3-fold rise of the enzyme activity in the same period of time. This is explained by an enhanced expression of the mitochondrial genome: the concentration of transcripts for the mitochondrially encoded subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase increases. Inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis abolishes the Ara-C induced effect on the specific activity of cytochrome c oxidase activity. The concentration of transcripts of the nuclearly encoded subunit IV of cytochrome c oxidase is the same as in control cells, and also the specific activity of the mitochondrial enzyme citrate synthase, which is exclusively encoded on nuclear-DNA, is not affected by Ara-C. Dysregulation in time and intensity of the expression of the mitochondrial relative to the nuclear genome may impair cell function and reflect a till now neglected mechanism of Ara-C cytotoxicity.","['Muus, P', 'Van den Bogert, C', 'De Vries, H', 'Pennings, A', 'Holtrop, M', 'Haanen, C']","['Muus P', 'Van den Bogert C', 'De Vries H', 'Pennings A', 'Holtrop M', 'Haanen C']","['Department of Haematology, Nijmegen University Hospital, The Netherlands.']","['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.9.3.1 (Electron Transport Complex IV)']",,PMC1977335,,,,,,,,,,,,

The DNA methylation patterns of six genes whose expression is regulated with terminal myeloid maturation were examined in HL-60 cells before and after their differentiation towards granulocytes. Methylation patterns were stable in five of these genes even with strong up- or down-regulation of mRNA levels. A somatic hybrid cell formed from HL-60 and B-lymphoid cells was studied for mRNA expression and DNA methylation of several of these genes. The pattern of methylation of the genes studied in the hybrid cells was a chimera of the parental patterns. These data suggest that changes in DNA methylation may not be necessary for the modulation of expression of many genes during terminal myeloid differentiation. Furthermore, somatic hybrid cell experiments suggest that specific DNA methylation patterns from both parental cells are inherited in a chimeric pattern by the hybrid and are independent of gene expression.","['Lubbert, M', 'Salser, W', 'Prokocimer, M', 'Miller, C W', 'Thomason, A', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Lubbert M', 'Salser W', 'Prokocimer M', 'Miller CW', 'Thomason A', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA.']","['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",,,,['MYC'],,,,,,,,,,

Mixtures of 61E and 61C virus and chimeras generated between them, but not 61E alone, killed feline T cells. T-cell killing depended on changes within a 7-amino-acid region near the C terminus of the gp70 env gene or was achieved independently by changes within a 109-amino-acid region encompassing the N terminus of gp70. The carboxy-terminal change was also sufficient for induction of fatal immunodeficiency disease in cats. Other changes within the 61C gp70 gene enhanced T-cell killing, as did changes in the long terminal repeat, the latter of which also enhanced virus replication. T-cell killing correlated with high levels of intracellular unintegrated and proviral DNA, all of which were blocked by treatment of infected cells with sera from 61C-immune cats or with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody. These findings indicate that T-cell killing is a consequence of superinfection and that the mutations in env critical to pathogenicity of the immunosuppressive variant result in a failure to establish superinfection interference in infected cells.","['Donahue, P R', 'Quackenbush, S L', 'Gallo, M V', 'deNoronha, C M', 'Overbaugh, J', 'Hoover, E A', 'Mullins, J I']","['Donahue PR', 'Quackenbush SL', 'Gallo MV', 'deNoronha CM', 'Overbaugh J', 'Hoover EA', 'Mullins JI']","[""Biomedical Research Institute, Children's Hospital of St. Paul, Minnesota 55102.""]","['0 (DNA, Viral)']","['AI25273/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA01058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC248886,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further experiments suggested that splenic hyperplasia results from inhibitory effects in the bone marrow, leading to compensatory extramedullary hematopoiesis. An enhancer variant of Mo-MuLV, Mo + PyF101 Mo-MuLV, fails to induce preleukemic hyperplasia and has greatly reduced leukemogenicity, indicating the importance of this state to efficient leukemogenesis. An alternative method for induction of preleukemic hyperplasia was sought. Treatment of mice with 89Sr causes specific ablation of bone marrow hematopoiesis and compensatory extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen and nodes. NIH Swiss mice were inoculated neonatally with Mo + PyF101 Mo-MuLV and treated with 89Sr at 6 weeks of age. Approximately 85% developed lymphoid leukemia with a time course resembling that caused by wild-type Mo-MuLV. In contrast, very few animals treated with Mo + PyF101 Mo-MuLV or 89Sr alone developed disease. In approximately one-third of cases, the Mo + PyF101 Mo-MuLV proviruses were found at common sites for wild-type Mo-MuLV-induced tumors (c-myc, pvt-1, and pim-1), indicating that this virus is capable of performing insertional activation in T-lymphoid cells. These results support the proposal that splenic hyperplasia results from inhibitory effects in the bone marrow. They also indicate that Mo + PyF101 Mo-MuLV is blocked in early and not late events in leukemogenesis.","['Li, Q X', 'Fan, H']","['Li QX', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine 92717.']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Strontium Radioisotopes)']",['CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC248884,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have examined the ability of extracellular nucleotides to modulate the phenotype of myelomonocytic progenitor cells. As model systems, we utilized the established HL-60 promyelocytic and U937 promonocytic human cell lines which were cultured in the continuous presence of nucleotides known to be potent agonists for P2-purinergic receptors. When cultured for 5 days with ATP gamma S (a phosphatase resistant analog of ATP) plus 10% fetal bovine serum, both HL-60 cells and U937 cells expressed several (but not all) phenotypic characteristics of differentiated phagocytes. In HL-60 cells these characteristics were (1) increased intracellular calcium mobilization in response to formylated chemotactic peptides, (2) a reduction in cell size with a decreased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, (3) a sharply reduced rate of proliferation, (4) a reduction in the percentage of cells expressing surface transferrin receptors, and (5) an increase in the percentage of cells expressing the type 1 complement receptor (CR1). In U937 cells these characteristics were (1) increased intracellular calcium mobilization in response to formylated chemotactic peptides and platelet activating factor, (2) a reduced rate of proliferation, (3) a reduction in the percentage of cells expressing surface transferrin receptors, and (4) increases in the percentage of cells expressing both type 1 (CR1) and type 3 (CR3) complement receptors. During the first 12-24 hr after exposure to ATP gamma S, HL-60 cells showed no obvious changes in morphology, viability, or the levels of beta-actin mRNA, but did show (1) a 4-fold increase in chemotactic peptide-induced Ca2+ mobilization, and (2) a greater than 90% decrease in c-myc mRNA levels. Significantly, when HL-60 cells were treated under serum-free conditions, the ability of ATP to enhance expression of functional FMLP receptors could be dissociated from the inhibitory effects of adenine nucleotides on cell proliferation observed in serum containing media. Moreover, treatment of serum-free HL-60 cultures with UTP, another P2-purinergic receptor agonist, also resulted in enhanced expression of functional FMLP receptors.","['Cowen, D S', 'Berger, M', 'Nuttle, L', 'Dubyak, G R']","['Cowen DS', 'Berger M', 'Nuttle L', 'Dubyak GR']","['Department of Physiology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio.']","['0 (Actins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', ""35094-46-3 (adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate))"", '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'UT0S826Z60 (Uridine Triphosphate)']","['AI22687/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM36387/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This effect was dose-dependent, remained unmodified when external Ca2+ was chelated with EGTA, and was totally inhibited when cells were first exposed to CD3 monoclonal antibodies, indicating that it was solely due to the release of an intracellular pool, which is also mobilized during a stimulation via the CD3 T-cell receptor (TcR) molecular complex. CD3- and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated Jurkat cells also produced PA, the dose-responses and kinetics of which were consistent with those of calcium release. Moreover, diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase inhibitors abrogated PA production and lowered calcium release by CD3-stimulated cells. PA did not induce any apparent increase in inositol triphosphates (IP3), nor did it modify the increase entailed by activation of the CD3 pathway, pointing out that IP3 can be supplemented in mobilizing calcium from intracellular stores. Conversely, a first exposure to PA only partially inhibited the CD3- or ionomycin-induced internal release of calcium, suggesting either a rapid restoration of the PA-sensitive stores, or a contribution of other mediators, such as IP3, in the CD3 activation pathway.","['Breittmayer, J P', 'Aussel, C', 'Farahifar, D', 'Cousin, J L', 'Fehlmann, M']","['Breittmayer JP', 'Aussel C', 'Farahifar D', 'Cousin JL', 'Fehlmann M']","['Immunologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, INSERM U210, Faculte de Medecine (Pasteur), Nice, France.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Phosphatidic Acids)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.107 (Diacylglycerol Kinase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,PMC1384455,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primitive haemopoietic cells such as the high proliferative potential progenitor cell and the colony-forming unit (CFU)-GEMM are directly inhibited by TGF-beta whereas the more differentiated CFU-G, CFU-M and CFU-E are not. Recombinant TGF-beta 1 administered intraperitoneally or intravenously to mice selectively inhibits haemopoietic colony formation in a time- and dose-dependent manner to the same extent as seen in vitro. The progenitors are reversibly prevented from entering the cell cycle. This inhibitory action of TGF-beta functions on at least two levels: (1) down-modulation of the cell surface expression of receptors for growth stimulatory molecules and (2) interference with the intracellular signalling pathways of these molecules. In addition, expression of TGF-beta receptors is regulated during cytokine stimulation of haemopoiesis. Neoplastic B lymphocytes can proliferate by escaping from a TGF-beta-mediated autocrine inhibitory loop. Activation signals (e.g. phorbol esters) inhibit tumour cell growth by stimulating active TGF-beta production and inducing cell surface expression of TGF-beta receptors. These results indicate that TGF-beta may be useful as a bone marrow protective and/or an antitumour agent.","['Ruscetti, F W', 'Dubois, C', 'Falk, L A', 'Jacobsen, S E', 'Sing, G', 'Longo, D L', 'Wiltrout, R H', 'Keller, J R']","['Ruscetti FW', 'Dubois C', 'Falk LA', 'Jacobsen SE', 'Sing G', 'Longo DL', 'Wiltrout RH', 'Keller JR']","['Biological Response Modifiers Program, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, MD 21701-1201.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']","['5R01AM27424/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', '5R01CA27466/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-74102/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['Rb', 'v-Ki-ras']",,42,,,,,,,,

Accumulation of MPO messenger RNA (mRNA) occurs only at the late myeloblastic and promyelocytic stages of myeloid differentiation and is negligible at other stages of myeloid development and in other tissues. The goal of our studies was to begin to understand the events that occur to control MPO gene expression during normal granulocytopoiesis. Chromatin structure of the MPO gene was evaluated by DNase I treatment of isolated nuclei and Southern blot analysis. No detectable DNase I hypersensitive sites were found in the region of the MPO gene in non-myeloid cells. One site was present in the 5' upstream region in myeloid cells that are developmentally too immature to transcribe MPO. Three sites of hypersensitivity in the regions of the putative MPO promoter and upstream region occurred in MPO-expressing promyelocytes. These sites were markedly reduced in terminally differentiated, non-expressing myeloid cells. Analysis of DNA methylation of the MPO gene using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes showed that the gene was highly methylated in non-myeloid cells. Stepwise demethylation occurred in myeloid cells developmentally too immature to transcribe MPO. Maximal demethylation in the 5' gene region occurred in MPO-expressing promyelocytes. This methylation pattern did not change in terminally differentiated, MPO non-expressing myeloid cells. A somatic hybrid cell formed by fusion of HL-60 (MPO-expressing cells) and PUT (MPO non-expressing lymphoid cells) extinguished expression of MPO and showed a chimeric pattern of MPO gene methylation, suggesting that demethylation is necessary but not sufficient for expression of the MPO gene. Our studies show that demethylation and DNase I hypersensitivity of the MPO gene were associated with a tissue-dependent potential for MPO gene expression that preceded the developmental ability to express MPO mRNA.","['Lubbert, M', 'Miller, C W', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Lubbert M', 'Miller CW', 'Koeffler HP']","['Cedars Sinai Medical Center, UCLA Department of Medicine.']","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the growth requirements of this cell line showed density-dependent growth and secretion of an autostimulatory growth factor, suggesting an autocrine mechanism. Several lines of evidence implicate the participation of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the autocrine growth regulation of B1 cells. These cells constitutively express the messenger RNA (mRNA) for IL-1 and IL-1 receptor and secrete IL-1; recombinant IL-1 stimulated the growth of colonies when cells were seeded at low density, and anti-IL-1 antibodies inhibited the growth of colonies with cells seeded at higher density. B1 cells do not express detectable levels of mRNA for any of the other cytokines tested, and other cytokines failed to support the growth of B1 cells at low density. In addition, B1 cells express multiple cytokine receptor genes, including the receptors for IL-6, IL-7, tumor necrosis factor and gamma-interferon. Addition of the respective cytokines to the B1 cells resulted in inhibition of the growth of leukemic cells in vitro. The multiplicity of growth-inhibitory cytokine receptors on this leukemic cell line might be due to its biphenotypic lineage and may suggest new therapeutic possibilities in controlling leukemic cell proliferation.","['Cohen, A', 'Grunberger, T', 'Vanek, W', 'Dube, I D', 'Doherty, P J', 'Letarte, M', 'Roifman, C', 'Freedman, M H']","['Cohen A', 'Grunberger T', 'Vanek W', 'Dube ID', 'Doherty PJ', 'Letarte M', 'Roifman C', 'Freedman MH']","['Division of Immunology and Cancer Research, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']","['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, treatment with 1 mmol/L8-bromo-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase, was associated with increases in jun-B transcripts that were maximal by 1 hour and then decreased to near pretreatment levels by 6 hours. Similar findings were obtained with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-CPT-cAMP) and N6,2'-0-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (dBt-cAMP). jun-B transcripts were also increased with other agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and forskolin. Moreover, inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase by the isoquinolinesulfonamide H-8 blocked 8-Br-cAMP-induced increases in jun-B expression. The results of nuclear run-on assays demonstrate that treatment of HL-60 cells with PGE2, forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP, and dBt-cAMP is associated with increases in the rate of jun-B transcription. The present findings also demonstrate that the related jun-D gene is similarly regulated by a cAMP-dependent pathway.

A rapid phase (t1/2 approximately 2 h) during which the initial activity was reduced by 40-50% was followed by a slow phase with t1/2 close to 3 days. The fast decay seemed to occur on the adenylate cyclase level since (-)isoprenaline- or forskolin-stimulated activities behaved similarly and bacterial toxin-monitored Gs and Gi proteins remained stable. The mechanism of the initial decrease in hormonal responsiveness was further analysed in hybrid cells prepared by fusing reticulocytes with Friend erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. The hybrids contained reticulocyte-derived beta-adrenoceptors and MEL cell-derived adenylate cyclase and G proteins. Fusion of reticulocytes to native MEL cells caused adenylate cyclase activity to drop by 30% at 2 h and 45% at 18 h after fusion. By contrast, hybrids prepared after dimethylsulfoxide-induced differentiation of MEL cells showed stable or increasing rates of receptor-coupled cAMP formation between 2 and 18 h after fusion, concomitant with the enhanced activity of the Gs protein in these cells. A cyclase-stimulating factor present in the cytosol of MEL cells and of reticulocytes appeared not to be involved in short-term regulation of hormonal responsiveness. We conclude that the strength of beta-adrenergic responses in erythroid progenitor cells is primarily regulated by modulating G protein-mediated receptor cyclase coupling while reticulocytes, during early maturation, seem to rely on direct inactivation of adenylate cyclase, probably via a cytosolic proteolytic pathway.","['Porzig, H', 'Moudry, R', 'Montandon, J B']","['Porzig H', 'Moudry R', 'Montandon JB']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Bern, Switzerland.']","['0 (Catecholamines)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, beta)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By trypan blue dye exclusion, a 24-h exposure of the cells to 0.1 microM of the drug was found to be cytotoxic. Exposure of the cells to lower concentrations (0.001-0.01 microM) for 3 days reduced cell proliferation and induced cell differentiation. As determined by Wright-Giemsa staining, approximately 25% of promyelocytic cells became metamyelocytes, banded and segmented neutrophils. Electron microscopy demonstrated alterations in the ultrastructure of HCPT-induced HL-60 cells that included the formation of lobulated nuclei and the accumulation of large vesicles and small myelin bodies as well as glycogen-like particles in the cell periphery. Qualitatively similar results were obtained in a subline of HL-60 that is resistant to 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA); however, the rate and extent of induced nitroblue tetrazolium-positive cells by HCPT and several other agents were greater in the resistant cell line. Under conditions that induced cell differentiation, HCPT sharply inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and increased the rate of protein synthesis without an effect on the rate of RNA synthesis. The measurement of DNA topoisomerase I activity in nuclear extracts from both HCPT- and DMSO-treated cells demonstrated that the enzyme was decreased in mature cells compared to nondifferentiated controls. The data suggest that progressive reduction of DNA topoisomerase I activity may be associated with cell differentiation, but whether HCPT-induced differentiation is mediated by inhibition of the enzyme is inconclusive.","['Ling, Y H', 'Tseng, M T', 'Nelson, J A']","['Ling YH', 'Tseng MT', 'Nelson JA']","['Department of Experimental Pediatrics, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '9Z01632KRV (10-hydroxycamptothecin)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",['CA-28034/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to the enzymatic method, the flow cytometric method did not accurately reflect the 95% reduction in GSH content of cells treated for 24 h with 100 microM BSO. Possible reaction of MBCL with other sulfhydryl groups (other than GSH) in BSO-treated cells may be responsible for this discordance. We have also shown the feasibility of using dual parameter flow cytometry to monitor cellular anthracycline (daunorubicin) retention and GSH-MBCL conjugate fluorescence in human tumor cells.

Twenty-two of 54 alleles showed rearrangements of the T-cell receptor (TCR) delta locus. These rearrangements resulted either from D2D delta 3 (2 alleles) or V delta 2(Dn)D delta 3 (20 alleles) recombinations, and the other V delta and delta Rec were not rearranged. Of 23 alleles with deletion of C delta and rearrangements of J alpha, V delta 2, V delta 4 and V delta 5 appeared to rearrange to J alpha on five alleles. With regard to the relationship between the rearranged V alpha/delta and J alpha genes, gene segments 5' to V delta 2 frequently rearranged to J alpha more proximal to C alpha, whereas V delta 2 and gene segments 3' to V delta 2 showed a tendency to rearrange to J alpha distal to C alpha. Based on these findings, we suggest that the initial recombination event of the TCR-alpha/delta gene may be D2D delta 3 joining, followed by V delta 2 recombination with the D2D delta 3 complex. It was also suggested that use of V alpha/delta and J alpha/delta may depend on the distance between the involved V alpha/delta and J alpha/delta at least in B-lineage cells. These rearrangements in B-precursor cells appear to be aberrant. However, this recombinational process may be one of the normal differentiation pathways in T-lineage cells, because cells with a V delta 2(Dn)D delta 3 rearrangement were detected in 0.1-0.01% of normal peripheral mononuclear cells by the polymerase chain reaction.","['Hara, J', 'Kawa-Ha, K', 'Takihara, Y', 'Yumura-Yagi, K', 'Ishihara, S', 'Tawa, A', 'Mak, T W', 'Okada, S', 'Gelfand, E W']","['Hara J', 'Kawa-Ha K', 'Takihara Y', 'Yumura-Yagi K', 'Ishihara S', 'Tawa A', 'Mak TW', 'Okada S', 'Gelfand EW']","['Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University Hospital, Japan.']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient progressed to acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) 5 months after clinical onset of MDS. PV-90 is of clonal origin as indicated by the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangements, monoclonal surface immunoglobulins, and a single DNA restriction fragment corresponding to the EBV genomic termini. PV-90 cells also express a number of myelomonocytic markers, including alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE), coagulation factor XIII, and CD68 antigen. Moreover, PV-90 cells constitutively express the c-fms proto-oncogene mRNA as the patient's blast cells did. Whereas a trisomy 11 (+11) was found in the patient's bone marrow cells, PV-90 cells had a normal karyotype initially, but at 4 months showed two different and independent chromosomal abnormalities: 90, XX, -Y, -Y, t(9;16) (q11;p13), and 90, XX, -Y, -Y, t(17;18) (p13;q21), the latter possibly involving the p53 (17,p13) and bcl-2 (18, q21) proto-oncogenes. The early development of these chromosomal aberrations is consistent with a genetic instability of PV-90 cells.

The rationale for using anti-idiotypes (anti-Ids) to try to elicit an antigenic-specific immune response is examined, and the production and characterization of polyclonal and monoclonal anti-Ids are described. Several techniques were used to determine antigenic mimicry and anti-Id subtypes. The potential use of anti-Ids in feline leukemia virus (FeLV) receptor studies and vaccine trials in vivo were investigated. Results from these studies suggest that the anti-Id strategy is feasible for the FeLV model. Polyclonal Ab2 reagents were developed that blocked virus-receptor binding and thus inhibited viral infection in vitro and induced humoral immune responses in 6- to 8-week old kittens characterized by production of Ab3 with the ability to bind the original FeLV envelope protein gp70 as assessed by Western blot analysis.","['Tavares, L', 'Roneker, C', 'Postie, L', 'Fevereiro, M', 'de Noronha, F']","['Tavares L', 'Roneker C', 'Postie L', 'Fevereiro M', 'de Noronha F']","['Department of Veterinary Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology, New York State College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca.']","['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease, termed murine AIDS (MAIDS), crucially depends on the presence of B cells and CD4+ T cells, suggesting that mutual activation of these two cell types is central in the pathogenesis of the immunodeficiency syndrome. Cyclosporin A (CsA), whose immunosuppressive effect is attributed mainly to inhibition of interleukin 2 and interferon-gamma expression, interferes in T-B cell interactions. Here we show that chronic treatment with CsA (40 or 60 mg/kg/day) before and after infection with LP-BM5 MuLV protects against the development of immunodeficiency disease as assessed by functional, serological and histopathological criteria. The protection was not complete, suggesting both CsA-sensitive and CsA-resistant components to the pathogenesis of this syndrome, and was found to be independent of ecotropic MuLV expression. These results underline immunopathological mechanisms in the progression of immune abnormalities in MAIDS that are susceptible to inhibition of CsA and may serve as an experimental basis for developing a treatment of the human disorder with immunomodulators.","['Cerny, A', 'Merino, R', 'Makino, M', 'Waldvogel, F A', 'Morse, H C 3rd', 'Izui, S']","['Cerny A', 'Merino R', 'Makino M', 'Waldvogel FA', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Izui S']","['Clinique Medicale Therapeutique, Hopital Cantonal Universitaire, Switzerland.']","['0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",['N01-AI-72622/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, cells exposed to topoisomerase inhibitors before or during the S (DNA synthetic) phase of the cell cycle undergo abnormal DNA replication and become irreversibly blocked in the G2 (pre-mitosis) phase. We report that following a 4-h exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors, murine erythroleukemic cells (MELC) do not form mitotic figures but exhibit a time-dependent progression into G2 (4N DNA) and greater than G2 (up to 8N DNA) stages of the cell cycle. Following exposure to the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, recovering MELC also exhibit greater than G2 polyploidy, but to a considerably lesser degree: mitotic figures are present and a subpopulation of cells resumes cycling. However, both topo I and topo II inhibitors induce maximal percentages of greater than G2 cells when synchronized MELC are in the G2/M phase at the time of exposure. This suggests that, in addition to their S-phase action, topoisomerase inhibitors can interfere with chromosome condensation during G2 and, in so doing, induce polyploidy.","['Zucker, R M', 'Elstein, K H']","['Zucker RM', 'Elstein KH']","['ManTech Environmental Technology, Inc., Triangle Park, NC 27709.']","['0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although oxidants are generally considered to be instrumental in the target lysis by PMNs, the mediators actually involved remain a matter of controversy. Moreover, other factors potentially crucial to the lysis have not been clearly identified. In order to reexamine the determinants of the cytolytic process, we studied the events underlying the PMA-triggered PMN-delivered attack against two different targets, selected on the basis of preliminary experiments (B lymphoblastoid Daudi cells and erythroleukemic K 562 cells). The results suggest that the lysis is promoted by hypochlorous acid (HOCl) or a compound with characteristics very similar to HOCl itself. No evidence was obtained for the intervention or contribution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl (OH.) radicals, and the major HOCl-derived chloramines. PMNs appeared to use 35% of the generated H2O2 to produce HOCl, while the remainder appears to be consumed by PMNs themselves and target cells as well. Moreover, PMNs and target cells coaggregated at an early step of the cytolytic reaction, through a process efficiently prevented by a monoclonal antibody (MoAb J-90) directed against leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1). The inhibition of the PMN-target aggregation by the MoAb J-90 resulted in the impairment of the lysis, despite a normal generation of HOCl. Thus, the data demonstrate that the PMA-triggered lysis of tumor target cells by PMNs requires at least two events, occurring simultaneously: the LFA-1-mediated effector-target adherence and the PMN production of HOCl. The intervention of the LFA-1-mediated PMN-target adherence in the PMA-triggered lysis is likely to allow PMNs to focus HOCl on the target cell surface and suggests that the process requires a sort of molecule to molecule recognition at the effector-target surface level.","['Dallegri, F', 'Ottonello, L', 'Ballestrero, A', 'Dapino, P', 'Ferrando, F', 'Patrone, F', 'Sacchetti, C']","['Dallegri F', 'Ottonello L', 'Ballestrero A', 'Dapino P', 'Ferrando F', 'Patrone F', 'Sacchetti C']","['First Medical Clinic, University of Genova Medical School, Italy.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '712K4CDC10 (Hypochlorous Acid)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indirect immunofluorescence revealed that the intensity of the signal for topo II in unsynchronized log phase HL-60 cells varied widely. Indirect immunolabeling combined with propidium iodide staining and two-parameter flow cytometry revealed that topo II levels increased an average of 2-fold as cells progressed from G1 to G2/M. When HL-60 cells were induced to mature toward granulocytes, topo II levels progressively decreased and became undetectable by functional assays, by indirect immunoperoxidase staining, and by Western blotting with an antibody which identified Mr 170,000 and Mr 180,000 forms of topo II. Similar changes were detected during normal granulocytic maturation in human marrow in vivo. Western blotting revealed that levels of the Mr 170,000 (proliferation-associated) isoform of topo II were highest in marrow fractions enriched in progranulocytes and myelocytes, intermediate in unfractionated marrow from normal volunteers, and undetectable in mature granulocytes. The Mr 180,000 topo II polypeptide was also diminished or absent from mature granulocytes. In further experiments, marrow samples from normal volunteers were subjected to flow cytometry after labeling of topo II and various cell surface markers. Levels of the Mr 170,000 topo II polypeptide in CD34-positive cells (multipotent and committed progenitors from several hematopoietic lineages) were indistinguishable from levels observed in the HL-60 leukemia cell line. These results suggest that topo II levels in highly proliferative normal human myeloid cells in vivo approach levels found in corresponding neoplastic cell lines in vitro. Conversely, as the same cells mature into granulocytes in vivo or in vitro, levels of both molecular weight forms of topo II diminish. These results provide a framework for the further investigation of topo II levels and drug sensitivity in human leukemia.","['Kaufmann, S H', 'McLaughlin, S J', 'Kastan, M B', 'Liu, L F', 'Karp, J E', 'Burke, P J']","['Kaufmann SH', 'McLaughlin SJ', 'Kastan MB', 'Liu LF', 'Karp JE', 'Burke PJ']","['Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']","['CA 06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 50435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physiologic RA concentrations alone were not able to induce any IL-1 beta production, but they strongly enhanced the PMA-induced IL-1 beta protein production and mRNA accumulation in both human monocytes and in THP-1 cells. Nuclear run-off analysis revealed that the enhancing effect was at the transcriptional level. RA also slightly potentiated LPS-induced IL-1 beta expression in THP-1 cells but not in human monocytes.

In addition, when both FLV and THC were administered to mice concurrently with infection by herpes simplex virus (HSV), mortality attributed to the retrovirus infection occurred significantly more rapidly than in the absence of the drug and HSV.

These strain-dependent differences in response to infection have been shown to be genetically determined with resistance to disease being, in general, associated with homozygosity for Fv-1n and H-2 haplotypes a and d and sensitivity with homozygosity for Fv-1b and other H-2 haplotypes including b, s, and q. The Fv-1b, H-2r strain RIIIS/J (RIIIS) was found to be highly resistant to disease even though B10.RIII(71NS)/J (B10.RIII), also H-2r, was very sensitive, thus excluding a role for H-2 in the resistance of RIIIS. The characteristics of RIIIS resistance were evaluated in studies of infected (B10.RIII x RIIIS) F1, F2 and reciprocal backcross mice. Resistance to disease was shown to be semidominant and determined by more than one gene, although a preponderant influence of a single gene was suggested. Studies of segregating populations showed that resistance was not associated with or linked to polymorphisms of the V beta complex or genes in proximity to the Emv-2 locus on chromosome 8. However, there was almost complete concordance between absence of disease in infected mice and inhibition of ecotropic virus spread. These results demonstrate that genes other than Fv-1 or H-2 can profoundly influence the development of retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency and replication of ecotropic viruses.","['Makino, M', 'Davidson, W F', 'Fredrickson, T N', 'Hartley, J W', 'Morse, H C 3rd']","['Makino M', 'Davidson WF', 'Fredrickson TN', 'Hartley JW', 'Morse HC 3rd']","['Laboratory of Immunopathology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['0 (H-2 Antigens)'],['N01-AI-72622/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this recipient, EM observations revealed many viral particles within the cells of urinary sediments with diameter of about 80 nm corresponding to adenovirus, of which type 11 was produced in viral cultures. In one of the other two recipients many viral particles with a mean diameter of 41.6 nm corresponding to papovavirus were observed, but viral cultures using conventional cells were negative.

After growing for 72 h in medium supplemented with unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) and alpha-tocopherol, the fatty acyl composition of membrane phospholipids in JURKAT cells was extensively modified. Each respective fatty acid supplemented in the culture medium was readily incorporated into phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine in the JURKAT cells. The total n-6 fatty acyl content was markedly reduced in phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine of cells grown in the presence of n-3 fatty acids (alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid). Conversely, in the presence of n-6 fatty acids (linoleic acid and arachidonic acid), the total n-3 fatty acyl content was reduced in all the phospholipids examined. In n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) modified JURKAT cells, the total n-9 monounsaturated fatty acyl content in the phospholipids were markedly reduced. Changing the fatty acyl composition of membrane phospholipids in the JURKAT cells appears to have no affect on the presentation of the T cell receptor/CD3 complex or the binding of anti-CD3 antibodies (OKT3) to the CD3 complex. However, the peak increase in [Ca2+]i and the prolonged sustained phase elicited by OKT3 activation were suppressed in n-3 and n-6 PUFA but not in n-9 monounsaturated fatty acid modified cells. In Ca2+ free medium, OKT3-induced transient increase in [Ca2+]i representing Ca2+ release from the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ stores, were similar in control and UFA modified cells. Using Mn2+ entry as an index of plasma membrane Ca2+ permeability, the rate of fura-2 fluorescence quenching as a result of Mn2+ influx stimulated by OKT3 in n-9 monounsaturated fatty acid modified cells was similar to control cells, but the rates in n-3 and n-6 PUFA modified cells were significantly lower. These results suggest that receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx in JURKAT cells is sensitive to changes in the fatty acyl composition of membrane phospholipids and monounsaturated fatty acids appears to be important for the maintenance of a functional Ca2+ influx mechanism.","['Chow, S C', 'Sisfontes, L', 'Jondal, M', 'Bjorkhem, I']","['Chow SC', 'Sisfontes L', 'Jondal M', 'Bjorkhem I']","['Department of Immunology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']","['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BLV infection is currently assessed by the detection of circulating antibodies against the viral envelope protein, gp51. However, this approach has shortcomings in the time taken to detect anti-BLV antibodies (three to four weeks after infection), and in the failure to detect antibodies in some animals. Clearly a technique such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which directly detects the presence of viral DNA, has advantages over methods designed to measure host antibodies. The use of PCR for the detection of proviral DNA in an affected DNA sample with as little as 10(-5) micrograms of host DNA using agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining is described here. It was possible to improve the sensitivity of this assay by using hybridisation analysis with a BLV gene probe. PCR used in combination with hybridisation analysis will provide a sensitive diagnostic assay to detect BLV when antibody tests give weakly positive or equivocal results.","['Brandon, R B', 'Naif, H', 'Daniel, R C', 'Lavin, M F']","['Brandon RB', 'Naif H', 'Daniel RC', 'Lavin MF']","['Molecular Oncology, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia.']","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The addition of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (which do not permeate the cell membrane), reduced the amount of hydroxyl radicals detected. SOD decreased hydroxyl radicals somewhat but catalase eliminated hydroxyl radicals almost completely.

Partial amino acid sequence was used to deduce oligonucleotide probes. These probes were used to screen a human granulocyte cDNA library derived from messenger RNA (mRNA) from a patient with chronic granulocytic leukemia. Cell-free translation of RNA produced from the cDNA produced a 52-Kd protein that was recognized by anti-HNC antibody. The cDNA clone was sequenced and shown to encode a 467-residue protein whose sequence matched those regions currently known for HNC. The enzyme exhibits 58% homology to human fibroblast collagenase and has the same domain structure. It consists of a 20-residue signal peptide, and an 80-residue propeptide that is lost on autolytic activation by cleavage of an M-L bond. Other regions identified include the autolytic degradation site, the ""cysteine switch"" residue that is involved in latency and activation, and a putative zinc binding sequence. HNC has six potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The cDNA hybridized to a 3.4-kb mRNA in RNA from a patient with chronic granulocytic leukemia, but not to RNA from uninduced HL60 cells or HL60 cells that had been induced to undergo granulocytic or monocytic maturation with dimethyl sulfoxide or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, respectively.

The postreceptor mechanisms for these two actions, and the extent to which they represent overlapping biochemical pathways, have not been fully clarified. We have examined the actions of GM-CSF on the expression of c-myc, an early response oncogene associated with the proliferative stimulus of growth factors. GM-CSF reduced the population doubling time of HL-60 leukemia cells from 32 hours to 25 hours, and, at concentrations that were correlated with mitogenicity, induced a rapid twofold increase in the level of c-myc mRNA. Nuclear runoff studies indicated that GM-CSF approximately doubled the transcription rate of c-myc by reversing the transcription attenuation that occurs at the exon 1-intron 1 junction. GM-CSF had no effect on the half-life of c-myc messenger RNA. The biochemical basis for the modulation of c-myc expression by GM-CSF was explored. GM-CSF treatment caused intracellular alkalinization of the cells as measured using the fluorescent probe 2', 7-bis (2-carboxyethyl)-5(and-6) carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). The sodium channel blocker amiloride prevented the GM-CSF-induced change in pH, but did not affect the stimulation of c-myc transcription by GM-CSF. Agents that increase cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels (prostaglandin E2 and cholera toxin) blocked the actions of GM-CSF on c-myc; however, these agents also reduced the basal level of c-myc expression. GM-CSF caused a rapid (5 minutes) and transient decline in cellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, and a slower (30 minutes) and transient decrease in cellular cAMP levels. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the declines in cAMP and cGMP are associated with a stimulation of HL-60 proliferation, while previously reported manipulations that elevate cyclic nucleotides are related to an inhibition of HL-60 proliferation and the potentiation of differentiation.","['Schwartz, E L', 'Chamberlin, H', 'Brechbuhl, A B']","['Schwartz EL', 'Chamberlin H', 'Brechbuhl AB']","['Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10467.']","['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sodium Channels)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",,,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,

We characterized the native Epo receptor on erythroleukemia cell lines by ligand blotting. Solubilized cell membrane proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and probed with 125I-Epo. Specificity was demonstrated by inhibition of 125I-Epo binding by unlabeled excess Epo but not other peptide growth factors and by the cellular distribution of the Epo binding protein. A single membrane protein of 61 Kd +/- 4 Kd was sufficient to bind 125I Epo in both human (OCIM2, K562) and murine (GM979, Rauscher, DA-1) cell lines. This finding is consistent with the predicted size of the Epo receptor from the murine cDNA clone. However, chemical crosslinking of 125I-Epo to its receptor has identified two Epo binding proteins of 105 Kd and 85 Kd. This difference may occur because the receptor is size fractionated before Epo binding in the ligand blot, but after Epo binding in crosslinking studies. Ligand blotting demonstrates that the native Epo receptor is composed of a single 61-Kd Epo binding protein, and suggests the presence of additional proteins of 20 to 25 Kd that associate with the receptor after Epo binding.","['Atkins, H L', 'Broudy, V C', 'Papayannopoulou, T']","['Atkins HL', 'Broudy VC', 'Papayannopoulou T']","['University of Washington, Seattle.']","['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",['DK31232/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have learned more about how normal genes with critical functions in growth and development can induce cellular transformation and malignancy if mutated or overexpressed. The finding of such oncogenes in specific human cancers often portends a poor prognosis. We have learned more about tumor suppressor genes, whose loss by mutation, deletion, or translocation can lead to cancer. A series of defects involving both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes has been shown to characterize the multistep development of a fully malignant colon cancer. We have new insights into the promotion of malignancy by the fused gene product resulting from the chromosomal abnormality diagnostic of one leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia. Recently, in acute promyelocytic leukemia, a characteristic chromosomal abnormality has been shown to result in a specific fusion of a nuclear receptor that activates transcription and a previously unknown gene. Most interestingly, a ligand for this rearranged receptor has been shown to be a novel effective treatment for the disease.

Gallium, a metal which resembles iron with respect to transferrin (Tf) binding, cellular uptake by the Tf receptor and incorporation into ferritin, blocks the cellular uptake of iron and inhibits cell growth. Exposure of HL60 cells to Tf-gallium (Ga) results in decreased deoxyribonucleotide synthesis and a diminution in the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy signal of ribonucleotide reductase, findings consistent with inhibition of this enzyme. In the present study, Ga nitrate blocked the uptake of 59Fe by L1210 cells and inhibited their proliferation. The ribonucleotide reductase M2 subunit ESR signal in cell cytoplasmic extracts was markedly inhibited in Ga-treated cells; however, the signal was restored to normal within 10 min of exposure of these cytoplasmic extracts to ferrous ammonium sulfate. These results confirm that Ga inhibits DNA synthesis by specifically limiting the amount of intracellular iron needed for the activity of the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. Further studies utilizing HL60 cells made resistant to Ga showed that these cells were also more resistant to growth inhibition by an anti-Tf receptor monoclonal antibody and deferoxamine. Ga blocks cell growth through inhibition of iron-dependent DNA synthesis. Cells appear to overcome the effects of Ga through compensatory mechanisms involving cellular iron metabolism.","['Chitambar, C R', 'Narasimhan, J']","['Chitambar CR', 'Narasimhan J']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.']","['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'CH46OC8YV4 (Gallium)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)']",['R01 CA41740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent findings indicated that retroviral RNA dimerization and encapsidation are probably related events during virion assembly. We studied the cation-induced dimerization of HIV-1 RNA and results indicate that all in vitro generated HIV-1 RNAs containing a 100 nucleotide domain downstream from the 5' splice site are able to dimerize. RNA dimerization depends on the concentration of RNA, mono- and multivalent cations, the size of the monovalent cation, temperature, and pH. Up to 75% of HIV-1 RNA is dimeric in the presence of spermidine. HIV-1 RNA dimer is fairly resistant to denaturing agents and unaffected by intercalating drugs. Antisense HIV-1 RNA does not dimerize but heterodimers can be formed between HIV-1 RNA and either MoMuLV or RSV RNA. Therefore retroviral RNA dimerization probably does not simply proceed through mechanisms involving Watson-Crick base-pairing. Neither adenine and cytosine protonation, nor quartets containing only guanines appear to determine the stability of the HIV-1 RNA dimer, while quartets involving both adenine(s) and guanine(s) could account for our results. A consensus sequence PuGGAPuA found in the putative dimerization-encapsidation region of all retroviral genomes examined may participate in the dimerization process.","['Marquet, R', 'Baudin, F', 'Gabus, C', 'Darlix, J L', 'Mougel, M', 'Ehresmann, C', 'Ehresmann, B']","['Marquet R', 'Baudin F', 'Gabus C', 'Darlix JL', 'Mougel M', 'Ehresmann C', 'Ehresmann B']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie, Institut de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du CNRS, Strasbourg, France.']","['0 (Formamides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '02F3473H9O (Magnesium Chloride)', '4781T907ZS (formamide)', '660YQ98I10 (Potassium Chloride)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)']",,PMC329442,,,,,,,,,,,,

The release of PCA from cells can be inhibited by vinblastine, an inhibitor of microfilament and microtubules in the cell. The optimal release of PCA occurs at pH 7.2-7.4 at 37 degrees C and is not inhibited by the ATPase inhibitor ouabain. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP inhibits the release/synthesis of PCA.

As expected, 48 h of 1,25(OH)2D3 exposure more than doubles (p less than 0.005) HL-60 basal cytosolic Ca2+ and increases inositol triphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ stores approximately 4-fold (p less than 0.01). 22-oxa in contrast alters neither Ca(2+)- nor inositol triphosphate-mobilizable deposits. Moreover, 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment prompts a transient Ca2+ ""spike"" in response to formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and a marked increase in superoxide (O-2) generation when exposed to the chemotactic peptide (p less than 0.01) or phorbol ester (p less than 0.02). Treatment with 22-oxa does not enable HL-60 to respond to fMLP with a Ca2+ spike or prime the cell for respiratory burst unless it is co-incubated with the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin. Similarly, phorbol ester impacts more profoundly on O-2 generation by 1,25(OH)2D3 than 22-oxa preincubated cells (p less than 0.02), unless the latter is added with ionomycin. Our findings indicate that the maturational effects of vitamin D sterols are independent of their capacity to prime cells for respiratory burst and that the Ca2+ ionophoretic effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 play a major role in such priming.","['Tanaka, H', 'Hruska, K A', 'Seino, Y', 'Malone, J D', 'Nishii, Y', 'Teitelbaum, S L']","['Tanaka H', 'Hruska KA', 'Seino Y', 'Malone JD', 'Nishii Y', 'Teitelbaum SL']","['Department of Pathology, Jewish Hospital, Washington University Medical Center, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'N2UJM5NBF6 (maxacalcitol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']","['AR32087/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DE05413/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

When acting on normal embryonic stem cells, it has the opposite action of preventing differentiation commitment. LIF is not a proliferative factor when acting alone on normal hemopoietic cells, but can potentiate the action of interleukin 3 on blast cell and megakaryocyte precursors. When injected in vivo, LIF stimulates rises in megakaryocyte numbers and platelet levels. LIF also exhibits striking functional effects on a wide range of other cells including hepatic parenchymal cells, neurones, adipocytes, osteoblasts and gonadal cells. The polyfunctionality of LIF suggests strongly that it is normally intended to be produced locally and act as a local regulator.

The type and function of this putative Ge (exocytosis) protein were investigated in streptolysin-O-permeabilized rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. The exocytotic response to calcium was first characterized both morphologically and biochemically using the release of preloaded [3H]serotonin as an index of exocytosis. Calcium-induced secretion (EC50 about 3 microM) in RBL cells requires ATP (EC50 about 2.5 mM) and is modulated by pH, the optimal value being 7.2. Another requirement for calcium-induced secretion is an activated G protein, since inactivators of G proteins such as GDP beta S (EC50 about 800 microM) inhibit the secretagogue effect of 10 microM free calcium. Conversely, GTP gamma S (EC50 about 1 microM) and other nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP, which keep G proteins in a permanently active conformation, potentiate the effect of calcium. GTP gamma S alone is without effect. The effect of GTP gamma S on exocytosis is apparently not mediated by known second messengers, suggesting that a Ge protein is involved. Electron microscopic images show that in resting cells, secretory granules are clustered in the perinuclear area, whereas they become scattered upon calcium stimulation. A paradoxical effect of GTP gamma S is observed when applied during permeabilization; under these conditions, in fact, the nucleotide inhibits the subsequent secretory response to calcium. The scattering of granules is also inhibited. This effect of GTP gamma S is counteracted by coadministration of GTP. These responses to guanine nucleotides are typical of vectorially acting G proteins involved in protein synthesis and in intracellular vesicle transport. Taken together, the data presented suggest that calcium-dependent release requires a vectorially acting G protein controlling the movement of secretory granules. This and alternative models are discussed.","['De Matteis, M A', 'Di Tullio, G', 'Buccione, R', 'Luini, A']","['De Matteis MA', 'Di Tullio G', 'Buccione R', 'Luini A']","['Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Consorzio Mario Negri Sud, (Chieti), Italy.']","['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Serotonin Antagonists)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,['J Biol Chem 1991 Dec 15;266(35):24232'],,,,,,,

Accordingly, murine L1210 leukemia cells were cocultivated with activated peritoneal macrophages from Bacillus-Calmette-Guerin-infected mice, or activated in vitro with interferon-gamma. In control experiments, macrophages were prevented from producing nitrogen oxides by incubation with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, a specific inhibitor of the L-arginine:NO pathway. After coculture, L1210 cells were removed from adherent macrophage monolayers and analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance at 77 K. In the L1210 cells cultured with activated macrophages, we detected a signal typical of nitrosyl-iron-sulfur complexes, with g values of 2.041 and 2.015. This signal was not present when L1210 cells were either cultured alone or cocultured with activated macrophages in the presence of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. Mitochondria from activated macrophage-injured L1210 cells also exhibited the signal with g values of 2.041 and 2.015.

While chickenpox is benign in normal children, infection in the immunocompromised patient is characterized by a period of prolonged viral replication, delayed healing and a high frequency of extracutaneous manifestations, such as pneumonitis and involvement of the nervous system. Therefore, current therapeutic research efforts have focused on both the prevention of VZV infections through the development of a live, attenuated vaccine and improved therapeutic modalities. The existing antiviral drug acyclovir has been shown to be effective in reducing severe complications in risk groups. It has been generally accepted that the varicella vaccine is useful in immunocompromised children with acute leukaemia or solid malignant tumours. Healthy seronegative siblings will also benefit from the varicella vaccine.

Phorbol treatment of HL60 cells for 24 h, at a concentration range of 160 nM down to 1 nM, led to differentiation of these cells towards monocytes and a loss of approximately 80% of their ability to bind reovirus in a fluorescence assay. These cells also lost their susceptibility to T1 and T3 reovirus infection. DMSO treatment for 24 h at a concentration of 1.25% (v/v) led to differentiation towards granulocytes. This was accompanied by an increase of approximately 15% in binding of reovirus to these cells. After being infected by T1 or T3 reovirus, the granulocytes produced higher titres of progeny virus than did untreated HL60 cells. Similar differences were noted when virus binding to HL60 cells was assayed using radiolabelled reovirus. These effects were not detected when murine L fibroblasts were treated with DMSO or phorbol. ATCC-derived murine R1.1 cells did not bind reovirus. Competition data indicated that there may be two reovirus receptors on HL60 cells, and that T1 can bind to only one receptor whereas T3 can bind to both receptors.

The diagnoses included acute and chronic leukemias and Hodgkin's disease. Identified in two families were p53 mutations that were nonhereditary. These included a 2-bp deletion in exon 6 found in the lymphoblast DNA of one child whose sibling, cousin, and several adult relatives had acute leukemia. The other nonhereditary p53 mutation was a transition at codon 248 (CGG to CAG, arginine to glutamine) found in the lymphoblasts of a patient with a preleukemic syndrome and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) whose brother is a long-term survivor of ALL. Thus, p53 mutations were found to occur in two families but both were nonhereditary. Moreover, in the remaining eight families no p53 mutation was identified in the regions of p53 where most mutations have been found in other cancers. Although p53 mutations sometimes may be present, they do not appear to be a primary event responsible for hereditary susceptibility to familial leukemia.

Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography of the purified complex yielded follistatin and activins A, AB, and B. The activity of the purified activin B was found to be significantly lower than those of other activins in various assay systems such as stimulation of follicle-stimulating hormone secretion, induction of erythrodifferentiation, and potentiation of expression of gonadotropin receptors on ovarian cells. Moreover, binding of 125I-activin A to erythroleukemic cells which are activin-responsive was competed by activin B with approximately 10-fold lower potency compared with other activins. In contrast to these results, activin B was proved to have a potent Xenopus mesoderm-inducing activity, comparable with that of other activins.

(1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17637-17640). Incubation of both these cell types in serum-free medium containing heme-hemopexin is shown here also to increase the steady-state level of metallothionein (MT) mRNA in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Heme-hemopexin is a far more effective inducer (12-fold) of the MT isozyme 1 (MT-1) in Hepa cells than nonprotein-bound heme (4-fold). Apohemopexin has no effect on MT-1 expression, and incubation with heme-hemopexin of mouse L fibroblasts that lack hemopexin receptors does not affect MT-1 expression. Thus, an interaction between the heme-hemopexin complex and its receptor is necessary for increased accumulation of MT-1 transcripts. In vitro nuclear ""run-on"" analysis indicates that the heme-hemopexin-mediated accumulation of MT-1 mRNA is regulated primarily at the level of initiation of transcription. A highly labile protein is required for constitutive MT-1 gene expression and acts to repress transcription. Transcriptional activation by heme or metals may require decreased concentrations or inactivation of the repressor as well as an additional inducer-specific trans-acting factor. Inhibition of protein synthesis augments the heme-hemopexin-mediated accumulation of MT-1 mRNA. Activation of heme oxygenase (HO) gene transcription by heme requires the synthesis of one (or more) heme-inducible proteins that are labile or become labile upon cycloheximide-sensitive processing or activation. Our comparison of MT and HO points to significant differences in the mechanisms of gene regulation by heme. The concomitant regulation of gene expression of MT-1 and HO in response to heme-hemopexin appears to be a concerted adaptive response of the cells, mediated at the level of the plasma membrane hemopexin receptor, and may relate to the proposed role of MT as an intracellular antioxidant or to a need to sequester zinc which otherwise would compete with iron and occupy sites on regulatory proteins such as the iron-responsive elements.","['Alam, J', 'Smith, A']","['Alam J', 'Smith A']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation, New Orleans, Louisiana 70121.']","['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '9013-71-2 (Hemopexin)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)']",['DK-37463/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The virus encodes a 40-kDa protein, tax, that is important for the immortalization of T cells. Expression of tax activates several cellular transcription factors, including NF kappa B. We have previously identified two functional NF kappa B binding sites within the murine c-myc gene: upstream regulatory element (URE) and internal regulatory element (IRE). Using transient cotransfection analysis of Jurkat or HeLa cells, we report that tax can transactivate chimeric TK-CAT constructs containing multiple copies of wild-type URE or IRE, but not constructs with mutated versions of these elements. Furthermore, tax induced transcriptional activity of murine and human c-myc promoter-CAT hybrid genes in Jurkat and HeLa cells. A mutated tax expression vector, which fails to activate NF kappa B, was unable to induce either murine or human c-myc-CAT or URE/IRE-TK-CAT constructs. Mutant c-myc gene-CAT constructs, in which the URE and IRE were mutated either singly or in combination by site directed mutagenesis, displayed significantly reduced CAT activation upon cotransfection with a tax expression vector. These results suggest that tax can transactivate the c-myc gene through NF kappa B. The tax-induced stimulation of this oncogene may play a role in T cell immortalization.","['Duyao, M P', 'Kessler, D J', 'Spicer, D B', 'Bartholomew, C', 'Cleveland, J L', 'Siekevitz, M', 'Sonenshein, G E']","['Duyao MP', 'Kessler DJ', 'Spicer DB', 'Bartholomew C', 'Cleveland JL', 'Siekevitz M', 'Sonenshein GE']","['Department of Biochemistry, Boston University School of Medicine, Massachusetts 02118.']","['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']","['AG00115/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AI07309/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL07429/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,"['c-myc', 'tax']",,,,,,,,,,

Chemically induced differentiation of MEL cells as assessed by beta-globin mRNA and hemoglobin accumulation was inhibited in RI mutant and PKI transfectants; adding zinc further inhibited differentiation in the transfectants but had no effect on parental MEL cells. The inhibition of differentiation correlated with the amount of RI mutant mRNA and protein in the RI mutant transfectants and with the cells' degree of cAMP-dependent protein kinase deficiency in both the RI mutant and PKI transfectants.

The most fundamental of these differences concerns the choice of parameter to be estimated: the ""excess lifetime risk"" is the difference in lifetime risks between exposed and unexposed populations; the ""risk of exposure-induced death"" is the lifetime risk of dying of a disease attributable to exposure. These two quantities are not the same, even at low doses. Although both quantities have some utility in risk assessment, the ""risk of exposure-induced death"" comes closer to capturing the total impact of exposure. Other differences between reported risk estimates include details of the calculations, the baseline rates and age distributions of the exposed population, the forms of the models for excess rates, handling of organ-specific doses, and the groupings of cancer sites. These issues are discussed theoretically and illustrated with comparisons of the BEIR V and UNSCEAR reports.

(1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 15823-15831]. In this study, parameters that modulate the effects of ceramide on HL-60 cell growth and differentiation were examined. A short-chain, cell-permeable analog of ceramide, C2-ceramide, induced differentiation of HL-60 human leukemia cells and inhibited HL-60 growth in a concentration-dependent manner. The potency of C2-ceramide was modulated by the starting cell density such that the concentration of C2-ceramide producing 50% inhibition of cell growth (IC50%) ranged from 2 microM (for cells suspended at 1 x 10(5) cells/ml) to 11 microM (for cells at 8 x 10(5) cells/ml). However, the IC50% showed little variation if the concentration of C2-ceramide was expressed as fmol of C2-ceramide per 10(5) cells. Therefore, the effectiveness of C2-ceramide appeared to be primarily determined by its cellular rather than molar concentration. Binding of C2-ceramide to serum proteins resulted in a 10-fold increase in the IC50%. These results demonstrate that the biologic activity of C2-ceramide is subject to surface dilution kinetics and is sensitive to the presence of lipid-binding proteins. In these properties, ceramide behaves as a prototypic lipid second messenger/intracellular mediator.","['Bielawska, A', 'Linardic, C M', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Bielawska A', 'Linardic CM', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710.']",['0 (Ceramides)'],['GM-43825/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

During this differentiation and retrodifferentiation process the cells obviously establish a distinct sequence of biological processes which is integrally regulated to simultaneously control differentiation and cell growth. Thus, induction of monocytic markers by TPA is associated with a down-regulation of cell cycle genes and cessation of proliferation. In particular, crosstalk between the TPA-induced translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) and the activation of transcription factors, especially AP-1, enhances the expression of genes associated with the monocytic phenotype. This is accompanied by induction of intermediate filament proteins, surface glycoproteins, changes in membrane properties and intracellular metabolism. In parallel, the cells cease to divide, and genes associated with cell cycle progression including cdc2, cyclins, cdc25, and histones are down-regulated. Although signals responsible for arrested cell growth remain unclear, there are several control mechanisms regarding cell cycle genes and differentiation parameters (for a review, see Nigg, E. A., Seminars in Cell Biol., 2, 262-270, 1991). For example, activated p34cdc2 kinase is involved in lamina disassembly by direct phosphorylation of lamin proteins which may contribute to nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis (Enoch, T., M. Peter, P. Nurse, J. Cell Biol. 112, 797-807 (1991)). Moreover, endomembrane traffic is arrested by a cdc2-like kinase probably via phosphorylation of members of the rab protein family which contributes to vesiculation and membrane transport by hydrolyzing GTP (Tuomikoski, T., et al., Nature 342, 942-945 (1989)). Although there are several reports on a possible feedback control between differentiation and cell cycle, including phosphorylation of cyclins and activation of a ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic degradation, signaling pathways and possible mechanisms for retrodifferentiation and reentry into the cell cycle remain unclear. While some terminally differentiated cells are committed to die, the major part of the differentiated monocytic population undergoes retrodifferentiation. All cellular signals characterized so far are reverted during retrodifferentiation: Redistribution of PKC and down-regulation of c-fos and c-jun contribute to an interruption of the differentiation-associated transsignaling cascade. Thus, down-regulation of markers associated with monocytic differentiation in combination with metabolic changes restore the original cell phenotype. At the same time cell cycle genes are up-regulated, and the cells regain proliferative capacity. Finally, retrodifferentiated and untreated control cells demonstrate indistinguishable properties.","['Hass, R']",['Hass R'],"['Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']","['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,,,121,,,,,,,,

To examine the reason for this difference in response, we carried out an alkaline elution assay using proteinase K to study DNA interstrand cross-linking. At early time points, equal concentrations of DAG produced the same level of interstrand cross-linking (ICL) in the resistant and sensitive P388 leukemic cells, although marked differences were observed in their cytotoxicity toward the two cell lines. In the sensitive cells, neither the amount of DNA cross-linking nor the cytotoxicity changed during the observation period (38 h) in either the presence or the absence of BA. In contrast, the elution rate of the DNA of DAG-treated resistant cells increased with time and had reached the control levels by 38 h. However, when these cells were postincubated with BA for 38 h, the elution rate of DNA was much faster than that observed for the untreated resistant cells, indicating an accumulation of DNA single-strand breaks (SSB). The SSB accumulation caused by BA was associated with an inhibition of the activity of ligase II enzyme, which was stimulated when resistant cells were treated with DAG alone. The potentiating effect of BA on the resistant cells can thus be related to the inhibiting action of BA on the DNA-rejoining enzyme, ligase II. The lack of sensitization by BA of the DAG-treated parent cell line may be attributable to the absence of DNA-SSB formation, which is necessary for ligase II activation through the stimulation of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis.","['Institoris, E', 'Fox, B W', 'Palyi, I']","['Institoris E', 'Fox BW', 'Palyi I']","['National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary.']","['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '4S465RYF7M (Dianhydrogalactitol)', '6X80438640 (benzamide)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Ligases)', 'EC 6.5.1.1 (DNA Ligase ATP)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Estimated creatinine clearance (CrCest) as calculated from the patient's age, weight, and serum creatinine level has been suggested as an adequate surrogate for CrCmeas, as it provides advantages of improved convenience, decreased cost, and possibly increased accuracy. We studied 847 patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocols to determine whether the CrCmeas, CrCest, or serum creatinine value or the age of the patient would predict the subsequent genitourinary (GU) toxicity. Both CrCmeas (P = 0.001) and CrCest (P = 0.02) were predictive of subsequent grade 2+ GU toxicity, with CrCmeas being a slightly better predictor. Patient age also influenced subsequent GU toxicity, with the risk increasing with age (P = 0.0008). When patients were classified by age group and by CrCmeas, distinct subgroups were identified, with differences in the risk for grade 2+ GU toxicity ranging from 14% to 32%. Using a logistic model to assess the probability of grade 2+ GU toxicity, we found that an age of greater than or equal to 60 years (P = 0.005), a CrCmeas value of less than 75 ml/min (P = 0.004), and the risk characteristics of the individual cisplatin trial were important, whereas CrCest was not.

The colony growth pattern of MDS marrow cells is remarkably similar to that of acute myeloid leukemia but quite dissimilar from that of normal marrow, in support of a common pathophysiological mechanism for these two disorders. In particular, L-ascorbic acid (LAA) enhanced colony growth in 30% and suppressed growth in 16% of cases, a finding also similar to that in acute myeloid leukemia, indicating a unique growth requirement which may be explored for therapeutic purposes. Further, these LAA effects have prognostic value, with LAA-sensitive (both LAA-enhanced and LAA-suppressed) cases displaying shorter survivals than LAA-insensitive cases (median survival of 5 months versus 18 months; P = 0.011). This prognostic value is independent of, and more powerful than, bone marrow blasts; the median survival was 18 months for less than 5% bone marrow blasts and 8 months for greater than 5% bone marrow blasts (P = 0.044). These two risk factors can be used together to identify patients with an extremely good or an extremely poor prognosis. This study establishes the clinical usefulness of the LAA effect in MDS as a prognostic factor and provides a new lead to explore in understanding differential biochemical/molecular events and, possibly, a new therapeutic approach to the management of MDS.","['Park, C H', 'Kimler, B F', 'Bodensteiner, D', 'Lynch, S R', 'Hassanein, R S']","['Park CH', 'Kimler BF', 'Bodensteiner D', 'Lynch SR', 'Hassanein RS']","['Department of Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City 66160.']",['PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)'],"['K04 CA 00534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 20717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the classic type, many nodular lesions were seen on the skin of the extremities and a few on the trunk, some of which were ulcerated. Most lesions regressed in 1.5 years. In four other patients (three without AIDS and one with AIDS), many plaques and a few nodular lesions were seen on the trunk, face, and extremities. The other patient with AIDS showed Kaposi sarcoma only in the lymph nodes and perineural tissues in the abdomen. METHODS: Immunohistochemical and lectin histochemical studies were done on deparaffinized sections and on cells cultured from small pieces of tumor mass from the classic type Kaposi sarcoma. Isolation of viruses from tumor tissue was also attempted. RESULTS: Large numbers of endothelial cells lining irregular vascular spaces, and some spindle cells showed positive reactions for Factor VIII-related antigen, Ulex europaeus 1 (UEA-1) (E.Y. Labs, Inc., San Mateo, CA), Griffonia simplicifolia (GS-1) (E.Y. Labs, Inc.) lectins, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor antigen. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B, herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, papillomavirus antigens, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 core antigen were not seen in any patients, except in the patient with AIDS in whom CMV was demonstrated in tissues adjacent to the tumor (Patient 6). In cell culture, elongated spindle cells proliferated in plate and also in three-dimensional cultures. The cells were positive immunohistochemically for Factor VIII-related antigen and EGF receptor. They also stained lectin histochemically with UEA-1 and GS-1. Tube formations were demonstrated by electron microscopic study. CONCLUSIONS: Six cases of Kaposi sarcoma have been diagnosed within a short time span where this condition has previously been said to be rare. The studies suggest a vascular endothelial cell origin and growth factor regulated growth for this tumor.","['Kamada, Y', 'Iwamasa, T', 'Miyazato, M', 'Sunagawa, K', 'Kunishima, N']","['Kamada Y', 'Iwamasa T', 'Miyazato M', 'Sunagawa K', 'Kunishima N']","['Department of Pathology, Ryukyu University School of Medicine, Nishihara, Japan.']",['0 (Lectins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chicken embryos inoculated at days 9 and 11 of development showed no CAV-infected cells in the thymus, nor in other lymphoid organs. Many CAV-infected cells were detected in the thymic cortex of all chicken embryos inoculated at days 13 and 16 of development and of all chickens inoculated 1, 3, and 7 days after hatching. All embryos and chickens that contained CAV-infected cells in the thymus also contained CAV-infected cells in the bone marrow, but not in the bursa of Fabricius or the spleen. In chickens inoculated at days 14 and 21, only few CAV-infected cells were detected in the thymus, whereas these cells were not detected in thymi of 28-day-old inoculated chickens. Depletion of the thymic cortex was only detected in chickens inoculated from day 16 of embryonic development till day 21 after hatching. Only hematocrit values of the chickens inoculated 1 and 3 days after hatching were below normal. The rationale for the simultaneous susceptibility of cells of the T-cell lineage and cells of the erythrocyte lineage is discussed. As far as the thymus is concerned, the absence of clinical and microscopical signs of CAV infection in older chickens and the inability of CAV to infect embryos at days 9 and 11 of embryonic development may be caused by a lack of susceptible thymocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Jeurissen, S H', 'Janse, M E', 'Van Roozelaar, D J', 'Koch, G', 'De Boer, G F']","['Jeurissen SH', 'Janse ME', 'Van Roozelaar DJ', 'Koch G', 'De Boer GF']","['Central Veterinary Institute, Department of Virology, Lelystad, The Netherlands.']",,,PMC2275848,,,,,,,,,,,,

The normal reference value was appraised by comparison with the percentage of immature cells in the bone marrow. The results showed that the sensitivity of the method was 94.12%, the specificity was 95.86%, the accuracy was 95.50%, the positive predictive value was 82.05% and the negative predictive value was 98.78%.

The metabolism of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine and 5-Aza-2 deoxycytidine (Aza-dC), which are activated via the salvage pathway, was evaluated in cells from Ara-C-sensitive and -resistant myelocytic leukemia cell line (BNML-Cl/0 and BNML-Cl/Ara-C). The combination of HU and Ara-C caused as much as a threefold increase of Ara-CTP; it significantly increased the incorporation of Ara-C into DNA and induced synergistic cytotoxicity, as evaluated in a colony assay. Even in the deoxycytidine (CdR) kinase-deficient Ara-C-resistant cell line, HU was partially able to restore sensitivity to Ara-C and Aza-dC. dCTP levels are reduced during the first 10 h after incubation with HU, but this effect vanishes at the time when phosphorylation is maximal. Increased CdR kinase activity in cell-free extracts could explain the enhanced synthetic salvage pathway activity, which is likely due to the fact that more enzyme is present (Vmax has increased by Km unchanged). RR inhibition combined with Ara-C might provide a means of eliminating leukemic cells with suboptimal anabolic salvage pathway activity, which otherwise survive Ara-C chemotherapy.","['Colly, L P', 'Richel, D J', 'Arentsen-Honders, M W', 'Kester, M G', 'ter Riet, P M', 'Willemze, R']","['Colly LP', 'Richel DJ', 'Arentsen-Honders MW', 'Kester MG', 'ter Riet PM', 'Willemze R']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Leiden, The Netherlands.']","['0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, DMSO was found not to induce detectable changes in PKC distribution in a MEL cell subline (MEL1) which differentiated normally in response to the agent. Nevertheless, the differentiation of MEL1 cells appeared dependent on an early PKC-related event because hemoglobinization was partially blocked by the PKC inhibitor H-7 added to cells within the first 2 h after DMSO induction. Indeed, a rapid (15-60 min) increase in membrane PKC activity was detected in DMSO-treated MEL1 cells using a novel method which quantitates the amount of 'active' PKC in intact membranes. This transient PKC increase resulted from the activation of 'inactive' enzyme already associated with membranes, and not from the translocation of cytosolic PKC. Conventional PKC assays cannot distinguish between active and inactive membrane PKC pools. DMSO also activated inactive membrane PKC in HL-60 cells, but not in S49T-lymphoma and WEHI-231 B-lymphoma cells which do not differentiate in response to DMSO. The results suggest that a rapid and transient increase in membrane PKC activity may be an important early step in DMSO-induced differentiation of erythroleukemia cells.","['Chakravarthy, B R', 'Tremblay, R', 'Macdonald, P', 'Krsmanovic, V', 'Whitfield, J F', 'Durkin, J P']","['Chakravarthy BR', 'Tremblay R', 'Macdonald P', 'Krsmanovic V', 'Whitfield JF', 'Durkin JP']","['Institute for Biological Sciences, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa.']","['EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In exons 5-8 containing highly conserved regions, mobility shifts indicating sequence alterations were detected in four of the 45 patients, and subsequent sequencing was performed. A point mutation resulting in a novel stop codon was detected at codon 213 in one of 23 cases of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (one of five cases of blast crisis). Point mutations causing amino acid substitutions were detected in one of four cases of myelodysplastic syndrome at codon 195, one of three cases of adult T-cell leukaemia at codon 281, and one of eight cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at codon 281, and these missense mutations were accompanied by loss of the wild type allele. Patients harbouring these nonsense and missense mutations were in advanced disease stages.

Assay conditions were selected to enable measurement of free light chains in the concentration range between 0.1 and 20 mg/l. The normal range for free lambda chains in serum was found to be 0.4-4.2 mg/l and for free kappa chains it was 1.6-15.2 mg/l. At diagnosis the serum of most patients with multiple myeloma contained increased levels of the malignant free light chain and in some cases there was also elevation of the non-malignant light chain. The absolute level of the malignant light chain at diagnosis did not correlate with survival nor with laboratory parameters such as IgM or creatinine. A correlation with beta 2 M and serum paraprotein levels was evident only in cases of IgA myeloma. Although the absolute level of free serum light chain had no value as a prognostic indicator, the ratio of kappa:lambda chains closely followed the clinical assessment of disease status, being near the normal range (1.2-9.1) in plateau phase or stable disease.

A breakpoint in the major translocation cluster of the BCL-1 locus was found in six of these cases. These patients were male with lymphomatous involvement of the bone marrow, marked splenomegaly and frequently had mucosa associated lymphoid tissue involvement. One patient with IDLL had a t(8;11)(p21;q13) and a rearranged BCL-1 locus, suggesting that this may be a variant of t(11;14)(q13;q32). Diagnoses of IDLL, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and monocytoid B cell lymphoma were made in all but one of the remaining cases. These cases had either a translocation involving 11q13-14 and various partner chromosomes or an 11q13 deletion.

All patients had over 70% lymphocytes coexpressing the CD5/CD23 antigens. While less than 1% interphase nuclei showed three fluorescent spots in 16/20 patients, evidence of trisomy 12 in 15-25% interphase cells was detected in four patients. According to the FAB classification the diagnosis in these patients was typical B-CLL, stage III (Rai's staging system) in one case, CLL/PLL, stage II and III in two cases, PLL, stage III in one case. In order to confirm these results, NISH was repeated after 1 month in one patient and after 2 years in three patients. All patients had been treated with chemotherapy in the period between the two NISH experiments. In all cases a 1.8-3-fold increase of percentage of trisomic interphase cells was detected. These findings suggest that in B-CLL clones with trisomy 12 may have proliferative advantage over clonal B-lymphocyte without +12 and, possibly, that they may be more resistant to chemotherapy. We conclude that NISH is a sensitive technique allowing for the detection and monitoring of trisomy 12 in a fraction of B-CLL patients with normal karyotype or with no analysable mitoses despite employment of polyclonal B-cell mitogens.","['Cuneo, A', 'Wlodarska, I', 'Sayed Aly, M', 'Piva, N', 'Carli, M G', 'Fagioli, F', 'Tallarico, A', 'Pazzi, I', 'Ferrari, L', 'Cassiman, J J']","['Cuneo A', 'Wlodarska I', 'Sayed Aly M', 'Piva N', 'Carli MG', 'Fagioli F', 'Tallarico A', 'Pazzi I', 'Ferrari L', 'Cassiman JJ', 'et al.']","['Institute of Haematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['0 (DNA Probes)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were divided into three groups on the basis of age at presentation (under 6 months: group 1: 6-12 months: group 2; 13-18 months: group 3). There were three cases of T-ALL (2.6%). The proportion of other subtypes was: common ALL in 59 patients (52.68%), pre-B ALL in 15 patients (13.3%), pre-pre-B ALL in 27 (24.1%) and acute undifferentiated leukaemia (AUL) in eight patients (7.14%).

Conversely, immature phenotypes (pre-pre-B and AUL) were found more often in the younger patients of groups I and II, as well as anomalous phenotypes, such as the presence of myeloid antigens (MyAg) and of CD7. Prognostic significance was evaluated as event-free survival (EFS) by statistical analysis. A better outcome in CD10-positive ALL than in CD10-negative ones (48% v. 25% of long-term survivors) was demonstrated in all infants. Similarly, EFS was significantly better in MyAg-negative than in MyAg-positive cases. These results were confirmed also when adjusting for white blood cell count. This allowed the identification of CD10-negative, MyAg-positive ALL, which were relatively more frequent in infants and had a poorer clinical outcome with the current therapies. This study stresses the prognostic relevance of the immunological study in infant leukaemias and its utility in choosing different therapeutic modalities for poor risk phenotypes.","['Basso, G', 'Putti, M C', 'Cantu-Rajnoldi, A', 'Saitta, M', 'Santostasi, T', 'Santoro, N', 'Lippi, A', 'Comelli, A', 'Felici, L', 'Favre, C']","['Basso G', 'Putti MC', 'Cantu-Rajnoldi A', 'Saitta M', 'Santostasi T', 'Santoro N', 'Lippi A', 'Comelli A', 'Felici L', 'Favre C', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova, Italy.']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The progression of murine leukemia is characterized by increases in the intensities of the resonances of Pi and phosphomonoesters (PME), in particular, phosphorylethanolamine, in liver; phosphodiester (PDE) signals increase two- to four-fold during the period of rapid tumor growth and decline to undetectable levels in the terminal stage. There were no reliable alterations detected in the ATP content and intracellular pH throughout the course of the leukemia. The kinetics of intracellular phosphates are similar in various kinds of leukemia but quite different in EAT. The reduction of inoculum causes the appearance of maxima in the Pi and PME profiles in the latent period of La leukemia, but the profiles of liver PDE considered from the end of the latent period are independent of inoculum. Possible mechanisms for the changes in PDE concentrations and their biochemical role are discussed.

Due to its effects on cellular deoxyribonucleotide pools, hydroxyurea can modulate the activity of several pyrimidine and purine antimetabolites. As an inhibitor of DNA repair, it can potentially interact with DNA-damaging agents such as alkylating agents or inhibitors of topoisomerase II. Both cytokinetic and biochemical interactions occur between hydroxyurea and cytarabine (ara-C), which account for their synergistic cytotoxicity. Inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase by hydroxyurea depletes cellular deoxycytidine triphosphate pools, thereby enhancing ara-C uptake and phosphorylation to ara-C triphosphate. In a phase II clinical trial, the combination of hydroxyurea and ara-C produced a 43% response rate in patients with refractory malignant lymphoma. Studies in murine leukemia models have demonstrated therapeutic synergy when hydroxyurea is combined with fluoropyrimidines. High levels of deoxyuridine monophosphate that have been associated with resistance to 5-fluorouracil can be suppressed by hydroxyurea, leading to greater inhibition of thymidylate synthase. Despite the strong biochemical rationale for the use of hydroxyurea and 5-fluorouracil in combination, few clinical trials have been conducted thus far. Antimetabolites and topoisomerase II inhibitors have also been shown to be synergistic in vitro. Hydroxyurea has been shown to enhance the formation of DNA strand breaks produced by amsacrine and to produce synergistic cytotoxicity with etoposide. A phase I clinical trial of these drugs has demonstrated bone marrow suppression to be the major toxicity of the combination. In summary, hydroxyurea has been shown to undergo cytokinetic and biochemical interactions with a number of established antitumor agents. Clinical trials of hydroxyurea in combination with these agents have identified doses and schedules of administration that produce acceptable levels of clinical toxicity and appear feasible for further testing.","['Schilsky, R L', 'Ratain, M J', 'Vokes, E E', 'Vogelzang, N J', 'Anderson, J', 'Peterson, B A']","['Schilsky RL', 'Ratain MJ', 'Vokes EE', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Anderson J', 'Peterson BA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, IL.']",['X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)'],"['CA 16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,31,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated the effect of achieving a predetermined level of myelosuppression using hydroxyurea on bone marrow cytogenetics in CML. Fourteen patients with chronic phase CML received 25 cycles of therapy. Fourteen of the 25 cycles were associated with cytogenetic responses consisting of 25% or more Ph1 negative metaphases (range, 25% to 100%). Nine of the responses consisted of 50% or greater Ph1 negative metaphases. Toxicity was exclusively due to consequences of myelosuppression, including febrile neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. In chronic phase CML, hydroxyurea induces cytogenetic responses with tolerable toxicity and is an attractive agent for further study as a component of treatment strategies aimed at eradicating the Ph1 + population in CML.","['Kolitz, J E', 'Kempin, S J', 'Schluger, A', 'Wong, G Y', 'Berman, E', 'Jhanwar, S', 'Arlin, Z A', 'Gee, T', 'Clarkson, B D']","['Kolitz JE', 'Kempin SJ', 'Schluger A', 'Wong GY', 'Berman E', 'Jhanwar S', 'Arlin ZA', 'Gee T', 'Clarkson BD']","['Department of Medicine, North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, Manhasset, NY 11030.']",['X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern blotting showed allele deletion in KCL-22 and cytogenetic studies showed a chromosome 17 deletion in KYO-1 but no gross structural abnormalities in the other two lines. Northern blotting showed increased amounts of normal size p53 mRNA in BV-173 and KYO-1, trace amounts in KCL-22, and none in K562. Direct sequencing of p53 cDNA revealed a missense point mutation in KYO-1 and a single base pair deletion consistent with a coding frame shift in KCL-22. Both abnormalities in these myeloid cell lines were located in the highly conserved region of p53. Studies with two monoclonal antibodies showed that the three cell lines with p53 mRNA had readily detectable p53 proteins. In KYO-1 and BV173 cells the p53 protein was located mainly in the nuclei but KCL-22 cells had weak staining in the cytoplasm. Our data support the assumption that inactivation of p53 tumor suppressor function in myeloid blast transformation of CML may result from point mutations or deletions that produce mutant proteins.","['Bi, S', 'Hughes, T', 'Bungey, J', 'Chase, A', 'de Fabritiis, P', 'Goldman, J M']","['Bi S', 'Hughes T', 'Bungey J', 'Chase A', 'de Fabritiis P', 'Goldman JM']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",,,,,['p53'],,,,,,,,,,

The malignant cell is morphologically unique and characterized by fine cytoplasmic projections. Although studies of the cell have revealed important information about its proliferative capacity, cell surface, and membrane composition, less is known about the metabolic characteristics of the cell. We have previously investigated the oxidative metabolism of the hairy cell and have suggested that hairy cells might have a unique glucose metabolism compared to normal lymphocytes. This is indicated by a high rate of [6-14C]glucose oxidation in short-term culture consistent with an active Kreb's cycle and a high ratio of [6-14C]glucose oxidation to [1-14C] glucose oxidation. In this study, we evaluated an additional group of patients with hairy cell leukemia prior to or after treatment with the experimental drug 2'-deoxycoformycin (dCF). We found that in seven of eight patients the leukemic cells had a pattern similar to that previously described and that all of these seven patients had a significant response to therapy. The cells of the eighth patient had minimal Kreb's cycle activity, and at the time of study the patient was resistant to therapy with dCF. The metabolic activity of hairy cells may distinguish them from other lymphoid populations and may be a marker for sensitivity to dCF.","['Kraut, E H', 'Husney, R M', 'Sagone, A L Jr']","['Kraut EH', 'Husney RM', 'Sagone AL Jr']","['Ohio State University, Department of Internal Medicine, Columbus 43210.']","['395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore investigated the early effect of the potent differentiation-inducing anthracycline antitumor antibiotic, aclacinomycin A, on the c-myc and c-myb mRNA levels in the Friend cell line, F4-6, using Northern blot analysis. Aclacinomycin A induced a rapid decrease in the levels of c-myc and c-myb transcripts within 0.5-1 h and 2-3 h, respectively. The time course of decline in c-myc and c-myb expression was similar to that observed with dimethylsulfoxide or after transcription blockage brought about by a high concentration of actinomycin D. By 12 to 18 h after aclacinomycin A exposure, the c-myc and c-myb mRNA levels had returned to about pretreatment levels. When the cells were treated with adriamycin, an anthracycline that reduces cell proliferation in F4-6 cells without increasing differentiation, an early decrease in c-myc and c-myb expression was not observed.

To further characterize this T-cell population, we have quantified production of both granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) production in a total of 98 T-cell clones (TCC) derived from CD25+ activated T cells present in HD LN; TCC derived from CD25+ T cells obtained from B-NHL LN(101 TCC), BH LN(95 TCC), and peripheral blood (PBL; 38 TCC) of healthy donors were used as controls.

Following an 18 h exposure to IL-3 plus IL-6, treatment with 4-HC in conjunction with IL-3 and IL-6 for one hour resulted in a significantly greater inhibition of L-CFU versus CFU-GEMM colony growth. In addition, treatment with IL-3 plus IL-6 reduced the inhibitory effects of higher concentrations of 4-HC on CFU-GEMM but not L-CFU growth. IL-3 and IL-6 did not protect the self-renewing, clonogenic, AML blast progenitor cells from the cytotoxic effects of 4-HC. While the total intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels were not significantly different between untreated normal bone marrow mononuclear cells (NBMMC) and AML blasts, greater intracellular GSH-S transferase activity was observed in the NBMMC. 4-HC produced a marked reduction in GSH levels in NBMMC as well as AML blasts. But treatment with IL-3 plus IL-6 in conjunction with 4-HC resulted in significantly higher GSH levels in NBMMC. These differences in intracellular GSH levels and GST activity may offer an explanation for the differential protective effects of IL-3 plus IL-6 treatment against the cytotoxic effects of 4-HC on CFU-GEMM colony growth.","['Bhalla, K', 'Bullock, G', 'Lutzky, J', 'Holladay, C', 'Ibrado, A M', 'Jasiok, M', 'Singh, S']","['Bhalla K', 'Bullock G', 'Lutzky J', 'Holladay C', 'Ibrado AM', 'Jasiok M', 'Singh S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425.']","['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that the activity of the 5-phosphomonoesterase (5-PME) enzyme which cleaves and inactivates these second messengers was strikingly reduced in HL60 cells compared to normal granulocytes or macrophages. Induction of differentiation of HL60 cells along the monocyte/macrophage or granulocytic pathways did not result in a significant increase in 5-PME activity. The activity of this enzyme was also low in extracts of bone marrow mononuclear cells from four patients with myeloid leukemia. A lesion in the 5-PME pathway may therefore result in the conservation of Ca(2+)-regulating second messengers in the HL60 cell line and in some myeloid leukemia cells.

While a response occurs regularly, it has not been unequivocally resolved whether this effect is due to the stimulation of normal hemopoiesis or to induced maturation of the abnormal clone. To determine whether selective responses to colony-stimulating factors of normal versus abnormal clones occurred, cytogenetic analysis was performed on bone marrow cells of MDS patients before and during in vivo treatment with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO). A proliferation of additional clones could be demonstrated by karyotypic analysis in one patient during GM-CSF therapy and in two patients during rhEPO treatment. Two patients, initially with completely normal cytogenetics, developed a mixture of normal and abnormal metaphases during treatment. Two patients, initially with all abnormal metaphases, developed normal metaphases during treatment with GM-CSF. A mosaic of normal and abnormal metaphases was present in six patients. The percentage of abnormal metaphases increased in three patients during GM-CSF treatment, and in one patient during rhEPO therapy. The cytogenetic anomalies in one patient persisted after clinical response to treatment, suggesting that GM-CSF enhanced maturation of the abnormal clone.

Even during prolonged clinical follow-up, most of these patients do not relapse. However, because of the limited sensitivity of cytogenetic techniques (approximately 5%) and Southern blots (approximately 1%), it is uncertain whether the residual malignant clone becomes extinct or persists below the limit of detection in these patients. We used polymerase chain reaction to amplify the chimeric BCR-ABL transcripts in 18 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia who became Ph1 chromosome negative while receiving treatment with interferon-alpha, either alone or in combination with interferon-gamma. At the time of study, these patients had been Ph1-negative for a median of 22+ months. Fifteen patients were positive for residual BCR-ABL transcripts. No residual BCR-ABL message was detected on analysis of multiple serial samples in three patients. In order to confirm these results, the samples from these three patients, along with positive and negative controls, were analyzed by two independent laboratories in a blinded fashion. In the first laboratory, RNA specimens from all three patients were considered negative using chemiluminescent acidinium-ester-labeled probes. In the second laboratory, samples from all three patients were also negative by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, when a second round of amplification was carried out on the amplified samples using a different combination of primers, samples from two of the three patients were positive. The results confirm the presence of a small proportion of BCR-ABL-positive cells in the majority of patients who are in complete remission and highlight some of the potential problems of PCR-based analysis. There is a need to standardize PCR methodology and potential confounding factors need to be addressed before PCR can be generally applied to analysis of minimal residual disease in CML. The implications of BCR-ABL positivity for these patients are discussed.","['Dhingra, K', 'Kurzrock, R', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Baine, R', 'Eastman, P S', 'Ku, S', 'Gutterman, J U', 'Talpaz, M']","['Dhingra K', 'Kurzrock R', 'Kantarjian H', 'Baine R', 'Eastman PS', 'Ku S', 'Gutterman JU', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']","['0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When nonadherent cells were separated on discontinuous Percoll gradients, only the cells in the less dense Percoll fractions produced IFN, whatever the virus used. By indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies to HLA-DR and to Leu 11b, the distribution of the HLA-DR+ cells was shown to resemble most closely that of the IFN-producing population. Elimination of these cells (by complement-mediated lysis with the same antibodies) abrogated the IFN response, but NK cells remained and thus do not produce IFN-alpha. In confirmation, elimination of the Leu 11b+ cells had no effect on the amount of IFN produced.

We have been interested in determining whether this temporal correlation indicates a causal connection between these two processes. We have compared V(D)J recombination minichromosome substrates that have transcripts running through the recombination zone with substrates that do not in a transient transfection assay. In this system, the substrates acquire a minichromosome conformation within the first several hours after transfection. We find that the substrates recombine equally well over a 100-fold range in transcriptional variation. In additional studies, we have taken substrates that have low levels of transcription and inhibited transcription further by methylating the substrate DNA or by treating the cells with a general transcription inhibitor (alpha-amanitin). Although these treatments decrease the level of expression an additional 10-100-fold, there is still no observable effect on V(D)J recombination. Based on these results, we conclude that transcription is not necessary for the V(D)J reaction mechanism and does not alter substrate structure at the DNA level or at the simplest levels of chromatin structure in a way that affects the reaction.","['Hsieh, C L', 'McCloskey, R P', 'Lieber, M R']","['Hsieh CL', 'McCloskey RP', 'Lieber MR']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305-5324.']","['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']","['5T32 AI 07290-07/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM43236/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty patients received local-regional radiotherapy (generally to the chest wall, internal mammary, supraclavicular, +/- axillary nodal areas; minimum 44-50 Gy, 1.8-2 Gy/fraction, +/- 10-15 Gy scar boost; standard radiation techniques). The first nine patients did not receive local-regional radiotherapy. Three developed a local-regional failure (6-12 months after HDCT); six are without evidence of disease. Local-regional radiotherapy (LR XRT) was delivered to the subsequent 40 patients following HDCT+autologous bone marrow transplant. Six received less than 44 Gy of the planned local-regional radiotherapy due to significant toxicity and one of these failed locally. Only one local failure was observed among the 34 patients who received greater than or equal to 44 Gy. Two additional patients developed distant metastases. None of these 40 patients have failed in the axilla despite the fact that the axilla was irradiated in only 18 cases. Overall, 36/40 (90%) of these patients are without evidence of disease 4-30 months following HDCT (approximately 10-36 months after mastectomy, median 22 months). Radiotherapy was interrupted or discontinued because of progressive dyspnea, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia in nine patients. Further studies to determine the roles of local-regional radiotherapy and HDCT in the development of these toxicities are underway. These encouraging results suggest that HDCT + autologous bone marrow transplant+local-regional radiotherapy may improve the survival rate in these high risk patients.

This result is surprising, given the potential for homologous recombination between copies of repeated DNA sequences that constitute approximately a third of the human HPRT locus.

This report discusses a detailed phenotypic characterization of molecular markers for hematopoietic differentiation in a basophilic leukemia cell line, KU812. The expression of markers for lymphoid, erythroid, neutrophil, eosinophil, monocytic, megakaryocytic, mast cell and basophil differentiation was analyzed at the mRNA level by Northern blots in the KU812 cells, and for reference, in a panel of human cell lines representative of the different hematopoietic differentiation lineages. KU812 was found to express a number of mast cell and basophil-related proteins, i.e. mast cell tryptase, mast cell carboxypeptidase A, high-affinity immunoglobulin (IgE) receptor alpha and gamma chains and the core protein for heparin and chondroitin sulphate synthesis. We found no expression of a number of monocyte/-macrophage or neutrophil leukocyte markers except for lysozyme. From earlier studies, it has been shown that lysozyme is not expressed in murine mucosal mast cell lines. This finding, together with the expression of the mast cell carboxypeptidase in KU812 might distinguish the phenotype of this cell line from that typical of mucosal mast cell lines in rodents. We found a low level of expression of the eosinophil and basophil marker, major basic protein, which might indicate a relationship between basophils and eosinophils. No expression is, however, detected with the eosinophil-specific markers eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin or eosinophil peroxidase. We also report an extensive screening for inducers of basophilic differentiation of the KU812 cells. The most efficient protocol of induction included serum starvation which led to a dramatic increase in a number of markers specific for mast cells and basophils such as tryptase, carboxypeptidase A and the heparin core protein. Finally, diisopropylfluorophosphate analysis of total protein extracts from KU812 show four labeled protein bands with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating that this cell line expresses at least three previously undescribed serine proteases of which one or more could be a potential basophil-specific marker(s).","['Blom, T', 'Huang, R', 'Aveskogh, M', 'Nilsson, K', 'Hellman, L']","['Blom T', 'Huang R', 'Aveskogh M', 'Nilsson K', 'Hellman L']","['Department of Immunology, University of Uppsala, Sweden.']","['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated interaction between HS2 and the gamma- and beta-promoters using reporter constructs in transient assays in human erythroleukemia (K562) cells. The beta-promoter, usually silent in K562 cells, was activated by HS2. This activity was abolished when a gamma-promoter was linked in cis. Analysis of truncation mutants suggested that sequences conveying the competitive advantage of the gamma-promoter for HS2 included those between positions -53 and -35 relative to the transcriptional start site. This sequence, when used to replace the corresponding region of the beta-promoter, increased beta-promoter activity 10-fold when linked to HS2. The modified beta-promoter was also capable of competing with a gamma-promoter modified internally in the -53 to -35 region, when the two promoters were linked to HS2 in a single plasmid. The corresponding sequences from the Galago gamma-promoter, a species which lacks fetal gamma-gene expression, were inactive in analogous assays. We have identified and partially purified a nuclear protein found in human (fetal stage) erythroleukemia cells, but present in much lower concentration in murine (adult stage) erythroleukemia cells, that binds the -53 to -35 sequence of the gamma-promoter. We speculate that this region of the gamma-promoter functions as a stage selector element in the regulation of hemoglobin switching in humans.","['Jane, S M', 'Ney, P A', 'Vanin, E F', 'Gumucio, D L', 'Nienhuis, A W']","['Jane SM', 'Ney PA', 'Vanin EF', 'Gumucio DL', 'Nienhuis AW']","['National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']","['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",,PMC556778,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these events is loss of wild type p53 expression, which can occur by internal deletion or proviral insertion in the p53 gene and by single point mutations in the coding sequence. In all cases, the corresponding wild type allele is absent. The high frequency of observed p53 mutations strongly suggests that inactivation of p53 may be an obligatory step in the development of Friend disease. Further evidence that abrogation of normal p53 expression contributes to the development of malignant clones was provided by in vitro reconstitution experiments in Friend cell lines: whereas exogenous mutant p53 was stably expressed in p53 negative FCLs, long term wild type p53 expression was not detected. Friend erythroleukaemia arises as a late consequence of infection of susceptible mice with Friend virus. In addition to p53 gene mutations, proviral insertions occur frequently adjacent to one of two cellular genes, Spi-1/PU.1 or Fli-1. Aberrant expression of these genes may therefore be involved in virus induced erythroleukaemia. Interaction of SFFV env gp55 with the EPO-R also appears to be important in providing a mitogenic signal to infected cells. The order in which these events occur and whether the order is relevant to the progression of the disease are not known. Investigation of the stepwise appearance of these events could provide information on the possible interactions of the gene products involved. Abrogation of normal p53 expression is not restricted to Friend erythroleukaemia: the observation of p53 mutations and allele loss in human breast, lung, colon and hepatocellular carcinomas and in leukaemia suggests that mutation of p53 may be the most common genetic abnormality detected in human cancer (reviewed in this issue). Studies of p53 expression in FCLs provided an early indication that p53 was a tumour suppressor gene. Further studies of the mechanisms by which wild type and mutant p53 affect the growth of p53 negative FCLs may reveal important biochemical properties of p53 in relation to cell cycle control and differentiation of erythroid cells.","['Johnson, P', 'Benchimol, S']","['Johnson P', 'Benchimol S']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, University of Toronto, Canada.']",,,,,"['Fli-1', 'SFFV', 'Spi-1/PU.1', 'p53']",,65,,,,,,,,

This agent has a bewildering variety of biological effects both within and on the surface of cells exposed to drug, and it has proved difficult to unambiguously assign a single mechanism of action. In this report we are able to separate intracellular and extracellular actions by taking advantage of the complete lack of Adriamycin-induced cytotoxicity at low temperature. For example, cells exposed to 100 microM Adriamycin at 0 degree C are not killed by the drug, even though this concentration is orders of magnitude higher than the concentration needed to cause 100% cell death at 37 degrees C. If cells exposed to 100 microM Adriamycin at 0 degree C are shifted to fresh drug-free medium at 37 degrees C, there is a time-dependent decrease in survival. However, if the drug-free medium contains calf thymus DNA (1.5 mg/ml) to act as a reservoir for Adriamycin binding of effluxed drug, there is no ensuing cytotoxicity. Thus, the results show that no matter how much drug is present inside the cell, there must also be extracellular drug available for membrane interaction in order to initiate nuclear DNA damage and the cytotoxic cascade.","['Vichi, P', 'Tritton, T R']","['Vichi P', 'Tritton TR']","['Vermont Regional Cancer Center, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington 05405.']","['0 (Culture Media)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This resistance-producing effect of BMT could be enhanced by interleukin 2 administration and could be abrogated by anti-asialo-GM1 antiserum treatment of recipients. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that cells with a natural killer phenotype are activated by BMT and can mediate tumor resistance.

A univariate regression analysis of all the data allows one to recognize that the main factors are: the complexity of karyotype (p = 0.00001), the percentage of type I and total marrow blast cells (p = 0.001), and the abnormal localized immature myeloid precursors' (ALIP) presence (p = 0.001).

In both cases, the donor was a sister, and engrafting was demonstrated by chromosome analyses which showed only donor cells in the BM. Cytogenetic relapse occurred 29 and 30 months after ABMT, respectively, when host cells reappeared: in both cases, the Ph and additional anomalies typical of the blastic phase of CML were evident. We then monitored the chromosome picture for 52 and 39 months, respectively: no striking evolution occurred, and cells with the Ph and additional anomalies persisted together with donor cells, which were a minority in the first patient and a great majority in the second throughout the observation period. A clinical relapse was observed in the first patient, but the disease never progressed to a blastic phase, whereas the second patient has not relapsed 7 years after ABMT. We reviewed data from the literature on cytogenetic relapse after ABMT in CML without clinical relapse, especially the 12 patients in whom cytogenetic relapse included chromosome anomalies in addition to the Ph, as in our patients. We suggest that graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reactions in such patients are able to arrest progression of the leukemic blastic clone and prevent a possible relapse in blastic phase.","['Maserati, E', 'Casali, M', 'Fogu, G', 'Sanna, R', 'Invernizzi, R', 'Latte, G', 'Simi, P', 'Gabbas, A', 'Ascari, E', 'Pasquali, F']","['Maserati E', 'Casali M', 'Fogu G', 'Sanna R', 'Invernizzi R', 'Latte G', 'Simi P', 'Gabbas A', 'Ascari E', 'Pasquali F']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Interna, Universita di Pavia, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been reported that addition of Lu-CSF1-conditioned media from a lung adenocarcinoma cell line masks abnormalities in cases of acute leukemia [1.] Because we routinely use GCT-CM in bone marrow and leukemic blood cultures for chromosome analysis in our lab, we investigated this potential effect on our case analysis. We have performed a serial study of a 100 cases of hematologic malignancies received for analysis in our lab to determine the effect of the addition of GCT-CM to our culture media with respect to 1) mitotic index, 2) quality of preparation, and 3) differential selection of either chromosomally normal or abnormal cell lines.

The two selected for review in this article include a biologic-response modifier and a new chemotherapeutic agent. The biologic-response modifiers offer entirely new approaches to these diseases. The most extensively tested agent currently has been recombinant alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN). The IFN are active, albeit weak, remission-induction agents for low-grade NHL and some T-cell lymphomas, but they appear to be ineffective as single agents in most intermediate-grade or high-grade NHL and myeloma. However, an emerging pattern in follicular lymphomas and myeloma is that alpha-IFN in combination with chemotherapy may lead to more complete and durable clinical responses and the increased prospect of prolonged disease control.

As the pattern of expression of bcl-2 in hematopoietic cells is still unclear, we have measured the level of the corresponding messenger RNA (mRNA) in a variety of myeloid and lymphoid cell malignancies not usually associated with the t(14;18) translocation. Molecular genetic analysis showed that bcl-2 was rearranged in only 2 of 77 patients: one was affected by hairy cell leukemia and one by diffuse small cleaved cell lymphoma with peripheral blood invasion. Although in rare cases of myeloid leukemia fairly high levels can be found, the expression of bcl-2 appears to be typical of certain lymphoid malignancies. High levels of bcl-2 mRNA had been found, previously, in established pre-B-cell lines. However, in fresh specimens, the peak level of bcl-2 expression shifts to a more differentiated cell type, represented by the long-living B lymphocytes that are found in most cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. bcl-2 gene product might have a role in prolonging cell survival and, even in the absence of translocations, might contribute to some of the biologic features that are typical of this disorder.","['Mariano, M T', 'Moretti, L', 'Donelli, A', 'Grantini, M', 'Montagnani, G', 'Di Prisco, A U', 'Torelli, G', 'Torelli, U', 'Narni, F']","['Mariano MT', 'Moretti L', 'Donelli A', 'Grantini M', 'Montagnani G', 'Di Prisco AU', 'Torelli G', 'Torelli U', 'Narni F']","['Istituto di Clinica Medica II, Universita di Modena, Italy.']","['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,['bcl-2'],,,,,,,,,,

We studied the effect of MGF on the in vitro growth of clonogenic leukemic precursor cells in the presence or absence of interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and/or erythropoietin (EPO). Leukemic blood and bone marrow cells from patients with various types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, as well as bone marrow samples from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) were studied. MGF as a single factor did not induce significant colony formation by clonogenic leukemic precursor cells. In the presence of IL-3 and/or GM-CSF, MGF weakly stimulated the colony formation by clonogenic precursor cells from patients with AML. In contrast, in the presence of IL-3 and/or GM-CSF, MGF strongly induced both size and number of leukemic colonies from patients with CML in chronic phase. Furthermore, in the presence of EPO, MGF strongly stimulated erythroid colony formation by CML precursor cells. Cytogenetic analysis of the colonies showed that all metaphases after 1 week of culture were derived from the leukemic clone. In patients with MDS, MGF strongly stimulated myeloid colony formation in the presence of IL-3 and/or GM-CSF (up to fourfold), and erythroid colony formation in the presence of EPO (up to eightfold). Not only the number, but also the size of the colonies increased. In the presence of MGF, the percentage of normal metaphases increased in three patients tested after 1 week of culture compared with the initial suspension, suggesting that the normal HPC were preferentially stimulated compared with the preleukemic precursor cells. In the absence of exogenous EPO and in the presence of 10% human AB serum, MGF in the presence of IL-3 and/or GM-CSF induced erythroid colony formation from normal bone marrow and patients with MDS or CML, illustrating that MGF greatly diminished the EPO requirement for erythroid differentiation. These results indicate that MGF may be a candidate as a hematopoietic growth factor to stimulate normal hematopoiesis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, or with myelodysplastic syndromes.","['Goselink, H M', 'Williams, D E', 'Fibbe, W E', 'Wessels, H W', 'Beverstock, G C', 'Willemze, R', 'Falkenburg, J H']","['Goselink HM', 'Williams DE', 'Fibbe WE', 'Wessels HW', 'Beverstock GC', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include somatic hypermutation, V gene replacement, and ongoing gene rearrangement. These mechanisms may be operational at discrete points in the B-cell differentiation pathway and may generate idiotypic diversity in various malignant B-cell tumors. Hypermutation of the Ig variable region has been shown to occur in follicular lymphoma, but not in pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Burkitt's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or myeloma. To study hypermutation in a large cell lymphoma, we use a polymerase chain reaction-based approach, employing consensus VH and JH primers, to clone and sequence rearranged Ig heavy chain variable regions. Neither tumor cells immortalized in rescue fusions nor idiotypic variants of a tumor-derived cell line generated through ongoing lambda light chain gene rearrangements show any significant number of variable region mutations. Thus, at the in vivo stage of B-cell differentiation from which this large cell lymphoma arose, Ig variable region hypermutation was not occurring, nor did it occur during propagation in vitro of these tumor cells. Thus, the window of hypermutation in malignant B-cell tumors is more precisely defined, which may have clinical implications for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches directed at the Ig variable region.","['Stiernholm, N', 'Kuzniar, B', 'Berinstein, N L']","['Stiernholm N', 'Kuzniar B', 'Berinstein NL']","['Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared the growth patterns of blast cell progenitors (CFU-L) in 23 patients with advanced MDS and 32 patients with de novo AML. Circulating blast progenitors were identified in 74% of MDS and 81% of AML samples. Primary plating efficiencies (PE1) were similar in both disorders, despite marked differences in peripheral blast cell concentrations. By cytological and cytochemical examination, colonies from MDS patients were indistinguishable from those obtained in AML. Cell cycle status was assessed by loss of colony formation following short-term exposure to cytosine arabinoside. CFU-L suicide rates (median, range) were 40% (12% to 77%) in MDS and 60.5% (27% to 98%) in AML. Actively proliferating blast cell progenitors are thus not confined to AML, but are also present in the majority of MDS patients. An important difference between MDS and AML was found when self-renewal capacity of CFU-L was examined by means of secondary plating efficiencies (PE2). Colonies could be successfully replated in 74% of AML cases. PE2 showed marked heterogeneity (2 to 730 colonies/10(5) mononuclear cells), with some values indicating excessive self-renewal capacity of CFU-L. In contrast, 62% of the MDS specimens failed to produce any secondary colony growth, and PE2 in the remaining cases was low (5 to 99/10(5) MNC). We conclude that a different balance between self-renewal and determination could be responsible for a slower pace of clonal expansion in MDS, even if the proliferative activity of clonogenic cells is similar to that in AML.","['Aul, C', 'Gattermann, N', 'Schneider, W']","['Aul C', 'Gattermann N', 'Schneider W']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that IL-3 induces rapid increases in protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity in IL-3--dependent cells. Unlike some other hematopoietic growth factor receptors (eg, c-fms and c-kit), however, the known subunits of the IL-3 receptor (IL-3R) lack intrinsic kinase activity. Recently, it was reported that the IL-2R (whose p75 beta-subunit shares sequence homology with a known murine IL-3R subunit and a common beta-subunit of the human IL-3R and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF] receptors) can physically associate with and regulate the activity of the SRC-family PTK, p56-LCK. Because most IL-3--dependent cells contain p53/56-LYN, but not p56-LCK, we explored the effects of IL-3 on the activities of LYN and other SRC-like PTKs in two human leukemic cell lines, AML-193 and TALL-101, which are phenotypically myeloid, and whose in vitro growth is dependent on IL-3. These cells expressed four of the eight known SRC-family proto-oncogenes: lyn, fyn, yes, and hck. When these factor-dependent leukemic cell lines were deprived of lymphokine to achieve cellular quiescence and then restimulated with IL-3, rapid increases (detectable within 1 minute and maximal by 10 minutes) were observed in the activity of the p53/56-LYN kinase, as assessed by in vitro kinase assays. In contrast, no alteration in the activities of other SRC-family PTKs present in these cells was detected after restimulation with IL-3 under the same conditions. This effect of IL-3 reflected an increase in the specific activity of the LYN kinase, because levels of the 53-Kd and 56-Kd LYN proteins were unaltered by IL-3 stimulation, as assessed by immunoblotting. Furthermore, the magnitude of these inducible increases in LYN kinase activity was dependent on the concentration of IL-3, and correlated with IL-3--induced proliferation. The IL-3--induced upregulation of LYN kinase activity may be mediated by the 120-Kd common subunit of the human IL-3 and GM-CSF receptors, because GM-CSF also stimulated marked increases in the activity of the LYN kinase, whereas granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) did not, despite inducing cellular proliferation. These observations provide the first example of an IL-3--regulable PTK, and strongly suggest that the p53/56-LYN kinase participates in early IL-3--initiated signalling events, at least in some human leukemic cell lines.","['Torigoe, T', ""O'Connor, R"", 'Santoli, D', 'Reed, J C']","['Torigoe T', ""O'Connor R"", 'Santoli D', 'Reed JC']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.']","['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']","['CA-47589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-54957/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['SRC', 'fyn', 'hck', 'lyn', 'yes']",,,,,,,,,,

We investigated (a) whether bone marrow cells unable to induce GVHD can effect graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity and (b) whether such antileukemic capacity depends on the presence of T lymphocytes in the graft. Balb/c mice were inoculated with A20 cells, a B-cell lymphoma/leukemia of Balb/c origin. Four weeks after tumor inoculation the animals were lethally irradiated and received a bone marrow graft. Cells from (Balb/c x C57) F1 or (C3H x Balb/c) F1 hybrids were transplanted into parental-strain Balb/c mice. Since lymphocytes from F1 hybrids are unable to cause graft-versus-host reactivity against a parental-strain animal, we used this experimental setting to explore GVL effects in a GVHD-free system. In vitro incubation with monoclonal anti-Thy-1.2 antibody plus complement was used to eliminate Thy-1+ cells. After syngeneic transplantation, the death rate due to leukemia remained unchanged (91%) compared with that among untreated animals (86%). Following transplantation of F1 marrow cells of either (C57 x Balb/c) F1 or (C3H x Balb/c) F1 origin, death rates of 40% and 50% were observed; these were significantly lower. Depletion of Thy 1+ cells from bone marrow graft caused only a slight increase in the leukemic death rate after transplantation of bone marrow of (C57 x Balb/c) F1 hybrid origin (50%), but a high leukemic death rate was seen after transplantation of (C3H x Balb/c) F1 bone marrow (100%). Additional experiments with fully allogeneic, T-cell-depleted C57 bone marrow transplantation suggest an antileukemic effect that is comparable to that seen after transplantation of unmanipulated F1 bone marrow. Taken together, our results indicate that GVL activity can be dissociated from graft-versus-host reaction.","['Glass, B', 'Uharek, L', 'Gassmann, W', 'Focks, B', 'Bolouri, H', 'Loeffler, H', 'Mueller-Ruchholtz, W']","['Glass B', 'Uharek L', 'Gassmann W', 'Focks B', 'Bolouri H', 'Loeffler H', 'Mueller-Ruchholtz W']","['Institute of Immunology, University of Kiel, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using flow cytometric evaluation of equilibrium intracellular levels of daunorubicin (DNR), we found that eight other surface active agents will also reverse MDR. All the active detergents contain polyethoxylated moieties but have no similarities in their hydrophobic components. The properties of three polyethoxylated surfactants that showed the lowest toxicities, Cremophor, Tween 80 and Solutol HS15, were examined in more detail. The concentrations of Tween 80 and Solutol required to reverse DNR exclusion were 10-fold lower than for Cremophor. However while concentrations greater than or equal to 1:10(2) of the former two surfactants resulted in breakdown of cells, even 1:10 of Cremophor did not lyse cells. Studies of the effects of Cremophor on the uptake and efflux of DNR in normal and MDR cell types showed that Cremophor increases intracellular DNR primarily by locking the rapid efflux from the cells. This blockage of drug efflux may be mediated by a substantial alteration in the fluidity of cell membranes induced by Cremophor, as shown by decreased fluorescence anisotropy of a membrane probe. Consistent with these data, coinjection of adriamycin plus Cremophor into mice carrying a multidrug resistant P388 transplantable tumour significantly increased the survival time of the mice compared with adriamycin treatment alone.","['Woodcock, D M', 'Linsenmeyer, M E', 'Chojnowski, G', 'Kriegler, A B', 'Nink, V', 'Webster, L K', 'Sawyer, W H']","['Woodcock DM', 'Linsenmeyer ME', 'Chojnowski G', 'Kriegler AB', 'Nink V', 'Webster LK', 'Sawyer WH']","['Peter MaCallum Cancer Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']","['0 (Surface-Active Agents)', '6D4M1DAL6O (cremophor EL)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'PDC6A3C0OX (Glycerol)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,PMC1977900,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Comprehensive cancer center. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with a morphologic diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia who underwent remission induction treatment with all-trans retinoic acid, 45 mg/m2 body surface area per day. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Nine of 35 patients (26%; 95% CI, 9% to 52%) with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were treated with all-trans retinoic acid developed a syndrome consisting primarily of fever and respiratory distress. Additional prominent signs and symptoms included weight gain, lower-extremity edema, pleural or pericardial effusions, and episodic hypotension. The onset of this symptom complex occurred from 2 to 21 days after starting treatment. Three deaths occurred; post-mortem examinations in two patients showed pulmonary interstitial infiltration with maturing myeloid cells. Six other patients survived, each achieving complete remission (five patients with all-trans retinoic acid only; 1 patient with chemotherapy). In six of the nine cases, the onset of the syndrome was preceded by an increase in peripheral blood leukocytes to a level of at least 20 x 10(9) cells/L. Certain therapeutic interventions, including leukapheresis, temporary cessation of therapy with all-trans retinoic acid, and cytotoxic chemotherapy in moderate doses were not useful after respiratory distress was established. However, the administration of high-dose corticosteroid therapy (dexamethasone, 10 mg IV intravenously every 12 hours for 3 or more days) early in the course of the syndrome resulted in prompt symptomatic improvement and full recovery in three of four patients. CONCLUSIONS: The use of all-trans retinoic acid to induce hematologic remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia is associated in some patients with the development of a potentially lethal syndrome that is not uniformly accompanied by peripheral blood leukocytosis. Early recognition of the symptom complex of fever and dyspnea, combined with prompt corticosteroid treatment, may decrease morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome.","['Frankel, S R', 'Eardley, A', 'Lauwers, G', 'Weiss, M', 'Warrell, R P Jr']","['Frankel SR', 'Eardley A', 'Lauwers G', 'Weiss M', 'Warrell RP Jr']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],"['CA-09207-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FD-R-000674/FD/FDA HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a new monoclonal antibody (PG-M1) directed against a formalin-resistant epitope on macrophages and by employment of the Prussian blue reaction, quantitation of this cell population was feasible. Morphometric analysis revealed that the number of iron-laden macrophages represented only a fraction of the total number of histiocytic reticular cells. As could be expected, in polycythaemia rubra vera, no haemosiderin deposits were detectable, but the content of macrophages slightly exceeded that of the normal bone marrow. In chronic myeloid leukaemia 9 of 30 patients showed a significant increase in PG-M1-positive reticular cell elements. These were consistent with pseudo-Gaucher cells, sea-blue histiocytes and intermediate cell types. Primary (idiopathic) myelofibrosis-osteomyelosclerosis was characterized by a significant increase in macrophages (25 of 30 patients). Involvement of macrophages in the complex mechanisms generating bone marrow fibrosis and angiogenesis and in bone remodelling (osteosclerosis) may be responsible for this finding.","['Thiele, J', 'Braeckel, C', 'Wagner, S', 'Falini, B', 'Dienemann, D', 'Stein, H', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Braeckel C', 'Wagner S', 'Falini B', 'Dienemann D', 'Stein H', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Federal Republic of Germany.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '9011-92-1 (Hemosiderin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Grounded theory methodology was used to elicit the experience of hoping in 10 men and 10 women, ages 20-58, who had undergone BMT. The central process described by participants was that of maintaining hope. The core categories used to describe this process were Dealing With It and Keeping It in Its Place. Dealing With It is defined as the process of confronting the negative possibilities inherent in the illness experience and allowing the full range of thoughts, behaviors, and emotions resulting from this confrontation. Keeping It in Its Place is defined as the process of managing the impact of the illness by controlling or limiting one's response to the disease and therapy. The relationship between these two contradictory core categories is explained by The Dialectic of Maintaining Hope. This dialectic is defined as the synthesis of the antithetical strategies of Dealing With It and Keeping It in Its Place in which people are able to transcend each strategy and sustain hope.

Based on the semantic data model RM/T we propose the design of a database system, report on its realization, and discuss this approach. Using a semantic data model, the quality of data increased considerably. This means, for instance, that the integration of the molecular-biological knowledge allows a better control of the person-related results. Hence, the decisions based of these data may have greater validity and the treatment on leukemia patients can be improved.

The enhancement of RA-induced differentiation and the potentiation of the decrease of PKC activity by sphinganine (SP) seemed to correlate with each other. Kinetically, PKC activity during RA-induced differentiation without SP decreased to its lowest (75% of the control) after 48h; about 50% of the reduction was observed at 24h. In the presence of SP, PKC activity decreased more rapidly to its lowest (60% of the control) within 24h of incubation of RA.

At four years of diagnosis of the lymphoma the appearance of hepatosplenomegaly, leukocytosis with myeloma and basophilia and thrombocytosis were observed. These alterations augmented progressively until a cytogenetic study of the bone marrow two years late established the diagnosis of CML upon demonstrating the presence of the Ph chromosome with no other karyotypic anomalies being observed. The explorations carried out at that time confirmed that the lymphoma continued to be in remission. The CML initially responded to treatment with busulphan.

The absolute number and the percentage values of both LUCs (large unstained cells) and blasts were correlated with survival, as well as with well-known prognostic factors including morphological subtypes of lymphoid cells. Results showed that patients at the most advanced clinical stages (Rai: III and IV; Binet: C) had the highest percentage and count of both LUCs and blasts. Furthermore, the proportion of LUC positively correlated with the following prognostic factors: peripheral lymphocytosis (greater than 50 x 10(9)/l); marked splenomegaly (greater than 10 cm UCM); % of circulating prolymphocytes, % immunoblasts, and % LGL. Our data analysis further revealed that chemotherapy produced a greater reduction of both the LUCs and of the blast count than of that of small lymphocytes. An increase in LUC count was found to coincide with deterioration of clinical status (progressive changes in the clinical stages, occurrence of prolymphocytoid transformation). A rapid increase in blast count was found to occur in concomitance with the development of Richter's syndrome, and correlated positively with the number of peripheral immunoblasts determined by light microscopy. Moreover, a blast percentage higher than 7% had the strongest predictive relation to survival rate when compared with other hematological parameters (lymphocytosis greater than 50 x 10(9)/l, % of LUCs greater than 12%, LUC to lymphocyte ratio greater than 16%, LUCs count greater than 2.2 x 10(9)/l). In the light of these findings, it may be suggested that the presence both of larger proportions of LUCs and of blasts measured with the flow cytometry may be considered unfavorable prognostic factors in B-CLL. However, based on morphological and multivariate statistical analyses, the blast count proved to be the most important prognostic parameter determined by the H*1 system in B-CLL.","['Lanza, F', 'Moretti, S', 'Latorraca, A', 'Scapoli, G', 'Rigolin, F', 'Castoldi, G']","['Lanza F', 'Moretti S', 'Latorraca A', 'Scapoli G', 'Rigolin F', 'Castoldi G']","['Institute of Hematology, St Anna Hospital, Ferrara, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum creatinine was elevated (greater than 120 mumol/liter) in 10 patients and exceeded 400 mumol/liter in three patients. A clear cut relationship between GN and hematologic disease could be established in nine cases: five patients had MPGN caused by type I or type II cryoglobulinemia; two had MPGN or mesangial hypertrophy with circulating and deposited noncryoprecipitating monoclonal IgG K and IgM K, respectively; in the two remaining patients, monotypic IgG K glomerular deposits exhibiting fibrillary organization were observed in association with MGN or MPGN, despite the absence of circulating M-component by immunofixation. The pathophysiologic link between glomerular lesions and B-cell proliferation was further evidenced by effectiveness of specific treatment of the malignancy by chlorambucil.

Moreover, in the five patients with creatininemia greater than 200 mumol/liter who received chemotherapy, substantial improvement in renal function was observed.

Initial response was observed as correction of DIC within a week of treatment. Hematologically, initial increase of maturing leukocytes reached a peak peripheral WBC count on the 16th and 20th day, respectively. However, these seemingly differentiated leukocytes retained Auer body and dysplastic features and there was no concomitant recovery of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages at this point. A sudden drop of leukocyte counts after this peak made a brief period of leukopenia before the complete remission was finally attained morphologically in 4-5 weeks. Thus, remission of APL by ATRA therapy consisted of a two-phase course. In one patient, we observed an increase of histiocytes phagocytizing leukocytes in the marrow during the recovery from leukopenia. It is, therefore, postulated that the two-phase course of recovery may reflect the differentiation of leukemic cells by ATRA and subsequent clearance of senescent cells by the reticuloendothelial system followed by regeneration and differentiation of residual normal hematopoietic stem cells.","['Shimizu, H', 'Min, Z Z', 'Konno, K', 'Kitano, Y', 'Sakakibara, Y', 'Kawai, S', 'Fujimoto, T']","['Shimizu H', 'Min ZZ', 'Konno K', 'Kitano Y', 'Sakakibara Y', 'Kawai S', 'Fujimoto T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aichi Medical University.']",['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parameters considered were tumor extension (pT stage) according to the International Union Against Cancer, tumor invasion into the renal vein or vena cava (V stage), standard histological grading (G stage), nuclear grading (F stage) and microscopic venous infiltration. The pT stage had a significant impact on disease-free survival (p = 0.0004) of patients with radically resected tumors, as did G stage (p = 0.0001) and F stage (p = 0.002). In contrast to some previously reported results tumor extension to the renal vein and vena cava showed no influence on disease-free survival (p = 0.077). On the other hand, microscopic venous infiltration, defined as local tumor infiltration through all vessel structures including the endothelial layer leading to a free tumor extension into the vessel, had a significant impact on disease-free survival (p less than 0.0001). When stratifying either tumor size or nuclear differentiation against microscopic venous infiltration, the latter retained a superior influence on disease-free survival (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0079, respectively).

The administration of d,l-FA results in the accumulation of d-FA in plasma relative to the active l-FA form; in vitro studies have shown that d-FA can compete with the polyglutamation of methotrexate (MTX). PURPOSE: Our purpose was to compare, on a pharmacokinetic, biological, and clinical basis, the racemic mixture d,l-FA with the pure l-FA in rescue of high-dose MTX therapy (5 g/m2) in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Eighteen children with ALL were entered in this trial, which was planned with a crossover design. Four cycles of MTX were administered to each patient, and rescue was achieved orally every 6 hours at a dose of 12 mg/m2 for d,l-FA and 6 mg/m2 for pure l-FA. The d,l-FA and l-FA rescues were alternated from one cycle to the next. d-FA, l-FA, and the active metabolite 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) were measured in plasma using a stereospecific high-performance liquid chromatography assay. RESULTS: Considering total active folate levels (l-FA + 5-MTHF), mean residual concentrations were similar for rescue by d,l-FA and l-FA, after two and six intakes, respectively: 92 and 186 nM for d,l-FA rescue versus 100 and 184 nM for l-FA rescue. Intra-individual comparison of total active folates (l-FA + 5-MTHF) did not show any significant difference between d,l-FA rescue and l-FA rescue. After administration of d,l-FA, the accumulation of d-FA in plasma was confirmed. For both types of FA rescue, MTX terminal half-lives were identical (average value, 13.9 hours). Considering each type of toxic effect (hematologic, hepatic, renal, and digestive), there was no significant difference in the proportion of toxic cycles following l-FA rescue or d,l-FA rescue. CONCLUSION: The administration of the pure l-FA, compared with the administration of the racemic mixture, results in comparable blood profiles of active folates and MTX, leads to equivalent treatment tolerance, and avoids the plasma accumulation of d-FA.","['Etienne, M C', 'Thyss, A', 'Bertrand, Y', 'Touraine, R', 'Rubie, H', 'Robert, A', 'Milano, G']","['Etienne MC', 'Thyss A', 'Bertrand Y', 'Touraine R', 'Rubie H', 'Robert A', 'Milano G']","['Centre Antoine Lacassagne, Nice, France.']","['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study extends these findings. First, a low dose of cyclosporin A (20 mg/kg/day) was ineffective, and treatment initiated 5 days after infection did not protect against virus-induced lymphoproliferation and hypergammaglobulinemia. Second, zidovudine added to drinking water (0.1 mg initiated 5 days after infection and continued for 8 weeks) was more effective than 0.2 mg/mL given day 5-12 after infection. This treatment reduced lymph node size, disease severity as determined histologically, retrovirus-induced gp70 expression, and IgE (but not IgM and IgG) levels.

We have investigated the molecular basis for this stimulation of H-2Dd class I expression. Elevated H-2 mRNA and H-2 transcription are demonstrated in the infected thymocytes as compared to normal thymocytes indicating that the elevation of H-2 surface expression is the result of transcriptional activation. Gel mobility assays performed with nuclear extracts of normal and infected thymocytes and sequences 5' of the H-2Dd gene show that specific binding occurs with both extracts; the binding differs both quantitatively and qualitatively, however. DNase I protection analysis detects a protein binding site that is protected only by extracts from infected cells. The protected region contains a sequence similar to the AP-1 consensus sequence. Gel shift competition assays and UV photo-cross-linking to an oligonucleotide containing this sequence demonstrate that specific binding of an H-2 binding factor 1 occurs and that this factor is not the AP-1 binding complex.

The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the AD1 Ag was nearly identical to that of human CD63 (melanoma-associated Ag ME491). In this study we cloned the cDNA of AD1 Ag from a rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 cDNA library. An open reading frame of 238 amino acids was identified that contained the N-terminal 43 amino acid sequence. No evidence of a signal peptide was found. However, four predominantly hydrophobic stretches of sequence were predicted to form membrane-spanning helices, and three putative N-glycosylation sites were identified. The AD1 Ag and CD63 were highly conserved between rat and human, suggesting that the sequence of this protein is important for its function. By immunostaining various rat tissues, the AD1 Ag was found localized to mast cells. However, it was located to lysosomes, secretory granules and the plasma membrane of RBL-2H3 cells and to lysosomes and plasma membrane of many other cultured cell lines. The AD1 Ag could be induced by placing cells in culture. Fibroblasts and hepatocytes freshly isolated from rat embryos stained very weakly for AD1 Ag; however, after 24 to 48 h in culture they were strongly positive. This increase in the expression of the AD1 Ag was accompanied by an increase in detectable RNA message. Therefore, AD1/ME491/CD63 Ag is a mast cell marker in tissue, but is also associated with other cells in culture.","['Nishikata, H', 'Oliver, C', 'Mergenhagen, S E', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Nishikata H', 'Oliver C', 'Mergenhagen SE', 'Siraganian RP']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Dental Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD63 protein, human)', '0 (Cd63 protein, rat)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tetraspanin 30)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,['GENBANK/X61654'],,,,,,,,,,,

M., and Hannun, Y. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19076-19080). SM is produced from endoplasmic reticulum-derived ceramide and is delivered to organelle membranes in a regulated manner, presumably through the same endomembrane trafficking system used for sorting and delivery of proteins. Since brefeldin A (BFA) interferes with this endomembrane trafficking system and thus alters normal membrane and organelle distribution, we investigated the effect of BFA on SM levels in HL-60 leukemia cells. BFA caused a dose-dependent decrease of 20-25% in cellular SM levels, with effects observed at concentrations of BFA as low as 0.10 microgram/ml. BFA effects on SM levels were noted as early as 5 min and were maximal by 20 min, with no further SM hydrolysis observed up to 60 min following treatment with BFA, suggesting the presence of a fixed SM-sensitive pool. BFA did not cause SM hydrolysis at 16 degrees C, a temperature that inhibits the effects of BFA on endomembrane mixing. The very early effects and temperature dependence of BFA-induced SM hydrolysis suggest that the mechanism of hydrolysis may be closely related to endomembrane mixing. These studies are beginning to define important interrelationships between membrane trafficking and topology, SM metabolism, and cell regulation.","['Linardic, C M', 'Jayadev, S', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Linardic CM', 'Jayadev S', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']","['0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)']",['GM43825/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

One case is in unmaintained remission while one has relapsed with a just palpable spleen on stopping the drug; two are still on intermittent IFN therapy while one has been lost to follow up. Fever and skin rash were the most common side effects observed but did not warrant reduction of dose or stoppage of treatment.

Viral and host factors are probably involved in determining the consequences of infection. Although most of the genome of HTLV-I appears remarkably stable, considerable variation is observed in the long terminal repeat (LTR) which harbors the promoter region. So far, no correlation between specific mutations and pathogenesis has been found, and the current opinion is that sequence variations reflect the geographical origin of the isolate more than the associated pathology. To assess whether the mutations observed between two HTLV-I LTRs were functionally significant, two LTRs, which differ by ten mutations, were coupled to the highly sensitive eukaryotic luciferase-encoding reporter gene, luc, and tested by transfection in a variety of cell lines. Marked differences in promoter activity were observed in some of the cells tested, whereas in other both LTRs were equally active. This result demonstrates that the minor differences observed between two HTLV-I LTRs can affect the activity level of the promoter in some cellular environments, a result which could point to the LTR as one determinant of HTLV-I cell tropism in vivo.","['Gonzalez-Dunia, D', 'Chirinian-Syan, S', 'Brahic, M', 'Ozden, S']","['Gonzalez-Dunia D', 'Chirinian-Syan S', 'Brahic M', 'Ozden S']","['Departement des Retrovirus, UA CNRS 1157, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']","['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,"['luc', 'tax']",,,,,,,,,,

This enzymatic reaction produces dark-blue granules of formazan, which increase cell refringency. In this work, we define the conditions for MTT use in quantitative flow cytometric analysis. MTT reduction provides a non-fluorescent dye usable by this technique to study an intracellular NADH-dependent dehydrogenase activity in vital cells. We observe that formazan production increases asymptotically with cell concentration and that this temperature-dependent Michaelis enzymatic reduction is produced essentially by mitochondrial dehydrogenases. In isolated mitochondria from rat hepatocytes and in whole L1210 murine leukemia cells, the Michaelis constants (KM) observed in the presence of respiratory substrates were, respectively, 10 microM and 500 microM. The inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis by chloramphenicol, which induces a rise of MTT reduction due to the correlative stimulation of glycolysis (Pasteur effect), is a limit of the MTT assay as a cytotoxicity test.","['Huet, O', 'Petit, J M', 'Ratinaud, M H', 'Julien, R']","['Huet O', 'Petit JM', 'Ratinaud MH', 'Julien R']","['Institut de Biotechnologie, Faculte des Sciences, Limoges, France.']","['0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '66974FR9Q1 (Chloramphenicol)', 'EC 1.6.99.3 (NADH Dehydrogenase)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to characterize a putative role of serum in such variations, we have studied the modifications of the cell cycle parameters when cells were induced to differentiate in the presence or in the absence of seric factors. We show that, in the absence of exogenous factors brought by serum, the G1 accumulation was enhanced both in amplitude and in duration, but cells were still able to bypass the G1 block and re-enter into the S phase. These results indicate that the resumption of cell proliferation after the transient block is under synergistic control of seric and endogenous factors, but these later are sufficient to overcome the block. However, MEL cells were unable to differentiate in the absence of seric factors, as measured by the number of benzidine-positive cells during induction with hexamethylene-bisacetamide (HMBA) or butyric acid. This capacity to differentiate was recovered when serum was added back to the culture medium, and the efficiency of recovery was maximal when cells underwent a full round of DNA replication in the presence of serum after the G1 block. The analysis of two molecular markers of cell differentiation confirmed these results.","['Mencherini, F', 'Khochbin, S', 'Chabanas, A', 'Lawrence, J J']","['Mencherini F', 'Khochbin S', 'Chabanas A', 'Lawrence JJ']","[""INSERM Unite 309, Departement de Biologie Moleculaire et Structurale, Centre d'Etudes Nucleaires de Grenoble.""]","['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hematinics)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that morphologically unbalanced mitoses occurred much more frequently in telophase-cell pairs of the heteroploid MCa-11 and HL-60 lines than in those of the chromosomally stable WCHE-5 line. Furthermore, the morphologically unbalanced mitoses represented unequal segregation of DNA into each of the daughter telophase nuclei. Such mitotic segregation errors (MSE) occurred almost exclusively in telophase cells with DNA contents which were above, or below, the DNA content of the modal telophase population.

In this report, we tested for correlations between immediate-early gene expression and some of the cellular responses elicited by OM. We determined that OM stimulated a rapid and transient elevation of EGR-1, c-jun, and c-myc mRNA in human fibroblasts prior to their proliferation. OM also stimulated a transient induction of these genes in M1 leukemic cells that differentiated into nonreplicating, macrophage-like cells. The expression of c-myc, however, decreased significantly as the cells stopped dividing. Interestingly, OM had no detectable effect on the expression of EGR-1, c-jun, and c-myc during the cell cycle arrest of human A375 melanoma cells. Our results indicate that an early nuclear event associated with OM action is the regulation of immediate-early gene expression. We suggest that the transcription factors encoded by the EGR-1, c-jun, and c-myc genes are utilized in both cell proliferation and differentiation but are not part of the mechanism by which OM inhibits A375 cell growth.","['Liu, J', 'Clegg, C H', 'Shoyab, M']","['Liu J', 'Clegg CH', 'Shoyab M']","['Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Seattle, Washington 98121.']","['0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,"['EGR-1', 'c-jun', 'c-myc']",,,,,,,,,,

All three myc oncogenes can cooperate with an activated ras gene to transform primary rat embryo cells (REC), and deregulated expression of c- and L-myc can block differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that N-myc also can block MEL cell differentiation, and we identify regions within the c-Myc protein that are necessary for inhibition of MEL differentiation. C19 MEL cells were transfected with six human c-myc genes which were partially deleted in different areas of the coding region. Four of the genes lack sequences that overlap either the putative transcriptional activation domain, the helix-loop-helix motif, or the leucine zipper motif and were previously shown to have lost REC cotransforming activity (J. Stone, T. DeLange, G. Ramsay, E. Jakobovitz, J.M. Bishop, H. Varmus, and W. Lee, Mol. Cell. Biol., 7: 1697-1709, 1987). In this study, we demonstrate that they also fail to inhibit N,N'-hexamethylene-bis-acetamide-induced differentiation of MEL cells. In contrast, two partially deleted c-myc genes, one lacking a short NH2-terminal region and the other lacking 118 amino acids at the center of the coding region, which were fully active in REC cotransformation, also exhibited full activity associated with the former and only partial activity with the latter in blocking MEL differentiation. We conclude that the mutated genes tested in this study behave similarly in inhibition of MEL cell differentiation and in REC cotransformation.","['Bar-Ner, M', 'Messing, L T', 'Cultraro, C M', 'Birrer, M J', 'Segal, S']","['Bar-Ner M', 'Messing LT', 'Cultraro CM', 'Birrer MJ', 'Segal S']","['NCI-Navy Medical Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20889.']","['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,

We have compared dolastatin 15 with dolastatin 10 for its effects on cells grown in culture and on biochemical properties of tubulin. The IC50 values for cell growth were obtained for dolastatin 15 with L1210 murine leukemia cells, human Burkitt lymphoma cells, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (3, 3, and 5 nM with the three cell lines, respectively). For dolastatin 10, IC50 values of 0.4 and 0.5 nM were obtained with the L1210 and CHO cells, respectively. At toxic concentrations dolastatin 15 caused the leukemia and lymphoma cells to arrest in mitosis. In the CHO cells both dolastatin 15 and dolastatin 10 caused moderate loss of microtubules at the IC50 values and complete disappearance of microtubules at concentrations 10-fold higher. Despite its potency and the loss of microtubules in treated cells, the interaction of dolastatin 15 with tubulin in vitro was weak. Its IC50 value for inhibition of glutamate-induced polymerization of tubulin was 23 microM, as compared to values of 1.2 microM for dolastatin 10 and 1.5 microM for vinblastine. Dolastatin 10 noncompetitively inhibits the binding of vincristine to tubulin, inhibits nucleotide exchange, stabilizes the colchicine binding activity of tubulin, and inhibits tubulin-dependent GTP hydrolysis (Bai et al., Biochem Pharmacol 39: 1941-1949, 1990; Bai et al. J Biol Chem 265: 17141-17149, 1990). Only the latter reaction was inhibited by dolastatin 15. Nevertheless, its structural similarity to dolastatin 10 indicates that dolastatin 15 may bind weakly in the ""vinca domain"" of tubulin (a region of the protein we postulate to be physically close to but not identical with the specific binding site of vinca alkaloids and maytansinoids), presumably in the same site as dolastatin 10 (the ""peptide site"").","['Bai, R', 'Friedman, S J', 'Pettit, G R', 'Hamel, E']","['Bai R', 'Friedman SJ', 'Pettit GR', 'Hamel E']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Tubulin)', '123884-00-4 (dolastatin 15)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EI946JT51X (dolastatin 10)']",['CA-443440-1A1-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements have been detected in some HD cases as well. These findings suggest that at least some cases of HD may be of B-cell derivation. Rearrangements of the bcl-2 gene, associated with the t(14;18)(q32;q21) are present in more than 75% of follicular and 30% of diffuse lymphomas of B-cell origin, suggesting that this translocation plays an important role in B-cell lymphomagenesis. In this study, we investigated 34 cases of HD (10 LP, 14 NS, and 10 MC) for bcl-2 gene rearrangements to determine if this B-cell lymphoma-associated translocation also plays a role in the pathogenesis of HD. The cases of HD were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization, using DNA probes that detect the major and minor breakpoint cluster regions and a 5'bcl-2 breakpoint region recently cloned and found to be involved in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using oligonucleotides capable of amplifying and detecting the major breakpoint region (mbr) and minor cluster region (mcr) breakpoint regions in t(14;18). bcl-2 translocations were not detected in any of the 34 cases of HD by Southern blot hybridization or by PCR. This is in spite of the fact that RS cells expressing B-cell-associated antigen CD20 were detectable in 7/8 cases of LP HD and 6/24 cases of NS and MC HD with monoclonal antibody L26. Therefore, these results indicate that the bcl-2 gene translocation does not play an important role in the pathogenesis of HD and did not provide evidence for the B-cell origin of HD.","['Athan, E', 'Chadburn, A', 'Knowles, D M']","['Athan E', 'Chadburn A', 'Knowles DM']","['Department of Pathology, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032.']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']","['CA 48236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY 06337/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1886573,,['bcl-2'],,,,,,,,,,

Maximal expression of Ia by sham-infected P388D1 cells was observed 2 days post rIFN-gamma addition followed by a progressive decline. These stimulatory effects of rIFN-gamma were dose dependent. Relative to sham-infected P388D1 cells, the induction of Ia by rIFN-gamma (200 U ml-1) on E. risticii-infected P388D1 cells was significantly suppressed at each time point tested through Day 5 with maximal suppression of 88% occurring on Day 2. Similarly, the induction of Ia by rIFN-gamma on E. risticii-infected peritoneal macrophages was significantly suppressed by 77% (fluorescent microscopy) when compared to sham-infected peritoneal macrophages. The higher dose of rIFN-gamma (2000 U ml-1) failed to restore Ia surface expression by E. risticii-infected P388D1 cells. The suppression of Ia on P388D1 cells in response to RIFN-gamma was not related to the degree of infection of these cells by E. risticii.

In this report, an NK allele-specific monoclonal antibody, anti-NK 1.1, was used to study the impact of in vivo donor NK cell depletion on GVH disease, graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) reactivity and donor T cell chimerism after allogeneic murine BMT. AKR/J (H-2k) recipient mice were preconditioned with suboptimal irradiation (9 Gy = LD50) and transplanted with major histocompatibility complex-matched B10.BR (H-2k) BM cells with or without added spleen cells as a source of T cells. The addition of increasing numbers of spleen cells to the BM inoculum produced GVHD of varying intensities. The beneficial effect of NK depletion on GVHD was dependent on the intensity of the GVH reaction. Donor NK cell depletion had no effect on the survival of mice with severe GVHD after MHC-matched BMT (B10.BR into AKR) or after MHC-mismatched BMT (B10.BR into DBA/2; H-2k into H-2d). However, donor NK depletion increased survival of AKR hosts given sufficient B10.BR splenic T cells to induce mild-to-moderate GVHD. Ex vivo depletion of donor CD8+ T cells also reduced GVH-associated mortality, but the use of both CD8 and NK depletion offered no improvement over either alone, suggesting an interaction between CD8+ and NK 1.1+ cells. In contrast to CD8 depletion, donor NK depletion did not compromise the rapid and complete establishment of donor T cell chimerism nor the ability of chimeras to mount an effective GVL reaction. Thus, elimination of donor NK cells provides an alternate strategy for reducing GVHD without loss of GVL reactivity following MHC-matched allogeneic BMT.","['Johnson, B D', 'Truitt, R L']","['Johnson BD', 'Truitt RL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['0 (CD8 Antigens)'],['CA39854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This assay is based on the recently described ""long-term culture-initiating cell"" (LTC-IC) assay for primitive normal human hematopoietic cells. Such cells, when cocultured with competent fibroblast feeder layers, give rise after a minimum of 5 weeks to multiple single and multilineage clonogenic progenitors detectable in secondary semisolid assay cultures. Similar cultures initiated by seeding a highly enriched source of leukemic cells from patients onto normal feeders showed the clonogenic cell output after 5 weeks to be linearly related to the input innoculum over a wide range down to limiting numbers of input cells, thus allowing absolute frequencies of leukemic LTC-ICs to be determined using standard limiting dilution analysis techniques. Leukemic LTC-IC concentrations in CML marrow were found to be decreased, on average to less than 10% of the normal LTC-IC concentration in normal marrow, but were greatly increased (up to greater than 10(5) times) in CML blood. Assessment of the number of clonogenic cells produced per leukemic LTC-IC by comparison to normal blood or marrow LTC-IC values showed this function to be unchanged in leukemic LTC-ICs [i.e., 3.1 +/- 0.4 clonogenic cells per CML LTC-IC (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) versus 3.7 +/- 1.2 (n = 3) and 4.3 +/- 0.4 (n = 5), respectively, for normal blood and marrow LTC-ICs]. In contrast, leukemic LTC-IC maintenance in LTC proved to be highly defective by comparison to normal LTC-IC of either blood or marrow origin. Thus, when cells from primary LTC were subcultured into secondary LTC-IC assays, leukemic LTC-IC rapidly declined (greater than 30-fold) within the first 10 days of culture, whereas normal LTC-IC numbers remained unchanged during this period. These findings illustrate how self-maintenance and differentiation events in primitive human hematopoietic cells can be differentially modulated by an oncogenic process and provide a framework for further studies of their manipulation, analysis, and therapeutic exploitation.","['Udomsakdi, C', 'Eaves, C J', 'Swolin, B', 'Reid, D S', 'Barnett, M J', 'Eaves, A C']","['Udomsakdi C', 'Eaves CJ', 'Swolin B', 'Reid DS', 'Barnett MJ', 'Eaves AC']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",,,PMC402148,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have analysed the expression of and mutational change in the p53 gene in the peripheral blood cells of 49 primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The p53 protein levels were elevated in 37 patients (75%) when measured by immunoprecipitation with antibodies PAb1801 and PAb421, which recognize both normal and mutant forms of the protein. The p53 protein from 32 of these 37 patients was immunoprecipitated by PAb240, which recognizes a conformation of p53 protein associated with point mutations. However, point mutations were detected by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assay and direct sequencing in only three patients at codons 178, 245, 273 and 290. Growth stimulation of normal lymphocytes also generated p53 which was immunoprecipitable by PAb240. Thus, alteration of p53 conformation, rather than acquisition of point mutations, could be the mechanism underlying the increased proliferation of myeloid cells in most AML patients.","['Zhang, W', 'Hu, G', 'Estey, E', 'Hester, J', 'Deisseroth, A']","['Zhang W', 'Hu G', 'Estey E', 'Hester J', 'Deisseroth A']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']","['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,['p53'],,,,,,,,,,

To determine if c-myb gene activation is associated with 6q- abnormalities, we developed a megabase map of the human c-myb locus using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. We then examined the occurrence of abnormalities near the c-myb gene in several hematopoietic tumor cell lines containing well-characterized 6q- abnormalities.

Translocation breakpoints invariably occur in single introns of dek and can, which were named icb-6 and icb-9, respectively. In a case of acute undifferentiated leukemia, a breakpoint was detected in icb-9 of can, whereas no breakpoint could be detected in dek. Genomic and cDNA cloning showed that instead of dek, a different gene was fused to can, which was named set. set encodes transcripts of 2.0 and 2.7 kb that result from the use of alternative polyadenylation sites. Both transcripts contain the open reading frame for a putative SET protein with a predicted molecular mass of 32 kDa. The set-can fusion gene is transcribed into a 5-kb transcript that contains a single open reading frame predicting a 155-kDa chimeric SET-CAN protein. The SET sequence shows homology with the yeast nucleosome assembly protein NAP-I. The only common sequence motif of SET and DEK proteins is an acidic region. SET has a long acidic tail, of which a large part is present in the predicted SET-CAN fusion protein. The set gene is located on chromosome 9q34, centromeric of c-abl. Since a dek-can fusion gene is present in t(6;9) acute myeloid leukemia and a set-can fusion gene was found in a case of acute undifferentiated leukemia, we assume that can may function as an oncogene activated by fusion of its 3' part to dek, set, or perhaps other genes.","['von Lindern, M', 'van Baal, S', 'Wiegant, J', 'Raap, A', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Grosveld, G']","['von Lindern M', 'van Baal S', 'Wiegant J', 'Raap A', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Grosveld G']","['Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']","['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,PMC364582,['GENBANK/M93651'],,,,,,,,,,,

At the same time, HTLV-I related reaction (diffuse pattern for MT-1 and/or MT-2) was found except positive reaction of the antibody (granular pattern for MT-1) by immunofluorescent assay. The incidence of HTLV-I related reaction was high in interstitial lung diseases with a rate of 45% in DPB and 53% in IIP. Thus, the total frequency of presence of antibodies and related reactions was 80% in DPB and 60% in IIP. In lung cancer, the frequency was also high, although it was less than in DPB and IIP. We termed cases of anti-HTLV-I antibody positive lung cancer HTLV-I associated lung cancer (HALC). One typical patient with IIP who initially showed HTLV-I related reaction showed a positive antibody reaction 2 years later.

ATL patients are classified into four subtypes according to the clinical picture: acute, chronic, smoldering, and lymphoma type. The diagnosis of ATL is made from the characteristic clinical findings, the detection of serum antibodies to HTLV-I, and when necessary, the confirmation of monoclonal integration of HTLV-I proviral DNA in cellular DNA of ATL cells. Recently, diagnostic criteria for clinical subtypes of ATL were proposed by the Lymphoma Study Group in Japan: 1) smoldering type, normal lymphocyte level, no hypercalcemia, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value 1.5 times the upper limit of normal or lower, no lymphadenopathy, no involvement of liver, spleen, central nervous system (CNS), bone or gastrointestinal tract, and no ascites or pleural effusion: 2) chronic type, absolute lymphocytosis with T-lymphocytosis of greater than 3 x 10(9)/1, LDH value twice the upper limit of normal or lower, no hypercalcemia, no involvement of CNS, bone, or gastrointestinal tract, and no ascites or pleural effusion: 3) lymphoma type, no lymphocytosis, 1% or less abnormal lymphocytes, and histologically-proven lymphadenopathy: 4) acute type, remaining ATL patients who are not classified as any of the above types. Infection with HTLV-I is a direct cause of ATL. Furthermore, infection with this virus can indirectly cause many other diseases via the induction of immunodeficiency, such as chronic lung diseases, opportunistic lung infections, cancer of other organs, monoclonal gammopathy, chronic renal failure, strongyloidiasis, non-specific dermatomycosis, non-specific lymph node swelling, HTLV-I associated myelopathy (HAM/TSP), and HTLV-I uveitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Yamaguchi, K']",['Yamaguchi K'],"['Blood Transfusion Service, Kumamoto University Medical School.']",['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On admission, physical examination showed slight pallor but no detectable superficial lymphadenopathies. Hepatosplenomegaly was not observed. Laboratory examination revealed a leukocyte count 5,500/microliters with 10% abnormal lymphoid cells. A majority of the abnormal lymphoid cells expressed both CD 4 and CD 8 antigens. The patient was diagnosed as chronic ATL, since anti-HTLV-1 antibody in his serum and monoclonal integration of HTLV-1 proviral DNA in his peripheral mononuclear cells were detected. Isospora belli was found in his feces thereafter, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was effective for diarrhea. In Japan, there have been only 9 reported cases of lymphoproliferative disorders (including five ATL patients) accompanied with Isospora belli infection. From the descriptions in those reports, these 9 cases might all be ATL patients.","['Kawano, F', 'Nishida, K', 'Kurisaki, H', 'Tsukamoto, A', 'Satoh, M', 'Sanada, I', 'Shido, T', 'Obata, S', 'Kimura, K', 'Sasaki, Y']","['Kawano F', 'Nishida K', 'Kurisaki H', 'Tsukamoto A', 'Satoh M', 'Sanada I', 'Shido T', 'Obata S', 'Kimura K', 'Sasaki Y', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kumamoto National Hospital.']",,,,,,,12,,,,,,,,

A cytogenetic study demonstrated the disappearance or marked reduction of Ph+ metaphases in Ph+AL in remission, while Ph+ cells persisted in BC. The major bcr gene was not rearranged in 4 Ph+AL cases, whereas it was found rearranged in 4 other cases of Ph+ AL and 6 cases of BC. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technique demonstrated the presence of minor bcr/abl mRNA in the former three cases, and major bcr/abl mRNA in the latter 4 cases. Remission rates were 63% for Ph+AL, 38% for BC, and 100% for Ph-ALL, and the 50% survival were 12, 5 and 29 months, respectively.

In our initial experiments, we generated Saccharomyces cerevisiae plasmids that separately express the GAL4 DNA-binding and GAL4 activation domains fused to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gag polyprotein, Pr55gag. The coexpression of these two hybrid proteins in S. cerevisiae results in the association of the GAL4 domains and the potent activation of an integrated GAL4-responsive lacZ indicator gene. Similar results were obtained with plasmids encoding GAL4-Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) gag polyprotein hybrid proteins. In contrast, the heterologous GAL4-HIV-1 gag and GAL4-M-MuLV gag fusion proteins were unable to interact with each other to induce lacZ expression. The results suggest that this yeast system provides a rapid and specific assay for the interactions of retroviral gag proteins that occur during virion assembly.","['Luban, J', 'Alin, K B', 'Bossolt, K L', 'Humaran, T', 'Goff, S P']","['Luban J', 'Alin KB', 'Bossolt KL', 'Humaran T', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']","['AI 24845/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K11 AI 00988/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC241396,,"['GAL4', 'gag', 'lacZ']",,,,,,,,,,

We have constructed chimeric viruses by in vitro recombination between two viruses, a RadLV that is thymotropic and an endogenous ecotropic virus that is nonthymotropic. We show here that, in contrast to thymotropism determinants identified previously, which lie in the long terminal repeat (LTR), it is the envelope region that is responsible for the thymotropism of BL/VL3 RadLV. The nonthymotropic virus which we have rendered thymotropic by transfer of the env region of RadLV in the present study has been shown previously to become thymotropic when the LTR of another thymotropic virus is inserted in its genome.

We find that the read-through signal is contained within the first 57 nucleotides on the 3' side of the UAG codon. Our results indicate that the identities of six conserved bases in the eight-nucleotide, purine-rich sequence immediately downstream of the UAG codon are critical for suppression, as is the existence of a pseudoknot structure spanning the next 49 nucleotides.

We describe here an analysis of the antigenic properties and diagnostic potentials of the predicted Imd-TM peptides of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) in serological assays of sera from infected cats. The results of these studies demonstrate that antibodies specific to the FIV Imd-TM peptide are detected within 2 weeks postinfection, are maintained at high levels for extended periods, and are not detectable in uninfected or FeLV-infected cats. In marked contrast, the FeLV Imd-TM peptide displayed only negligible levels of serological reactivity in FeLV-infected cats.

Interferon-alpha reduces the level of this activity only in the cells of patients who are clinically sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of interferon-alpha. We have purified this protein to homogeneity and found it to be a 57-kDa protein which corresponds to an isoform of protein disulfide isomerase. Protein disulfide isomerase is an oxidoreductase which catalyzes the interconversion between the reduced and oxidized states of proteins which contain multiple sulfhydryl groups and disulfide bonds. These studies suggest that this protein may play an important role in the transcriptional activation of interferon-inducible genes, perhaps through redox mechanisms.","['Johnson, E', 'Henzel, W', 'Deisseroth, A']","['Johnson E', 'Henzel W', 'Deisseroth A']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.

Propentofylline and its hydroxylated metabolite A 72 0287 were about 20 times less potent than theophylline in displacing A1-agonist binding to membranes from rat cortex, and A1-antagonist binding to whole DDT, MF-2 smooth muscle cells. A1-agonist binding to adenosine A1-receptors in several brain structures was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by A 72 0287 and propentofylline as judged by quantitative autoradiography (IC50-values 300-600 microM in eg striatum and in cortex layer IV). In two functional assays, A1-receptor mediated effects were blocked by propentofylline. A1-receptor-mediated inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation was virtually abolished by 100 microM propentofylline. The A1-receptor-mediated inhibition of evoked acetylcholine release was also reduced by propentofylline, but in this case the effect is not due exclusively to adenosine receptor antagonism but also to another action since the presynaptic inhibitory effect of carbachol was also inhibited. Adenosine A2-receptors were also antagonized by propentofylline as judged by a concentration-dependent antagonism of A2-agonist-induced cAMP accumulation in human T-leukemia cells (possessing putative A2b-receptors; pA2-value 180 microM compared to 0.26 microM for 8-cpt), and in PC-12 cells (possessing putative A2a-receptors, Ki-value 365 microM). Finally, adenosine transporters were affected by propentofylline and A 72 0287. Thus, [3H]-nitrobenzylthioinosine-binding to guinea-pig cardiac membranes was blocked by propentofylline or A 72 0287 (Ki 270 microM). The present results show that propentofylline and its hydroxylated metabolite can influence adenosine mechanisms in a multitude of ways. How these different actions may contribute to the ability of propentofylline to reduce the magnitude of ischemic damage is discussed.","['Fredholm, B B', 'Fastbom, J', 'Kvanta, A', 'Gerwins, P', 'Parkinson, F']","['Fredholm BB', 'Fastbom J', 'Kvanta A', 'Gerwins P', 'Parkinson F']","['Department of Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']","['0 (Purinergic Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic)', '0 (Xanthines)', '5RTA398U4H (propentofylline)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because previous results have suggested that c-fos and c-jun protooncogenes are expressed in human leukemic cell lines induced to undergo megakaryocytic differentiation, we have analyzed the expression of these two protooncogenes in normal MK. Studies were performed, by in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence, on human MK obtained either directly from bone marrow or from culture of MK progenitors. c-fos and c-jun transcripts were detected in most cultured or fresh marrow MK from adult donors. Expression was much higher in cytologically immature than in mature MK whereas no expression was detected in the most mature MK. c-fos and c-jun expression increased dramatically with MK size. In cultured fetal MK, which all remained small in size, c-fos mRNA was present but at a low level. The c-fos-encoded protein (P62fos) was easily detectable in the great majority of MK. We directly demonstrated that the level of P62fos expression was correlated to MK ploidy by flow cytometry using a three-color staining technique. The involvement of serum and growth factors in the induction of P62fos in MK was studied. Whereas a 3-h serum deprivation resulted in the disappearance of P62fos in MK, several growth factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 3 (IL-3), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 7 (IL-7), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), as well as normal or aplastic serum, were able to reinduce its expression within 2 h. In conclusion, our results suggest that c-jun and c-fos may play a role in the transduction of signals by several growth factors during terminal MK differentiation.","['Mouthon, M A', 'Navarro, S', 'Katz, A', 'Breton-Gorius, J', 'Vainchenker, W']","['Mouthon MA', 'Navarro S', 'Katz A', 'Breton-Gorius J', 'Vainchenker W']","['INSERM U91, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GTF2H1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors, TFII)', '148710-81-0 (Transcription Factor TFIIH)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PE1 and PE2 have been considered to reflect the capacities of terminal divisions and self-renewal of leukemic blast progenitors, respectively.

In contrast, there was statistically significant correlation between PE2 and the remission outcome of the patients, whereas PE1 was not significantly associated with the clinical outcome. The results in the present study indicate that the proliferative activity, especially self-renewal capacity, of leukemic blast progenitors is highly predictive of the prognosis of AML patients but is not significantly correlated with the AML subtype classified by the blast morphology.","['Nara, N', 'Chen, G J', 'Murohashi, I', 'Tohda, S', 'Imai, Y', 'Tomiyama, J', 'Nagata, K', 'Suzuki, T', 'Tanikawa, S', 'Shiina, S']","['Nara N', 'Chen GJ', 'Murohashi I', 'Tohda S', 'Imai Y', 'Tomiyama J', 'Nagata K', 'Suzuki T', 'Tanikawa S', 'Shiina S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using three AML blast colony assays combined with a suspension culture (delta assay), we determined the in vitro effect of GM-CSF on mature and undifferentiated AML blast progenitors obtained from bone marrow aspirates of six AML patients. GM-CSF stimulated AML blast colony proliferation at a concentration of 5 ng/ml in the methylcellulose and the agar clonogenic assays in six of six AML marrow samples. However, in the delta assay, which selects for immature AML progenitors, GM-CSF did not affect AML blast colony-forming cells in five of six AML marrow samples at concentrations ranging from 5 to 300 ng/ml. Our data imply that GM-CSF stimulates mature but not undifferentiated AML blast progenitors. It is therefore possible that GM-CSF may not be beneficial as a recruiting agent in most AML patients.","['Estrov, Z', 'Park, C H', 'Reading, C L', 'Estey, E H', 'Talpaz, M', 'Kurzrock, R', 'Deisseroth, A B', 'Gutterman, J U']","['Estrov Z', 'Park CH', 'Reading CL', 'Estey EH', 'Talpaz M', 'Kurzrock R', 'Deisseroth AB', 'Gutterman JU']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We speculated that these minor aberrations might also manifest in other morphological defects, especially in minor anomalies and malformations of the ribs. We reviewed chest roentgenographs of 1000 children with malignancies for rib anomalies and compared them to 200 patients with mainly infectious diseases. We found 242 rib anomalies in 218 children with tumours (21.8%) and 11 (5.5%) in children without malignancy. This difference was statistically highly significant (P less than 0.001). A high incidence of cervical ribs was found in neuroblastoma (33%), brain tumour (27.4%), leukaemia (26.8%), soft tissue sarcoma (24.5%), Wilms tumour (23.5%) and Ewing sarcoma (17.1%). Only neuroblastoma showed a high incidence of rib bifurcation (4.5%). The increased incidence of these mesenchymal defects in children with malignancies may be another clue for an altered morphogenesis in tumour origin. In neuroblastoma the rib anomaly may be another expression of neurocristopathy as proposed for the association of congenital heart disease and neuroblastoma.","['Schumacher, R', 'Mai, A', 'Gutjahr, P']","['Schumacher R', 'Mai A', 'Gutjahr P']","[""University Children's Hospital, Mainz, Federal Republic of Germany.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experiments in HL-60 cells to determine the cause of the observed decay in CD4 mRNA levels suggested that the half-life of CD4 transcripts did not diminish but increased after phorbol ester stimulation. Direct measurement of CD4 gene transcription by run-on analysis indicated that the rate of synthesis of new CD4 mRNA molecules was reduced approximately 10-fold after phorbol ester stimulation, whereas the rate of synthesis of c-fos mRNA resulted in a 2.5-fold increase. These data suggest that phorbol ester treatment specifically reduces CD4 mRNA levels by repressing CD4 gene transcription.

In this investigation, we have compared the modulation of the (2'-5')(A)n synthetase gene by interferon alone and by the combination of interferon and a second cellular effector, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA). Although TPA alone had no effect on (2'-5')(A)n synthetase, it potentiated the induction of (2'-5')(A)n of synthetase by interferon in HL-60 and HeLa cells by increasing content of its mRNA and an immunoreactive 40-kDa isoenzyme. Since TPA activates protein kinase C (PKC), other PKC-activating phorbol-ester analogues were tested and found to be effective, whereas the PKC inhibitor staurosporine reduced the potentiative activity of TPA. By using the (2'-5')(A)n synthetase gene promoter linked to a reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), TPA and interferon were found to result in a doubling of CAT activity compared to cells treated with interferon alone. Moreover, when nuclear extracts prepared from control cells or cells treated with TPA and interferon (IFN), separately or together, were incubated with radioactively labeled oligodeoxynucleotides containing the interferon-responsive element (IRE), TPA was shown to down-regulate an IFN-inducible IRE/protein complex.

Thirty of 32 (94%) evaluable patients achieved granulocyte counts greater than 500 x 10(6)/l (median 23 days; range 10-119 days); 26 of 32 (74%) evaluable patients achieved platelets greater than 50 x 10(9)/l (median 30 days; range 19-128 days) while 22/32 (69%) patients achieved platelets greater than 100 x 10(9)/l (median 45 days; range 20-328 days). This report demonstrates that human stem cells cryopreserved for up to 11 years are capable of engrafting. Stem cells may be stored for prolonged periods and used for transplantation in patients harvested prior to pelvic irradiation or alkylating agent therapy.","['Aird, W', 'Labopin, M', 'Gorin, N C', 'Antin, J H']","['Aird W', 'Labopin M', 'Gorin NC', 'Antin JH']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115.""]",,['CA 39542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients achieving remission within 8 weeks of diagnosis ('fast responders') had better LFS after BMT than those with remission after 8 weeks ('slow responders'): LFS at 3 years was 43% vs 32% for fast and slow responders, respectively (p = 0.04). The effect on LFS was particularly severe for slow responders transplanted within 3 months of remission. Only 17% of the slow responders with short remission-BMT interval survived at 3 years. Decreased LFS was caused by both excess of transplant-related mortality and increased relapse incidence. In a multivariate analysis, time intervals (both diagnosis-remission and remission-BMT) were the strongest independent prognostic factor for LFS, probability of relapse and transplant-related mortality. We conclude that the intervals diagnosis-remission and remission-BMT have a strong prognostic value in adult patients with ALL not only for remission duration after conventional treatment, but also for LFS after BMT.","['Niederwieser, D', 'Granena, A', 'Hermans, J', 'Kolb, H J', 'Zwaan, F', 'Gratwohl, A']","['Niederwieser D', 'Granena A', 'Hermans J', 'Kolb HJ', 'Zwaan F', 'Gratwohl A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Comparison of tumour recurrence rates in children treated with growth hormone for radiation induced deficiency and an untreated population. Computed tomograms from children with brain tumours were reviewed when starting growth hormone and subsequently. SETTING: North West region. PATIENTS: 207 children treated for brain tumour, 47 of whom received growth hormone and 161 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 15 of whom received growth hormone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tumour recurrence and changes in appearances on computed tomography. RESULTS: Among children with brain tumour, five (11%) who received growth hormone had recurrences compared with 42 (26%) who did not receive growth hormone. Also adjusting for other variables that might affect tumour recurrence the estimated relative risk of recurrence was 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 2.37). The only child with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who relapsed while taking growth hormone had relapsed previously before starting treatment. Two of the five children with brain tumours who relapsed had abnormal appearances on computed tomography when growth hormone was started. 14 other children who remained relapse free and had follow up computed tomography showed no deterioration in radiological appearance during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In this population growth hormone did not increase the risk of tumour recurrence but continued surveillance is essential. Abnormal results on computed tomography are not a contraindication to treatment with growth hormone.","['Ogilvy-Stuart, A L', 'Ryder, W D', 'Gattamaneni, H R', 'Clayton, P E', 'Shalet, S M']","['Ogilvy-Stuart AL', 'Ryder WD', 'Gattamaneni HR', 'Clayton PE', 'Shalet SM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Christie Hospital and Holt Radium Institute, Manchester.']",['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],,PMC1881949,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Follow up study. SETTING: Dounreay area of Caithness, Scotland. SUBJECTS: 4144 children born in the area in the period 1969-88 and 1641 children who attended local schools in the same period but who had been born elsewhere. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cancer registration records linked to birth and school records with computerised probability matching methods. RESULTS: Five cancer registrations were traced from the birth cohort compared with 5.8 expected on the basis of national rates (observed to expected ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.3 to 2.0). All five cases were of leukaemia (2.3, 0.7 to 5.4). In the schools cohort three cases were found (2.1, 0.4 to 6.2), all of which were of leukaemia (6.7, 1.4 to 19.5). All eight children were resident in the Dounreay area at the time of diagnosis; thus no cases were found in children who were born in or had attended school in the study area but who subsequently moved away. CONCLUSION: The raised incidence of leukaemia in both the birth and schools cohorts suggests that place of birth is not a more important factor than place of residence in the series of cases of leukaemia observed near Dounreay area.","['Black, R J', 'Urquhart, J D', 'Kendrick, S W', 'Bunch, K J', 'Warner, J', 'Jones, D A']","['Black RJ', 'Urquhart JD', 'Kendrick SW', 'Bunch KJ', 'Warner J', 'Jones DA']","['Scottish Health Service, Common Services Agency, Information and Statistics Division, Edinburgh.']",,,PMC1882190,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined the effect of gallium on Tf-independent iron uptake by HL60 cells. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of Tf-gallium on Tf-iron uptake, gallium nitrate, in a time-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent manner, stimulated Tf-independent uptake of iron-nitrilotriacetic acid (Fe-NTA). Preexposure of cells to gallium followed by removal of gallium also resulted in sustained stimulation of iron uptake. The anti-Tf receptor monoclonal antibody 42/6 blocked Tf-iron uptake, but had no effect on gallium-induced stimulation of Tf-independent iron uptake. Gallium increased the number of cell membrane iron-binding sites, without a change in their affinity for iron. Ferric chloride stimulated Tf-independent gallium uptake. Although gallium nitrate inhibited cell growth in Tf-free medium, cellular proliferation was restored by Fe-NTA.

Towards this end, we have constructed a retroviral vector (LG) in which the human glucocerebrosidase (GC) cDNA is driven by the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) long terminal repeat (LTR). Day 12 to 14 colony-forming unit-spleen progenitor cells were infected by the LG virus with a 100% efficiency, and GC messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were detected in the progeny of these cells. Tissues from long-term reconstituted mice analyzed 8 months posttransplantation with LG-infected BM contained the intact provirus at greater than 1 copy per cell, indicating effective infection of hematopoietic stem cells. Human GC mRNA generated by the viral LTR was detected in macrophages as well as other hematopoietic cells. Enzyme activity was increased fivefold and twofold in macrophages from BM and spleen, respectively, and could be precipitated with an antibody specific for human GC. Immunohistochemical analysis detected the human GC protein in 81% of the macrophages from five recipient mice. These data indicate that, after transduction of hematopoietic stem cells, the LG vector is capable of directing expression of human GC in the majority of macrophages from long-term reconstituted mice and producing enzyme levels comparable with endogenous mouse activity, suggesting that this virus may be useful in the treatment of Gaucher disease.","['Correll, P H', 'Colilla, S', 'Dave, H P', 'Karlsson, S']","['Correll PH', 'Colilla S', 'Dave HP', 'Karlsson S']","['Molecular and Medical Genetics Section, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']","['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.2.1.45 (Glucosylceramidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although these highly selective anticancer lipids appear to target the cell membrane, their mechanism of cytotoxic action remains to be defined. We report here that treatment of 'sensitive' HL-60 leukemia cells with one of the most potent lipid agents, 1-alkyl-2-methoxy-glycero-3-phosphocholine, inhibits the cellular transport of multiple essential nutrients including choline, amino acids, fatty acids, and the non-metabolizable carbohydrate, 2-deoxy-D-glucose. Minimal inhibitory responses of the varied transport systems were noted in HL-60 cells treated with the less potent, 2-lyso analog, and in 'resistant' K562 leukemia cells, treated with the 2-methoxy lipid. Although both the 2-methoxy lipid and 12-tetradacanoylphorbol 13-acetate induce differentiation in HL-60 cells, significant differences in the interactions of these lipids on cellular choline transport were found. Based on these results, we conclude that multiple nutrient deprivation induced by the detergent-like action of the methoxy-containing alkyl phospholipid results in the selective destruction of neoplastic cells that are sensitive to this membrane-targeted antitumor agent.","['Hoffman, D R', 'Thomas, V L', 'Snyder, F']","['Hoffman DR', 'Thomas VL', 'Snyder F']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Monosaccharide Transport Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arthrocenteses in 2 cases did not show crystals or infection. Serological studies were nondiagnostic. The arthritis and systemic features responded to steroids in all 5 treated patients.

The assay appears to have a particularly high positivity rate in leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, melanoma, sarcoma, advanced ovarian carcinoma and oropharyngeal tumors, suggesting that LASA may serve as a valuable marker in these malignancies. As a consequence of the rise of sialic acid-rich acute-phase proteins, such as alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, in inflammatory diseases the specificity of LASA and therefore its diagnostic accuracy is low. LASA can be useful for monitoring cancer patients during treatment, especially in combination with other tumor markers.","['Schutter, E M', 'Visser, J J', 'van Kamp, G J', 'Mensdorff-Pouilly, S', 'van Dijk, W', 'Hilgers, J', 'Kenemans, P']","['Schutter EM', 'Visser JJ', 'van Kamp GJ', 'Mensdorff-Pouilly S', 'van Dijk W', 'Hilgers J', 'Kenemans P']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital, Free University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '0 (lipid-associated sialic acid)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)']",,,,,,68,,,,,,,,

The risks were as high as 2.23 (1.56-3.18) 3.09 (1.68-5.71) for all cancers, 2.98 (1.72-5.15) for leukemia and 2.40 (1.08-5.36) for brain cancers. Wire configuration around houses was used as a surrogate for direct EMF exposure measurements. Wertheimer's finding of an association between cancer and wire configuration around houses has been replicated in two recent studies. However, direct measurement of EMF fields in houses of cancer children have not yielded the same results as the wire configuration around houses, thereby jeopardizing the hypothesis of an association between EMF and cancer. To comprehend the putative association between residential exposure to EMF and childhood cancer, one would have to understand what is hidden behind the notion of 'wire configuration' around the house. In parallel with residential studies, scores of studies were conducted among workers occupationally exposed to EMF. What have we learned from these occupational studies? Hypotheses generating and case control studies have revealed the existence of an excess risk of leukemia among electrical workers. Pooled results have estimated the risk for all leukemia to be 1.18 (1.09-1.29) and for acute myeloid leukemia 1.46 (1.27-1.64). An increased risk of leukemia among electrical workers does not necessarily mean that EMF is a causal agent, other chemicals such as benzene, creosote, solvent, could possibly account for it but this has yet to be confirmed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Theriault, G']",['Theriault G'],"['School of occupational health, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our findings indicate that IL3-dependent cell lines possess an extremely rapid transcription mechanism for introduced DNA, which if also present in normal cells may be usefully used to analyse gene regulation during signal transduction leading to growth and differentiation by haematopoietic growth factors.","['Garland, J M', 'Robin, P', 'Harel-Bellan, A']","['Garland JM', 'Robin P', 'Harel-Bellan A']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.""]","['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of such new drugs, the overall cost to achieve complete remission (CR) with treatments including these drugs has to be compared to the cost of the daunorubicin-cytosine arabinoside (DNR-AraC) association, considered as the reference treatment. A retrospective analysis of charts from 15 patients treated with DNR-AraC was used to identify 228 items of cost, including general cost, diagnostic, supportive care, and chemotherapy. Eleven patients underwent CR after one course of chemotherapy for a cost of US$16,701 +/- 4451, and four patients achieved CR after two courses for a cost of US$37,130 +/- 4923. The chemotherapy represented only 1.4% of the total cost, supportive care 25% and general cost 56%. According to these data, the projective cost of a treatment with mitoxantrone instead of DNR was simulated in 40 untreated patients with AML. The better rate of CR obtained after one course of chemotherapy leads to a saving of 9% (US$1261) per patient, despite the higher cost of chemotherapy.

Characterization was done using a large combination of well clustered monoclonal antibodies, and monoclonal antibodies prepared in our laboratory by immunizing mice either with bovine normal lymphocytes or with tumour thymic cells. The thymic tumours and the cell line did not express any T lymphoid antigens but they did express some B lymphoid markers.

The cell line expressed a more mature phenotype: TdT-, CD45-, CD44+, class II-DR+, CD19+, CD21+/- and sIgG+. These results allow us to consider these tumours as B-cell derived.

Additional treatment with dexamethasone shortly after irradiation increased leukemia incidence up to 50%. Experiments were conducted in order to demonstrate the existence of preleukemic cells in irradiated mice and to explore the possible role of dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, and different hemopoietic growth factors on their promotion to overt leukemia. Transplantation of bone marrow cells from mice exposed to 300 rad plus dexamethasone into appropriate recipients, performed 4-5 months after leukemogenic treatment, resulted in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development of donor origin in 70% of the recipients. Transfer of fractionated preleukemic bone marrow showed that the highest AML incidence developed in the recipients of fractions enriched in early hemopoietic precursors. The promoting effect of dexamethasone on preleukemic cells was confirmed by demonstrating its similar coleukemogenic effect whether administered within several hours or 130 days after radiation. Treatment with cyclophosphamide shortly after radiation could not replace the dexamethasone effect but was found to be complementary to the coleukemogenic effect of dexamethasone. Early administration of hemopoietic growth factors (starting 14 days after radiation and dexamethasone) showed that colony-stimulating factor (CSF) 1 increased the AML incidence (75%) and reduced its latency. Treatment with recombinant granulocyte-CSF (rG-CSF) had a reduced effect and recombinant granulocyte-macrophage CSF (rGM-CSF) had no promoting effect. However, administration of different factors several months after the leukemogenic treatment revealed that rGM-CSF increased AML incidence (75%) and shortened its latency, whereas rG-CSF and CSF-1 had no effect. In contrast, the late administration of recombinant interleukin 6 reduced AML incidence significantly (23%). The present results indicate that murine radiation induced AML is a multiphase process involving radiation induced preleukemia that can be promoted by different treatments.","['Haran-Ghera, N', 'Peled, A', 'Krautghamer, R', 'Resnitzky, P']","['Haran-Ghera N', 'Peled A', 'Krautghamer R', 'Resnitzky P']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']","['0 (Growth Substances)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with B-CLL exhibit a number of immune defects including: auto-antibodies, depressed cell-mediated immunity and hypogammaglobulinemia (HG). We investigated the control of Ig production in the malignant CLL B-cell at a transcriptional and translation level. We isolated fresh leukemic B-cells from CLL patients and analyzed for the presence of nuclear factors OCT-1, OCT-2, and NF-KB. Malignant B-cells were purified to greater than 90% B-cells, and total cellular RNA and nuclear proteins were isolated from these cells. Mobility shift assays were probed with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides specific to the immunoglobulin (Ig) enhancer and promotor regions. We detected endogenous OCT-1, OCT-2, and NF-KB in all patients tested (n = 5). We then evaluated whether activation of CLL B cells could augment kappa-mRNA levels. CLL cells (n = 3) exposed to phorbol ester and A23187 were harvested at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 48 min and examined for kappa-mRNA by Northern blot. All CLL patients (n = 3) had easily detectable levels of endogenous kappa-mRNA. However, only one patient had an obvious increase in kappa-mRNA post-induction with TPA/A23187. There was no concomitant increase in this patient's OCT-1, OCT-2, or NF-KB level. This finding prompted us to survey other B-CLL patients (n = 6) for Ig nuclear transcriptional factors pre- and post-induction. In summary, CLL B cells express Ig transcriptional factor OCT-1, OCT-2, and NF-KB constitutively. The endogenous level of NF-KB may account for the basal kappa-mRNA detected in B-CLL cells. However, the inability to augment NF-KB levels may, in part, explain the low levels of Ig synthesis in CLL B-cells.","['Zaknoen, S L', 'Christian, S L', 'Suen, R', 'Van Ness, B', 'Kay, N E']","['Zaknoen SL', 'Christian SL', 'Suen R', 'Van Ness B', 'Kay NE']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-2)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (POU2F2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)']",['GM 37687/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with APL respond to the administration of all-trans-retinoic acid. A cell line with t15;17 (NB4) has recently been reported; this line responds to all-trans-retinoic acid with differentiation. There is also a recent report showing that all-trans-retinoic acid is more active than cis-retinoic acid in inducing differentiation in freshly obtained APL cells. All-trans-retinoic and cis-retinoic acid are compared for their effects on growth in culture of freshly obtained AML cells, cell lines without t15;17, and NB4 cells. While all of these AML populations responded to both forms of retinoic acid, NB4 cells only were much more sensitive to all-trans-retinoic acid compared to cis-retinoic acid. The difference was seen when the NB4 cells were exposed in suspension and not when colony-formation in methylcellulose was used as an end point. Both forms of retinoic acid increased the sensitivity of blast cells to cytosine arabinoside; for NB4 cells, the sensitization was much greater when all-trans-retinoic acid was used rather than cis-retinoic acid. We conclude that the increased effects of all-trans-retinoic acid are specific for APL cells, and that a major effect of retinoic acid is on blast stem cell self-renewal.","['Tohda, S', 'Curtis, J E', 'McCulloch, E A', 'Minden, M D']","['Tohda S', 'Curtis JE', 'McCulloch EA', 'Minden MD']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, University of Toronto, Canada.']","['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3) on differentiation (NBT positivity) and proliferation (3H-thymidine incorporation) were studied in suspension cultures of bone marrow cells. Twelve bone marrow donors served as controls. Normal cells showed spontaneous differentiation in vitro, but only 2/12 were induced to differentiation by D3. Myelodysplastic cells did not differentiate spontaneously, but cells from 18/34 patients differentiated after incubation with D3. Normal cells showed increased proliferation, myelodysplastic cells showed a heterogeneous response and leukemic cells reacted with decreased proliferation after D3 incubation. Poor survival was associated with low platelet counts, high percentage of bone marrow blasts (BM blast %), low spontaneous in vitro proliferation and absence of hypogranulation of myeloid cells. Platelet counts and hypogranulation retained their predictive value in a multi-variate analysis. Progression to AML was predicted by a high BM blast % and low scores for erythroid and total dysplasia. In conclusion, the pattern of in vitro proliferation showed prognostic value while the pattern of vitamin D3-induced differentiation failed to correlate to other parameters. An estimation of bone marrow dysplasia can be used to predict the development of AML. Our results add to the information about the biology of MDS and may be important for the evaluation of therapeutic trials.","['Hellstrom-Lindberg, E', 'Robert, K H', 'Ahnsen, B', 'Elmhorn-Rosenborg, A', 'Kock, Y', 'Ost, A']","['Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Robert KH', 'Ahnsen B', 'Elmhorn-Rosenborg A', 'Kock Y', 'Ost A']","['Department of Medicine, Huddinge University Hospital, Sweden.']",['FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequential evolution of phenotypic and genetic markers was demonstrated during adaptation from primary to continuous culture in vitro. In the primary sample the majority of blast cells displayed the early T-cell markers, CD7, HLA-DR, and TdT, but were negative for the common ALL antigen (CALLA), CD4 and CD8. Simultaneously, unstimulated metaphase cells showed great karyotypic variation with a range of 43-46 chromosomes per cell. Clonal changes included the Ph chromosome t(9;22), loss of the Y and gain of several altered chromosomes. The cells grew slowly in suspension during the first 10 weeks of culture. During that time, cells still expressed the CD7 and HLA-DR antigens. Karyotypic analysis at ten weeks showed a pattern of 46,X,-Y,t(9;22),+8 in more than 90% of metaphases with disappearance of all other abnormal chromosomes noted in the original sample. A tetraploid subline exhibiting duplication of most chromosomes, including the Ph, comprised the remaining metaphases. Upon further cultivation in vitro, the cells transformed spontaneously over a period of several weeks, from T-lymphoid into myeloid cells. Expression of CD7 was lost, but reactivities with monoclonal antibodies to CD34, CD33 and CD13 were newly acquired. The karyotype was hypertriploid and all cells carried two copies of t(9;22) and lacked normal copies of No. 9 or Y. The cells have since maintained stable cytogenetic and phenotypic profiles. Molecular rearrangement of the breakpoint cluster region was identified in the primary blasts and the established line and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements were not found. These observations suggest that the leukemic blast arose from primitive stem cells, not irreversibly committed T cells, and that these stem cells retained the capacity to differentiate along the myeloid pathway.","['Mohamed, A N', 'Smith, M R', 'al-Katib, A', 'Wolman, S R']","['Mohamed AN', 'Smith MR', 'al-Katib A', 'Wolman SR']","['Department of Genetics-Cytogenetics Laboratory Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit.']","['0 (Antigens, CD)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This strongly suggests that this region of the Gs alpha gene is highly nonpolymorphic and that oncogenic mutations in this gene are unlikely to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of leukaemia.","['Baker, B W', 'Norton, J D']","['Baker BW', 'Norton JD']","['CRC Department of Gene Regulation, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital (NHS) Trust, Manchester, U.K.']","['0 (Codon)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two groups could be identified and compared: 'pure' erythroblastic AISA (AISA-E: 59 pts), and AISA with myelodysplastic features, i.e. dysgranulo and/or dysmegakaryopoiesis (AISA-M: 25 pts). Results were also compared to those of a series of 71 cases of refractory anaemia without sideroblastosis (RA) carried out from the same registry. Dyserythropoiesis was present in 90% of all AISA subtypes, dysgranulopoiesis in 88% of the AISA-M cases; dysmegakaryopoiesis was observed in 44% of AISA-M. Ten patients with both forms of AISA showed high platelet counts. These cases appeared particular in that four of them were associated with a splenomegaly and/or a hyperleucocytosis. They had to be distinguished from myeloproliferative syndromes. Outcome comparison of AISA-E with AISA-M showed a significant discrepancy of survival duration (60 vs 38 months respectively). Progression towards refractory anaemia with excess of blasts or acute leukaemia, was significantly higher for AISA-M than for AISA-E. The risk of transformation increased to 24% for the AISA-M group similarly to those of RA patients (17%). We conclude that AISA must be divided into two categories, 'pure' AISA and AISA-M, because survival duration and risk of transformation are different.","['Garand, R', 'Gardais, J', 'Bizet, M', 'Bremond, J L', 'Accard, F', 'Callat, M P', 'de Bouchony, E T', 'Goasguen, J E']","['Garand R', 'Gardais J', 'Bizet M', 'Bremond JL', 'Accard F', 'Callat MP', 'de Bouchony ET', 'Goasguen JE']","['French University and Hospital Centers, Nantes.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One approach is selective photosensitization, using sensitizing compounds and light radiation. Pyrene-containing fatty acids and lipids are potent photosensitizers, e.g. 12-(1-pyrene)dodecanoic acid (P12), is taken up preferentially by leukemic cells and undergo photoexcitation when exposed to long wave ultra-violet light, resulting in selective killing of leukemic cells. These compounds are incorporated into the neutral- and phospho-lipids of the cells. The presence of intracellular pyrene-linked lipids might present a potential hazard in applying these agents for clinical use. We have, therefore, studied a series of other pyrene-linked compounds with the objective of finding a non-metabolizable photosensitizing agent that can be easily removed from the cells. In the present paper we report the results with pyrene butanol (P4-OH), a pyrene linked short-chain alcohol. When compared to P12, P4-OH was found to be taken up by cells most rapidly and reached saturation within minutes. It did not undergo any metabolism and washing the cells with serum-containing salt solutions removed practically all the P4-OH. This compound was found to be an efficient photosensitizer (in terms of concentrations and time of incubation with the cells) and selective to leukemic cells--it caused a 99% reduction in leukemic clonogenic cells under conditions that normal hemopoietic progenitors remained almost intact. These properties make P4-OH a potential photosensitizer for clinical application.","['Fibach, E', 'Rabia, S A', 'Gatt, S']","['Fibach E', 'Rabia SA', 'Gatt S']","['Department of Hematology, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']","['0 (Butanols)', '0 (Lauric Acids)', '0 (Pyrenes)', '69168-45-2 (12-(1-pyrene)dodecanoic acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, therapeutic application is difficult because of the development of hypercalcaemia. We examined a novel vitamin D analogue, MC 903, which is at least 100 times less effective on calcium metabolism in rats than 1.25 (OH)2D3. Using the HL-60 cell line, differentiation was measured with a comprehensive panel of qualitative and quantitative parameters. Development of monocytic cells was shown morphologically, immunophenotypically and functionally by increased capability of reducing NBT (vs cultures without MC 903, p less than 0.0001) and by qualitatively and quantitatively increased non-specific esterase activity. Furthermore, a concomitant decreased activity of myeloperoxidase and lactate dehydrogenase was noticed. In conclusion, MC 903 is a potent inducer of monocytic differentiation, comparable with 1.25 (OH)2D3 and will therefore be an interesting and potential therapeutic agent for studies in human acute leukaemia.","['Rebel, V I', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'van de Loosdrecht, A A', 'Wijermans, P W', 'Beelen, R H', 'Langenhuijsen, M M']","['Rebel VI', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Wijermans PW', 'Beelen RH', 'Langenhuijsen MM']","['Department of Haematology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '143NQ3779B (calcipotriene)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (naphthylbutyrate esterase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report evidence that a human 12-kDa B cell growth factor (BCGF-12KD) may function as a growth stimulatory factor in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). First, recombinant BCGF-12KD induced dose-dependent DNA synthesis in neoplastic B cells of four B-CLL patients tested. Second, seven different B-CLL clones secreted a BCGF-12KD-like product that accounted for their proliferation. A neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb; Ac8) directed against a BCGF-12KD synthetic peptide inhibited the spontaneous growth of the leukemic B cells. The same mAb blocked DNA synthesis in normal tonsillar B lymphocytes induced by the culture supernatant of spontaneously proliferating B-CLL cells. Finally, BCGF-12KD mRNA was expressed in freshly isolated (two of three patients) as well as in vitro proliferating B-CLL cells (three of three patients). These findings strongly suggest that BCGF-12KD can modulate the growth of B-CLL cells in vivo as well as in vitro. They may offer significant insights into the biology of this frequent B lymphoproliferative disorder.","['Fournier, S', 'Jackson, J', 'Kumar, A', 'King, T', 'Sharma, S', 'Biron, G', 'Rubio, M', 'Delespesse, G', 'Sarfati, M']","['Fournier S', 'Jackson J', 'Kumar A', 'King T', 'Sharma S', 'Biron G', 'Rubio M', 'Delespesse G', 'Sarfati M']","['University of Montreal, Notre-Dame Hospital, Laboratory for Allergy Research, Quebec, Canada.']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",['CA54763/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AUC (538.6 ng.h.ml-1) after the rectal dose of 30 mg/m2 was approximately 1.5-times of that (365.5 ng.h.ml-1) after the oral dose of 87.5 mg/m2.

A systematic comparison of the membrane phenotypes in the two entities needs to be investigated. METHODS: Cell suspensions from peripheral blood of 184 patients with CLL, bone marrow from 23 patients with CLL, and lymph nodes from 86 patients with SLL were analyzed to compare the membrane phenotypes. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the three groups in the mean percentages of cells expressing surface immunoglobulin (SIg), CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD2 or in the frequency of cases with weak SIg. Although the mean percentage of mouse rosette-forming cells (MRFC) showed no statistical difference between bone marrow from CLL and lymph nodes from SLL, the mean percentage of MRFC in peripheral blood from CLL (48.02 +/- 18.23%) was twice as high as that in bone marrow from CLL (25.27 +/- 21.51%) and lymph nodes from SLL (20.87 +/- 16.72%) (P less than 0.001). Correlation analysis assessing the association of MRFC and residual T-cells showed a negative coefficient (r), and the r was statistically significant in bone marrow from CLL and lymph nodes from SLL but not in peripheral blood from CLL. The mean CD4/CD8 ratios in descending order were as follows: the ratio in lymph nodes from SLL (4.25) was greater than that in peripheral blood from CLL (1.70), which was greater than that in bone marrow from CLL (0.82); this followed the same pattern as the respective tissue controls. The mean ratios were not statistically different from those of their respective control groups. CONCLUSIONS: The similarity of membrane phenotypes between CLL and SLL provided evidence that the two are different tissue expressions of the same disease. The alterations in CD4/CD8 ratios were related to the type of tissue analyzed and not to the disease process. The difference in MRFC presumably results from the microenvironment or residual T-cells.","['Batata, A', 'Shen, B']","['Batata A', 'Shen B']","['Department of Pathology, Cox Institute, Wright State University School of Medicine, Dayton, Ohio 45429.']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the physiological role of CDF and to further elucidate the as yet unknown effects of CDF on the nervous system, two kinds of function-blocking antibodies were generated. One type, raised against whole native CDF, completely blocks CDF activity, whereas the other type, raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal amino acid region of CDF, blocks activity partially. All three anti-CDF and two antipeptide polyclonal antibodies tested in this study significantly inhibit CDF function.","['Fukada, K', 'Towle, M F']","['Fukada K', 'Towle MF']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Health Science Center, State University of New York, Brooklyn 11203.']","['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neuropeptides)']",['5R29NS26175/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

By monitoring the radiolabel association with cellular PL, the data indicated that LPS (10 micrograms/ml) drastically altered the catabolism of choline-containing PL; it induced their breakdown by 50% within 20 min. The reutilization of choline or its phosphates for PL synthesis was also suggested as a result of regaining radiolabel in the next 40 min. Choline-containing PL then underwent a second degradation after 60 min; 50% decline in radiolabel was detected at 120 min. In contrast, LPS did not induce the breakdown of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol through phospholipase C/phospholipase D (PLC/PLD). No significant redistribution of the radiolabel in PL was detected in any cases during chasing. The data clearly indicate that LPS stimulates phosphatidylcholine breakdown, implying that the liberation of phosphatidic acid or diacylglycerol via PLC/PLD reaction may be relevant to the initiation of LPS-induced monocytic activation.","['Chu, A J', 'Moore, J']","['Chu AJ', 'Moore J']","['Research Division, Miami Heart Institute, FL 33140-2999.']","['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phospholipids)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During 6 weeks of culture, the cellular composition of HLTBMCs was quantitatively studied. The cells of the HLTBMCs were divided into three main categories: fibroblasts, macrophages, and 'other cells' (endothelial cells, hematopoietic cells and undefined cells). HLTBMCs derived from healthy volunteers demonstrated a very consistent development. The number of fibroblasts increased during culture and the number of macrophages decreased, resulting in a steady state after 3 weeks of culture. In contrast, HLTBMCs derived from patients with AML showed a strikingly different pattern of irregular development and a steady state was not reached under our conditions. The APAAP technique was used to demonstrate expression of adhesion molecules. VLA2, VLA5, VLA6, LFA1, Mac1, p150/95, beta 2-chain, HCAM, ICAM1, NCAM, and VCAM1 were more expressed on 'normal' as compared with 'leukemic' bone marrow stromal cells, although this reached significance only for beta 2-chain and NCAM. VLA1, 3, and 4 were expressed in a higher percentage on 'leukemic' stroma (not significant). More expression was seen on 'normal' as opposed to 'leukemic' macrophages for the adhesion molecules tested, except for VLA5. The differences reached significance for the majority of molecules tested. It is concluded that striking differences exist in cellular composition and adhesion molecule expression between HLTBMCs from healthy individuals and those from patients with AML. This may have an impact on the pathogenesis of AML.","['Denkers, I A', 'Beelen, R H', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'de Jong-de Boer, A J', 'Langenhuijsen, M M']","['Denkers IA', 'Beelen RH', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'de Jong-de Boer AJ', 'Langenhuijsen MM']","['Department of Hematology, Free University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since each of these cell lines has a cloning efficiency approaching 100%, the number of cells which enters thymus during a 3 h homing assay has been estimated by limit dilution cloning analysis taking into account extra-binomial variation caused by individual mice. Only two out of seven of these cell lines have been found to have this specific property. These two cell lines, 16C1 and 5C2B, have been characterized as immature lymphoid cells, bearing no rearrangement at the TCR gamma and beta loci, and having the phenotype of CD3+CD4-CD8-, immature T cells.

Effects on the biology of residual tumour may be important in protocol design. Studies of SMN need large and reliable data sets. The leukaemia risk with current ACT is likely to be less than a five-fold increase. Leukaemia is predominantly a result of alkylating agents and peaks before 10 years. Solid SMN result also from radiotherapy and this risk continues after 10 years. Cardiotoxicity can be caused by anthracyclines but should not be a problem with current ACT regimens. It can be reduced by careful monitoring and by the cardioprotector ICRF-187. Amenorrhoea is a crude marker of ovarian suppression which may explain conflicting data on its relationship to outcome after ACT. Ovarian suppression following ACT is more likely and more permanent in older premenopausal women, but only explains a part of the ACT effects on outcome.

At 1.0 microgram/ml of ara-C, cells could be separated into two populations, with some becoming ballooned and deformed, i.e. irreversibly damaged, and others remaining unchanged, i.e. in a proliferative state. In contrast, at 0.10 microgram/ml of DNR, nearly all cells were remarkably enlarged and did not proliferate during 72 hours of observation. Such morphologic changes induced at clinically achievable concentrations of each agent seemed to reflect their differing mechanisms of action on the synthesis of DNA.

In an effort to explore any additive or synergistic interactions between these biological agents which could provide the basis for improved therapeutic regimens for myeloid leukaemia patients, we have investigated the effects of IL-3 on both RA- and vitamin D-induced actions in HL-60 human myeloid leukaemia cells, which have receptors for these three agents, in both clonogenic microassays and liquid suspension cultures. The proliferative stimulus of IL-3 overrode and reversed the antiproliferative actions of both RA and vitamin D, the latter being more sensitive to the counter-acting effect of IL-3. Whereas only high concentrations of IL-3: 1000 or more U/ml were able to oppose the antiproliferative effect of RA, all concentrations of IL-3 including the low concentration of 10 U/ml, significantly counteracted the anti-proliferative action of vitamin D. RA restrained the proliferative stimulus of IL-3 partly at low physiological concentrations and almost completely at high pharmacological concentrations. The same results were reproduced in liquid suspension culture. Whereas RA restrained the proliferative stimulus of IL-3, vitamin D failed to restrain it. However, IL-3 did not induce differentiation or affect RA- or vitamin D-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. The present results suggest that the clinical use of the combination of low concentration of IL-3 with RA and not with vitamin D might restrain the progression of myeloid leukaemia incurred during the treatment with IL-3 in some preleukaemic patients.","['Hassan, H T', 'Tsiriyotis, C', 'Maurer, H R', 'Spandidos, D A']","['Hassan HT', 'Tsiriyotis C', 'Maurer HR', 'Spandidos DA']","['Institut fur Pharmazie, Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany.']","['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Partial sequence analysis of the carbohydrate-binding B chain revealed a ragged N-terminus and overall homologies to the B subunit of Ricin D and Ricin E. Two evolutionarily neutral substitutions were apparent in the otherwise identical N-terminal sequences of the two toxic chains within the lectin preparation. On the basis of the influence of chemical modification by group-specific reagents on ligand binding, the lectin was biotinylated with biotinyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester to allow monitoring of cell binding. Monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1) specifically bound the lectin with positive cooperativity at low lectin concentrations. Radiolabelled lectin could be found in several organs and in an experimental solid tumor in biodistribution in mice. Its presence in a notable amount in spleens is especially noteworthy with respect to the already reported immunomodulation. To determine intracellular responses that precede the lectin-dependent augmentation of cytokine secretion, phosphorylation of proteins and phospholipids as well as Ca(2+)-mobilization were assessed in THP-1 cells. Quantitative increases of [32P]-phosphate incorporation were determined for a 28 kDa protein and for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate. Similarly, the fluorescence activity of the intracellular Ca(2+)-indicator fluo-3 is elevated by approximately 25% after lectin treatment. Apparently, cell binding of the lectin is followed by modulation of biosignalling processes.","['Gabius, H J', 'Walzel, H', 'Joshi, S S', 'Kruip, J', 'Kojima, S', 'Gerke, V', 'Kratzin, H', 'Gabius, S']","['Gabius HJ', 'Walzel H', 'Joshi SS', 'Kruip J', 'Kojima S', 'Gerke V', 'Kratzin H', 'Gabius S']","['Abteilung Glykobiochemie und Angewandte Tumorlektinologie, Institut fur Pharmazeutische Chemie der Universitat, Marburg, F.R.G.']","['0 (Galactosides)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2)', '0 (Toxins, Biological)', '0 (beta-galactoside)', '0 (mistletoe lectin I)', '0 (ribosome inactivating protein, Viscum)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the cell types described in the National Cancer Institute Working Formulation occurred in this series of bovine lymphomas, but the distribution of cell types varied markedly compared to that of human beings. Eighty-nine percent (1,067/1,198) of bovine lymphomas were high-grade tumors. The diffuse large cell type and its cleaved variant comprised 65.9% of all bovine lymphomas. Similar to the dog, but in marked contrast to human beings where at least 34% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were follicular, follicular tumors were found to be extremely rare in cattle (0.3% or 4/1,198). The prevalence of cell types varied significantly between the enzootic and sporadic lymphomas. The cleaved variant of the diffuse large cell type constituted 38% (406/1,072) of enzootic lymphomas versus 14% (18/126) of sporadic lymphomas. The mitotic index (100 x oil immersion field, 175 microns in diameter) of enzootic lymphomas (3.72 +/- 0.06, mean +/- standard error) was significantly greater than the mitotic index of sporadic lymphomas (2.82 +/- 0.17). We concluded that the cleaved variant of the diffuse large cell type with high mitotic index is characteristic of enzootic lymphoma. This characteristic high-grade cell type may be a consequence of the viral etiology of the enzootic form of bovine lymphoma.","['Vernau, W', 'Valli, V E', 'Dukes, T W', 'Jacobs, R M', 'Shoukri, M', 'Heeney, J L']","['Vernau W', 'Valli VE', 'Dukes TW', 'Jacobs RM', 'Shoukri M', 'Heeney JL']","['Department of Pathology, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The mortality for all types of leukaemia in that period was studied in three aspects: (a) By reviewing the rates of specific mortality for ages under 20 years, at quinquennial intervals and per millions of inhabitants of those ages. (b) Studying the mortality per cohorts of births at five-year intervals from 1951-1955 to 1981-1985. (c) Attaining the statistical value, ""observed deceased"" of leukaemia in people under 15 years of age for the period studied and on each year of that period, and comparing such value with the number of ""expected deceased"", with regard to the reference year, 1965. RESULTS: A decreasing trend was observed along the whole period. As for ages, there seems to be some tendency to stabilisation of the mortality in the last five-year period, 1981-1985 (there is a decrease only in the 15-18 age-group). These data were confirmed when assessing the mortality per ""birth cohorts"" or generations, and after plotting the figures of ""observed"" and ""expected"" mortality in accordance with the previous evolution. CONCLUSION: It was inferred that regard to the mortality of childhood and youth leukaemia, in Spain the situation has improved markedly, doubtless as a result of better therapeutical approach. This evolution closely resembles the patterns of the most developed countries from a sanitary standpoint.","['Cortina, P', 'Cortes, C', 'Gil, A', 'Corella, D', 'Cortina Birlanga, P']","['Cortina P', 'Cortes C', 'Gil A', 'Corella D', 'Cortina Birlanga P']","['Departamento de Medicina Preventiva y Salud Publica, Universidad de Valencia.']",,,,,,Mortalidad por leucemias infanto-juveniles en Espana (1951-1985).,,,,,,,,,

The singlet-oxygen quenching constants obtained depended somewhat upon the specific combination of detergent and photosensitizer used. Extrapolation of the singlet-oxygen lifetime data to ""100%"" cell concentration (1.39 +/- 0.04 x 10(9) cells/mL) and correction for the contribution of the water solvent gave a singlet-oxygen lifetime between 0.17 and 0.32 microseconds for the L1210 leukemia cell. The theoretical contributions of various types of biological molecules within the L1210 cell to the total singlet-oxygen quenching were calculated from their concentrations and their quenching constants.

The more sensitive species, the mice, definitely has a higher capacity to metabolize benzene and to metabolize it to more of the putative toxic metabolites than do rats. A major finding of these studies is that in three different animal species, from mice to monkeys, the metabolic pathways leading to production of the putative toxic metabolites appear to be low-capacity, high-affinity pathways that are saturated at relatively low-exposure concentrations. This does not prove, but suggests, that the same may be true in humans. If the total formation of the putative toxic metabolites is predictive of the toxicity of benzene, then the animal studies suggest that calculations of the risk associated with low dose exposures based on the results of animal studies conducted at high doses would underestimate the toxicity of benzene. The current report concerns only dosimetry. Another problem in assessing the risk to humans from benzene exposure is the fact that the animal models do not respond to benzene in the same way as humans. The major concern for humans exposed to benzene, based on epidemiology studies, is the risk of developing acute myelogenous leukemia (Rinksy, 1987). The cancers developed by the rodents on the long-term bioassay studies were at other sites (liver, lung, Zymbal's gland, lymph tissue, ovaries, and mammary gland). There is as yet no good animal model for benzene-induced leukemia. However, it has been suggested that benzene may also increase the incidence of Hodgkin's disease, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma and lung cancer in humans, although a statistical basis for this is lacking (Askoy, 1985). It is not unreasonable to assume that whatever form of cancer is induced, the induction is most likely through the reactive metabolites produced from benzene. Therefore, the dosimetry of these metabolites is pertinent. Our studies indicate that benzene metabolite dosimetry data obtained in animals provides data relevant to the estimation of human risks.","['Henderson, R F', 'Sabourin, P J', 'Medinsky, M A', 'Birnbaum, L S', 'Lucier, G L']","['Henderson RF', 'Sabourin PJ', 'Medinsky MA', 'Birnbaum LS', 'Lucier GL']","['Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185.']","['0 (Carcinogens)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",['222-ES-20092/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,20,,,,,,,,

Administration of hemin increases the steady-state level of ferritin mRNA about 10-fold and that of ferritin protein expression 20-fold. Experiments with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D and transfection studies demonstrate that the increment in cytoplasmic mRNA content results from enhanced transcription of the ferritin H-chain gene and cannot be attributed to stabilization of preexisting mRNAs. In addition to transcriptional effects, translational regulation induces the recruitment of stored mRNAs into functional polyribosomes after hemin and FAC administration, resulting in a further increase in ferritin synthesis. Administration of protoporphyrin IX to FLCs produces divergent transcriptional and translational effects. It increases transcription but appears to suppress ferritin mRNA translation. FAC treatment increases the mRNA content slightly (about twofold), and the ferritin levels rise about fivefold over the control values. We conclude that in FLCs, hemin induces ferritin H-chain biosynthesis by multiple mechanisms: a transcriptional mechanism exerted also by protoporphyrin IX and a translational one, not displayed by protoporphyrin IX but shared with FAC.","['Coccia, E M', 'Profita, V', 'Fiorucci, G', 'Romeo, G', 'Affabris, E', 'Testa, U', 'Hentze, M W', 'Battistini, A']","['Coccia EM', 'Profita V', 'Fiorucci G', 'Romeo G', 'Affabris E', 'Testa U', 'Hentze MW', 'Battistini A']","['Laboratorio di Virologia, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']","['0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'UVP74NG1C5 (ferric ammonium citrate)']",,PMC364515,,,,,,,,,,,,

The virus-encoded gp55 glycoprotein binds to erythropoietin receptors to cause mitogenesis and differentiation of erythroblasts. However, if the provirus integrates adjacent to the gene for the PU.1 transcription factor, the cell loses its commitment to terminally differentiate and becomes immortal, as indicated by its transplantability and by its potential for indefinite growth in culture (C. Spiro, B. Gliniak, and D. Kabat, J. Virol. 63:4434-4437, 1989; R. Paul, S. Schuetze, S. L. Kozak, and D. Kabat, J. Virol. 65:464-467, 1991). To test the implications of these results, we produced polyclonal antiserum to bacterially synthesized PU.1, and we used it to analyze PU.1 expression throughout leukemic progression and during chemically induced differentiation of Friend erythroleukemia (F-MEL) cell lines. This antiserum identified three electrophoretically distinct PU.1 components in extracts of F-MEL cells and demonstrated their nuclear localization. Although PU.1 proteins are abundant in F-MEL cells, they are absent or present in only trace amounts in normal erythroblasts or in differentiating erythroblasts from the preleukemic stage of Friend disease. Furthermore, chemicals (dimethyl sulfoxide or N,N'-hexamethylenebisacetamide) that overcome the blocked differentiation of F-MEL cells induce rapid declines of PU.1 mRNA and PU.1 proteins. The elimination of PU.1 proteins coincides with recommitment to the program of erythroid differentiation and with loss of immortality. These results support the hypothesis that PU.1 interferes with the commitment of erythroblasts to differentiate and that chemicals that reduce PU.1 expression reinstate the erythropoietic program.","['Schuetze, S', 'Paul, R', 'Gliniak, B C', 'Kabat, D']","['Schuetze S', 'Paul R', 'Gliniak BC', 'Kabat D']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201-3098.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (v-Spi-1 protein, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)']",['CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC364510,,,,,,,,,,,,
