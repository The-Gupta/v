OBSERVATIONS: A 33-year-old woman with chronic myelogenous leukemia developed widespread alopecia involving scalp and body hair within weeks after starting nilotinib therapy. Biopsies revealed perifollicular lymphocytic inflammation and evidence of follicular injury but normal hair density, consistent with a nonscarring alopecia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Nilotinib therapy may induce perifollicular inflammation and widespread persistent alopecia. We present the first clinical and histologic description of this potential adverse effect. Further investigation into the underlying mechanism of this adverse effect may produce insights into the hair growth cycle as well as potential therapeutic targets.","['Hansen, Timothy', 'Little, Anthony J', 'Miller, Jeffrey J', 'Ioffreda, Michael D']","['Hansen T', 'Little AJ', 'Miller JJ', 'Ioffreda MD']","['Department of Dermatology, Penn State Milton S.

Over the past decade, increases and decreases in miRNA expression have been shown to associate with various types of disease, including cancer. The first two known miRNA aberrations resulted from altered expression of DLEU2 and C13orf25 in hematological malignancies. DLEU2, which encodes miR-15a and miR-16-1, was discovered from 13q14 deletion in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, while C13orf25, which encodes six mature miRNA (miR-17, miR-18, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a and miR-92a), was identified from 13q31 amplification in aggressive B-cell lymphomas. These miRNA were downregulated or upregulated in accordance with genomic deletion or amplification, which suggests that they contribute to tumorigenesis through altered regulation of target oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Consistent with that idea, miR-15a/16-1 is known to regulate Bcl2 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and miR-17-92 regulates the tumor suppressors p21, Pten and Bim in aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Dysregulation of other miRNA, including miR-21, miR-29, miR-150 and miR-155, have also been shown to play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of aggressive transformed, high-grade and refractory lymphomas. Addition of miRNA dysregulation to the original genetic events likely enhances tumorigenicity of malignant lymphoma through activation of one or more signaling pathways.","['Tagawa, Hiroyuki', 'Ikeda, Sho', 'Sawada, Kenichi']","['Tagawa H', 'Ikeda S', 'Sawada K']","['Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan. htagawa0279jp@yahoo.co.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics']",2013/04/05 06:00,2014/02/07 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12160 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2013 Jul;104(7):801-9. doi: 10.1111/cas.12160.

The mechanisms underlying its dysregulation have not been clarified. In this study, we explored the involvement of micro-RNAs that acted as endogenous sequence-specific suppressors of gene expression. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using computational and TCGA analysis, we identified miR-139 as being downregulated in glioblastoma in comparison with human brain tissue, as well as possessing a putative target site in Mcl-1 mRNA. Overexpression of miR-139 led to a clear decrease in Mcl-1 expression in gliomas. Reporter assays revealed direct post-transcriptional regulation involving miR-139 and the 3'-untranslated region of Mcl-1. Human glioma tissues with low expression of miR-139 displayed higher expression of Mcl-1 protein than those with high expression, suggesting that low miR-139 contributes to Mcl-1 overexpression. In addition, upregulation of miR-139 suppressed the proliferation and enhanced temozolomide (TMZ)-induced apoptosis. Finally, we observed that Mcl-1 knockdown resulted in similar effects compared with miR-139 transfection. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that miR-139 negatively regulated Mcl-1 and induced apoptosis in cooperation with an anticancer drug TMZ in glioma.","['Li, Rui-Yan', 'Chen, Ling-Chao', 'Zhang, Hai-Yan', 'Du, Wen-Zhong', 'Feng, Yan', 'Wang, Han-Bing', 'Wen, Jin-Qiong', 'Liu, Xin', 'Li, Xian-Feng', 'Sun, Ying', 'Yang, Dong-Bo', 'Jiang, Tao', 'Li, Yong-Li', 'Jiang, Chuan-Lu']","['Li RY', 'Chen LC', 'Zhang HY', 'Du WZ', 'Feng Y', 'Wang HB', 'Wen JQ', 'Liu X', 'Li XF', 'Sun Y', 'Yang DB', 'Jiang T', 'Li YL', 'Jiang CL']","['Department of Neurosurgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,CNS Neurosci Ther,CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,101473265,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (MIRN139 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brain Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Glioma/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*biosynthesis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oligonucleotides/genetics', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Temozolomide']",2013/04/05 06:00,2014/01/21 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cns.12089 [doi]'],ppublish,CNS Neurosci Ther. 2013 Jul;19(7):477-83. doi: 10.1111/cns.12089.

Although imatinib mesylate (IM) is effective for CML treatment, patients in accelerated and blastic phases of the disease are often refractory to this therapy, and there are also cases of IM resistance in patients in the chronic phase. Therefore, potential new drugs are being investigated to improve the efficiency of the therapy of CML such as snake venoms and their compounds. In this investigation, Bothrops pirajai L-amino acid oxidase (BpirLAAO-I) effect on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and on BCR-ABL(+) cell line was assessed to explore its potential against leukaemic cells. MTT viability assay, lymphocyte subsets quantification and cell activation markers expression were performed to evaluate BpirLAAO-I effect on normal PBMC. The effect of BpirLAAO-I on HL-60 and HL-60.BCR-ABL cell lines was assessed by apoptosis detection. BpirLAAO-I was able to induce apoptosis in HL-60 and HL-60.BCR-ABL cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, promoted caspases 3, 8 and 9 activation and enhanced IM effect while not affecting the viability of normal cells.

As the major allele (65.6%) in a Chinese population, WT1(GG) was associated with younger age (</= 60) and lower percentage of blasts than WT1(GA/AA). Meanwhile, improved overall survival (OS, p = 0.035) and disease-free survival (DFS, p = 0.021) were observed in WT1(GG) compared with WT1(GA/AA). We then found that WT1 mutation, occurring in 8% of patients with AML, did not predict clinical outcome. Finally, WT1 levels were higher in patients with WT1(GG) than in those with WT1(GA/AA). However, high levels of WT1 (> median) predicted worse OS (p = 0.015) and DFS (p = 0.034) than low levels of WT1 (</= median). However, further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of why WT1(GG), which was associated with higher median expression of WT1 that predicts worse OS and DFS compared to low expression of WT1, predicted better OS and DFS compared with WT1(GA/AA).

We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and ISI Web of Knowledge literature databases without language restrictions to identify observational studies among children diagnosed between ages 0 and 19 years that assessed MTHFR 677 polymorphisms in relation to ALL survival. We identified six studies comprising 909 pediatric patients with ALL. The magnitude of relative risk (RR) for pediatric ALL mortality varied by genotype comparison and study population, ranging from RR = 0.84 (95% confidence limits [CL]: 0.24, 3.0) for a TT vs. CT/CC comparison to RR = 7.0 (95% CL: 0.98, 49) for a TT vs. CC comparison. The current evidence suggests that individuals with MTHFR 677 variants (i.e. at least one T allele) may have a higher relative risk of pediatric ALL mortality, with greater statistical support for MTHFR 677TT. With more detailed supporting evidence, MTHFR 677 genotyping at diagnosis could provide an option for individualizing therapy and further reducing pediatric ALL mortality in certain populations.","['Ojha, Rohit P', 'Gurney, James G']","['Ojha RP', 'Gurney JG']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital , Memphis, TN , USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Codon)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"['Alleles', '*Codon', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*mortality', 'Prognosis']",2013/04/05 06:00,2014/08/15 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.792336 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 Jan;55(1):67-73. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.792336.

In this article, we discuss emerging knowledge regarding the functions of miRNA genes in the immune system. We delve into the roles of miRNAs in regulating signaling strength and threshold, homeostasis, and the dynamics of the immune response and tolerance during normal and pathogenic immunological conditions. We also present observations based on analyzes of miR-181 family genes that indicate the potential functions of primary and/or precursor miRNAs in target recognition and explore the impact of these findings on target identification. Finally, we illustrate that despite the subtle effects of miRNAs on gene expression, miRNAs have the potential to influence the outcomes of normal and pathogenic immune responses by controlling the quantitative and dynamic aspects of immune responses. Tuning miRNA functions in immune cells, through gain- and loss-of-function approaches in mice, may reveal novel approach to restore immune equilibrium from pathogenic conditions, such as autoimmune disease and leukemia, without significant toxicity.","['Chen, Chang-Zheng', 'Schaffert, Steven', 'Fragoso, Rita', 'Loh, Christina']","['Chen CZ', 'Schaffert S', 'Fragoso R', 'Loh C']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. czchen@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,"['0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Homeostasis/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance/genetics', '*Immunity/genetics', '*Immunomodulation', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology']",2013/04/05 06:00,2013/09/27 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imr.12060 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2013 May;253(1):112-28. doi: 10.1111/imr.12060.,,['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The present study aimed at delineating benzene induced myelodysplasia and related disorders in an experimental mouse model with a view to assessing the clinical hazards in human at a comparable event. The observations made so far documented some quantitative and qualitative changes in the bone marrow population, especially involving the hematopoietic stem cells and related microenvironment, their immune responsiveness and survival fate of the cells at that particular event. The observations furnished that benzene following occupational exposure can be hazardous by way of HSC mediated dysfunction and, the microenvironmental studies conducted in some details indicated that the damage may be in the bone marrow stem cell niche. Furthermore, some data collected showed an increased death rate of bone marrow cells and associated abnormalities in receptor expression of adhesion molecules and related growth factors. Culminating the above data the study reveals that Benzene may cause target damage in the bone marrow stem cell niche [BM SC niche] both structurally and functionally, with the resultant disease expression as in MDS.","['Das, Madhurima', 'Chaudhuri, Samaresh', 'Law, Sujata']","['Das M', 'Chaudhuri S', 'Law S']","['Stem Cell Research and Application Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnology, Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, C R Avenue, Kolkata-700073, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Stem Cells,Journal of stem cells,101295936,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Ferrocyanides)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'TLE294X33A (ferric ferrocyanide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/enzymology/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Environmental Exposure/*analysis', 'Female', 'Ferrocyanides/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*chemically induced/enzymology/*pathology', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Stem Cell Niche/*drug effects', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism']",2012/01/01 00:00,2013/06/13 06:00,['2013/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Stem Cells. 2012;7(1):43-59.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to estimate the 5-year survival rates of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia (AML) as well as factors influencing them. METHODS: This is a nonrandomized retrospective study conducted on 280 patients with ALL and AML. They were all below 15 years old children admitted to Shahid Faghihi hospital, Shiraz, Iran from 2004 to 2008.The survival rates were estimated by applying the Kaplan-Meier method. In addition, the log rank test was used to estimate the statistical significance of differences in the survival probability. Cox regression model was applied to conduct multivariate analysis for adjusting confounding variable. All analyses were performed in SPSS statistical software (version 16). P-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. FINDINGS: The mean (+/- standard deviation) of the observation period was 28.2+/-16.1 months. In this period, 60 (24.7%) patients (47 ALL and 15 AML) passed away. The cumulative rate of survival in this study was 53.3+/-0.1 percent. This probability was 56.6+/-0.1% and 44.2+/-0.1% for ALL and AML patients, respectively, which indicates no statistically significant difference between them (P=0.8). According to Cox model, there was a significant relationship among the variables of platelet count and relapse with the survival rate. CONCLUSION: Platelet count was identified as a positive prognostic factor of the survival rate in ALL patients. However, on the base of our results and other studies, incidence of relapse and the number of relapses are significant factors of survival rates of leukemia.","['Amir, Almasi-Hashiani', 'Soheil, Zareifar', 'Mehran, Karimi', 'Esmaeil, Khedmati', 'Abolfazl, Mohammadbeigi']","['Amir AH', 'Soheil Z', 'Mehran K', 'Esmaeil K', 'Abolfazl M']","['Department of Public Health, School of Health, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Iran J Pediatr,Iranian journal of pediatrics,101274724,,,,2013/04/04 06:00,2013/04/04 06:01,['2013/04/04 06:00'],"['2012/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Pediatr. 2013 Feb;23(1):53-8.,,,PMC3574992,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Relapse', 'Survival Rate']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test if selection for autoreactivity leads to increased aggressiveness and if this selection plays out equally in primary and secondary tissues, we used T-cell leukemia (TCL)1 cells reactive with the autoantigen phosphatidylcholine (PtC). After repeated transfers of splenic lymphocytes from a single mouse with oligoclonal PtC-reactive cells, outgrowth of cells expressing a single IGHV-D-J rearrangement and superior PtC-binding and disease virulence occurred. In secondary tissues, increased PtC-binding correlated with enhanced BCR signaling and cell proliferation, whereas reduced signaling and division of cells from the same clone was documented in cells residing in the bone marrow, blood, and peritoneum, even though cells from the last site had highest surface membrane IgM density. Gene-expression analyses revealed reciprocal changes of genes involved in BCR-, CD40-, and PI3K-signaling between splenic and peritoneal cells. Our results suggest autoantigen-stimulated BCR signaling in secondary tissues promotes selection, expansion, and disease progression by activating pro-oncogenic signaling pathways, and that--outside secondary lymphoid tissues--clonal evolution is retarded by diminished BCR-signaling. This transferrable, antigenic-specific murine B-cell clone (TCL1-192) provides a platform to study the types and sites of antigen-BCR interactions and genetic alterations that result and may have relevance to patients.","['Chen, Shih-Shih', 'Batliwalla, Franak', 'Holodick, Nichol E', 'Yan, Xiao-Jie', 'Yancopoulos, Sophia', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Rothstein, Thomas L', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Chen SS', 'Batliwalla F', 'Holodick NE', 'Yan XJ', 'Yancopoulos S', 'Croce CM', 'Rothstein TL', 'Chiorazzi N']","['Karches Center for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantigens/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phosphatidylcholines/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', '*Selection, Genetic', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'V(D)J Recombination']",2013/04/04 06:00,2013/06/20 06:00,['2013/04/04 06:00'],"['2013/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1300616110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1300616110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Apr 16;110(16):E1500-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1300616110.

Recently, Chinese researchers have discovered that two anthraquinones isolated from a water extract of H. diffusa Willd showed apoptosis-inducing effects against cancer cells. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are poorly understood. The current study determines the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in human leukemic U937 cells apoptosis induced by 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone from H. diffusa. Our results showed that 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone decreased phosphorylation-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), and increased p-p38MAPK, but did not affect expressions of p-JNK1/2 in U937 cells. Moreover, treatment of U937 cells with 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone resulted in activation of caspase-3. Furthermore, PD98059 (ERK1/2 inhibitor) significantly enhanced 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone-induced apoptosis in U937 cells, whereas caspase-3 inhibitor or SB203580 (p-p38MAPK inhibitor), decreased apoptosis in U937 cells. Taken together, our study for the first time suggests that 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone is able to enhance apoptosis of U937 cells, at least in part, through activation of p-p38MAPK and downregulation of p-ERK1/2. Moreover, the triggering of caspase-3 activation mediated apoptotic induction.","['Wang, Nan', 'Li, Dong-Yang', 'Niu, Hui-Yan', 'Zhang, Yi', 'He, Ping', 'Wang, Jia-He']","['Wang N', 'Li DY', 'Niu HY', 'Zhang Y', 'He P', 'Wang JH']","['Department of Geriatrics, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,"['0 (2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone)', '0 (Anthraquinones)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Anthraquinones/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Hedyotis/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Medicine, East Asian Traditional', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'U937 Cells', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2013/04/04 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2013/04/04 06:00'],"['2013/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12272-013-0096-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2013 Jun;36(6):752-8. doi: 10.1007/s12272-013-0096-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effects of sequential therapy with the potent VEGF inhibitor, aflibercept, and doxorubicin (DOX) in preclinical acute myeloid leukemia (AML) models. Mice were engrafted with human HL-60 and HEL-luciferase leukemia cells via S.C. and/or I.V. injection and treated with two to three doses of aflibercept (5-25 mg/kg) up to 3-7 days prior to doxorubicin (30 mg/kg) administration. Leukemia growth was determined by local tumor measurements (days 0-16) and systemic bioluminescent imaging (days 0-28) in animals receiving DOX (3 mg/kg) with or without aflibercept. A PK/PD model was developed to characterize how prior administration of aflibercept altered intratumoral DOX uptake. DOX concentration-time profiles were described using a four-compartment PK model with linear elimination. We determined that intratumoral DOX concentrations were 6-fold higher in the aflibercept plus DOX treatment group versus DOX alone in association with increased drug uptake rates (from 0.125 to 0.471 ml/h/kg) into tumor without affecting drug efflux. PD modeling demonstrated that the observed growth retardation was mainly due to the combination of DOX plus TRAP group; 0.00794 vs. 0.0043 h(-1). This PK/PD modeling approach in leukemia enabled us to predict the effects of dosing frequency and sequence for the combination of anti-VEGF and cytotoxic agents on AML growth in both xenograft and marrow, and may be useful in the design of future rational combinatorial dosing regimens in hematological malignancies.","['Fetterly, Gerald J', 'Aras, Urvi', 'Lal, Deepika', 'Murphy, Michael', 'Meholick, Patricia D', 'Wang, Eunice S']","['Fetterly GJ', 'Aras U', 'Lal D', 'Murphy M', 'Meholick PD', 'Wang ES']","['PK/PD Core Facility, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. gerald.fetterly@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AAPS J,The AAPS journal,101223209,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '15C2VL427D (aflibercept)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/*methods']",2013/04/04 06:00,2014/01/23 06:00,['2013/04/04 06:00'],"['2012/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1208/s12248-013-9480-8 [doi]'],ppublish,AAPS J. 2013 Jul;15(3):662-73. doi: 10.1208/s12248-013-9480-8.

We aimed at modeling sequential tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance in vitro to compare the sequences imatinib-nilotinib-dasatinib and imatinib-dasatinib-nilotinib. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We designed an in vitro model for sequential TKI resistance in CML. Replicates of imatinib-resistant cell lines were treated with dasatinib or nilotinib. Second-line resistant replicates were exposed to third-line treatment. RESULTS: Growth of all replicates in all three lines of treatment was associated with T315I. However, T315I occurred with low abundance and did not increase during sequential treatment. Nilotinib second-line more often gave rise to sequential resistance compared with dasatinib due to pre-existing P-loop mutations, especially at suboptimal drug concentration. In contrast, mutations predisposing to dasatinib resistance such as F317C/V and V299L did not occur before dasatinib exposure. Nilotinib third-line did not overcome imatinib-dasatinib resistance due to pre-existing T315I or P-loop/V299L or P-loop/F317 exchanges. Dasatinib third-line suppressed imatinib-nilotinib-resistant replicates with residual sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential acquisition of BCR-ABL drug resistance mutations in CML might be underestimated. Resistance to sequential TKI monotherapy in vitro more often was associated with stepwise acquisition of drug-specific compound mutations compared with T315I. Pre-existing mutations strongly limited the activity of both third-line treatments, and the activity of nilotinib second-line in vitro critically depended on drug concentration.","['Bauer, Robert C', 'Sanger, Jana', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Duyster, Justus', 'von Bubnoff, Nikolas']","['Bauer RC', 'Sanger J', 'Peschel C', 'Duyster J', 'von Bubnoff N']","['III.

We used flow cytometry to characterize cell surface antigen expression on human testicular cells and leukemic cells (MOLT-4 and TF-1a). We demonstrated via FACS that EpCAM is expressed by human spermatogonia but not MOLT-4 cells. In contrast, HLA-ABC and CD49e marked >95% of MOLT-4 cells but were not expressed on human spermatogonia. A multiparameter sort of MOLT-4-contaminated human testicular cell suspensions was performed to isolate EpCAM+/HLA-ABC-/CD49e- (putative spermatogonia) and EpCAM-/HLA-ABC+/CD49e+ (putative MOLT-4) cell fractions. The EpCAM+/HLA-ABC-/CD49e- fraction was enriched for spermatogonial colonizing activity and did not form tumors following human-to-nude mouse xenotransplantation. The EpCAM-/HLA-ABC+/CD49e+ fraction produced tumors following xenotransplantation. This approach could be generalized with slight modification to also remove contaminating TF-1a leukemia cells.

RESULTS: BV8-STAT3 forms a feed-forward loop in both normal and malignant myeloid cells and promotes tumor growth. CONCLUSION: JAK2/STAT3 signaling plays critical roles in BV8-mediated myeloid cell-dependent oncogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies a novel role of BV8-STAT3 signaling in mediating cross-talk between tumor microenvironment and tumor cells. An important role of BV8 in mobilization of myeloid cells and myeloid cell-dependent angiogenesis has been established. Recently, it has also been shown that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced BV8 expression is STAT3 dependent in CD11b(+)Gr1(+) myeloid cells. However, the BV8 downstream signaling pathway(s) intrinsic to myeloid cells crucial for angiogenesis, and potentially also for development of cancers of myeloid origin, remains largely unknown. Here we show that BV8 activates STAT3, which is critical for regulating genes important for both tumor cell proliferation/survival and tumor angiogenesis, in both normal and malignant myeloid cells. Further, BV8-induced STAT3 activation requires Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) activity as shown by both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition. Knocking down BV8 in human myeloid leukemia cells inhibits STAT3 activity and expression of STAT3 downstream angiogenic and pro-proliferation/survival genes, leading to a decrease in tumor cell viability. BV8 shRNA expressing leukemia cells exhibit reduced STAT3 activity and tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, we have delineated a signaling pathway downstream of BV8 that plays critical roles in both the tumor microenvironment and malignant myeloid cells for angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation/survival.","['Xin, Hong', 'Lu, Rongze', 'Lee, Heehyoung', 'Zhang, Wang', 'Zhang, Chunyan', 'Deng, Jiehui', 'Liu, Yong', 'Shen, Shudan', 'Wagner, Kay-Uwe', 'Forman, Stephen', 'Jove, Richard', 'Yu, Hua']","['Xin H', 'Lu R', 'Lee H', 'Zhang W', 'Zhang C', 'Deng J', 'Liu Y', 'Shen S', 'Wagner KU', 'Forman S', 'Jove R', 'Yu H']","['Departments of Cancer Immunotherapeutics and Tumor Immunology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Angiogenic Proteins)', '0 (Gastrointestinal Hormones)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (PROK2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Angiogenic Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Feedback, Physiological', 'Gastrointestinal Hormones/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cells/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neuropeptides/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Burden']",2013/04/04 06:00,2013/07/16 06:00,['2013/04/04 06:00'],"['2013/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)54612-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.450049 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 May 10;288(19):13842-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.450049.

The aim of the study was to validate the expression stability of ten candidate reference genes in RNA isolated from whole blood cells of BLV-negative and BLV-positive cows with hematological abnormalities. The rankings of the candidate genes according to their expression stability were calculated using BestKeeper, NormFinder and qBase(PLUS) software with implemented geNorm(PLUS) algorithm. The results showed that two genes are sufficient for normalization of qRT-PCR studies in whole blood RNA isolated from cows infected with BLV. According to geNorm, UCHL5 and RPLP0 were the best choice, but taking into account possible intergroup variation, NormFinder recommended RPLP0 and B2M as a most suitable pair. The overall ranking based on the geometric mean of the ranking numbers from each method separately showed UCHL5, RPLP0 and TBP as the most stable candidate reference genes. In addition, all three methods unanimously pointed at the commonly used ACTB and GAPDH as the least stable genes. These results further emphasize the need to accurately validate candidate reference genes before use in gene expression qRT-PCR studies.","['Brym, P', 'Rusc, A', 'Kaminski, S']","['Brym P', 'Rusc A', 'Kaminski S']","['Department of Animal Genetics, University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Oczapowskiego 5, 10-719 Olsztyn, Poland. pawbrym@uwm.edu.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/blood/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Reference Standards', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",2013/04/04 06:00,2013/11/15 06:00,['2013/04/04 06:00'],"['2012/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2427(13)00095-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2013 Jun 15;153(3-4):302-7. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.03.004.

Nevertheless, several chromosome abnormalities have not been completely determined, and their prognostic significance is currently unknown due to their low incidence and the sporadic limited data. We report a case of AML-M2 with a novel, nonrandom translocation t(5;18)(q35;q21) in order to clarify the clinical features and outcome of these patients which could be advisable for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. This translocation has been reported only once in AML. Our patient received intensive chemotherapy, but he achieved a complete remission only initially. Eighteen months post diagnosis, t(3;12)(p23;p13) was detected as a secondary abnormality to t(5;18)(q35;q21) in the progression of the disease. FISH studies confirmed the reciprocal t(5;18)(q35;q21) and demonstrated a rearrangement of ETV6 gene as a consequence of t(3;12)(p23;p13). The patient died a few days later. In conclusion, t(5;18)(q35;q21) is a rare but nonrandom abnormality in AML, found in FAB M2 subtype, possibly associated with a rather poor prognosis, while t(3;12)(p23;p13) seems to contribute to the progression of the disease.

SOCS2 is known to regulate signal transduction by cytokine receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. The receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 is of importance for proliferation, survival and differentiation of hematopoietic cells and is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia. We observed that SOCS2 associates with activated FLT3 through phosphotyrosine residues 589 and 919, and co-localizes with FLT3 in the cell membrane. SOCS2 increases FLT3 ubiquitination and accelerates receptor degradation in proteasomes. SOCS2 negatively regulates FLT3 signaling by blocking activation of Erk 1/2 and STAT5. Furthermore, SOCS2 expression leads to a decrease in FLT3-ITD-mediated cell proliferation and colony formation. Thus, we suggest that SOCS2 associates with activated FLT3 and negatively regulates the FLT3 signaling pathways.","['Kazi, Julhash U', 'Ronnstrand, Lars']","['Kazi JU', 'Ronnstrand L']","['Experimental Clinical Chemistry, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Wallenberg Laboratory, Skane University Hospital, 20502 Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,"['0 (SOCS2 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', '*Protein Interaction Maps', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Sequence Alignment', '*Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/analysis/*metabolism']",2013/04/04 06:00,2013/12/24 06:00,['2013/04/04 06:00'],"['2013/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S1574-7891(13)00044-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molonc.2013.02.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2013 Jun;7(3):693-703. doi: 10.1016/j.molonc.2013.02.020.

The aim of this work was to characterize hTERT splice variants in CLL in relation to disease activity, clinical stage, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) genes mutational status, and TL. Real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were validated for quantification of the hTERT transcripts with either alpha deletion (del-alpha; alpha(-)beta(+))), beta deletion (del-beta; alpha(+)beta(-)) or both alpha and beta deletions (del-alphabeta; alpha(-)beta(-)). The splice variant expression pattern was studied in 97 patients with CLL, 6 healthy control subjects, and one CD34 cell sample. TL was assessed with real-time polymerase chain reaction in 71 of 97 samples. Thirty-two percent of the cases did not express any of the splice variants. Average FL expression was 5.5-fold higher in IGHV-unmutated (n = 35) compared with mutated (n = 59) patients (p < 0.0001). FL levels correlated directly with the percentage of IGHV homology (r = 0.34; p = 0.0007) and inversely with TL (r = -0.44; p = 0.0001). Overall, FL expression correlated significantly with that of the other splice variants. All transcripts were more frequently expressed in progressive compared with nonprogressive patients (p < 0.0001 for FL and del-alpha; p = 0.01 for del-beta; and p = 0.006 for del-alphabeta). This study provides a detailed insight into the hTERT transcript pattern in CLL, highlighting the necessity of subgrouping patients according to IGHV mutation status when analyzing hTERT expression.","['Palma, Marzia', 'Parker, Anton', 'Hojjat-Farsangi, Mohammad', 'Forster, Jade', 'Kokhaei, Parviz', 'Hansson, Lotta', 'Osterborg, Anders', 'Mellstedt, Hakan']","['Palma M', 'Parker A', 'Hojjat-Farsangi M', 'Forster J', 'Kokhaei P', 'Hansson L', 'Osterborg A', 'Mellstedt H']","['Immune and Gene Therapy Laboratory, Department of Oncology and Pathology, Cancer Centre Karolinska, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. marzia.palma@karolinska.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/*genetics/physiology', 'Telomere/*ultrastructure']",2013/04/04 06:00,2013/09/10 06:00,['2013/04/04 06:00'],"['2012/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(13)00120-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2013.03.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2013 Jul;41(7):615-26. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2013.03.008.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to elucidate whether these adverse effects are passed from exposed male mice to their offspring. Adult male mice received Fen (10 mg/kg) daily for 30 days and mated with untreated females to produce offspring. Fenvalerate significantly changed the methylation status of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (Ace), forkhead box O3 (Foxo3a), huntingtin-associated protein 1 (Hap1), nuclear receptor subfamily 3 (Nr3c2), promyelocytic leukemia (Pml), and Prostaglandin F2 receptor negative regulator (Ptgfrn) genes in paternal mice sperm genomic DNA. Further, Fen significantly increased sperm abnormalities; serum testosterone and estradiol-17ss level in adult male (F0) and their male offspring (F1). Further, paternal Fen treatment significantly increased the length of estrous cycle, serum estradiol-17ss concentration in estrus, and progesterone levels in diestrus in female offspring (F1). These findings suggest that adverse effects of paternal Fen exposure on reproductive functions can be seen not only in treated males (F0) but also in their offsprings.","['Xia, Dong', 'Parvizi, Nahid', 'Zhou, Yuchuan', 'Xu, Kesi', 'Jiang, Hui', 'Li, Rongjie', 'Hang, Yiqiong', 'Lu, Yang']","['Xia D', 'Parvizi N', 'Zhou Y', 'Xu K', 'Jiang H', 'Li R', 'Hang Y', 'Lu Y']","['1Institute of Animal Husbandry & Veterinary Sciences, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Reprod Sci,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",101291249,"['0 (Insecticides)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrethrins)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'Z6MXZ39302 (fenvalerate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Estrous Cycle/drug effects', 'Female', 'Insecticides/*toxicity', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nitriles/*toxicity', 'Ovary/drug effects/metabolism', 'Paternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Progesterone/blood', 'Pyrethrins/*toxicity', 'Reproduction/*drug effects/genetics', 'Spermatozoa/drug effects/pathology', 'Testis/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Testosterone/blood', 'Uterus/drug effects/metabolism']",2013/04/04 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/04/04 06:00'],"['2013/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1933719113483015 [pii]', '10.1177/1933719113483015 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Sci. 2013 Nov;20(11):1308-15. doi: 10.1177/1933719113483015.

However, its activity against nonhematologic cancers is rather limited so far. Here, we show that inhibition of ATO-mediated EGF receptor (EGFR) activation can be used to potently sensitize diverse solid cancer types against ATO. Thus, combination of ATO and the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib exerted synergistic activity against multiple cancer cell lines. Subsequent analyses revealed that this effect was based on the blockade of ATO-induced EGFR phosphorylation leading to more pronounced G2-M arrest as well as enhanced and more rapid induction of apoptosis. Comparable ATO-sensitizing effects were also found with PI3K/AKT and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitors, suggesting an essential role of the EGFR-mediated downstream signaling pathway in cancer cell protection against ATO. H2AX staining and comet assay revealed that erlotinib significantly increases ATO-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) well in accordance with a role of the EGFR signaling axis in DNA damage repair. Indeed, EGFR inhibition led to downregulation of several DNA DSB repair proteins such as Rad51 and Rad50 as well as reduced phosphorylation of BRCA1. Finally, the combination treatment of ATO and erlotinib was also distinctly superior to both monotreatments against the notoriously therapy-resistant human A549 lung cancer and the orthotopic p31 mesothelioma xenograft model in vivo. In conclusion, this study suggests that combination of ATO and EGFR inhibitors is a promising therapeutic strategy against various solid tumors harboring wild-type EGFR.","['Kryeziu, Kushtrim', 'Jungwirth, Ute', 'Hoda, Mir Alireza', 'Ferk, Franziska', 'Knasmuller, Siegfried', 'Karnthaler-Benbakka, Claudia', 'Kowol, Christian R', 'Berger, Walter', 'Heffeter, Petra']","['Kryeziu K', 'Jungwirth U', 'Hoda MA', 'Ferk F', 'Knasmuller S', 'Karnthaler-Benbakka C', 'Kowol CR', 'Berger W', 'Heffeter P']","['Department of Medicine I, Institute of Cancer Research, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (BRCA1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'DA87705X9K (Erlotinib Hydrochloride)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.- (Rad50 protein, human)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases', 'Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'BRCA1 Protein/biosynthesis', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Drug Synergism', 'ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Erlotinib Hydrochloride', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Rad51 Recombinase/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2013/04/04 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2013/04/04 06:00'],"['2013/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-13-0065 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-13-0065 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2013 Jun;12(6):1073-84. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-13-0065.

In ~10% of tumor samples, however, telomere length is conserved, despite no detectable telomerase activity, in part through activation of the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. METHODS: We studied the circular extra-chromosomal telomeric repeat (ECTR), an ALT hallmark, and telomerase activity in 24 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients in chronic phase (CP). RESULTS: We identified the presence of ECTR in primary leukemia cells from some of these samples, which indicates the possible involvement of an ALT mechanism. Moreover, we found that some samples exhibited both circular ECTR and telomerase activities, suggesting that both mechanisms can contribute to the onset of CML. CONCLUSION: We propose that ALT or the combined activities of ALT and telomerase might be required for the early stages of leukemogenesis. These findings shed new light into the oncogenic pathways responsible for the maintenance of telomere length in leukemia, which will ultimately determine the effectiveness of anti-telomerase-based treatment protocols.","['Samassekou, Oumar', 'Malina, Abba', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Yan, Ju']","['Samassekou O', 'Malina A', 'Hebert J', 'Yan J']","['Division of Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universite de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/*genetics', 'Telomere/*genetics', 'Telomere Homeostasis/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2013/04/04 06:00,2013/07/26 06:00,['2013/04/04 06:00'],"['2013/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-6-26 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-6-26 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2013 Apr 2;6:26. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-6-26.,20130402,,PMC3623713,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although much has been learned about PU.1 over the past decades, relatively little is known about cis-elements that interact with this factor under physiological or pathological conditions, especially in the whole-genome scale. We aimed to define the cistrome of PU.1 in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells and characterize the cis-elements bound by PU.1. METHODS: Chromatin immunoprecipitation with specific antibody coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used to investigate the in vivo PU.1 binding sites at the whole-genome scale in APL-derived NB4 cells. The ChIP-quantitative (q)-PCR and luciferase reporter assays were used to validate the binding events and trans-activity, respectively. Various computational analyses, including motif mining, evolutionary conservation analysis and functional enrichment analysis, were performed to characterize the cis-elements that interacted with PU.1. RESULTS: A total of 26,907 significantly enriched binding regions of PU.1 were identified under the false discovery rate 0.1% in NB4 cells. PU.1 bound to various types of genomic regions and acted as a promoter-enhancer dual binding transcription factor. Based on the sequence length and composition, two types of representative motifs were identified in PU.1 binding sites: a long and a short motif. The long motif, characterized by high sequence specificity and binding affinity, predominantly resided in the promoter-distal regions. In contrast, the short one, with strong evolutionary constraint, represented the primary PU.1 cis-elements in the promoter-proximal regions. Interestingly, the short one showed more preference to be correlated with the binding of other factors, especially PML/RARalpha. Moreover, genes targeted by both PU.1 and PML/RARalpha were significantly involved in categories associated with oncogenesis, hematopoiesis and the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that structurally differentiated cis-elements that interact with PU.1 are functionally distinguishable in APL, suggesting that the sequence diversity of cis-elements might be a critical mechanism by which cells interpret the genome, and contribute to distinct physiological and/or pathological function.","['Qian, Maoxiang', 'Jin, Wen', 'Zhu, Xuehua', 'Jia, Xiaohong', 'Yang, Xianwen', 'Du, Yanzhi', 'Wang, Kankan', 'Zhang, Ji']","['Qian M', 'Jin W', 'Zhu X', 'Jia X', 'Yang X', 'Du Y', 'Wang K', 'Zhang J']","['Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences CAS, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2013/04/04 06:00,2013/07/26 06:00,['2013/04/04 06:00'],"['2013/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-6-25 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-6-25 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2013 Apr 2;6:25. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-6-25.,20130402,,PMC3618267,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) by multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC), chimerism, cytogenetics and molecular analysis may be critical to prevent relapse. Therefore, we assessed the overall agreement among chimerism (low level mixed chimerism [LL-MC] vs. complete chimerism [CC]), MFC and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) mRNA to detect MRD and investigated the impact of MRD obtained from the three methods on patient outcome. Sixty-seven fresh bone marrow (BM) samples from 24 patients (17 acute myeloid leukemia [AML], seven acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]) in complete remission (CR) after allo-SCT were investigated at different time points. A moderate agreement was found among the three techniques investigated. A higher concordance between positive results from MFC (75.0% vs. 32.7%, p = 0.010) and WT1 (58.3% vs. 29.1%, p = 0.090) was detected among LL-MC rather than CC samples. Relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were found to be higher in MRD negative patients than in MRD positive patients analyzed with MFC and WT1.

Complete remission is achieved in the majority of patients, but responses are often not durable. Allogeneic stem cell transplant is used for patients with high risk features, including those who are positive for minimal residual disease after induction and consolidation therapy. Nevertheless, transplant is a toxic intervention, and does not guarantee long-term disease-free survival. Monoclonal antibodies target surface antigens present on leukemic blasts, with the aim of minimizing off-target toxicity. Rituximab, an antibody directed against CD20, prolongs the survival of younger adults with ALL when added to chemotherapy in the frontline setting. Novel agents, such as the cytotoxin-antibody conjugate inotuzumab, and the bispecific T-cell engaging compound blinatumomab, have exhibited marked antileukemic activity in the relapsed setting. As these agents continue in clinical development, it will be important to eventually incorporate them in the frontline treatment approach.

The Guava EasyCyte Plus (Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA, US) is the first, personal, bench-top flow cytometer designed to address these limitations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to adapt the immunohistochemical protocol used for immunophenotyping of canine lymphoma to the personal flow cytometer for rapid, effective and user-friendly application to the diagnosis and prognosis of canine lymphoma and to demonstrate its practicality for widespread veterinary application. Performance of the personal flow cytometer for immunophenotyping T and B lymphocytes in blood and lymph nodes from normal dogs and dogs with lymphoproliferative disease, was assessed using only two monoclonal antibodies (against CD3 and CD21), and by comparison with analysis using two conventional flow cytometers. METHODS: 26 dogs with lymphoproliferative disease (23 with lymphoma, 3 with lymphocytic leukaemia) were studied along with 15 controls (2 non-lymphoma lymph nodes and 13 non-leukemic bloods. Lymphocytes were immunostained with fluorescent-labeled, monoclonal antibodies against CD3 and CD21. To assess the effectiveness of the personal flow cytometer in discrimination between T and B cell immunophenotypes, T and B cell counts for half the samples (14 blood and 11 lymph node) were also determined using the same method and conventional flow cytometers (FACSCalibur, Cyan Dako). To assess the effectiveness of the personal flow cytometer in discriminating between leukocyte types, lymphocyte differential counts were determined for 21 blood samples and compared with those from automated hematology analyzers (CELL-DYN 3500, n=11 and ADVIA 2120, n=10). Quality and sub-cellular distribution of immunostaining was assessed using fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: The protocol for immunophenotyping took 2 to 3 hours to complete from the point of receipt of sample to reporting of immunophenotype. The personal flow cytometer differential lymphocyte counts correlated highly (n=20; r=0.97, p<0.0001) with those of automated haematology analyzers. The personal flow cytometer counts consistently, but mildly, underestimated the percentages of lymphocytes in the samples (mean bias of -5.3%.). The personal flow cytometer immunophenotype counts were indistinguishable from those of conventional flow cytometers for both peripheral blood samples (n=13; r=0.95; p<0.0001; bias of -1.1%) and lymph node aspirates (n=11,r=0.98; p<0.001; bias of 1%). All but one leukemic and one lymphomatous lymph node sample, out of 26 samples of dogs with lymphoproliferative disease analyzed, could be immunophenotyped as either B or T cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that use of only 2 monoclonal antibodies is sufficient for immunophenotyping most cases of canine lymphoma by flow cytometry and enables rapid immunophenotyping. The personal flow cytometer may be as effectively used for immunophenotyping canine lymphoma as conventional flow cytometers. However, the personal flow cytometer is more accessible and user-friendly, and requires lower sample volumes.","['Papakonstantinou, Stratos', 'Berzina, Inese', 'Lawlor, Amanda', ""J O'Neill, Emma"", ""J O'Brien, Peter""]","['Papakonstantinou S', 'Berzina I', 'Lawlor A', ""J O'Neill E"", ""J O'Brien P""]","['School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin (UCD), Dublin, Ireland.', 'School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin (UCD), Dublin, Ireland.', 'School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin (UCD), Dublin, Ireland.', 'School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin (UCD), Dublin, Ireland.', 'School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin (UCD), Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Ir Vet J,Irish veterinary journal,0100762,,,,2013/04/04 06:00,2013/04/04 06:01,['2013/04/04 06:00'],"['2012/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/2046-0481-66-6 [doi]', '2046-0481-66-6 [pii]']",epublish,Ir Vet J. 2013 Apr 1;66(1):6. doi: 10.1186/2046-0481-66-6. eCollection 2013.,20130401,,PMC3640923,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Canine lymphoma', 'Guava', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Microfluidics', 'Personal flow cytometer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete deficiency is fatal in knockout mice, but a mutant polymorphism resulting in low enzyme activity with an accumulation of ITP and other non-canonical nucleotides, appears benign in humans. We hypothesised that reduced ITPase activity may cause acquired mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) defects. Furthermore, we investigated whether accumulating mtDNA defects may then be a risk factor for cell transformation, in adult haematological malignancy (AHM). METHODS: DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and bone marrow samples. Microarray-based sequencing of mtDNA was performed on 13 AHM patients confirmed as carrying the ITPA 94C>A mutation causing low ITPase activity, and 4 AHM patients with wildtype ITPA. The frequencies of ITPA 94C>A and IVS2+21A>C polymorphisms were studied from 85 available AHM patients. RESULTS: ITPA 94C>A was associated with a significant increase in total heteroplasmic/homoplasmic mtDNA mutations (p<0.009) compared with wildtype ITPA, following exclusion of haplogroup variants. This suggested that low ITPase activity may induce mitochondrial abnormalities. Compared to the normal population, frequencies for the 94C>A and IVS2+21A>C mutant alleles among the AHM patients were higher for myelodyplastic syndrome (MDS) - but below significance; were approximately equivalent for chronic lymphoblastic leukemia; and were lower for acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: This study invokes a new paradigm for the evolution of MDS, where nucleotide imbalances produced by defects in 'house-cleaning' genes may induce mitochondrial dysfunction, compromising cell integrity. It supports recent studies which point towards an important role for ITPase in cellular surveillance of rogue nucleotides.","['Zamzami, Mazin A', 'Duley, John A', 'Price, Gareth R', 'Venter, Deon J', 'Yarham, John W', 'Taylor, Robert W', 'Catley, Laurence P', 'Florin, Timothy H J', 'Marinaki, Anthony M', 'Bowling, Francis']","['Zamzami MA', 'Duley JA', 'Price GR', 'Venter DJ', 'Yarham JW', 'Taylor RW', 'Catley LP', 'Florin TH', 'Marinaki AM', 'Bowling F']","['King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Pyrophosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.9 (ITPA protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/*genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Pyrophosphatases/*genetics']",2013/04/04 06:00,2014/05/06 06:00,['2013/04/04 06:00'],"['2012/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-6-24 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-6-24 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2013 Mar 29;6:24. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-6-24.,20130329,,PMC3765497,,,"['096919/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MR/K000608/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients from the nilotinib registration trial (CAMN107A2101; registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00109707) who had imatinib-resistant or -intolerant Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP) or accelerated phase with BCR-ABL1 > 10% (on the international scale [IS]) at baseline and, in the first 6 months, had at least three BCR-ABL1 transcript measurements and an average daily dose of at least 720 mg were included in this analysis (N = 123). RESULTS: More than half of patients (65/123; 53%) had a slow monophasic response and the remainder (58/123; 47%) had a biphasic response, in which patients had a rapid initial decrease in BCR-ABL1 transcripts followed by a more gradual response. The biphasic response type strongly correlated with improved event-free survival (EFS). Data in the first 6 months of follow-up were sufficient to predict EFS at 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ CML-CP-in whom the majority had a biphasic response-approximately half of patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML had a slower, monophasic response. Second-line patients who did have a biphasic response had an EFS outlook similar to that of newly diagnosed patients treated with imatinib. Our model was comparable to using BCR-ABL1 (IS) </= 10% at 6 months as a threshold for predicting EFS.","['Stein, Andrew M', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Beppu, Lan', 'Gottardi, Enrico', 'Branford, Susan', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Woodman, Richard C', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Radich, Jerald P']","['Stein AM', 'Martinelli G', 'Hughes TP', 'Muller MC', 'Beppu L', 'Gottardi E', 'Branford S', 'Soverini S', 'Woodman RC', 'Hochhaus A', 'Kim DW', 'Saglio G', 'Radich JP']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Chronic Disease', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate']",2013/04/04 06:00,2015/01/28 06:00,['2013/04/04 06:00'],"['2012/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-13-173 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-13-173 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2013 Apr 2;13:173. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-13-173.,20130402,,PMC3646679,,,['P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00109707'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to evaluate kidney function in children after treatment of ALL. We used our 99mTc-DTPA (diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid labeled with 99mTc) dynamic scintigraphy protocol. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 48 ALL patients, aged 79-275 months, in complete remission (mean duration 51 months). Treatment was according to the guidelines of the Berlin Frankfurt Munster (BFM) BFM 86 and BFM 90 protocols in 36 (75%) and 12 (25%) children, respectively. Follow-up after treatment was up to 12 months in 10 (21%) children (group I), 12-60 months in 21 (44%) children (group II), and more than 60 months in 17 (35%) children (group III). 99mTc-DTPA dynamic renal scintigraphy was done in all patients. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was determined according to Gates and the diuretic test was done after 18 minutes of the examination. RESULTS: The glomerular filtration rate at the end of the 5-year follow-up was less than 80 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p < 0.002) in 3 (25%) children treated with the BFM 86 protocol. In the remaining 45 (94%) patients, GFR exceeded 80 mL/ min/1.73 m2. Normal renogram curves were obtained in 40 (83%) patients. Eight (17%) children had cumulative curves with normal clearance. This finding was interpreted as non-obstructive uropathy. There was no statistical correlation between outflow disorders seen during dynamic scintigraphy, type of chemotherapy protocol, and assignment to risks group. CONCLUSIONS: 1. There was no clinically significant kidney function impairment in children after treatment of ALL. 2. Dynamic renal scintigraphy can be a valuable and non-invasive method for the assessment of kidney function in patients with a risk factor in the form of previous potentially nephrotoxic antitumor treatment.","['Listewnik, Maria H', 'Peregud-Pogorzelski, Jaroslaw', 'Birkenfeld, Bozena', 'Matacz, Monika', 'Zorga, Piotr', 'Szychot, Elwira', 'Piwowarska-Bilska, Hanna', 'Brodkiewicz, Andrzej']","['Listewnik MH', 'Peregud-Pogorzelski J', 'Birkenfeld B', 'Matacz M', 'Zorga P', 'Szychot E', 'Piwowarska-Bilska H', 'Brodkiewicz A']","['Zaklad Medycyny Nuklearnej Pomorskiego Uniwersytetu Medycznego w Szczecinie, ul.

Although targeted gene disruption studies have demonstrated that TAK1 plays a critical role in T cell functions, precise functions of downstream mediators remain elusive. We used the chemical compound LL-Z1640-2, which preferentially suppressed MAPK activation but not NF-kappaB signal downstream of TAK1. LL-Z1640-2 blocked TCR-induced T cell proliferation and activation, confirming that a TAK1-mediated MAPK signal is essential for T cell activation. LL-Z1640-2 induced apoptosis of activated mouse splenic T cells in a caspase- and caspase-activated DNase-dependent manner. TAK1-JNK pathway, which is activated downstream of IL-2R, induced the phosphorylation of antiapoptotic protein Mcl1 in activated T cells, resulting in the stabilization of Mcl1 protein. Our data uncover that among signal transduction pathways downstream of TAK1, JNK mediates a survival program through Mcl1 stabilization downstream of IL-2R in activated T cells and that blockade of TAK1-JNK pathway can eliminate activated T cells by apoptosis.","['Hirata, Yasuko', 'Sugie, Ayano', 'Matsuda, Akio', 'Matsuda, Satoshi', 'Koyasu, Shigeo']","['Hirata Y', 'Sugie A', 'Matsuda A', 'Matsuda S', 'Koyasu S']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (LL Z1640-2)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP kinase kinase kinase 7)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Caspases/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Deoxyribonucleases/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/immunology/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/immunology/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphorylation/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism']",2013/04/03 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2013/04/03 06:00'],"['2013/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1202809 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1202809 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 May 1;190(9):4621-6. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1202809.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CD20(+) stage III or IV FL with complete response (CR), unconfirmed CR (CRu), or partial response (PR) after first-line induction treatment were randomly assigned to (90)Y-ibritumomab consolidation therapy (rituximab 250 mg/m(2) days -7 and 0, then (90)Y-ibritumomab 14.8 MBq/kg day 0; maximum 1,184 MBq) or no further treatment (control). Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) from date of random assignment. RESULTS: For 409 patients available for analysis ((90)Y-ibritumomab, n = 207; control, n = 202), estimated 8-year overall PFS was 41% with (90)Y-ibritumomab versus 22% for control (hazard ratio [HR], 0.47; P < .001). For patients in CR/CRu after induction, 8-year PFS with (90)Y-ibritumomab was 48% versus 32% for control (HR, 0.61; P = .008), and for PR patients, it was 33% versus 10% (HR, 0.38; P < .001). For (90)Y-ibritumomab consolidation, median PFS was 4.1 years (v 1.1 years for control; P < .001). Median time to next treatment (TTNT) was 8.1 years for (90)Y-ibritumomab versus 3.0 years for control (P < .001) with approximately 80% response rates to second-line therapy in either arm, including autologous stem-cell transplantation. No unexpected toxicities emerged during long-term follow-up. Estimated between-group 8-year overall survival rates were similar. Annualized incidence rate of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloblastic leukemia was 0.50% versus 0.07% in (90)Y-ibritumomab and control groups, respectively (P = .042). CONCLUSION: (90)Y-ibritumomab consolidation after achieving PR or CR/CRu to induction confers 3-year benefit in median PFS with durable 19% PFS advantage at 8 years and improves TTNT by 5.1 years for patients with advanced FL.","['Morschhauser, Franck', 'Radford, John', 'Van Hoof, Achiel', 'Botto, Barbara', 'Rohatiner, Ama Z S', 'Salles, Gilles', 'Soubeyran, Pierre', 'Tilly, Herve', 'Bischof-Delaloye, Angelika', 'van Putten, Wim L J', 'Kylstra, Jelle W', 'Hagenbeek, Anton']","['Morschhauser F', 'Radford J', 'Van Hoof A', 'Botto B', 'Rohatiner AZ', 'Salles G', 'Soubeyran P', 'Tilly H', 'Bischof-Delaloye A', 'van Putten WL', 'Kylstra JW', 'Hagenbeek A']","['Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Lille, France. franck.morschhauser@chru-lille.fr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Yttrium Radioisotopes)', '4Q52C550XK (ibritumomab tiuxetan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/diagnosis/etiology', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*methods', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Yttrium Radioisotopes/therapeutic use']",2013/04/03 06:00,2013/07/28 06:00,['2013/04/03 06:00'],"['2013/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2012.45.6400 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2012.45.6400 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 Jun 1;31(16):1977-83. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.45.6400.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data on 113 patients with FA with cytogenetic abnormalities (n = 54), MDS (n = 45), or acute leukemia (n = 14) who were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research from 1985 to 2007. RESULTS: Neutrophil recovery occurred in 78% and 85% of patients at days 28 and 100, respectively. Day 100 cumulative incidences of acute graft-versus-host disease grades B to D and C to D were 26% (95% CI, 19% to 35%) and 12% (95% CI, 7% to 19%), respectively. Survival probabilities at 1, 3, and 5 years were 64% (95% CI, 55% to 73%), 58% (95% CI, 48% to 67%), and 55% (95% CI, 45% to 64%), respectively. In univariate analysis, younger age was associated with superior 5-year survival (</= v > 14 years: 69% [95% CI, 57% to 80%] v 39% [95% CI, 26% to 53%], respectively; P = .001). In transplantations from HLA-matched related donors (n = 82), younger patients (</= v > 14 years: 78% [95% CI, 64% to 90%] v 34% [95% CI, 20% to 50%], respectively; P < .001) and patients with cytogenetic abnormalities only versus MDS/acute leukemia (67% [95% CI, 52% to 81%] v 43% [95% CI, 27% to 59%], respectively; P = .03) had superior 5-year survival. CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicates that long-term survival for patients with FA with cytogenetic abnormalities, MDS, or acute leukemia is achievable. Younger patients and recipients of HLA-matched related donor transplantations who have cytogenetic abnormalities only have the best survival.","['Ayas, Mouhab', 'Saber, Wael', 'Davies, Stella M', 'Harris, Richard E', 'Hale, Gregory A', 'Socie, Gerard', 'LeRademacher, Jennifer', 'Thakar, Monica', 'Deeg, H Joachim J', 'Al-Seraihy, Amal', 'Battiwalla, Minoo', 'Camitta, Bruce M', 'Olsson, Richard', 'Bajwa, Rajinder S', 'Bonfim, Carmem M', 'Pasquini, Ricardo', 'Macmillan, Margaret L', 'George, Biju', 'Copelan, Edward A', 'Wirk, Baldeep', 'Al Jefri, Abdullah', 'Fasth, Anders L', 'Guinan, Eva C', 'Horn, Biljana N', 'Lewis, Victor A', 'Slavin, Shimon', 'Stepensky, Polina', 'Bierings, Marc', 'Gale, Robert Peter']","['Ayas M', 'Saber W', 'Davies SM', 'Harris RE', 'Hale GA', 'Socie G', 'LeRademacher J', 'Thakar M', 'Deeg HJ', 'Al-Seraihy A', 'Battiwalla M', 'Camitta BM', 'Olsson R', 'Bajwa RS', 'Bonfim CM', 'Pasquini R', 'Macmillan ML', 'George B', 'Copelan EA', 'Wirk B', 'Al Jefri A', 'Fasth AL', 'Guinan EC', 'Horn BN', 'Lewis VA', 'Slavin S', 'Stepensky P', 'Bierings M', 'Gale RP']","['King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. mouhab@kfshrc.edu.sa']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Fanconi Anemia/genetics/*surgery/therapy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/genetics/*surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/genetics/*surgery', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2013/04/03 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2013/04/03 06:00'],"['2013/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2012.45.9719 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2012.45.9719 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 May 1;31(13):1669-76. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.45.9719.

High expression of Evi1 is found in 10% of patients with AML and indicates a poor outcome. Several recent studies have indicated that Evi1 requires collaborative factors to induce AML. Therefore, the search for candidate factors that collaborate with Evi1 in leukemogenesis is one of the key issues in uncovering the mechanism of Evi1-related leukemia. Previously, we succeeded in making a mouse model of Evi1-related leukemia using a bone marrow transplantation (BMT) system. In the Evi1-induced leukemic cells, we identified frequent retroviral integrations near the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) gene and overexpression of its protein. These findings imply that C/EBPbeta is a candidate gene that collaborates with Evi1 in leukemogenesis. Cotransduction of Evi1 and the shortest isoform of C/EBPbeta, liver inhibitory protein (LIP), induced AML with short latencies in a mouse BMT model. Overexpression of LIP alone also induced AML with longer latencies. However, excision of all 3 isoforms of C/EBPbeta (LAP*/LAP/LIP) did not inhibit the development of Evi1-induced leukemia. Therefore, isoform-specific intervention that targets LIP is required when we consider C/EBPbeta as a therapeutic target.","['Watanabe-Okochi, Naoko', 'Yoshimi, Akihide', 'Sato, Tomohiko', 'Ikeda, Toshiyuki', 'Kumano, Keiki', 'Taoka, Kazuki', 'Satoh, Yumiko', 'Shinohara, Akihito', 'Tsuruta, Takako', 'Masuda, Akiko', 'Yokota, Hiromitsu', 'Yatomi, Yutaka', 'Takahashi, Koki', 'Kitaura, Jiro', 'Kitamura, Toshio', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Watanabe-Okochi N', 'Yoshimi A', 'Sato T', 'Ikeda T', 'Kumano K', 'Taoka K', 'Satoh Y', 'Shinohara A', 'Tsuruta T', 'Masuda A', 'Yokota H', 'Yatomi Y', 'Takahashi K', 'Kitaura J', 'Kitamura T', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology & Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Universityof Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (Cebpb protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/pathology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2013/04/03 06:00,2013/08/06 06:00,['2013/04/03 06:00'],"['2013/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58503-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-07-368654 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 May 16;121(20):4142-55. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-07-368654.

We therefore investigated the contribution of CD44 to CLL in a murine disease model, the Emicro-TCL1 transgenic mouse, and in CLL patients. Surface CD44 increased during murine CLL development. CD44 expression in human CLL was induced by stimulation with interleukin 4/soluble CD40 ligand and by stroma cell contact. Engagement of CD44 by its natural ligands, hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulfate, protected CLL cells from apoptosis, while anti-CD44 small interfering RNAs impaired tumor cell viability. Deletion of CD44 during TCL1-driven murine leukemogenesis reduced the tumor burden in peripheral blood and spleen and led to a prolonged overall survival. The leukemic cells from these CD44 knockout animals revealed lower levels of antiapoptotic MCL1, a higher propensity to apoptosis, and a diminished B-cell receptor kinase response. The inhibitory anti-CD44 antibodies IM7 and A3D8 impaired the viability of CLL cells in suspension cultures, in stroma contact models, and in vivo via MCL1 reduction and by effector caspase activation. Taken together, CD44 expression in CLL is mediated by the tumor microenvironment. As a coreceptor, CD44 promotes leukemogenesis by regulating stimuli of MCL1 expression. Moreover, CD44 can be addressed therapeutically in CLL by specific antibodies.","['Fedorchenko, Oleg', 'Stiefelhagen, Marius', 'Peer-Zada, Abdul A', 'Barthel, Romy', 'Mayer, Petra', 'Eckei, Laura', 'Breuer, Alexandra', 'Crispatzu, Giuliano', 'Rosen, Natascha', 'Landwehr, Thomas', 'Lilienthal, Nils', 'Mollmann, Michael', 'Montesinos-Rongen, Manuel', 'Heukamp, Lukas', 'Durig, Jan', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Fingerle-Rowson, Gunter', 'Herling, Marco']","['Fedorchenko O', 'Stiefelhagen M', 'Peer-Zada AA', 'Barthel R', 'Mayer P', 'Eckei L', 'Breuer A', 'Crispatzu G', 'Rosen N', 'Landwehr T', 'Lilienthal N', 'Mollmann M', 'Montesinos-Rongen M', 'Heukamp L', 'Durig J', 'Hallek M', 'Fingerle-Rowson G', 'Herling M']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, and Cluster of Excellence, Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics/physiology']",2013/04/03 06:00,2013/08/06 06:00,['2013/04/03 06:00'],"['2013/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58501-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-11-466250 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 May 16;121(20):4126-36. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-11-466250.

The detection of considerable amounts of Neu5Gc-sialoconjugates, in particular gangliosides, in human malignancies makes these antigens attractive targets for immunotherapy, in particular with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We have previously described a GM3(Neu5Gc) ganglioside-specific mAb, named 14F7, with the ability to kill tumor cells in a complement-independent manner. Silencing the cmah gene in GM3(Neu5Gc)-expressing L1210 mouse lymphocytic leukemia B cells caused the abrogation of this cytotoxic effect. We now show that cmah-silenced L1210 cells (cmah-kd) express a high level of GM3(Neu5Ac) and have an impaired ability for anchorage-independent cell growth and tumor development in vivo. No evidences of increased immunogenicity of the cmah-kd cell line were found. These results provide new evidences on the role of GM3(Neu5Gc), or Neu5Gc-sialoconjugates in general, in tumor biology. As an important tool in this study, we used the humanized version (here referred to as 7C1 mAb) of a recently described, rationally-designed mutant of 14F7 mAb that is able to bind to both GM3(Neu5Gc) and GM3(Neu5Ac). In contrast to its parental antibody, the humanized 14F7 (14F7hT) mAb, 7C1 mAb was able to kill not only GM3(Neu5Gc)-expressing L1210 wild type cells, but also GM3(Neu5Ac)-expressing cmah-kd cells, which endorses this antibody as a potential agent for cancer immunotherapy.","['Casadesus, Ana Victoria', 'Fernandez-Marrero, Yuniel', 'Clavell, Marilyn', 'Gomez, Jose Alberto', 'Hernandez, Tays', 'Moreno, Ernesto', 'Lopez-Requena, Alejandro']","['Casadesus AV', 'Fernandez-Marrero Y', 'Clavell M', 'Gomez JA', 'Hernandez T', 'Moreno E', 'Lopez-Requena A']","['Immunobiology Division, Center of Molecular Immunology, P.O.

We analyzed the alterations in the miRNA expression profile of the glioma cell line U-251 caused by ionizing radiation (IR) by using an miRNA array and identified several miRNAs whose expression was significantly affected by IR. Among the IR-responsive miRNAs, we further examined the function of miR-193a-3p, which exhibited the most significant growth-inhibiting effect. miR-193a-3p was observed to induce apoptosis in both U-251 and HeLa cells. We also demonstrated that miR-193a-3p induces the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage as determined by the level of gammaH2AX and by performing the comet assay. The induction of both apoptosis and DNA damage by miR-193a-3p was blocked by antioxidant treatment, indicating the crucial role of ROS in the action of miR-193a-3p. Among the putative target proteins, the expression of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, decreased because of miR-193a-3p transfection. A reporter assay using a luciferase construct containing the 3'-untranslated region of Mcl-1 confirmed that Mcl-1 is a direct target of miR-193a-3p. Down-regulation of Mcl-1 by siRNA transfection closely mimicked the outcome of miR-193a-3p transfection showing increased ROS, DNA damage, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis. Ectopic expression of Mcl-1 suppressed the pro-apoptotic action of miR-193a-3p, suggesting that Mcl-1 depletion is critical for miR-193a-3p induced apoptosis. Collectively, our results suggest a novel function for miR-193a-3p and its potential application in cancer therapy.","['Kwon, Jeong-Eun', 'Kim, Bu-Yeon', 'Kwak, Seo-Young', 'Bae, In-Hwa', 'Han, Young-Hoon']","['Kwon JE', 'Kim BY', 'Kwak SY', 'Bae IH', 'Han YH']","['Division of Radiation Cancer Research, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences, Nowon-gil 75, Nowon-gu, Seoul 139-706, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN193 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/radiation effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*radiation effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Luciferases', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2013/04/03 06:00,2013/12/24 06:00,['2013/04/03 06:00'],"['2013/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-013-0841-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2013 Jul;18(7):896-909. doi: 10.1007/s10495-013-0841-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Original methods for iPSC generation use fibroblasts as a cell source for reprogramming and retroviral vectors as a delivery method of the reprogramming factors. However, fibroblasts require extended time for expansion and viral delivery of transgenes results in the integration of vector sequences into the genome which is a source of potential insertion mutagenesis, residual expressions, and reactivation of transgenes during differentiation. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for the efficient generation of transgene-free iPSC lines from human bone marrow and cord blood cells with a single transfection of non-integrating episomal plasmids. This method uses mononuclear bone marrow and cord blood cells, and makes it possible to generate transgene-free iPSCs 1-3 weeks faster than previous methods of reprogramming with fibroblasts. Additionally, we show that this approach can be used for efficient reprogramming of chronic myeloid leukemia cells.","['Hu, Kejin', 'Slukvin, Igor']","['Hu K', 'Slukvin I']","['Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Reprogramming/genetics', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cryopreservation', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/chemistry', 'Plasmids/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes']",2013/04/03 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/04/03 06:00'],"['2013/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-62703-348-0_13 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2013;997:163-76. doi: 10.1007/978-1-62703-348-0_13.,,,,,,"['P51 RR000167/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P51RR000167/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 GM081629/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL099773/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P51 OD011106/OD/NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

G0S2 regulates lipolysis via inhibition of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). This study found that retinoic acid receptor (RAR), but not retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonists induced G0S2 expression in APL cells. Novel G0S2 functions were uncovered that included repression of exogenous gene expression and transcriptional activity. Transient G0S2 transfection repressed the activities of multiple reporter constructs (including the retinoid-regulated species RARbeta, UBE1L and G0S2); this occurred in diverse cell contexts. This inhibition was antagonized by siRNA-mediated G0S2 knockdown. To determine the inhibitory effects were not due to transient G0S2 expression, G0S2 was stably overexpressed in cells without appreciable basal G0S2 expression. As expected, this repressed transcriptional activities. Intriguingly, transfection of G0S2 did not affect endogenous RARbeta, UBE1L or G0S2 expression. Hence, only exogenously expressed genes were affected by G0S2. The domain responsible for this repression was localized to the G0S2 hydrophobic domain (HD). This was the same region responsible for the ability of G0S2 to inhibit ATGL activity. Whether an interaction with ATGL accounted for this new G0S2 activity was studied. Mimicking the inhibition of ATGL by oleic acid treatment that increased lipid droplet size or ATGL siRNA knockdown did not recapitulate G0S2 repressive effects. Engineered gain of ATGL expression did not rescue G0S2 transcriptional repression either. Thus, transcriptional repression by G0S2 did not depend on the ability of G0S2 to inhibit ATGL. Subcellular localization studies revealed that endogenous and exogenously-expressed G0S2 proteins were localized to the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear region. Expression of a mutant G0S2 species that lacked the HD domain altered cytosolic G0S2 localization. This linked G0S2 subcellular localization to G0S2 transcriptional repression. The potential mechanisms responsible for this G0S2 repression are examined.","['Ma, Tian', 'Dong, Jessica P', 'Sekula, David J', 'Fei, Dennis Liang', 'Lamph, William W', 'Henderson, Michael', 'Lu, Yun', 'Blumen, Steven', 'Freemantle, Sarah J', 'Dmitrovsky, Ethan']","['Ma T', 'Dong JP', 'Sekula DJ', 'Fei DL', 'Lamph WW', 'Henderson M', 'Lu Y', 'Blumen S', 'Freemantle SJ', 'Dmitrovsky E']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH 03755, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (G0S2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.1.3 (Lipase)', 'EC 3.1.1.3 (PNPLA2 protein, human)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (UBA7 protein, human)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipase/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes/metabolism']",2013/04/03 06:00,2013/11/02 06:00,['2013/04/03 06:00'],"['2013/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2013.1876 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2013 May;42(5):1743-53. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2013.1876.

Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are fusion proteins consisting of antigen recognition moieties and T-cell activation domains. T cells can be genetically modified to express CARs, and adoptive transfer of anti-CD19 CAR T cells is now being tested in clinical trials. Effective clinical treatment with anti-CD19 CAR T cells was first reported in 2010 after a patient with advanced-stage lymphoma treated at the NCI experienced a partial remission of lymphoma and long-term eradication of normal B cells. Additional patients have subsequently obtained long-term remissions of advanced-stage B-cell malignancies after infusions of anti-CD19 CAR T cells. Long-term eradication of normal CD19(+) B cells from patients receiving infusions of anti-CD19 CAR T cells demonstrates the potent antigen-specific activity of these T cells. Some patients treated with anti-CD19 CAR T cells have experienced acute adverse effects, which were associated with increased levels of serum inflammatory cytokines. Although anti-CD19 CAR T cells are at an early stage of development, the potent antigen-specific activity observed in patients suggests that infusions of anti-CD19 CAR T cells might become a standard therapy for some B-cell malignancies.","['Kochenderfer, James N', 'Rosenberg, Steven A']","['Kochenderfer JN', 'Rosenberg SA']","['Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. kochendj@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",England,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,Nature reviews.

The outcome with liposomal amphotericin B is not negatively affected by prior administration of mold-active azoles.,64-9,,"There are concerns of a reduced effect of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) given sequentially after mold-active azoles due to a possible antagonism in their antifungal mechanism. To investigate this possible effect in the clinic, we retrospectively studied 182 high risk hematologic patients with invasive fungal infections (IFI) who were treated with L-AmB. Overall, 96 patients (52.7%) had possible, 52 (28.6%) probable and 34 (18.7%) proven IFI according to EORTC classification. Most had suspected or proven invasive aspergillosis. We compared patients with prior exposure to mold-active azoles (n=100) to those having not (n=82). The group with prior mold-active azoles included more patients with poor risk features for IFI as acute myeloid leukemia (p<0.05) and prolonged neutropenia (p<0.05). A favorable response in the IFI, defined as a complete or partial response, was achieved in 75% and 74.4% of patients in the whole cohort, and in 66% and 74.4% of patients with probable or proven IFI in the two groups. None of these differences were significant. Multivariate analysis showed that refractory baseline disease and renal dysfunction were adverse factors for response in the IFI (p<0.05). Survival was poorer for patients with prior broad spectrum azoles (p<0.05), and for those who did not recover from neutropenia (p<0.05). In conclusion, the effectiveness of treatment of breakthrough fungal infection with L-AmB is not likely to be affected by prior exposure to mold-active azoles prophylaxis, but survival largely depends on host and disease factors.","['De la Serna, Javier', 'Jarque, Isidro', 'Lopez-Jimenez, Javier', 'Fernandez-Navarro, Jose Maria', 'Gomez, Valle', 'Jurado, Manuel', 'Pascual, Adriana', 'Serrano, Josefina', 'Romero, Monica', 'Vallejo, Carlos']","['De la Serna J', 'Jarque I', 'Lopez-Jimenez J', 'Fernandez-Navarro JM', 'Gomez V', 'Jurado M', 'Pascual A', 'Serrano J', 'Romero M', 'Vallejo C']","['Hematology Dept., Hospital Universitario12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain. drjdelaserna@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Rev Esp Quimioter,Revista espanola de quimioterapia : publicacion oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Quimioterapia,9108821,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/*therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Aspergillosis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Candidiasis, Invasive/drug therapy/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cross Infection/drug therapy', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Fungemia/*drug therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy/surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/drug therapy/surgery', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/complications', 'Postoperative Complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2013/04/03 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/04/03 06:00'],"['2013/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",['serna [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Esp Quimioter. 2013 Mar;26(1):64-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the 17 previously untreated patients, 7 (41.2%) achieved CR and 8 (47.0%) achieved PR. Two of the 5 pre-treated patients achieved CR and the other 2 achieved PR. During a median observation of 24 months, the overall survival rate was 81.8%. The main adverse reactions were myelosuppression and infection. Grade 1 to 3 granulocytopenia was found in 7 (31.8%) patients, and infection in 3 (13.6%) patients. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild. All the adverse reactions were reversible. CONCLUSION: The oral fludarabine is effective, safe, and well-tolerated in the patients with CLL/ SLL.","['Zhu, Yan', 'Qin, Qun', 'Xie, Zhaoxia']","['Zhu Y', 'Qin Q', 'Xie Z']","['Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Changsha 410008, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",China,Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

Testing >20 human lymphoma and leukemia B cell lines, we found that most can be transdifferentiated at least partially into macrophage-like cells, provided that C/EBPalpha is expressed at sufficiently high levels. A tamoxifen-inducible subclone of the Seraphina Burkitt lymphoma line, expressing C/EBPalphaER, could be efficiently converted into phagocytic and quiescent cells with a transcriptome resembling normal macrophages. The converted cells retained their phenotype even when C/EBPalpha was inactivated, a hallmark of cell reprogramming. Interestingly, C/EBPalpha induction also impaired the cells' tumorigenicity. Likewise, C/EBPalpha efficiently converted a lymphoblastic leukemia B cell line into macrophage-like cells, again dramatically impairing their tumorigenicity. Our experiments show that human cancer cells can be induced by C/EBPalpha to transdifferentiate into seemingly normal cells at high frequencies and provide a proof of principle for a potential new therapeutic strategy for treating B cell malignancies.","['Rapino, Francesca', 'Robles, Eloy F', 'Richter-Larrea, Jose A', 'Kallin, Eric M', 'Martinez-Climent, Jose A', 'Graf, Thomas']","['Rapino F', 'Robles EF', 'Richter-Larrea JA', 'Kallin EM', 'Martinez-Climent JA', 'Graf T']","['Center for Genomic Regulation, Universidad Pompeu Fabra and Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats, Dr. Aiguader 88, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Rep,Cell reports,101573691,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Transdifferentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/mortality', 'Macrophages/*cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phagocytosis', 'Tamoxifen/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Transcriptome', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2013/04/03 06:00,2013/11/07 06:00,['2013/04/03 06:00'],"['2012/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S2211-1247(13)00110-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.celrep.2013.03.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Rep. 2013 Apr 25;3(4):1153-63. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2013.03.003.

At present little is known about their phenotype and steroidogenic potential. We isolated highly purified PDGFRalpha-positive neonatal PTCs by magnetic cell sorting (MACS) from 8dpp rat testes and characterized them in vitro. We have demonstrated that PDGFRalpha-positive PTCs have a mixed phenotype. They expressed PTC-specific genes (alphaSma, Myh11), pluripotency markers (Pou5f1, nestin, Lifr) and genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes. Treatment with the cAMP-analog (Bu)2cAMP for 7 days upregulated steroidogenic enzyme gene expression and significantly increased their steroidogenic potential. The main end-point steroid was progesterone due to rapid inactivation of CYP17 and 17betaHSD. Long-term culturing of PDGFRalpha-positive PTCs increased the expression of Myh11, and treatment with (Bu)2cAMP attenuated this process. All together, our findings support the hypothesis that neonatal PDGFRalpha-positive PTCs are steroidogenic competent progeny of stem Leydig cells (SLCs) which give rise to the adult Leydig cell lineage.","['Landreh, Luise', 'Stukenborg, Jan-Bernd', 'Soder, Olle', 'Svechnikov, Konstantin']","['Landreh L', 'Stukenborg JB', 'Soder O', 'Svechnikov K']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, Karolinska Institutet and University Hospital, Solna, Sweden.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,"['0 (3 beta-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase-delta(5) 3-ketosteroid isomerase)', '0 (Gonadal Steroid Hormones)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nes protein, rat)', '0 (Nestin)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 1.1.1.145 (Progesterone Reductase)', 'EC 1.14.14.19 (CYP17A1 protein, rat)', 'EC 1.14.14.19 (Steroid 17-alpha-Hydroxylase)', 'EC 1.14.15.6 (Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 5.3.3.- (Steroid Isomerases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones/biosynthesis', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Leydig Cells/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Multienzyme Complexes/genetics/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Nestin', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Progesterone/*biosynthesis', 'Progesterone Reductase/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*metabolism', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Seminiferous Tubules/cytology', 'Stem Cells/physiology', 'Steroid 17-alpha-Hydroxylase/genetics/metabolism', 'Steroid Isomerases/genetics/metabolism', 'Testosterone/*biosynthesis', 'Transcriptome']",2013/04/03 06:00,2013/11/13 06:00,['2013/04/03 06:00'],"['2012/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0303-7207(13)00115-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mce.2013.03.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2013 Jun 15;372(1-2):96-104. doi: 10.1016/j.mce.2013.03.019.

Concomitant detection of the 2 conditions poses special diagnostic challenges for the pathologist. OBJECTIVE: To describe the pathologic findings in cases of concomitant bone marrow involvement by myeloma and CD5(+) monoclonal B cells and to outline the differential diagnostic possibilities, suggest a workup for correct diagnosis, and examine clinical outcome. DESIGN: Fifteen cases that met the diagnostic criteria were identified from pathology databases at 4 participating institutions. Morphologic findings were reviewed, additional immunohistochemical stains performed, and flow cytometric, cytogenetic, and relevant laboratory and clinical information was summarized. Previously published cases were searched from electronic databases and cross-references. RESULTS: Most patients (13 of 15) were older males. Often (11 of 15) they presented clinically with myeloma, yet had both monotypic plasma cells and B cells in the diagnostic marrow. In 4 patients, myeloma developed 24 months or later after chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In 7 patients, myeloma and CD5(+) B cells showed identical immunoglobulin light-chain restriction. Primary differential diagnoses include lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia with plasmacytoid differentiation. CD56 and/or cyclin D1 expression by plasma cells was helpful for correct diagnosis. Most patients in our cohort and published reports were treated for plasma cell myeloma. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant detection of myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the bone marrow is a rare event, which must be carefully differentiated from lymphomas with lymphoplasmacytic differentiation for correct treatment.","['Alley, Christopher L', 'Wang, Endi', 'Dunphy, Cherie H', 'Gong, Jerald Z', 'Lu, Chuanyi M', 'Boswell, Elizabeth L', 'Burchette, James', 'Lagoo, Anand S']","['Alley CL', 'Wang E', 'Dunphy CH', 'Gong JZ', 'Lu CM', 'Boswell EL', 'Burchette J', 'Lagoo AS']","['Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'CD5 Antigens/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphocytosis/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Plasma Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/diagnosis']",2013/04/03 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2013/04/03 06:00'],"['2013/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5858/arpa.2011-0696-OA [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2013 Apr;137(4):503-17. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2011-0696-OA.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This was a clinical-epidemiological, cross-sectional, observational, and descriptive study. It included patients younger than 2 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, treated in the period of 1990 to 2010 in a pediatric oncology unit of a state reference center, totaling 41 cases. RESULTS: All patients were white ethnicity, and 60.9% were females. Regarding age, 24.38% were younger than 6 months, 17.07% were between 6 months and 1 year, and 58.53% were older than 1 year. The age of 6 months was statistically significant for the outcome of death. Predominant signs and symptoms were fever, bruising, and petechiae. A leukocyte count > 100,000 was found in 34.14% of cases, hemoglobin count < 11 in 95.13%, and platelet count < 100,000 in 75.61. Infiltration of central nervous system was present in 12.91% of patients. According to the lineage, B-cell lineage predominated (73%), but the T-cell line was statistically significant for death. 39% of patients had disease recurrence. In relation to vital status, 70.73% of the patients died; septic shock was the main cause. CONCLUSIONS: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in infants has a high mortality rate, especially in children under 1 year and those with T-cell derived lineage.","['Ibagy, Amanda', 'Silva, Denise B', 'Seiben, Jackline', 'Winneshoffer, Ana P F F', 'Costa, Tatiana E J B', 'Dacoregio, Juliana S', 'Costa, Imarui', 'Faraco, Daniel']","['Ibagy A', 'Silva DB', 'Seiben J', 'Winneshoffer AP', 'Costa TE', 'Dacoregio JS', 'Costa I', 'Faraco D']","['Pediatric Oncologist.

This results in the production of an oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Glioma patients harboring IDH mutations have a longer survival than their wild-type counterparts. 2-HG has been detected noninvasively in gliomas with IDH mutations using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), suggesting its potential clinical relevance for identifying glioma subtypes with better prognosis. In this paper, the recent developments in the MRS detection of the 2-HG in gliomas are reviewed, including the therapeutic potentials and translational values.","['Esmaeili, Morteza', 'Vettukattil, Riyas', 'Bathen, Tone Frost']","['Esmaeili M', 'Vettukattil R', 'Bathen TF']","['Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transl Oncol,Translational oncology,101472619,,,,2013/04/02 06:00,2013/04/02 06:01,['2013/04/02 06:00'],"['2012/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1593/tlo.12424 [doi]'],ppublish,Transl Oncol. 2013 Apr;6(2):92-8. doi: 10.1593/tlo.12424.

Although mechanistic details are lacking, reports abound that Nrf2 can also be degraded in the nucleus. Here, we demonstrate that Nrf2 is a target for sumoylation by both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2. HepG2 cells treated with As2O3, which enhances attachment of SUMO-2/3 to target proteins, increased SUMO-2/3-modification (polysumoylation) of Nrf2. We show that Nrf2 traffics, in part, to promyelocytic leukemia-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). Cell fractions harboring key components of PML-NBs did not contain biologically active Keap1 but contained modified Nrf2 as well as RING finger protein 4 (RNF4), a poly-SUMO-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase. Overexpression of wild-type RNF4, but not the catalytically inactive mutant, decreased the steady-state levels of Nrf2, measured in the PML-NB-enriched cell fraction. The proteasome inhibitor MG-132 interfered with this decrease, resulting in elevated levels of polysumoylated Nrf2 that was also ubiquitylated. Wild-type RNF4 accelerated the half-life (t&frac12;) of Nrf2, measured in PML-NB-enriched cell fractions. These results suggest that RNF4 mediates polyubiquitylation of polysumoylated Nrf2, leading to its subsequent degradation in PML-NBs. Overall, this work identifies Nrf2 as a target for sumoylation and provides a novel mechanism for its degradation in the nucleus, independent of Keap1.","['Malloy, Melanie Theodore', 'McIntosh, Deneshia J', 'Walters, Treniqka S', 'Flores, Andrea', 'Goodwin, J Shawn', 'Arinze, Ifeanyi J']","['Malloy MT', 'McIntosh DJ', 'Walters TS', 'Flores A', 'Goodwin JS', 'Arinze IJ']","['Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee 37208-3599.', 'Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee 37208-3599.', 'Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee 37208-3599.', 'Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee 37208-3599.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Cancer Biology, School of Medicine, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee 37208-3599.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee 37208-3599.

A consensus exists regarding the need for administration of both induction and consolidation treatments, albeit using different approaches. However, there is conflicting evidence for the role of maintenance treatment in APL patients. OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy and safety of maintenance therapy in APL patients and to establish the optimal regimen for maintenance. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 6), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2012), LILACS (1982 to July 2012), relevant conference proceedings (2000 to 2012) and databases of ongoing and unpublished trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials assessing maintenance treatment in patients with newly diagnosed APL in first complete remission (CR) following induction or induction and consolidation therapy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors assessed the quality of trials and extracted data. We estimated and pooled hazard ratios (HR) and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the fixed-effect model. If significant heterogeneity was present we explored potential causes for such heterogeneity and if not found we used also the random-effects model. MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 randomized controlled trials enrolling 2072 patients in the systematic review, and conducted meta-analysis on nine of them. There was no statistically significant effect on overall survival (OS) in the three main comparisons (HR for any maintenance treatment versus observation 0.79, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.27; HR for all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-based maintenance versus non-ATRA based maintenance 1.21, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.98; HR for ATRA alone maintenance versus ATRA and chemotherapy 0.99, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.43). However, disease free survival (DFS) was improved with any maintenance therapy compared to observation (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.74; 5 trials, 1209 patients) and with ATRA and chemotherapy compared to ATRA alone maintenance (HR for ATRA alone compared to ATRA and chemotherapy 1.38, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.76; 4 trials, 1028 patients). DFS was not improved with ATRA-based regimens compared to non-ATRA based regimens (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.01; 4 trials, 670 patients). Analysis of clinically relevant adverse events could not be conducted due to paucity of data. Yet, increased reports of grade 3/4 adverse events were noted for any maintenance versus observation and for combined ATRA and chemotherapy versus ATRA alone treatment. The major limitation of this review lies in the variability between the included trials in both maintenance and pre-maintenance parameters. We tried to address this variability and to reduce its potential biases by conducting three separate main comparisons, as outlined above, leaving less statistical power to the presented results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance therapy compared to observation in APL patients improved DFS but not OS. Similarly, ATRA and chemotherapy compared to ATRA improved DFS but not OS. In contrast, ATRA based regimens compared to non-ATRA based regimens did not demonstrate a survival benefit. The significance of these findings is limited due to clinical heterogeneity between studies.","['Muchtar, Eli', 'Vidal, Liat', 'Ram, Ron', 'Gafter-Gvili, Anat', 'Shpilberg, Ofer', 'Raanani, Pia']","['Muchtar E', 'Vidal L', 'Ram R', 'Gafter-Gvili A', 'Shpilberg O', 'Raanani P']","['Department of Medicine E, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, 39 Jabotinski Street, Petah Tikva, Israel, 49100.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use', 'Watchful Waiting']",2013/04/02 06:00,2013/07/16 06:00,['2013/04/02 06:00'],"['2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD009594.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013 Mar 28;(3):CD009594. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD009594.pub2.,20130328,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant DNA methylation patterns are the most frequent molecular alterations detected in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Gravin is down-regulated in several solid tumors and is implicated in tumorigenesis. To explore its role in the molecular pathogenesis and its possible prognostic importance in AML, we have evaluated the expression levels of the gravin gene in 83 acute myeloid leukemia patients as compared with controls using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Mean gravin expression was 0.53 +/- 1.34 and 8.81 +/- 11.6 for patients and controls, respectively, and was found to be about 16-fold lower than controls. Gravin gene expression was lower than controls in 83.1 % (69/83) and was similar to controls in 16.9 % (14/83) of cases (p < 0.0001). It was found that there was no significant correlation between gravin expression and laboratory prognostic markers (p > 0.05). Gravin expression was highest in complete remission (1.065 +/- 1.79) and lowest in relapse (0.019 +/- 0.03) with a statistical difference (p = 0.004). Patients with gravin expression below median level had higher risk to develop relapse (OR = 8.689, 95 % CI = 2.464-30.638; p < 0.0001). No statistical correlation was reported between gravin expression and survival times (OS, DFS) (p = 0.482, 0.409, respectively), and this was confirmed in multivariate analysis. Gravin gene expression was found to be decreased in acute myeloid leukemia, and the degree of its decreased expression has been found to be correlated with poor prognosis.","['Mostafa, Mohamed R', 'Yahia, Raida S', 'Abd El Messih, Hanaa M', 'El-Sisy, Eman', 'El Ghannam, Doaa M']","['Mostafa MR', 'Yahia RS', 'Abd El Messih HM', 'El-Sisy E', 'El Ghannam DM']","['Physical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (A Kinase Anchor Proteins)', '0 (AKAP12 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)']",IM,"['A Kinase Anchor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",2013/04/02 06:00,2013/10/25 06:00,['2013/04/02 06:00'],"['2013/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-013-0548-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2013 Jun;30(2):548. doi: 10.1007/s12032-013-0548-1.

TKI-naive and TKI-treated leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and leukemia progenitor cells (LPCs) accumulate high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative DNA damage. To determine the role of TKI-refractory LSCs in genomic instability, we used a murine model of CML-CP where ROS-induced oxidative DNA damage was elevated in LSCs, including quiescent LSCs, but not in LPCs. ROS-induced oxidative DNA damage in LSCs caused clinically relevant genomic instability in CML-CP-like mice, such as TKI-resistant BCR-ABL1 mutations (E255K, T315I, H396P), deletions in Ikzf1 and Trp53, and additions in Zfp423 and Idh1. Despite inhibition of BCR-ABL1 kinase, imatinib did not downregulate ROS and oxidative DNA damage in TKI-refractory LSCs to the levels detected in normal cells, and CML-CP-like mice treated with imatinib continued to accumulate clinically relevant genetic aberrations. Inhibition of class I p21-activated protein kinases by IPA3 downregulated ROS in TKI-naive and TKI-treated LSCs. Altogether, we postulate that genomic instability may originate in the most primitive TKI-refractory LSCs in TKI-naive and TKI-treated patients.","['Bolton-Gillespie, Elisabeth', 'Schemionek, Mirle', 'Klein, Hans-Ulrich', 'Flis, Sylwia', 'Hoser, Grazyna', 'Lange, Thoralf', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, Margaret', 'Maier, Jacqueline', 'Kerstiens, Linda', 'Koptyra, Mateusz', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Modi, Hardik', 'Stoklosa, Tomasz', 'Seferynska, Ilona', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Bolton-Gillespie E', 'Schemionek M', 'Klein HU', 'Flis S', 'Hoser G', 'Lange T', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Maier J', 'Kerstiens L', 'Koptyra M', 'Muller MC', 'Modi H', 'Stoklosa T', 'Seferynska I', 'Bhatia R', 'Holyoake TL', 'Koschmieder S', 'Skorski T']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Genomic Instability/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology/*physiology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/genetics', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2013/04/02 06:00,2013/08/06 06:00,['2013/04/02 06:00'],"['2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58506-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-11-466938 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 May 16;121(20):4175-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-11-466938.

This study was designed to investigate whether ATO could induce apoptosis of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) that play very important roles in maintaining the structure integrity and function of the heart. Cardiac fibroblasts from guinea pigs administered with ATO (1mg/kgbw) were used to test the pro-apoptotic role of ATO in vivo. The current study demonstrated that ATO induced morphological characteristics of apoptosis and Caspase-3 activation in CFs of guinea pigs along with a significant up-regulation in TGF-beta1 protein expression, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In vitro MTT assay showed that ATO remarkably reduced the viability of cultured cardiac fibroblasts (NRCFs) from neonatal rat in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Consistent with the notions in vivo, ATO significantly induced the apoptosis in NRCFs, dramatically up-regulated TGF-beta1 protein level and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in a time-dependent fashion and activated Caspase-3 and ERK1/2. Finally, pretreatment with LY364947, an inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling could apparently reverse these changes. We therefore conclude that TGF-beta is functionally linked to ERK1/2 and that TGF-beta signaling is responsible for ATO-induced CFs apoptosis, which provides a novel mechanism of ATO related cardiac toxicology.","['Li, Cui', 'Qu, Xuefeng', 'Xu, Wenxiao', 'Qu, Ning', 'Mei, Liu', 'Liu, Yu', 'Wang, Xuelian', 'Yu, Xiangru', 'Liu, Zengyan', 'Nie, Dan', 'Liu, Yang', 'Yan, Jinglong', 'Yang, Baofeng', 'Lu, Yanjie', 'Chu, Wenfeng']","['Li C', 'Qu X', 'Xu W', 'Qu N', 'Mei L', 'Liu Y', 'Wang X', 'Yu X', 'Liu Z', 'Nie D', 'Liu Y', 'Yan J', 'Yang B', 'Lu Y', 'Chu W']","['Department of Pharmacology (The State-Province Key Laboratories of Biomedicine-Pharmaceutics of China, Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Research, Ministry of Education), Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150081, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Myocardium/cytology/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*biosynthesis', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2013/04/02 06:00,2013/07/20 06:00,['2013/04/02 06:00'],"['2012/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-4274(13)00129-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.toxlet.2013.03.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2013 Jun 7;219(3):223-30. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2013.03.024.

However, little is known regarding a role for DAXX in mOSE cells. In this study, we both over-expressed DAXX and depleted DAXX in primary mOSE cells. We found that Daxx deletion accelerated senescence in a p53/p21-dependent manner and promoted DNA damage by interacting with PML bodies without affecting cell cycle progression.

The values at diagnosis were evaluated in 104 patients. Data collected after induction chemotherapy were available for all patients, but only 68 patients were treated with HSCT. Significant WT1 expression cut-offs were determined by receiver operation characteristic curve analysis, and rates of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were estimated. WT1 decrement ratios (DR) at postinduction chemotherapy and at pre- and post-HSCT compared with the diagnostic level were calculated. Higher WT1 expression at diagnosis, postinduction chemotherapy, and pre-HSCT showed inferior OS (P = .015, <.001, and .002) and DFS (P = .006, <.001, and .003). The cut-offs were determined at the median for diagnostic WT1 expression and at the 25% level from the top for other time points excluding post-HSCT. The WT1 DR >/= 1-log after induction chemotherapy showed superior OS and DFS (P = .009 and .002) and WT1 DR >/= 1-log preceding HSCT also showed superior OS and DFS (P = .009 and .003). Results of WT1 DR were consistently applicable in each subgroup with higher (>/= 1.0) and lower (<1.0) WT1 expression at diagnosis and also in NPM1-wild-type/FLT3-ITD-negative CN-AML. The WT1 DR therefore predicted survival outcomes after HSCT more accurately than did the diagnostic WT1 expression. WT1 expression may serve as a reliable marker for residual disease and WT1 DR as a prognostic indicator, particularly in NPM1-wild-type/FLT3-ITD-negative CN-AML. These measures may be applied throughout the course of treatment and even after HSCT.","['Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Shin, Seung-Hwan', 'Yahng, Seung-Ah', 'Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Eom, Ki-Seong', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Lee, Seok', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Cho, Seok-Goo', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Lee, Jong-Wook', 'Min, Woo-Sung', 'Park, Chong-Won', 'Lim, Ji-Hyang']","['Yoon JH', 'Kim HJ', 'Shin SH', 'Yahng SA', 'Lee SE', 'Cho BS', 'Eom KS', 'Kim YJ', 'Lee S', 'Min CK', 'Cho SG', 'Kim DW', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS', 'Park CW', 'Lim JH']","[""Department of Hematology, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*immunology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/immunology/mortality/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics/*immunology']",2013/04/02 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/04/02 06:00'],"['2013/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(13)00139-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.03.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2013 Jun;19(6):958-66. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.03.013.

None of the derivatives analyzed caused depolarization of mitochondrial membrane within 24h of incubation, suggesting the involvement of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in the death process.

Vitamin C can act as an antioxidant, ascorbic acid (AA) donates two electrons and becomes oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). Under physiological conditions, vitamin C predominantly exists in its reduced (AA) form but also exists in trace quantities in the oxidized form (DHA). This study evaluates the therapeutic potential of vitamin C in Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDSs). F36P cells (MDS cell line) were treated with ascorbate and dehydroascorbate alone and in combination with cytarabine. Cell proliferation and viability were assessed by trypan blue assay and cell death was evaluated by optical microscopy and flow cytometry. The role of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential, BAX, BCL-2 and cytochrome C were also assessed.

Although ample studies have been conducted on the disease progress mechanisms, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the malignant phenotype transition are still unclear. In this study, we have shown that myofibrillogenesis regulator-1 (MR-1) was overexpressed in blast crisis patients and leukemic cells, but there was little trace expressed in healthy individuals and in most patients in CML chronic phase. MR-1 could inhibit the differentiation of myeloid cells into megakaryocytic lineages and accelerate cell proliferation. The molecular mechanism responsible for these effects was the interaction of MR-1 with MEK, which blocked the MEK/ERK signaling pathway by dephosphorylating MEK. Our results provide compelling and important evidence that MR-1 might act as a diagnostic marker and potential target of CML progression from chronic phase to blast crisis.","['Zhao, W', 'He, H', 'Ren, K', 'Li, B', 'Zhang, H', 'Lin, Y', 'Shao, R-G']","['Zhao W', 'He H', 'Ren K', 'Li B', 'Zhang H', 'Lin Y', 'Shao RG']","['Key Laboratory of Antibiotic Bioengineering, Ministry of Health, Laboratory of Oncology, Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,,,2013/04/02 06:00,2013/04/02 06:01,['2013/04/02 06:00'],"['2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/02 06:01 [medline]']","['bcj20135 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2013.5 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2013 Mar 29;3:e107. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2013.5.,20130329,,PMC3615218,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The regulatory mechanisms underlying the co-activation functions of GRIP1, which associates with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in PML-nuclear bodies, are not well-understood. This study showed that PML specifically and dramatically enhanced the C-terminal transactivation activity of GRIP1 by directly binding to GRIP1 but only when it was sumoylated. Most of the transactivation activity resided in the N-terminal PML regions that are conserved among isoforms. Three N-terminal sumoylation residues (Lys 65, 160, and 490) exhibited differential roles in the regulation of GRIP1 activity, and the sumoylation of Lys 490 acted as the primary nuclear localization signal of PML. While GRIP1 transactivation was stimulated to a similar degree by PML (K490R), located in the nucleus, and wild-type PML, PML (K490D) and the C-truncated mutant PML1-489 both displayed an epinuclear localization and were mostly inactive in stimulating GRIP. Based on these data, nuclear foci, nuclear localization, and the sumoylation status of Lys 490 were not essential for the enhancement of GRIP1 activity by PML, but the charge status of Lys 490 was important for subcellular localization of PML and cross-talk between its N- and C-terminal regions to modulate transcriptional activation. Taken together, these results provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms of PML that control the functional activities of GRIP1.","['Liu, Shu-Ting', 'Lu, Guan-Yu', 'Hsu, Yu-Juei', 'Chang, Li-Chien', 'Ho, Ching-Liang', 'Huang, Shih-Ming']","['Liu ST', 'Lu GY', 'Hsu YJ', 'Chang LC', 'Ho CL', 'Huang SM']","['Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (GRIPAP1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Lysine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2013/04/02 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/04/02 06:00'],"['2012/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-4889(13)00116-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.03.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2013 Aug;1833(8):1799-810. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.03.015.

Function blocking antibodies for these integrins may also reduce cell adhesion to collagens. To make the first systematical comparison of human alpha(L)beta2, alpha(M)beta2 and alpha(X)beta2 as collagen receptors, we produced the corresponding integrin alphaI domains both in wild-type and activated form and measured their binding to collagens I-VI. In the ""closed"" (wild-type) conformation, the alpha(L)I and alpha(M)I domains bound with low avidity to their primary ligands, and the interaction with collagens was also very weak. Gain-of-function mutations alpha(L) I306G, alpha(L) K287C/K294C and alpha(M) I316G are considered to mimic ""open"", activated alphaI domains. The binding of these activated alphaI domains to the primary ligands was clearly stronger and they also recognized collagens with moderate avidity (K(d)400 nM). After activation, the alphaLI domain favored collagen I (K(d ) approximately 80 nM) when compared to collagen IV. The integrin alphaXI domain acted in a very different manner since already in native, wild-type form it bound to collagen IV and iC3b (K(d) approximately 200-400 nM). Antibodies against alphaXbeta2 and alphaMbeta2 blocked promyelocytic leukemia cell adhesion to the collagenous GFOGER motif, a binding site for the beta1 integrin containing collagen receptors. In brief, leukocyte beta2 integrins may act as collagen receptors in a heterodimer specific manner.","['Lahti, Matti', 'Heino, Jyrki', 'Kapyla, Jarmo']","['Lahti M', 'Heino J', 'Kapyla J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Food Chemistry, University of Turku, Turku FI-20014, Finland. matti.lahti@iki.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Collagen)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antibodies, Blocking/immunology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Collagen/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaXbeta2/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Collagen']",2013/04/02 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2013/04/02 06:00'],"['2012/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1357-2725(13)00090-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2013.03.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2013 Jul;45(7):1204-11. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2013.03.016.

RNA signals to express viral genes from overlapping open reading frames potentially initiate NMD, nevertheless it is not clear whether viral RNAs are sensitive to NMD or if viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade NMD. Here we demonstrate that the genomic and full-length mRNAs of Human-T-cell Leukemia Virus type-I (HTLV-1), a retrovirus responsible for Adult T-cell Leukemia (ATL), are sensitive to NMD. They exhibit accelerated turnover in NMD-activated cells, while siRNA-mediated knockdown of NMD-master-regulator, UPF1, promotes enhanced stability of them. These effects on RNA stability were recapitulated by a reporter construct encoding the HTLV-1 translational frameshift signal of gag-pol. In agreement with the RNA stability, viral protein expression from the integrated provirus was inversely correlated with cellular NMD activity. We further demonstrated that the viral RNA-binding protein, Rex, approves the stability of viral RNA by inhibiting NMD. Significantly, Rex establishes a general block to NMD, as both NMD-responsive reporter transcripts and natural host-encoded NMD substrates were stabilized in the presence of Rex. Thus, we suggest that Rex not only stabilizes viral transcripts, but also perturbs cellular mRNA metabolism and host cell homeostasis via inhibition of NMD.","['Nakano, Kazumi', 'Ando, Tomomi', 'Yamagishi, Makoto', 'Yokoyama, Koichi', 'Ishida, Takaomi', 'Ohsugi, Takeo', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Brighty, David W', 'Watanabe, Toshiki']","['Nakano K', 'Ando T', 'Yamagishi M', 'Yokoyama K', 'Ishida T', 'Ohsugi T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Brighty DW', 'Watanabe T']","['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Department of Medical Genome Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Minatoku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Microbes Infect,Microbes and infection,100883508,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', '0 (rex Protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['Gene Products, rex/*metabolism', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Virulence Factors/*metabolism']",2013/04/02 06:00,2013/12/29 06:00,['2013/04/02 06:00'],"['2013/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S1286-4579(13)00064-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.micinf.2013.03.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Microbes Infect. 2013 Jun;15(6-7):491-505. doi: 10.1016/j.micinf.2013.03.006.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) have demonstrated their importance in implantation in both animal and human studies. Lower expression of LIF is found in proliferative phase and maximal expression is found in secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. Lower expression of LIF is also found in secretory phase endometrium in patients with infertility. However, studies investigating whether the levels of LIF in proliferative phase are associated with multiple implantation failures (MIFs) are limited. 30 Endometrial biopsies in proliferative phase from unexplained infertile women with MIF with normal hormone levels were collected. The expression of LIF, IL-6 and its receptor gp130 were measured by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Moderate expression of LIF in the proliferative phase and high expression of LIF in the secretory phase were found in fertile women. However, lower expression of LIF was found in unexplained infertile women with MIF compared to fertile women. There was no difference in endometrial IL-6 and gp130 expression between unexplained infertile women with MIF and fertile women. LIF expression is independent of the process of embryo and dependent partially on the maternal sex hormone levels.

Oxysterols belong to a class of bioactive lipids that are implicated in neurological disease and are associated with various types of cancer. Here, we investigated expression and transcriptional regulation of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) in human U87MG and GM133 glioblastoma cell lines. We demonstrate that in both cell lines transcription and translation of CH25H are increased in response to TNFalpha and IL1beta. In parallel, both cell lines upregulate 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC) synthesis and secretion to levels comparable to bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages under inflammatory conditions. To determine whether 25-OHC acts as chemoattractant for tumor-associated macrophages, the human THP-1 monoblastic leukemia cell line was treated with varying amounts of the oxysterol. Experiments revealed that 25-OHC and lipid extracts isolated from GM133-conditioned medium (containing 7-fold higher 25-OHC concentrations than U87MG medium) induce chemotactic migration of THP-1 cells. Of note, 25-OHC also induced the migration of primary human peripheral blood monocytes. In response to exogenously added 25-OHC, THP-1 cells reorganized intermediate filament-associated vimentin to more cortical and polarized structures. Chemotactic migration of monocytes in response to 25-OHC was pertussis toxin-sensitive, indicating the involvement of G protein-coupled receptors. Using RNA interference we demonstrated that G protein-coupled receptor 183 (EBI2) contributes to 25-OHC-mediated chemotactic migration of THP-1 cells. These in vitro data indicate that GBM-derived and secreted 25-OHC may be involved in the recruitment of immune-competent cells to a tumor via EBI2.","['Eibinger, Gerald', 'Fauler, Gunter', 'Bernhart, Eva', 'Frank, Sasa', 'Hammer, Astrid', 'Wintersperger, Andrea', 'Eder, Hans', 'Heinemann, Akos', 'Mischel, Paul S', 'Malle, Ernst', 'Sattler, Wolfgang']","['Eibinger G', 'Fauler G', 'Bernhart E', 'Frank S', 'Hammer A', 'Wintersperger A', 'Eder H', 'Heinemann A', 'Mischel PS', 'Malle E', 'Sattler W']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Graz, Harrachgasse 21, Graz 8010, Austria.', 'Clinical Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical University of Graz, Graz 8010, Austria.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Graz, Harrachgasse 21, Graz 8010, Austria.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Graz, Harrachgasse 21, Graz 8010, Austria.', 'Institute of Cell Biology, Histology and Embryology, Medical University of Graz, Graz 8010, Austria.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Graz, Harrachgasse 21, Graz 8010, Austria.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Medical University of Graz, Graz 8010, Austria.', 'Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University of Graz, Graz 8010, Austria.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, La Jolla, California, CA 92093, USA.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Graz, Harrachgasse 21, Graz 8010, Austria.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Graz, Harrachgasse 21, Graz 8010, Austria.

There is a need to optimize quality control, sensitivity, and reliability of methods used to measure a major molecular response and/or treatment failure. The effects of room temperature storage time, different primers, and RNA input in the reverse transcription (RT) reaction on BCR-ABL1 and beta-glucuronidase (GUSB) cDNA yield were assessed in whole blood samples mixed with K562 cells. BCR-ABL1 was measured relative to GUSB to control for sample loading, and each gene was measured relative to known numbers of respective internal standard molecules to control for variation in quality and quantity of reagents, thermal cycler conditions, and presence of PCR inhibitors. Clinical sample and reference material measurements with this test were concordant with results reported by other laboratories. BCR-ABL1 per 10(3) GUSB values were significantly reduced (P = 0.004) after 48-hour storage. Gene-specific primers yielded more BCR-ABL1 cDNA than random hexamers at each RNA input. In addition, increasing RNA inhibited the RT reaction with random hexamers but not with gene-specific primers. Consequently, the yield of BCR-ABL1 was higher with gene-specific RT primers at all RNA inputs tested, increasing to as much as 158-fold. We conclude that optimal measurement of BCR-ABL1 per 10(3) GUSB in whole blood is obtained when gene-specific primers are used in RT and samples are analyzed within 24 hours after blood collection.","['Stanoszek, Lauren M', 'Crawford, Erin L', 'Blomquist, Thomas M', 'Warns, Jessica A', 'Willey, Paige F S', 'Willey, James C']","['Stanoszek LM', 'Crawford EL', 'Blomquist TM', 'Warns JA', 'Willey PF', 'Willey JC']","['Department of Medicine, University of Toledo Health Sciences Campus, Toledo, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)']",IM,"['Clinical Laboratory Techniques/*methods', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood/*genetics', 'Glucuronidase/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics', 'Quality Control', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2013/04/02 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/04/02 06:00'],"['2012/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-1578(13)00043-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmoldx.2013.02.004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2013 May;15(3):391-400. doi: 10.1016/j.jmoldx.2013.02.004.

The aim of this study was to investigate the methylation status of CEBPA gene in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. The methylation status of CEBPA promoter was studied in 100 patients with CML and 98 normal healthy individuals from Hyderabad, India, using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The aberrant methylation of CEBPA gene promoter was found in 32 of the 100 CML cases. A highly significant association was found between the frequency of CEBPA gene promoter hypermethylation and the CML stages (P = 0.017), but association with respect to age and gender of the patient was not found. The results suggest that aberrant methylation in the CpG island of the promoter region of this gene might be a common event in CML, and systemic expression studies will be needed to unfold the role of CEBPA promoter methylation in the development, progression, and prognosis of CML.","['Annamaneni, Sandhya', 'Kagita, Sailaja', 'Gorre, Manjula', 'Digumarti, Raghunadha Rao', 'Satti, Vishnupriya', 'Battini, Mohan Reddy']","['Annamaneni S', 'Kagita S', 'Gorre M', 'Digumarti RR', 'Satti V', 'Battini MR']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2013/04/02 06:00,2014/10/10 06:00,['2013/04/02 06:00'],"['2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['hem154 [pii]', '10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000081 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2014 Jan;19(1):42-4. doi: 10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000081.

We found that ORF75c interacts weakly with PML and SUMO-modified forms of PML are important for its degradation by ORF75c. ORF75c-mediated PML degradation was not dependent on two known cellular regulators of PML stability, Casein kinase II (CK2) and human papilloma virus E6-associated protein (E6AP). Finally, ORF75c had self-ubiquitination activity in vitro and its expression increased levels of ubiquitinated PML in transfected cells. Taken together, the evidence accumulated in this study provides new insights into the function of a vFGARAT and is consistent with a model in which ORF75c could mediate direct ubiquitination of PML resulting in its degradation by the proteasome.","['Sewatanon, Jaturong', 'Ling, Paul D']","['Sewatanon J', 'Ling PD']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Mail Stop BCM-385, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.5.- (Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases with Glutamine as Amide-N-Donor)', 'EC 6.3.5.3 (phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthetase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases with Glutamine as Amide-N-Donor/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proteolysis', 'Rhadinovirus/*physiology', '*Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism']",2013/04/02 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2013/04/02 06:00'],"['2012/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0042-6822(13)00102-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2013 Jun 5;440(2):140-9. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2013.02.014.

We analyzed the prognostic impact of these mutations and their interactions in adults with CN-AML. NPM1 mutation (NPM1mut) and FLT3-ITD mutation (FLT3-ITD+) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and GeneScan assays of bone marrow samples obtained from newly diagnosed 104 CN-AML patients. FLT3-ITD+ and NPM1mut were detected in 36 (34.6%) and 30 (28.8%) out of 104 subjects, respectively, 16 cases (15.4%) had double NPM1mut/FLT3-ITD+. The incidence of FLT3-ITD+ was significantly higher in the NPM1mut group than in the NPM1 wild (NPM1wt) group (P = 0.018). Statistical analysis revealed that isolated NPM1mut group had a better clinical outcomes in terms of higher complete response (CR) rate (P = 0.01) and a trend towards favorable overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.28, 0.40, respectively). In contrast, the isolated FLT3-ITD+ group had an unfavorable outcome in terms of lower CR rate (P = 0.12), shorter OS, and DFS (P < 0.0001 for both). The NPM1mut/FLT3-ITD-group had the best OS and DFS, while the NPM1wt/FLT3-ITD+ group had the worst OS and DFS than other groups (NPM1mut/FLT3-ITD+ or NPM1wt/FLT3-ITD-) (P < 0.0001 for both). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age and FLT3/ITD+ were independent poor prognostic factors for OS (P = 0.006, <0.0001, respectively), while FLT3/ITD+ was independent predictor for DFS (P = 0.04). However, NPM1mut did not have a significant impact on OS and DFS. In conclusion, adult patients with CN-AML carrying isolated NPM1mut and isolated FLT3-ITD+ exhibit different clinical outcomes than those with NPM1mut/FLT3-ITD+ or NPM1wt/FLT3-ITD-. Patients with NPM1mut/FLT3-ITD- had the best prognosis in terms of higher CR, OS, and DFS, while those with NPM1mut/FLT3-ITD+ had the worst CR rate, and NPM1wt/FLT3-ITD+ had the lowest OS and DFS.","['Shamaa, Sameh', 'Laimon, Nabil', 'Aladle, Doaa A', 'Azmy, Emad', 'Elghannam, Doaa M', 'Salem, Dalia A', 'Taalab, Mona M']","['Shamaa S', 'Laimon N', 'Aladle DA', 'Azmy E', 'Elghannam DM', 'Salem DA', 'Taalab MM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytogenetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Egypt', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2013/04/02 06:00,2014/10/10 06:00,['2013/04/02 06:00'],"['2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['hem151 [pii]', '10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000085 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2014 Jan;19(1):22-30. doi: 10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000085.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fourty-three chronic phase CML patients (71 males, 72 females) taking imatinib as frontline treatment were included in the study. The median age was 44 (16-82) years. Median total and on-imatinib follow-up durations were 29 (3.8-130) months and 25 (3-125) months, respectively. RESULTS: The complete hematological response (CHR) rate at 3 months was 95%. The best cumulative complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rate at 24 months was 79.6%. Euro/Hasford scoring system was well-correlated with both Sokal and EUTOS scores (r = 0.6, P < 0.001 and r = 0.455, P < 0.001). However, there was only a weak correlation between Sokal and EUTOS scores (r = 0.2, P = 0.03). The 5-year median estimated event-free survival for low and high EUTOS risk patients were 62.6 (25.7-99.5) and 15.3 (7.4-23.2) months, respectively (P < 0.001). This performance was better than Sokal (P = 0.3) and Euro/Hasford (P = 0.04) scoring systems. Overall survival and CCyR rates were also better predicted by the EUTOS score. DISCUSSION: EUTOS CML prognostic scoring system, which is the only prognostic system developed during the imatinib era, predicts European LeukemiaNet (ELN)-based event-free survival better than Euro/Hasford and Sokal systems in CML patients receiving frontline imatinib mesylate. This observation might have important clinical implications.","['Uz, Burak', 'Buyukasik, Yahya', 'Atay, Hilmi', 'Kelkitli, Engin', 'Turgut, Mehmet', 'Bektas, Ozlen', 'Eliacik, Eylem', 'Isik, Ayse', 'Aksu, Salih', 'Goker, Hakan', 'Sayinalp, Nilgun', 'Ozcebe, Osman I', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim C']","['Uz B', 'Buyukasik Y', 'Atay H', 'Kelkitli E', 'Turgut M', 'Bektas O', 'Eliacik E', 'Isik A', 'Aksu S', 'Goker H', 'Sayinalp N', 'Ozcebe OI', 'Haznedaroglu IC']","['Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2013/04/02 06:00,2014/06/11 06:00,['2013/04/02 06:00'],"['2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['hem144 [pii]', '10.1179/1607845412Y.0000000071 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2013 Sep;18(5):247-52. doi: 10.1179/1607845412Y.0000000071.

METHODS: An institutionally approved urologic oncology database was used to retrospectively identify patients who underwent partial or radical nephrectomy for pT1a RCC from 1990 to 2010 at a tertiary care center. Baseline characteristics were reviewed, and postoperative imaging for the indication of RCC surveillance was recorded. Radiation exposure was calculated using the effective dose according to imaging modality. Relative risks of the development of solid malignancies and leukemia were calculated from the dose of radiation exposure. RCC recurrence, defined as radiologic evidence of local recurrence or distant metastases, was noted. RESULTS: A total of 1708 patients had undergone partial or radical nephrectomy for a renal mass. Of these, 315 patients had pT1a RCC with postsurgical follow-up, and 252 (80%) of these patients were exposed to ionizing radiation during postoperative surveillance. Mean radiation doses in years 1, 2 to 5, and >/=6 after surgery were 11.4, 47.0, and 13.8 mSv, respectively. Relative risks of radiation-induced solid cancers and leukemia were 1.05 and 1.12, respectively. There were 8 (2.5%) total recurrences. CONCLUSION: During the past 20 years, 80% of patients undergoing surgery for pT1a RCC were monitored with radiation-based imaging during postoperative surveillance. Given the low rate of cancer recurrence in this population, expanded efforts in counseling physicians regarding the risk of ionizing radiation in imaging should be encouraged.","['Lipsky, Michael J', 'Shapiro, Edan Y', 'Hruby, Greg W', 'McKiernan, James M']","['Lipsky MJ', 'Shapiro EY', 'Hruby GW', 'McKiernan JM']","['Department of Urology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Urology,Urology,0366151,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*diagnostic imaging/secondary/surgery', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnostic imaging', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Nephrectomy', '*Population Surveillance', 'Postoperative Period', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",2013/04/02 06:00,2013/08/24 06:00,['2013/04/02 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0090-4295(12)01045-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.urology.2012.08.056 [doi]']",ppublish,Urology. 2013 Jun;81(6):1190-5. doi: 10.1016/j.urology.2012.08.056.

In the present study, an allele-specific oligonucleotide reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect T315I mutation in a cohort of 60 imatinib-resistant CML patients. In terms of disease phase, 43 patients (71%) were in late chronic phase, 4 (7%) in accelerated phase, and 13 (22%) in blastic phase. The prevalence of the T315I mutation was found to be 7% (4/60).

RESULTS: Overexpression of DAXX enhanced ovarian cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration, whereas Daxx depletion had the opposite effects. CONCLUSION: DAXX promotes ovarian cancer cell proliferation and chemoresistance. SIGNIFICANCE: ModulatingDAXXmay be an effective strategy for preventing the recurrence and chemoresistance of ovarian cancers. Understanding the genes involved in apoptosis and DNA damage responses may improve therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer. The death domain-associated protein DAXX can be either a pro-apoptotic or an anti-apoptotic factor, depending on the cell type and context. In this study, we found that DAXX was highly expressed in human ovarian surface epithelial tumors but not in granulosa cell tumors. In cultured ovarian cancer cells, DAXX interacted with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and localized to subnuclear domains (so-called PML nuclear bodies). A role for DAXX in ovarian cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and radio/chemoresistance was examined. Overexpression of DAXX enhanced multiple ovarian cancer cell lines' proliferation, colony formation, and migration, whereas Daxx depletion by RNA interference had the opposite effects. When transplanted into nude mice, ovarian cancer cells that overexpressed DAXX displayed enhanced tumorigenesis capability in vivo, whereas Daxx depletion inhibited tumor development. Importantly, Daxx induced tumorigenic transformation of normal ovarian surface epithelial cells. Daxx also protected ovarian cancer cells against x-irradiation- and chemotherapy-induced DNA damage by interacting with PML. Taken together, our results suggest that DAXX is a novel ovarian cancer oncogene that promotes ovarian cancer cell proliferation and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cells. Thus, modulating DAXX-PML nuclear body activity may be an effective strategy for preventing the recurrence and chemoresistance of ovarian cancers.","['Pan, Wei-Wei', 'Zhou, Jian-Jie', 'Liu, Xiao-Man', 'Xu, Ying', 'Guo, Lian-Jun', 'Yu, Chao', 'Shi, Qing-Hua', 'Fan, Heng-Yu']","['Pan WW', 'Zhou JJ', 'Liu XM', 'Xu Y', 'Guo LJ', 'Yu C', 'Shi QH', 'Fan HY']","['Life Sciences Institute, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cystadenoma, Serous/drug therapy/*metabolism/secondary', 'DNA Damage', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Ovary/metabolism/pathology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2013/03/30 06:00,2013/07/16 06:00,['2013/03/30 06:00'],"['2013/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)54589-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.446369 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 May 10;288(19):13620-30. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.446369.

Lower overall HOX/TALE expression appears to correlate with more favorable prognosis/better response to treatment in some leukemias and solid cancer. The functional significance of the associated gene expression and response to chemotherapy is not known. Three independent microarray datasets obtained from large cohorts of patients along with quantitative polymerase chain reaction validation were used to identify a four-gene HOXA/TALE signature capable of prognostic stratification. Biochemical analysis was used to identify interactions between the four encoded proteins and targeted knockdown used to examine the functional importance of sustained expression of the signature in leukemia maintenance and response to chemotherapy. An 11 HOXA/TALE code identified in an intermediate-risk group of patients (n=315) compared to a group with a favorable risk (n=105) was reduced to a four-gene signature of HOXA6, HOXA9, PBX3 and MEIS1 by iterative analysis of independent platforms. This signature maintained the favorable/intermediate risk partition and where applicable, correlated with overall survival in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia. We further showed that cell growth and function are dependent on maintained levels of these core genes and that direct targeting of HOXA/PBX3 sensitizes cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia cells to standard chemotherapy. Together the data support a key role for HOXA/TALE in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia and demonstrate that targeting of clinically significant HOXA/PBX3 elements may provide therapeutic benefit to patients with this subtype of leukemia.","['Dickson, Glenda J', 'Liberante, Fabio G', 'Kettyle, Laura M', ""O'Hagan, Kathleen A"", 'Finnegan, Damian P J', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Geerts, Dirk', 'McMullin, Mary Frances', 'Lappin, Terry R J', 'Mills, Ken I', 'Thompson, Alexander']","['Dickson GJ', 'Liberante FG', 'Kettyle LM', ""O'Hagan KA"", 'Finnegan DP', 'Bullinger L', 'Geerts D', 'McMullin MF', 'Lappin TR', 'Mills KI', 'Thompson A']","[""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxa6 protein, human)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*methods', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques/methods', 'Homeodomain Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'U937 Cells']",2013/03/30 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/03/30 06:00'],"['2013/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.079012 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.079012 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Aug;98(8):1216-25. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.079012.

In these patients, neoplastic mast cells usually harbor the KIT mutant D816V that confers resistance against tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We examined the effects of the multi-kinase blocker ponatinib on neoplastic mast cells and investigated whether ponatinib acts synergistically with other antineoplastic drugs. Ponatinib was found to inhibit the kinase activity of KIT G560V and KIT D816V in the human mast cell leukemia cell line HMC-1. In addition, ponatinib was found to block Lyn- and STAT5 activity in neoplastic mast cells. Ponatinib induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in HMC-1.1 cells (KIT G560V(+)) and HMC-1.2 cells (KIT G560V(+)/KIT D816V(+)) as well as in primary neoplastic mast cells. The effects of ponatinib were dose-dependent, but higher IC50-values were obtained in HMC-1 cells harboring KIT D816V than in those lacking KIT D816V. In drug combination experiments, ponatinib was found to synergize with midostaurin in producing growth inhibition and apoptosis in HMC-1 cells and primary neoplastic mast cells. The ponatinib+midostaurin combination induced substantial inhibition of KIT-, Lyn-, and STAT5 activity, but did not suppress Btk. We then applied a Btk short interfering RNA and found that Btk knockdown sensitizes HMC-1 cells against ponatinib. Finally, we were able to show that ponatinib synergizes with the Btk-targeting drug dasatinib to produce growth inhibition in HMC-1 cells. In conclusion, ponatinib exerts major growth-inhibitory effects on neoplastic mast cells in advanced systemic mastocytosis and synergizes with midostaurin and dasatinib in inducing growth arrest in neoplastic mast cells.","['Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Peter, Barbara', 'Blatt, Katharina', 'Suppan, Verena', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Radia, Deepti', 'Hadzijusufovic, Emir', 'Valent, Peter']","['Gleixner KV', 'Peter B', 'Blatt K', 'Suppan V', 'Reiter A', 'Radia D', 'Hadzijusufovic E', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Pyridazines/*administration & dosage', 'Staurosporine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",2013/03/30 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/03/30 06:00'],"['2013/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.079202 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.079202 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Sep;98(9):1450-7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.079202.

Effective DNA damage response (DDR) and maintenance of genomic stability are crucial for normal functioning of HSPCs. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) integrates signals from nutrients and growth factors to control protein synthesis, cell growth, survival and metabolism, and has been shown to regulate DDR in yeast and human cancer cells through the p53/p21 signaling cascade. Here, we show that gene targeting of mTOR in HSPCs causes a defective DDR due to a variety of DNA damage agents, mimicking that caused by deficient FANCD2, a key component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) DDR machinery. Mechanistically, mTOR(-/-) HSPCs express drastically reduced FANCD2. Consistent with these genetic findings, inactivation of mTOR in human lymphoblast cells by pp242 or Torin 1, mTOR kinase inhibitors, suppresses FANCD2 expression and causes a defective DDR that can be rescued by reconstitution of exogenous FANCD2. Further mechanistic studies show that mTOR deficiency or inactivation increases phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, which results in an enhanced NF-kappaB binding to FANCD2 promoter to suppress FANCD2 expression. Thus, mTOR regulates DDR and genomic stability in hematopoietic cells through a noncanonical pathway involving NF-kappaB-mediated FANCD2 expression.","['Guo, F', 'Li, J', 'Du, W', 'Zhang, S', ""O'Connor, M"", 'Thomas, G', 'Kozma, S', 'Zingarelli, B', 'Pang, Q', 'Zheng, Y']","['Guo F', 'Li J', 'Du W', 'Zhang S', ""O'Connor M"", 'Thomas G', 'Kozma S', 'Zingarelli B', 'Pang Q', 'Zheng Y']","['Department of Biotechnology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Division of Critical Care Medicine, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Department of Cancer and Cell Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', ""Division of Critical Care Medicine, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0', '(1-(4-(4-propionylpiperazin-1-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-9-(quinolin-3-yl)ben', 'zo(h)(1,6)naphthyridin-2(1H)-one)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Naphthyridines)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Comet Assay', '*DNA Damage', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein/*physiology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Genomic Instability', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Naphthyridines/pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",2013/03/30 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/03/30 06:00'],"['2012/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/leu.2013.93 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Oct;27(10):2040-2046. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.93.

Trimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is present in promoters of actively transcribed genes and has been shown to be involved in hematopoietic differentiation. We performed a genome-wide H3K4me3 CHIP-Seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with whole genome sequencing) analysis of primary MDS bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells. This resulted in the identification of 36 genes marked by distinct higher levels of promoter H3K4me3 in MDS. A majority of these genes are involved in nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation and innate immunity signaling. We then analyzed expression of histone demethylases and observed significant overexpression of the JmjC-domain histone demethylase JMJD3 (KDM6b) in MDS CD34+ cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that JMJD3 has a positive effect on transcription of multiple CHIP-Seq identified genes involved in NF-kappaB activation. Inhibition of JMJD3 using shRNA in primary BM MDS CD34+ cells resulted in an increased number of erythroid colonies in samples isolated from patients with lower-risk MDS.

Here, using a novel small-molecule BET bromodomain inhibitor, JQ1, and the EZH2 inhibitor, DZNep, we demonstrated that combined treatment of JQ1 and DZNep cooperatively disrupted MYC activation, resulting in a greater restoration of miR-26a expression and synergistically suppressed lymphoma growth and clonogenicity in aggressive lymphoma cells. Furthermore, CHIP assay demonstrated that MYC recruited EZH2 to miR-26a promoter and cooperatively repressed miR-26a expression in aggressive lymphoma cell lines, as well as primary lymphoma cells. Loss- or gain-of-function approaches revealed that miR-26a functioned as a tumor suppressor miRNA and mediated the combinatorial effects of JQ1 and DZNep.

As a result, the level of CD3 expressed on the surface of Jurkat-I cells was significantly higher than those in the Jurkat wild strain. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate increased the surface CD3 levels in Jurkat wild strain cells without resulting in MYL9 gene expression, indicating that protein kinase C is partially involved in the expression of CD3 on the surface. These results suggest that surface CD3 expression proceeds through both MYL9-dependent and MYL9-independent pathways (i.e. the protein kinase C- dependent pathway) in Jurkat cells.","['Aoki, Takumi', 'Miyazaki, Koji', 'Katayama, Takuji', 'Watanabe, Mariko', 'Horie, Ryoichi', 'Danbara, Mikio', 'Higashihara, Masaaki']","['Aoki T', 'Miyazaki K', 'Katayama T', 'Watanabe M', 'Horie R', 'Danbara M', 'Higashihara M']","['Hematology, Clinical Medicine, Kitasato University Graduate School of Medical Science, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Smooth Muscle Res,Journal of smooth muscle research = Nihon Heikatsukin Gakkai kikanshi,9211664,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Myosin Light Chains)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['CD3 Complex/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Myosin Light Chains/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Kinase C/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2012/01/01 00:00,2013/09/11 06:00,['2013/03/30 06:00'],"['2013/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/jsmr/48.137 [pii]', '10.1540/jsmr.48.137 [doi]']",ppublish,J Smooth Muscle Res. 2012;48(5-6):137-47. doi: 10.1540/jsmr.48.137.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognosis of ATL is extremely poor; however, effective strategies for diagnosis and treatment have not been established. To identify novel therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers for ATL, we employed focused proteomic profiling of the CD4(+)CD25(+)CCR4(+) T-cell subpopulation in which HTLV-1-infected cells were enriched. Comprehensive quantification of 14 064 peptides and subsequent 2-step statistical analysis using 29 cases (6 uninfected controls, 5 asymptomatic carriers, 9 HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis patients, 9 ATL patients) identified 91 peptide determinants that statistically classified 4 clinical groups with an accuracy rate of 92.2% by cross-validation test. Among the identified 17 classifier proteins, alpha-II spectrin was drastically accumulated in infected T cells derived from ATL patients, whereas its digestive protease calpain-2 (CAN2) was significantly downregulated. Further cell cycle analysis and cell growth assay revealed that rescue of CAN2 activity by overexpressing constitutively active CAN2 (Delta(19)CAN2) could induce remarkable cell death on ATL cells accompanied by reduction of alpha-II spectrin. These results support that proteomic profiling of HTLV-1-infected T cells could provide potential diagnostic biomarkers and an attractive resource of therapeutic targets for ATL.","['Ishihara, Makoto', 'Araya, Natsumi', 'Sato, Tomoo', 'Tatsuguchi, Ayako', 'Saichi, Naomi', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Nakamura, Yusuke', 'Nakagawa, Hidewaki', 'Yamano, Yoshihisa', 'Ueda, Koji']","['Ishihara M', 'Araya N', 'Sato T', 'Tatsuguchi A', 'Saichi N', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Nakamura Y', 'Nakagawa H', 'Yamano Y', 'Ueda K']","['Laboratory for Biomarker Development, Center of Genomic Medicine, RIKEN, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '12634-43-4 (Spectrin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'EC 3.4.22.53 (CAPN2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/virology', 'Calpain/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Disease Progression', '*HTLV-I Infections/diagnosis/immunology/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/metabolism/virology', 'Proteomics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Spectrin/immunology/metabolism']",2013/03/30 06:00,2013/07/24 06:00,['2013/03/30 06:00'],"['2013/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58467-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-08-446922 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 May 23;121(21):4340-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-08-446922.

We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies involving 523 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from individuals of European, African, Asian, and African American ancestry. Several of the highest-ranked single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were within the mutated in colorectal cancers (MCC) gene. MCC expression was induced by cytarabine treatment from 1.7- to 26.6-fold in LCLs. A total of 33 SNPs ranked at the top of the meta-analysis (P < 10(-5)) were successfully tested in a clinical trial of patients randomized to receive low-dose or high-dose cytarabine plus daunorubicin and etoposide; of these, 18 showed association (P < .05) with either cytarabine 50% inhibitory concentration in leukemia cells or clinical response parameters (minimal residual disease, overall survival (OS), and treatment-related mortality). This count (n = 18) was significantly greater than expected by chance (P = .016). For rs1203633, LCLs with AA genotype were more sensitive to cytarabine-induced cytotoxicity (P = 1.31 x 10(-6)) and AA (vs GA or GG) genotype was associated with poorer OS (P = .015), likely as a result of greater treatment-related mortality (P = .0037) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

The innate immune signaling molecule CD14 was reported to be upregulated in adventitial macrophages in a murine model of AAA and in monocytes cocultured with aortic adventitial fibroblasts (AoAf) in vitro, concurrent with increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. We hypothesized that CD14 plays a crucial role in adventitial macrophage precursor recruitment early during AAA formation. METHODS AND RESULTS: CD14(-/-) mice were resistant to AAA formation induced by 2 different AAA induction models: aortic elastase infusion and systemic angiotensin II (AngII) infusion. CD14 gene deletion led to reduced aortic macrophage infiltration and diminished elastin degradation. Adventitial monocyte binding to AngII-infused aorta in vitro was dependent on CD14, and incubation of human acute monocytic leukemia cell line-1 (THP-1) monocytes with IL-6 or conditioned medium from perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) upregulated CD14 expression. Conditioned medium from AoAf and PVAT induced CD14-dependent monocyte chemotaxis, which was potentiated by IL-6.

RESULTS: Body weight and indexes for immune organs of chickens infected with ALV-J strain SCDY1 were lower than those in controls. Proliferation of lymphocytes was observed in many tissues, and viral integration was detected in the genome of lymphocytes at 14 days post-infection, along with virus shedding. ALV-J was also efficiently transmitted from eggs to progenies. Embryo hatchability and progeny mortality were lower than those for controls. The efficiencies of virus shedding and virus integration in the lymphocytes of progenies were higher than those in parents. CONCLUSIONS: ALV-J is able to inhibit the growth of infected chickens, and causes damage to immune organs. Vertical transmission of ALV-J appears to be more deleterious than horizontal transmission.","['Lin, Yan', 'Xia, Jing', 'Zhao, Yang', 'Wang, Fuyan', 'Yu, Songcheng', 'Zou, Nianli', 'Wen, Xintian', 'Cao, Sanjie', 'Huang, Yong']","['Lin Y', 'Xia J', 'Zhao Y', 'Wang F', 'Yu S', 'Zou N', 'Wen X', 'Cao S', 'Huang Y']","[""College of Veterinary Medicine, Sichuan Agricultural University, 46# Xinkang Road, Ya'an, Sichuan 625014, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*complications/pathology/transmission/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*pathogenicity', 'Body Weight', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chickens', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Disease Transmission, Infectious', 'Hemangioma/pathology/*virology', 'Lymphocytes/virology', 'Survival Analysis']",2013/03/30 06:00,2014/01/23 06:00,['2013/03/30 06:00'],"['2012/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-10-97 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-10-97 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2013 Mar 27;10:97. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-10-97.,20130327,,PMC3717065,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cellular delivery of phosphopeptides is challenging because of the presence of the negatively charged phosphate group. The cellular uptake of a number of fluorescent-labeled phosphopeptides, including F'-GpYLPQTV, F'-NEpYTARQ, F'-AEEEIYGEFEAKKKK, F'-PEpYLGLD, F'-pYVNVQN-NH2, and F'-GpYEEI (F' = fluorescein), was evaluated in the presence or absence of a [WR]4, a cyclic peptide containing alternative arginine (R) and tryptophan (W) residues, in human leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM) after 2 h incubation using flow cytometry. [WR]4 improved significantly the cellular uptake of all phosphopeptides. PEpYLGLD is a sequence that mimics the pTyr1246 of ErbB2 that is responsible for binding to the Chk SH2 domain. The cellular uptake of F'-PEpYLGLD was enhanced dramatically by 27-fold in the presence of [WR]4 and was found to be time-dependent. Confocal microscopy of a mixture of F'-PEpYLGLD and [WR]4 in live cells exhibited intracellular localization and significantly higher cellular uptake compared to that of F'-PEpYLGLD alone. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and isothermal calorimetry (ITC) were used to study the interaction of PEpYLGLD and [WR]4. TEM results showed that the mixture of PEpYLGLD and [WR]4 formed noncircular nanosized structures with width and height of 125 and 60 nm, respectively. ITC binding studies confirmed the interaction between [WR]4 and PEpYLGLD. The binding isotherm curves, derived from sequential binding models, showed an exothermic interaction driven by entropy. These studies suggest that amphiphilic peptide [WR]4 can be used as a cellular delivery tool of cell-impermeable negatively charged phosphopeptides.","['Nasrolahi Shirazi, Amir', 'Tiwari, Rakesh Kumar', 'Oh, Donghoon', 'Banerjee, Antara', 'Yadav, Arpita', 'Parang, Keykavous']","['Nasrolahi Shirazi A', 'Tiwari RK', 'Oh D', 'Banerjee A', 'Yadav A', 'Parang K']","['Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, Rhode Island 02881, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Surface-Active Agents)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arginine/chemistry', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Peptides, Cyclic/chemistry', 'Phosphopeptides/*administration & dosage/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Surface-Active Agents/chemistry', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tryptophan/chemistry']",2013/03/30 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/03/30 06:00'],"['2013/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp400046u [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2013 May 6;10(5):2008-20. doi: 10.1021/mp400046u.

Subsequent studies however were unable to replicate these findings, and there is now compelling evidence that the virus evolved through rare retroviral recombination events in human tumor cell lines established through murine xenograft experiments. There is also no direct evidence that XMRV infection has any functional effects that contribute to tumor pathogenesis. RESULTS: Herein we describe an additional xenotropic MLV, ""B4rv"", found in a cell line derived from xenograft experiments with the human prostate cancer LNCaP cell line. When injected subcutaneously in nude mice, LNCaP cells infected with XMRV or B4rv formed larger tumors that were highly hemorrhagic and displayed poor pericyte/smooth muscle cell (SMC) investment, markers of increased metastatic potential. Conditioned media derived from XMRV- or B4rv-infected LNCaPs, but not an amphotropic MLV control virus infected LNCaPs, profoundly decreased expression of marker genes in cultured SMC, consistent with inhibition of SMC differentiation/maturation. Similar effects were seen with a chimeric virus of the amphotropic MLV control virus containing the XMRV env gene, but not with an XMRV chimeric virus containing the amphotropic MLV env gene. UV-inactivated XMRV and pseudovirions that were pseudotyped with XMRV envelope protein also produce conditioned media that down-regulated SMC marker gene expression in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Together these results indicate that xenotropic MLV envelope proteins are sufficient to induce the production of factors by tumor cells that suppress vascular SMC differentiation, providing evidence for a novel mechanism by which xenotropic MLVs might alter tumor pathogenesis by disrupting tumor vascular maturation. Although it is highly unlikely that either XMRV or B4Rv themselves infect humans and are pathogenic, the results suggest that xenograft approaches commonly used in the study of human cancer promote the evolution of novel retroviruses with pathogenic properties.","['Murgai, Meera', 'Thomas, James', 'Cherepanova, Olga', 'Delviks-Frankenberry, Krista', 'Deeble, Paul', 'Pathak, Vinay K', 'Rekosh, David', 'Owens, Gary']","['Murgai M', 'Thomas J', 'Cherepanova O', 'Delviks-Frankenberry K', 'Deeble P', 'Pathak VK', 'Rekosh D', 'Owens G']","['Robert M, Berne Cardiovascular Research Center, University of Virginia, School of Medicine Charlottesville, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Gene Products, env)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Products, env/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*pathology/*virology', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*pathogenicity']",2013/03/30 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/03/30 06:00'],"['2012/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-10-34 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-10-34 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2013 Mar 27;10:34. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-10-34.,20130327,,PMC3681559,,,"['T32 CA009109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL057353/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL087867/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL098538/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recently developed chromosome conformation capturing techniques such as the Hi-C method empowered by next generation sequencing can generate unbiased, large-scale, high-resolution chromosomal interaction (contact) data, providing an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the spatial structure of a genome and its applications in gene regulation, genomics, epigenetics, and cell biology. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive, large-scale computational analysis of this new stream of genome conformation data generated for three different human leukemia cells or cell lines by the Hi-C technique. We developed and applied a set of bioinformatics methods to reliably generate spatial chromosomal contacts from high-throughput sequencing data and to effectively use them to study the properties of the genome structures in one-dimension (1D) and two-dimension (2D). Our analysis demonstrates that Hi-C data can be effectively applied to study tissue-specific genome conformation, chromosome-chromosome interaction, chromosomal translocations, and spatial gene-gene interaction and regulation in a three-dimensional genome of primary tumor cells. Particularly, for the first time, we constructed genome-scale spatial gene-gene interaction network, transcription factor binding site (TFBS) - TFBS interaction network, and TFBS-gene interaction network from chromosomal contact information.

In this study, we sought to investigate HDI efficacy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells expressing leukemia-associated fusion proteins (LAFP). HDIs have been shown to induce apoptosis, in part, through accumulation of DNA damage and inhibition of DNA repair. LAFPs have been correlated with a DNA repair-deficient phenotype, which may make them more sensitive to HDI-induced DNA damage. We found that expression of the LAFPs PLZF-RARalpha, PML-RARalpha, and RUNX1-ETO (AML1-ETO) increased sensitivity to DNA damage and apoptosis induced by the HDI vorinostat. The increase in apoptosis correlated with an enhanced downregulation of the prosurvival protein BCL2. Vorinostat also induced expression of the cell-cycle regulators p19(INK4D) and p21(WAF1) and triggered a G2-M cell cycle arrest to a greater extent in LAFP-expressing cells. The combination of LAFP and vorinostat further led to a greater downregulation of several base excision repair (BER) enzymes. These BER genes represent biomarker candidates for response to HDI-induced DNA damage. Notably, repair of vorinostat-induced DNA double-strand breaks was found to be impaired in PLZF-RARalpha-expressing cells, suggesting a mechanism by which LAFP expression and HDI treatment cooperate to cause an accumulation of damaged DNA. These data support the continued study of HDI-based treatment regimens in LAFP-positive AMLs.","['Petruccelli, Luca A', 'Pettersson, Filippa', 'Del Rincon, Sonia V', 'Guilbert, Cynthia', 'Licht, Jonathan D', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr']","['Petruccelli LA', 'Pettersson F', 'Del Rincon SV', 'Guilbert C', 'Licht JD', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Segal Cancer Center, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, human)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Vorinostat']",2013/03/29 06:00,2014/04/02 06:00,['2013/03/29 06:00'],"['2013/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-12-1039 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-1039 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2013 Aug;12(8):1591-604. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-1039.

BCR-ABL induces survivin expression at both the mRNA and protein level, thus inhibiting the apoptotic machinery of CML cells and contributing to the expansion of the leukemic clone. We report that, in human CML cell lines, BCR-ABL-mediated upregulation of survivin involves the JAK2/STAT3 pathway since silencing of either protein caused a consistent reduction in survivin expression. Cell lines unresponsive to imatinib mesylate (IM) because of BCR-ABL gene amplification were not resensitized to the drug after survivin downregulation. However, cells insensitive to IM because of point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain were highly responsive to hydroxyurea (HU) after survivin silencing. To address the possible clinical applications of our results, we used shepherdin, a cell-permeable peptidomimetic compound that downregulates survivin expression by preventing its interaction with Hsp90. Incubation with shepherdin of immortalized cell lines both sensitive and resistant to IM enhanced cell death induced by HU and doxorubicin. Similarly, the combination of shepherdin with first- and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors reduced the colony-forming potential of human progenitors derived from both patients with IM-sensitive and IM-resistant CML. These results suggest that strategies aimed at reducing survivin levels may represent a potential therapeutic option for patients with CML unresponsive to IM.","['Stella, Stefania', 'Tirro, Elena', 'Conte, Enrico', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Manzella, Livia', 'Vigneri, Paolo']","['Stella S', 'Tirro E', 'Conte E', 'Stagno F', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Manzella L', 'Vigneri P']","['Department of Clinical and Molecular Bio-Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Survivin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Survivin']",2013/03/29 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2013/03/29 06:00'],"['2013/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-12-0550 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0550 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2013 Jun;12(6):1085-98. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0550.

MK-8776 synergistically potentiated vorinostat-mediated apoptosis in various p53-wt or -deficient leukemia cell lines, whereas p53 knockdown by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sensitized p53-wt cells to lethality of this regimen. Leukemia cell lines carrying FLT3-ITD were also sensitive to the MK-8776/vorinostat regimen. Synergistic interactions were associated with inhibition of Chk1 activity, interference with the intra-S-phase checkpoint, disruption of DNA replication, and downregulation of proteins involved in DNA replication (e.g., Cdt1) and repair (e.g., CtIP and BRCA1), resulting in sharp increases in DNA damage, reflected by enhanced gamma-H2A.X formation, and apoptosis. Moreover, leukemia cells expressing kinase-dead Chk1 (D130A) or Chk1 shRNA were significantly more sensitive to HDACIs compared with their wt counterparts and displayed downregulation of CtIP and BRCA1 phosphorylation following HDACI exposure. Finally, the MK-8776/vorinostat regimen was active in primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts, particularly against the CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+) population enriched for leukemia-initiating cells. In contrast, identical regimens were relatively sparing toward normal cord blood CD34(+) cells. Together, these findings indicate that the novel Chk1 inhibitor MK-8776 markedly potentiates HDACI lethality in leukemia cells displaying various genetic backgrounds through mechanisms involving disruption of the intra-S checkpoint, DNA replication, and DNA repair. They also argue that leukemic cells, including those bearing oncogenic mutations associated with poor prognosis, for example, p53 deletion/mutation or FLT3-ITD, may also be susceptible to this strategy.","['Dai, Yun', 'Chen, Shuang', 'Kmieciak, Maciej', 'Zhou, Liang', 'Lin, Hui', 'Pei, Xin-Yan', 'Grant, Steven']","['Dai Y', 'Chen S', 'Kmieciak M', 'Zhou L', 'Lin H', 'Pei XY', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (MK-8776)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Histone Deacetylases/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'S Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Vorinostat']",2013/03/29 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2013/03/29 06:00'],"['2013/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-12-0902 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0902 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2013 Jun;12(6):878-89. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0902.

To test the commonality of the findings from the rhTRIM5alpha study, we have now employed a similar genetic approach using human TRIM5alpha (huTRIM5alpha). Consistent with the rhTRIM5alpha study, the mapped huTRIM5alpha escape mutations were distributed across the capsid exterior, confirming the extended binding surface between virus and restriction factor. Compared to the results of the previous study, fewer escape mutations were identified, with particular mutants being repeatedly selected. Three out four huTRIM5alpha escape variants showed resistance to all primate TRIM5alphas tested, but two of them sacrificed viral fitness, observations that were not made in the rhTRIM5alpha study. Moreover, differences in amino acid changes associated with escape from hu- and rhTRIM5alphas suggested a charge dependence of the restriction by different TRIM5alphas. Taken together, these results suggest that the recognition of the entire capsid surface is a general strategy for TRIM5alpha to restrict MLV but that significantly different specific interactions are involved in the binding of TRIM5alpha from different species to the MLV capsid core.","['Ohkura, Sadayuki', 'Stoye, Jonathan P']","['Ohkura S', 'Stoye JP']","['Division of Virology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Capsid Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Binding', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2013/03/29 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2013/03/29 06:00'],"['2013/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.03425-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.03425-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Jun;87(11):6455-68. doi: 10.1128/JVI.03425-12.

In most virus infections, they provide essential help for antiviral B and T cell responses. In chronic infections, including HIV infection, an expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) has been demonstrated, which can suppress virus-specific CD4(+) T cell responses in vitro. However, the suppressive activity of Tregs on effector CD4(+) T cells in retroviral infection is less well documented in vivo. We took advantage of a transgenic mouse in which Tregs can be selectively depleted to determine the influence of such cells on retrovirus-specific CD4(+) T cell responses during an ongoing infection. Mice were infected with Friend retrovirus (FV), and Tregs were depleted during the acute phase of the infection. In nondepleted mice, activated CD4(+) T cells produced Th1-type cytokines but did not exhibit any antiviral cytotoxicity as determined in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted in vivo cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assay. Depletion of Tregs significantly increased the numbers of virus-specific CD4(+) T cells and improved their cytokine production, whereas it induced only very little CD4(+) T cell cytotoxicity. However, after dual depletion of Tregs and CD8(+) T cells, conventional CD4(+) T cells developed significant cytotoxic activity against FV epitope-labeled target cells in vivo and contributed to the control of virus replication. Thus, both Tregs and CD8(+) T cells influence the cytotoxic activity of conventional CD4(+) T cells during an acute retroviral infection.","['Manzke, Nora', 'Akhmetzyanova, Ilseyar', 'Hasenkrug, Kim J', 'Trilling, Mirko', 'Zelinskyy, Gennadiy', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Manzke N', 'Akhmetzyanova I', 'Hasenkrug KJ', 'Trilling M', 'Zelinskyy G', 'Dittmer U']","['Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology/physiology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology']",2013/03/29 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2013/03/29 06:00'],"['2013/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00432-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00432-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Jun;87(11):6306-13. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00432-13.

Previously, electrospun nanofiber scaffolds (NFSs) were used to capture and expand hematopoietic stem cells in vitro; here, we demonstrate that NFS could also serve as a useful bioadhesive platform for capturing functionally adherent leukemia cells. Collagen-blended poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) NFS enabled more rapid and efficient capture of K562 leukemia cells than tissue culture polystyrene surfaces with up to 70% improved adhesion and shorter time. Cellular extensions, stronger adhesion, and enhanced cell-cell interactions were observed in K562 cells captured on NFS. While NFS promoted hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation, it inhibited leukemia cell proliferation and affected cell cycle status by shifting more cells toward the G0/G1 phase. The expression of alpha-integrins was equally high in both captured and uncaptured leukemia cell populations demonstrating no relation to its adhesive nature. Hematopoietic morphological signatures of NFS captured cells presented no impact on cell differentiation. We conclude that electrospun NFS serves as an excellent platform not only for capturing functionally adherent leukemia cells but also for studying the impact of niche-like structure in the nanoscale.","['Cao, Xue', 'Kwek, Kenneth', 'Chan, Jerry K Y', 'Chan, Casey K H', 'Lim, Mayasari']","['Cao X', 'Kwek K', 'Chan JK', 'Chan CK', 'Lim M']","['Division of Bioengineering, School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biomed Mater Res A,Journal of biomedical materials research.

Based on the known interaction between SYK and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in lymphoma, we hypothesized that SYK may regulate mTOR signaling in AML. Both small-molecule inhibition of SYK and SYK-directed shRNA suppressed mTOR and its downstream signaling effectors, as well as its upstream activator, AKT. Moreover, the inhibition of multiple nodes of the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway enhanced the effects of SYK suppression on AML cell viability and differentiation. Evaluation of the collateral mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway revealed a heterogeneous response to SYK inhibition in AML with downregulation of MEK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in some AML cell lines but a paradoxical increase in MEK/ERK phosphorylation in RAS-mutated AML. These studies reveal SYK as a regulator of mTOR and MAPK signaling in AML and demonstrate that inhibition of PI3K pathway activity enhances the effects of SYK inhibition on AML cell viability and differentiation.","['Carnevale, J', 'Ross, L', 'Puissant, A', 'Banerji, V', 'Stone, R M', 'DeAngelo, D J', 'Ross, K N', 'Stegmaier, K']","['Carnevale J', 'Ross L', 'Puissant A', 'Banerji V', 'Stone RM', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Ross KN', 'Stegmaier K']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2013/03/29 06:00,2014/01/10 06:00,['2013/03/29 06:00'],"['2012/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201389 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.89 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Nov;27(11):2118-28. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.89.

Risk-directed therapy included recommending allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for high-risk patients and chemotherapy/autologous-HSCT (auto-HSCT) for low-risk patients. Among 116 eligible patients, MRD status after the second consolidation rather than induction or first consolidation could discriminate high-risk relapse patients (P = .001). Allo-HSCT could reduce relapse and improve survival compared with chemotherapy for high-risk patients (cumulative incidence of relapse [CIR]: 22.1% vs 78.9%, P < .0001; disease-free survival [DFS]: 61.7% vs 19.6%, P = .001), whereas chemotherapy/auto-HSCT achieved a low relapse rate (5.3%) and high DFS (94.7%) for low-risk patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that MRD status and treatment choice were independent prognostic factors for relapse, DFS, and OS.

Aberrant Bcl-3 results in increased cell proliferation and survival, suggesting a contribution to malignant potential and elevated levels of Bcl-3 have been observed in many HTLV-1-infected T cell lines and ATL cells. To investigate the specific roles of Bcl-3 in HTLV-1-infected cells, we knocked down Bcl-3 expression using shRNA and then examined the consequences with regard to DNA damage and cell proliferation, as well as NF-kappaB activation.

METHODS: After intralesional injection of Bleomycin A5 into the tumor of animal model of infancy hemangioma, the variation of tumor form was and the variation of tumor structure were observed using light microscope and electron microscope, the variation of tumor gene expression spectra was also tested by DNA microarray technique. RESULTS: After treatment, the tumor gradually shrunk, hardened, disappeared one month later. The tumor lost appearance of infancy hemangioma and replaced by lamellar collagen fibers and cellular nucleus scattered in the fibers, and almost all cells were necrotic and dissolved. Under electron microscope, only large stretches of dissolved cell could be seen without intact cells and blood vessels, but apoptotic cells and bodies could also be found. The results of DNA microarray analysis showed that 9 genes associated with apoptosis (murine double minute 2, heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit, lymphotoxin B receptor, tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily 7, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 21, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 1A, myeloid cell leukemia-1, caspase3), 13 genes associated with cell proliferation and cell cycle (cell division cycle27, cell division cycle37, CDC28 protein kinase 1B, cycling B1, cullin 2, cullin 3, cullin 4A, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45A, meiotic recombination 11 homolog B, forkhead box M1, minichromosome maintenance 7, antigen identified by monoclonal antibody ki 67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen), and 11 genes associated with cellular stress and toxic reaction (glutathione peroxidase 1, metallothioneins, superoxide dismutase-1, heat shock protein A1A, heat shock protein A2, heat shock protein A4, heat shock protein A5, heat shock protein 9B, heat shock protein CA, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor)were up or down regulated more than 2 folds in tumors treated with Bleomycin A5 compared with controls.

This factor binds and localizes the coagulation factor VII to the cell surface to initiate the coagulation cascade. TF is normally expressed only in adventitial fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells surrounding blood vessels, providing a hemostatic barrier that activates coagulation when the tissue is injured (2). TF can be newly synthesized upon endotoxin and cytokine stimulation of endothelial cells and leukocytes. The expression of TF is upregulated in thrombosis, tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis (3, 4). There is an aberrant expression of TF in pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, glioma, leukemia, and lung cancer, with strong association of several hemostatic complications (5).

In an effort to confirm previous reports of an association between clonal mosaicism and incident hematologic cancer, we applied the anomDetectBAF algorithm to call chromosomal anomalies in genotype data from previously conducted Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS). The genotypes were initially collected from DNA derived from peripheral blood of 12,176 participants in the Group Health electronic Medical Records and Genomics study (eMERGE) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). We detected clonal mosaicism in 169 individuals (1.4%) and large clonal mosaic events (>2 mb) in 117 (1.0%) individuals. Though only 9.5% of clonal mosaic carriers had an incident diagnosis of hematologic cancer (multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, lymphoma, or leukemia), the carriers had a 5.5-fold increased risk (95% CI: 3.3-9.3; p-value = 7.5x10(-11)) of developing these cancers subsequently. Carriers of large mosaic anomalies showed particularly pronounced risk of subsequent leukemia (HR = 19.2, 95% CI: 8.9-41.6; p-value = 7.3x10(-14)).

Resveratrol, an important integrant in traditional Chinese medicine, possesses certain antitumor effects. However, the mechanisms on regulating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are unclear. This study first used human subjects to demonstrate that the plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-1 beta in AML patients were higher and lower, respectively, than healthy donors. The expression of Shh preproproteins, and C- and N-terminal Shh peptides increased in bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from AML patients, and the plasma N-Shh secretion was greater. To further clarify the effect of IL-6 and resveratrol in Shh signaling, human AML HL-60 cells were tested. IL-6 upregulated Shh and Gli-1 expression and was accompanied by an increase of cell viability. Resveratrol significantly decreased CSC-related Shh expression, Gli-1 nuclear translocation, and cell viability in IL-6-treated HL-60 cells and had synergistic effect with Shh inhibitor cyclopamine on inhibiting cell growth. Conclusions. IL-6 stimulated the growth of AML cells through Shh signaling, and this effect might be blocked by resveratrol. Further investigations of Shh as a prognostic marker and resveratrol as a therapeutic drug target to CSCs in AML are surely warranted.","['Su, Yu-Chieh', 'Li, Szu-Chin', 'Wu, Yin-Chi', 'Wang, Li-Min', 'Chao, K S Clifford', 'Liao, Hui-Fen']","['Su YC', 'Li SC', 'Wu YC', 'Wang LM', 'Chao KS', 'Liao HF']","['Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Tzu Chi University, Hualien 97004, Taiwan ; Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Buddhist Dalin Tzu Chi General Hospital, Chiayi 62247, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,2013/03/28 06:00,2013/03/28 06:01,['2013/03/28 06:00'],"['2012/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/547430 [doi]'],ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2013;2013:547430. doi: 10.1155/2013/547430.

Here we show that the combined treatment with 5,7-dihydroxyflavone and TRAIL at subtoxic concentrations induced strong apoptotic response in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells, acute leukemia Jurkat T cells, and cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. We further investigated the mechanisms by which 5,7-dihydroxyflavone augments TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. 5,7-Dihydroxyflavone up-regulated the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, attenuated the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and IAPs, and reduced the phosphorylation levels of Akt and STAT3, weakening the anti-apoptotic signals thus facilitating the process of apoptosis. Moreover, 5,7-dihydroxyflavone and TRAIL were well tolerated in mice, and the combination of 5,7-dihydroxyflavone and TRAIL reduced tumor burden in vivo in a HepG2 tumor xenograft model. Interestingly, 5,7-dihydroxyflavone-mediated sensitization to TRAIL-induced cell death was not observed in normal human hepatocytes L-O2.

Epidemiologic studies suggest that exposure to 2,4-D and MCPA may be associated with increased risk non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin's disease (HD), leukemia, and soft-tissue sarcoma (STS). Toxicological studies in rodents show no evidence of carcinogenicity, and regulatory agencies worldwide consider chlorophenoxies as not likely to be carcinogenic or unclassifiable as to carcinogenicity. This systematic review assembles the available data to evaluate epidemiologic, toxicological, pharmacokinetic, exposure, and biomonitoring studies with respect to key cellular events noted in disease etiology and how those relate to hypothesized modes of action for these constituents to determine the plausibility of an association between exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of 2,4-D and MCPA and lymphohematopoietic cancers. The combined evidence does not support a genotoxic mode of action. Although plausible hypotheses for other carcinogenic modes of action exist, a comparison of biomonitoring data to oral equivalent doses calculated from bioassay data shows that environmental exposures are not sufficient to support a causal relationship. Genetic polymorphisms exist that are known to increase the risk of developing NHL.

Leukemias of diverse lineages ensued, most commonly lymphoid leukemia and erythroleukemia. The inclusion of a transgenic allele of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)V617F resulted in acceleration of transposon-driven disease and strong selection for erythroleukemic pathology with transformation of bipotential erythro-megakaryocytic cells. The genes encoding the E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors Ets related gene (Erg) and Ets1 were the most common sites for transposon insertion in SB-induced JAK2V617F-positive erythroleukemias, present in 87.5% and 65%, respectively, of independent leukemias examined. The role of activated Erg was validated by reproducing erythroleukemic pathology in mice transplanted with fetal liver cells expressing translocated in liposarcoma (TLS)-ERG, an activated form of ERG found in human leukemia. Via application of SB mutagenesis to TLS-ERG-induced erythroid transformation, we identified multiple loci as likely collaborators with activation of Erg. Jak2 was identified as a common transposon insertion site in TLS-ERG-induced disease, strongly validating the cooperation between JAK2V617F and transposon insertion at the Erg locus in the JAK2V617F-positive leukemias. Moreover, loci expressing other regulators of signal transduction pathways were conspicuous among the common transposon insertion sites in TLS-ERG-driven leukemia, suggesting that a key mechanism in erythroleukemia may be the collaboration of lesions disturbing erythroid maturation, most notably in genes of the ETS family, with mutations that reduce dependence on exogenous signals.","['Tang, Jian Zhong', 'Carmichael, Catherine L', 'Shi, Wei', 'Metcalf, Donald', 'Ng, Ashley P', 'Hyland, Craig D', 'Jenkins, Nancy A', 'Copeland, Neal G', 'Howell, Viive M', 'Zhao, Zhizhuang Joe', 'Smyth, Gordon K', 'Kile, Benjamin T', 'Alexander, Warren S']","['Tang JZ', 'Carmichael CL', 'Shi W', 'Metcalf D', 'Ng AP', 'Hyland CD', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG', 'Howell VM', 'Zhao ZJ', 'Smyth GK', 'Kile BT', 'Alexander WS']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (ERG protein, mouse)', '0 (Ets1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'DNA Transposable Elements', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genotype', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG']",2013/03/28 06:00,2013/07/16 06:00,['2013/03/28 06:00'],"['2013/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1304234110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1304234110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Apr 9;110(15):6091-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1304234110.

Here, we explored the methylation and expression of PTPRO as well as its function in human HCC. MassARRAY analysis of primary human HCC and matching liver samples (n = 24) revealed significantly higher (P = 0.004) methylation density at the promoter CGI in tumors. Combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) of another set of human HCC samples (n = 17) demonstrated that the CGI was methylated in 29% of tumors where expression of PTPRO was lower than that in corresponding matching livers. A substrate-trapping mutant of PTPRO that stabilizes the bound substrates was used to identify its novel substrate(s). VCP/p97 was found to be a PTPRO substrate by mass spectrometry of the peptides pulled down by the substrate-trapping mutant of PTPRO. Tyrosyl dephosphorylation of VCP following ectopic expression of wild-type PTPRO in H293T and HepG2 cells confirmed that it is a bona fide substrate of PTPRO. Treatment of PTPRO overexpressing HepG2 cells with Doxorubicin, a DNA damaging drug commonly used in therapy of primary HCC, sensitized these cells to this potent anticancer drug that correlated with dephosphorylation of VCP. Taken together, these results demonstrate methylation and downregulation of PTPRO in a subset of primary human HCC and establish VCP as a novel functionally important substrate of this tyrosine phosphatase that could be a potential molecular target for HCC therapy.","['Hsu, Shu-hao', 'Motiwala, Tasneem', 'Roy, Satavisha', 'Claus, Rainer', 'Mustafa, Mufaddal', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Freitas, Michael A', 'Ghoshal, Kalpana', 'Jacob, Samson T']","['Hsu SH', 'Motiwala T', 'Roy S', 'Claus R', 'Mustafa M', 'Plass C', 'Freitas MA', 'Ghoshal K', 'Jacob ST']","['Department of Molecular & Cellular Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRO protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.4.6 (VCP protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.6 (Valosin Containing Protein)', 'EC 3.6.4.6 (Vcp protein, rat)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/*biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*biosynthesis', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Rats', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Valosin Containing Protein']",2013/03/28 06:00,2013/11/02 06:00,['2013/03/28 06:00'],"['2013/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24525 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2013 Aug;114(8):1810-8. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24525.,,"['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",PMC4199230,,,"['R01 CA086978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK088076/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK088076/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA086978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS584242'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overcoming proliferative and cytoprotective signals generated within the microenvironment of lymphoid organs is essential for limiting CLL progression and ultimately developing a cure. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We assessed the potency of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor CR8, a roscovitine analog, to induce apoptosis in primary CLL from distinct prognostic subsets using flow cytometry-based assays. CLL cells were cultured in in vitro prosurvival and proproliferative conditions to mimic microenvironmental signals in the lymphoid organs, to elucidate the mechanism of action of CR8 in quiescent and proliferating CLL cells using flow cytometry, Western blotting, and quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: CR8 was 100-fold more potent at inducing apoptosis in primary CLL cells than roscovitine, both in isolated culture and stromal-coculture conditions. Importantly, CR8 induced apoptosis in CD40-ligated CLL cells and preferentially targeted actively proliferating cells within these cultures. CR8 treatment induced downregulation of the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and XIAP, through inhibition of RNA polymerase II, and inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling at the transcriptional level and through inhibition of the inhibitor of IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, resulting in stabilization of IkappaBalpha expression. CONCLUSIONS: CR8 is a potent CDK inhibitor that subverts pivotal prosurvival and proproliferative signals present in the tumor microenvironment of CLL patient lymphoid organs. Our data support the clinical development of selective CDK inhibitors as novel therapies for CLL.","['Cosimo, Emilio', 'McCaig, Alison M', 'Carter-Brzezinski, Luke J M', 'Wheadon, Helen', 'Leach, Michael T', 'Le Ster, Karine', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Durieu, Emilie', 'Oumata, Nassima', 'Galons, Herve', 'Meijer, Laurent', 'Michie, Alison M']","['Cosimo E', 'McCaig AM', 'Carter-Brzezinski LJ', 'Wheadon H', 'Leach MT', 'Le Ster K', 'Berthou C', 'Durieu E', 'Oumata N', 'Galons H', 'Meijer L', 'Michie AM']","['Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CR8 compound)', '0 (IL4 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'CD40 Ligand/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Interleukin-4/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'RNA Polymerase II/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Roscovitine', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2013/03/28 06:00,2013/11/13 06:00,['2013/03/28 06:00'],"['2013/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-2170 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2170 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 May 1;19(9):2393-405. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2170.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Utilizing different multiple myeloma cell lines we determined the effect of TG02 over viability by MTT assays. The apoptotic effect over multiple myeloma patient samples was studied ex vivo by cytometry. The mechanism of action of TG02 was analyzed in the cell line MM1S, studying its effect on the cell cycle, the induction of apoptosis, and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential by cytometry and Western blot. Two models of multiple myeloma xenograft were utilized to study the in vivo action of TG02. RESULTS: TG02 potently inhibited proliferation and survival of multiple myeloma cell lines, even under protective bone marrow niche conditions, and selectively induced apoptosis of primary patient-derived malignant plasma cells. TG02 displayed significant single-agent activity in two multiple myeloma xenograft models, and enhanced the in vivo activity of bortezomib and lenalidomide. Signaling analyses revealed that the drug simultaneously blocked the activity of CDKs 1, 2, and 9 as well as the MAP kinase ERK5 in MM1S cells, leading to cell-cycle arrest and rapid commitment to apoptosis. TG02 induced robust activation of both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis, and depletion of XIAP and the key multiple myeloma survival protein Mcl-1.

In ALL, no correlations were elicited between CD133 expression and some monoclonal antibodies, but in AML group, there was a significant positive correlation between CD133 and HLA-DR, CD3, CD7 and TDT, CD13 and CD34. In ALL group, patients with negative CD133 expression achieved complete remission more than patients with positive CD133 expression. In AML group, there was no statistically significant association found between positive CD133 expression and treatment outcome. The Kaplan-Meier curve illustrated a high significant negative correlation between CD133 expression and the overall survival of the AML patients.

Studies have reported that neutrophil elastase(NE) cleaved bcr-1-derived PML-RARalpha in early myeloid cells leading to the removal of nuclear localization signal (NLS) from PML. The resultant PML without NLS named PML(NLS(-)). PML(NLS(-)) mainly locates and functions in the cytoplasm. PML(NLS(-)) may act in different ways from PML, but its biological characteristics have not been reported. In this study, the PML (NLS(-)) was silenced with shRNA [HL-60/pPML(NLS(-))-shRNA] and over-expressed by preparation of recombinant adenovirus [HL-60/pAd-PML(NLS(-))]. The mRNA and protein expression of PML(NLS(-)) were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot respectively. Cell proliferation in vitro was assessed by MTT assay. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to detect apoptotic cells. The transcription of BCL-2, BAX and C-MYC was detected in HL-60/pAd-PML(NLS(-)) cells. Our results showed that compared to the control group, the expression of PML(NLS(-)) was significantly reduced in the HL-60/pPML(NLS(-))-shRNA cells, and increased significantly in the HL-60/pAd-PML(NLS(-)) cells. The proliferation was significantly inhibited in the HL-60/pPML(NLS(-))-shRNA cells in a time-dependent manner, but markedly promoted in the HL-60/pAd-PML(NLS(-)) cells treated with 60 mumol/L emodin. FCM revealed the apoptosis increased in HL-60/pPML(NLS(-))-shRNA cells, and decreased in the HL-60/pAd-PML(NLS(-)) cells.

We used a computational approach, termed kinase-substrate enrichment analysis (KSEA), to systematically infer the activation of given kinase pathways from mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic analysis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Experiments conducted in cell lines validated the approach and, furthermore, revealed that DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) was activated as a result of inhibiting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Application of KSEA to primary AML cells identified PI3K, casein kinases (CKs), cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and p21-activated kinases (PAKs) as the kinase substrate groups most frequently enriched in this cancer type. Substrates phosphorylated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cell division cycle 7 (CDC7) were enriched in primary AML cells that were resistant to inhibition of PI3K-mTOR signaling, whereas substrates of the kinases Abl, Lck, Src, and CDK1 were increased in abundance in inhibitor-sensitive cells. Modeling based on the abundances of these substrate groups accurately predicted sensitivity to a dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor in two independent sets of primary AML cells isolated from patients. Thus, our study demonstrates KSEA as an untargeted method for the systematic profiling of kinase pathway activities and for increasing our understanding of diseases caused by the dysregulation of signaling pathways.","['Casado, Pedro', 'Rodriguez-Prados, Juan-Carlos', 'Cosulich, Sabina C', 'Guichard, Sylvie', 'Vanhaesebroeck, Bart', 'Joel, Simon', 'Cutillas, Pedro R']","['Casado P', 'Rodriguez-Prados JC', 'Cosulich SC', 'Guichard S', 'Vanhaesebroeck B', 'Joel S', 'Cutillas PR']","['Analytical Signalling Group, Centre for Cell Signalling, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1B 6BQ, UK. pedro.cutillas@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Sci Signal,Science signaling,101465400,"['EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Computational Biology/*methods', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Mass Spectrometry/methods', '*Models, Biological', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']",2013/03/28 06:00,2013/09/10 06:00,['2013/03/28 06:00'],"['2013/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['6/268/rs6 [pii]', '10.1126/scisignal.2003573 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Signal. 2013 Mar 26;6(268):rs6. doi: 10.1126/scisignal.2003573.,20130326,,,,,"['BB/G015023/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'G0800914/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BB/G0115023/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP1 (Rasgrp1 in mice) as a Ras activator that contributes to leukemogenesis. We found increased RasGRP1 expression in many pediatric T-ALL patients, which is not observed in rare early T cell precursor T-ALL patients with KRAS and NRAS mutations, such as K-Ras(G12D). Leukemia screens in wild-type mice, but not in mice expressing the mutant K-Ras(G12D) that encodes a constitutively active Ras, yielded frequent retroviral insertions that led to increased Rasgrp1 expression. Rasgrp1 and oncogenic K-Ras(G12D) promoted T-ALL through distinct mechanisms. In K-Ras(G12D) T-ALLs, enhanced Ras activation had to be uncoupled from cell cycle arrest to promote cell proliferation. In mouse T-ALL cells with increased Rasgrp1 expression, we found that Rasgrp1 contributed to a previously uncharacterized cytokine receptor-activated Ras pathway that stimulated the proliferation of T-ALL cells in vivo, which was accompanied by dynamic patterns of activation of effector kinases downstream of Ras in individual T-ALLs. Reduction of Rasgrp1 abundance reduced cytokine-stimulated Ras signaling and decreased the proliferation of T-ALL in vivo. The position of RasGRP1 downstream of cytokine receptors as well as the different clinical outcomes that we observed as a function of RasGRP1 abundance make RasGRP1 an attractive future stratification marker for T-ALL.","['Hartzell, Catherine', 'Ksionda, Olga', 'Lemmens, Ed', 'Coakley, Kristen', 'Yang, Ming', 'Dail, Monique', 'Harvey, Richard C', 'Govern, Christopher', 'Bakker, Jeroen', 'Lenstra, Tineke L', 'Ammon, Kristin', 'Boeter, Anne', 'Winter, Stuart S', 'Loh, Mignon', 'Shannon, Kevin', 'Chakraborty, Arup K', 'Wabl, Matthias', 'Roose, Jeroen P']","['Hartzell C', 'Ksionda O', 'Lemmens E', 'Coakley K', 'Yang M', 'Dail M', 'Harvey RC', 'Govern C', 'Bakker J', 'Lenstra TL', 'Ammon K', 'Boeter A', 'Winter SS', 'Loh M', 'Shannon K', 'Chakraborty AK', 'Wabl M', 'Roose JP']","['Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Sci Signal,Science signaling,101465400,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Rasgrp1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Diglycerides', 'Enzyme Activation/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Oligonucleotides/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",2013/03/28 06:00,2013/09/10 06:00,['2013/03/28 06:00'],"['2013/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['6/268/ra21 [pii]', '10.1126/scisignal.2003848 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Signal. 2013 Mar 26;6(268):ra21. doi: 10.1126/scisignal.2003848.,20130326,,PMC3737252,,['Cell Cycle. 2013 May 15;12(10):1480-1.

Our understanding of the biology of CLL has helped us identify several markers of prognostic significance, by which CLL can be differentiated into several distinct diseases. The presence of specific chromosomal abnormalities is a prognostic indicator of disease progression and survival. Conventional cytogenetic analyses have revealed chromosomal aberrations in 40-50% of patients, but the detection of abnormalities is limited by the low mitotic activity of CLL cells. Metaphase analysis has recently undergone a ""revival"" because the metaphase yield has been improved by stimulation of CLL cells with alternative methods. Fluorescence in situ hybridization identifies chromosomal changes in approximately 80% of patients with CLL, and comparative genomic hybridization using high-density arrays (i.e., array comparative genomic hybridization [aCGH]) enables high-resolution genome-wide scanning for detecting copy number alterations in a single hybridization. The mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) genes identifies two subsets of CLL with different outcomes. Unfortunately, the determination of IGHV mutation status may not be practical in all laboratories, and for this reason characteristics that are correlated with IGHV mutation status are needed-zeta-chain associated (TCR) protein kinase 70 kDa (ZAP-70) being that most commonly used currently in routine clinical practice. Whole genome sequencing has offered new insights into the mutational status of the disease, highlighting the role of several genes previously unrelated to CLL. Of these, NOTCH1 and SF3B1 are the most frequently mutated genes that predict poor prognosis. MicroRNA alterations are also involved in the initiation and progression of CLL, and the expression levels of some microRNAs correlate with previously established prognostic markers such as IGHV mutation status or ZAP-70. In addition, both global and gene-specific aberrant DNA methylation have been observed in CLL. Aberrant methylation has been described for genes that are specifically deregulated in CLL, such as BCL2, TCL1, and ZAP-70. Expanding knowledge of aberrant methylation profiles in CLL has a potential future impact on diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of treatment response in CLL patients.","['Rodriguez-Vicente, Ana E', 'Diaz, Marcos Gonzalez', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M']","['Rodriguez-Vicente AE', 'Diaz MG', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM']","['IBSAL, IBMCC, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, and Servicio de Hematologi a, Hospital Cli nico Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Genet,Cancer genetics,101539150,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', '*DNA Methylation', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear/genetics']",2013/03/28 06:00,2013/06/01 06:00,['2013/03/28 06:00'],"['2012/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S2210-7762(13)00014-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergen.2013.01.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet. 2013 Mar;206(3):49-62. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergen.2013.01.003.

Recently, NUP98/NSD1 (t(5; 11)(q35; p15)), a cytogenetically cryptic fusion, was described as recurrent event in AML, characterized by dismal prognosis and HOXA/B gene overexpression. Using split-signal fluorescence in situ hybridization, other NUP98-rearranged pediatric AML cases were identified, including several acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) cases with a cytogenetically cryptic fusion of NUP98 to JARID1A (t(11;15)(p15;q35)). In this study we screened 105 pediatric AMKL cases to analyze the frequency of NUP98/JARID1A and other recurrent genetic abnormalities. NUP98/JARID1A was identified in 11/105 patients (10.5%). Other abnormalities consisted of RBM15/MKL1 (n=16), CBFA2T3/GLIS2 (n=13) and MLL-rearrangements (n=13). Comparing NUP98/JARID1A-positive patients with other pediatric AMKL patients, no significant differences in sex, age and white blood cell count were found. NUP98/JARID1A was not an independent prognostic factor for 5-year overall (probability of overall survival (pOS)) or event-free survival (probability of event-free survival (pEFS)), although the 5-year pOS for the entire AMKL cohort was poor (42 +/- 6%). Cases with RBM15/MLK1 fared significantly better in terms of pOS and pEFS, although this was not independent from other risk factors in multivariate analysis. NUP98/JARID1A cases were characterized by HOXA/B gene overexpression, which is a potential druggable pathway. In conclusion, NUP98/JARID1A is a novel recurrent genetic abnormality in pediatric AMKL.","['de Rooij, J D E', 'Hollink, I H I M', 'Arentsen-Peters, S T C J M', 'van Galen, J F', 'Berna Beverloo, H', 'Baruchel, A', 'Trka, J', 'Reinhardt, D', 'Sonneveld, E', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Alonzo, T A', 'Pieters, R', 'Meshinchi, S', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, M M', 'Zwaan, C Michel']","['de Rooij JD', 'Hollink IH', 'Arentsen-Peters ST', 'van Galen JF', 'Berna Beverloo H', 'Baruchel A', 'Trka J', 'Reinhardt D', 'Sonneveld E', 'Zimmermann M', 'Alonzo TA', 'Pieters R', 'Meshinchi S', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Zwaan CM']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM5A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.11.27 (Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 2/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2013/03/28 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/03/28 06:00'],"['2013/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201387 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.87 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Dec;27(12):2280-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.87.

Pgp acts as a drug efflux pump and exports chemotherapeutic agents from cancer cells. Specific inhibition of Pgp expression by gene therapy is considered a well-respective strategy having less innate toxicities. At present, the investigation of DRz in reversal MDR is scarce. In the study, phosphorothioate DRz that targets to the translation initiation codon AUG was synthesized and transfected into breast cancer cells and leukemia cells with MDR phenotype. ASODN (antisense oligonucleotide) and ribozyme targets to the same region were also synthesized for comparison analysis. Alterations in MDR1 mRNA and Pgp were determined by RT-PCR, Northern blot, flow cytometry and Rh123 retention tests. Chemosensitivity of the treated cells was determined by MTT assay. The results showed that DRz could significantly suppress expression of MDR1 mRNA and inhibit synthesis of Pgp. The efflux activity of Pgp was inhibited accordingly. Chemosensitivity assay showed that a 21-fold reduction in drug resistance for Adriamycin and a 45-fold reduction in drug resistance for Vinblastine were found in the treated cells 36h after transfection. These data suggest that DRz targeted to the translation initiation codon AUG can reverse MDR phenotype in cancer cells and restore their chemosensitivity. Moreover, the reversal efficiency of DRz is better than that of ribozyme and ASODN targets to the same region of MDR1 mRNA.","['Xing, Ai-Yan', 'Shi, Duan-bo', 'Liu, Wei', 'Chen, Xu', 'Sun, Yan-Lin', 'Wang, Xiao', 'Zhang, Jian-ping', 'Gao, Peng']","['Xing AY', 'Shi DB', 'Liu W', 'Chen X', 'Sun YL', 'Wang X', 'Zhang JP', 'Gao P']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Catalytic)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Phosphorothioate Oligonucleotides)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'DNA, Catalytic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/therapy', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics', 'Phosphorothioate Oligonucleotides', 'Transfection', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",2013/03/28 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2013/03/28 06:00'],"['2012/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4800(13)00042-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2013.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2013 Jun;94(3):481-5. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2013.03.004.

The structural features that mediate interaction between Galpha13 and RhoGEFs have been examined in crystallographic studies of the purified complex, whereas a Galpha12:RhoGEF complex has not been reported. Several signaling responses and effector interactions appear unique to Galpha12 or Galpha13, despite their similarity in amino acid sequence. METHODS: To comprehensively examine Galpha12 for regions involved in RhoGEF interaction, we screened a panel of Galpha12 cassette substitution mutants for binding to leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) and for activation of serum response element mediated transcription. RESULTS: We identified several cassette substitutions that disrupt Galpha12 binding to LARG and the related p115RhoGEF. These Galpha12 mutants also were impaired in activating serum response element mediated signaling, a Rho-dependent response. Most of these mutants matched corresponding regions of Galpha13 reported to contact p115RhoGEF, but unexpectedly, several RhoGEF-uncoupling mutations were found within the N- and C-terminal regions of Galpha12. Trypsin protection assays revealed several mutants in these regions as retaining conformational activation. In addition, charge substitutions near the Galpha12 N-terminus selectively disrupted binding to LARG but not p115RhoGEF. CONCLUSIONS: Several structural aspects of the Galpha12:RhoGEF interface differ from the reported Galpha13:RhoGEF complex, particularly determinants within the C-terminal alpha5 helix and structurally uncharacterized N-terminus of Galpha12. Furthermore, key residues at the Galpha12 N-terminus may confer selectivity for LARG as a downstream effector.","['Ritchie, Benjamin J', 'Smolski, William C', 'Montgomery, Ellyn R', 'Fisher, Elizabeth S', 'Choi, Tina Y', 'Olson, Calla M', 'Foster, Lori A', 'Meigs, Thomas E']","['Ritchie BJ', 'Smolski WC', 'Montgomery ER', 'Fisher ES', 'Choi TY', 'Olson CM', 'Foster LA', 'Meigs TE']","['Department of Biology, University of North Carolina at Asheville, One University Heights, Asheville, NC 28804, USA. tmeigs@unca.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Mol Signal,Journal of molecular signaling,101271526,,,,2013/03/28 06:00,2013/03/28 06:01,['2013/03/28 06:00'],"['2013/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/28 06:01 [medline]']","['1750-2187-8-3 [pii]', '10.1186/1750-2187-8-3 [doi]']",epublish,J Mol Signal. 2013 Mar 25;8(1):3. doi: 10.1186/1750-2187-8-3.,20130325,,PMC3636079,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a following work, the author has reported on the in vitro cytotoxicity and the mechanism of action of a silver(I) tartaric acid chelate synthesized by the author given the title name Aliargentumycine (AAgM) on hematopoietic malignancies. The in vitro antineoplastic activities of AAgM on solid human breast ductal carcinoma (T- 47D) and disseminated T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Jurkat) cell lines, its mechanism of action and its structural properties were investigated here. The cytotoxicity results of AAgM were compared to cisplatin, a ubiquitously used platinum-based antitumor drug. Results have indicated that AAgM demonstrated excellent cytotoxicity on both tumor cell lines studied when compared to cis-platin, especially for T-47D. Unlike cisplatin, AAgM was found to exhibit an aberrant triphasic cytotoxicity profile. Phase I exhibited cytotoxicity in the nanoconcentration range, Phase II exhibited no cytotoxicity in the intermediate range, and finally Phase III exhibited cytotoxicity in the microconcentration range. Phase II lacks of cytotoxicity might be an indication of cells reverting back to being nonmalignant in a similar way to 5-Aza-2'- deoxycytidine (decitabine). Quantitative pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analyses were undertaken and were found that AAgM induced significantly better cytotoxic activities than cisplatin between 1.9-30.5 ng/mL while cisplatin did not exhibit any cytotoxicity on T-47D below 122 ng/mL. TUNEL assay was performed and AAgM was found to elicit its antineoplastic activities by apoptosis. X-ray diffraction showed that AAgM is a polymeric chain hydrate structure with no imposed symmetry and the complex around the silver is a monohydrate distorted skew trapezoidal bipyramidal sixcoordinate. AAgM is composed of lipophilic and hydrophilic moieties, making AAgM miscible in both lipids via the tartrate rings and ionic solutions via the water molecules. The results are expected to have significant implications on cancer therapy, especially solid neoplasms, which are exceptionally difficult to treat, and those derived from epithelial and mesenchymal cells, which are not prone to apoptotic responses with cdk inhibitor drugs. Also, the results should be very useful in the design of future novel silver-based antineoplastic drugs.","['Batarseh, Kareem I']",['Batarseh KI'],"['NovaGene, LLC, 265 High Street, 4th Floor, Morgantown, WV 26505, USA. fractals00@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coordination Complexes)', '0 (Tartrates)', '3M4G523W1G (Silver)', 'W4888I119H (tartaric acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coordination Complexes/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Silver/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tartrates/chemistry/pharmacology']",2013/03/28 06:00,2013/11/10 06:00,['2013/03/28 06:00'],"['2012/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['CMC-EPUB-20130315-4 [pii]', '10.2174/0929867311320180007 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2013;20(18):2363-73. doi: 10.2174/0929867311320180007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neuregulin (NRG)-1 and erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB) receptors have been shown to play a critical role in maintenance of cardiac function. However, whether myocardial NRG-1/ErbB is altered during post-MI HF associated with DM remains unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of type 1 DM on the myocardial NRG-1/ErbB system following MI in relation to residual left ventricular (LV) function. METHODS: Type 1 DM was induced in rats via administration of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg, i.p.). Control rats were injected with citrate buffer (vehicle) only. Two weeks after induction of type 1 DM, MI was produced in DM and non-DM rats by ligation of the left coronary artery. Sham MI rats underwent the same surgical procedure with the exception that the left coronary artery was not ligated. At 4 weeks after surgery, residual in vivo LV function was assessed via echocardiography. Myocardial protein expression of NRG-1beta, ErbB2 and ErbB4 receptors, and MDM2 (a downstream signaling pathway induced by NRG-1 that has been implicated in cell survival) was assessed in the remaining, viable LV myocardium by Western blotting. Changes in ErbB receptor localization in the surviving LV myocardium of diabetic and non-diabetic post-MI rats was determined using immunohistochemistry techniques. RESULTS: At 4 weeks post-MI, echocardiography revealed that LV fractional shortening (FS) and LV ejection fraction (EF) were significantly lower in the DM + MI group compared to the MI group (LVFS: 17.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 25.2 +/- 2.2; LVEF: 35.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 47.5 +/- 3.5, respectively; P < 0.05), indicating an increased functional severity of HF among the DM + MI rats. Up-regulation of NRG-1beta and ErbB2 protein expression in the MI group was abrogated in the DM + MI group concurrent with degradation of MDM2, a downstream negative regulator of p53. ErbB2 and ErbB4 receptors re-localized to cardiac myocyte nuclei in failing type 1 diabetic post-MI hearts.

This study investigated the anticancer activity of the same mixture in HT-29 colon cancer cells. RQ decreased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by up to 2.25-fold and increased the antioxidant capacity by up to 3-fold in HT-29 cells (3.8-60 mug/mL), whereas IC50 values for viability were 18.13, 18.73, and 11.85 mug/mL, respectively. RQ also induced caspase-3-cleavage (2-fold) and increased PARP cleavage. Specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors are overexpressed in colon and other cancers and regulate genes required for cell proliferation survival and angiogenesis. RQ treatment decreased the expression of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 mRNA and this was accompanied by decreased protein expression. Moreover, the Sp-dependent antiapoptotic survival gene survivin was also significantly reduced, both at mRNA and protein levels. RQ decreased microRNA-27a (miR-27a) and induced zinc finger protein ZBTB10, an Sp-repressor, suggesting that interactions of RQ with the miR-27a-ZBTB10-axis play a role in Sp downregulation. This was confirmed by transfection of cells with the specific mimic for miR-27a, which partially reversed the effects of RQ. These findings are consistent with previous studies on botanical anticancer agents in colon cancer cells.","['Del Follo-Martinez, Armando', 'Banerjee, Nivedita', 'Li, Xiangrong', 'Safe, Stephen', 'Mertens-Talcott, Susanne']","['Del Follo-Martinez A', 'Banerjee N', 'Li X', 'Safe S', 'Mertens-Talcott S']","['Department of Nutrition and Food Science, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77843, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (MIRN27 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (SP4 protein, human)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sp4 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '148710-94-5 (Sp3 Transcription Factor)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'MicroRNAs/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Sp3 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Sp4 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology']",2013/03/28 06:00,2013/09/17 06:00,['2013/03/28 06:00'],"['2013/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2012.725194 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2013;65(3):494-504. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2012.725194.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To study the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of myeloid sarcoma in the head and neck region and to review the differential diagnosis. DESIGN: We searched for cases of myeloid sarcoma involving the head and neck region for a 24-year period at our institution. The medical records and pathology slides were reviewed. Additional immunohistochemical stains were performed. RESULTS: We identified 17 patients, age 17 to 85 years. Most tumors involved the oral cavity. Myeloid sarcoma was the initial diagnosis in 9 patients (53%); the remaining 8 patients (47%) had a history of bone marrow disease. Immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies specific for lysozyme, CD43, and CD68 were highly sensitive for diagnosis but were not specific. By contrast, assessment for myeloperoxidase in this study was less sensitive but more specific. We also used antibodies specific for CD11c and CD33 in a subset of cases, and these reagents seem helpful as well. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical presentation of myeloid sarcoma involving the head and neck, particularly the mouth, is often nonspecific, and a high degree of suspicion for the possibility of myeloid sarcoma is needed. Immunohistochemistry is very helpful for establishing the diagnosis.","['Zhou, Jane', 'Bell, Diana', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey']","['Zhou J', 'Bell D', 'Medeiros LJ']","['From the Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/genetics/pathology', 'CD11c Antigen/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukosialin/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/28 06:00,2013/12/24 06:00,['2013/03/28 06:00'],"['2013/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5858/arpa.2012-0537-OA [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2013 Nov;137(11):1560-8. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2012-0537-OA.

It is usually caused by the perturbation of the network formed by several genes or proteins. In the last decade several research teams have attempted to construct interaction maps of genes and proteins either experimentally or reverse engineer interaction maps using computational techniques. These networks were usually created under a certain condition such as an environmental condition, a particular disease, or a specific tissue type. Lately, however, there has been greater emphasis on finding the differential structure of the existing network topology under a novel condition or disease status to elucidate the perturbation in a biological system. In this review/tutorial article we briefly mention some of the research done in this area; we mainly illustrate the computational/statistical methods developed by our team in recent years for differential network analysis using publicly available gene expression data collected from a well known cancer study. This data includes a group of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and a group with acute myeloid leukemia. In particular, we describe the statistical tests to detect the change in the network topology based on connectivity scores which measure the association or interaction between pairs of genes. The tests under various scores are applied to this data set to perform a differential network analysis on gene expression for human leukemia. We believe that, in the future, differential network analysis will be a standard way to view the changes in gene expression and protein expression data globally and these types of tests could be useful in analyzing the complex differential signatures.","['Gill, Ryan', 'Datta, Somnath', 'Datta, Susmita']","['Gill R', 'Datta S', 'Datta S']","['Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, 40202, USA. susmita.datta@louisville.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,,IM,"['*Biomedical Research', 'Computational Biology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Models, Theoretical', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics']",2013/03/28 06:00,2014/09/16 06:00,['2013/03/28 06:00'],"['2013/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['CPD-EPUB-20130319-9 [pii]', '10.2174/138161282001140113122316 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2014;20(1):4-10. doi: 10.2174/138161282001140113122316.,,,PMC4868626,,,"['R15 CA133844/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R15 CA170091/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA133844/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS783147'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that a humanized mAb specific for CD44 (RG7356) was directly cytotoxic for leukemia B cells, but had little effect on normal B cells. Moreover, RG7356 could induce CLL cells that expressed the zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP-70) to undergo caspase-dependent apoptosis, independent of complement or cytotoxic effector cells. The cytotoxic effect of this mAb was not mitigated when the CLL cells were cocultured with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) or hyaluronic acid or when they were stimulated via ligation of the B-cell receptor with anti-micro. RG7356 induced rapid internalization of CD44 on CLL cells at 37 degrees C, resulting in reduced expression of ZAP-70, which we found was complexed with CD44. Administration of this mAb at a concentration of 1 mg/kg to immune-deficient mice engrafted with human CLL cells resulted in complete clearance of engrafted leukemia cells. These studies indicate that this mAb might have therapeutic activity, particularly in patients with CLL that express ZAP-70.","['Zhang, Suping', 'Wu, Christina C N', 'Fecteau, Jessie-F', 'Cui, Bing', 'Chen, Liguang', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Wu, Rongrong', 'Rassenti, Laura', 'Lao, Fitzgerald', 'Weigand, Stefan', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Zhang S', 'Wu CC', 'Fecteau JF', 'Cui B', 'Chen L', 'Zhang L', 'Wu R', 'Rassenti L', 'Lao F', 'Weigand S', 'Kipps TJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of California at San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (RG7356)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*immunology', 'Apoptosis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phagocytosis', 'Temperature', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",2013/03/27 06:00,2013/07/16 06:00,['2013/03/27 06:00'],"['2013/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1221841110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1221841110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Apr 9;110(15):6127-32. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1221841110.

We conducted a validation study of the 12-gene recurrence score (RS), a quantitative assay integrating stromal response and cell cycle gene expression, in tumor specimens from patients enrolled onto Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9581. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CALGB 9581 randomly assigned 1,713 patients with stage II colon cancer to treatment with edrecolomab or observation and found no survival difference. The analysis reported here included all patients with available tissue and recurrence (n = 162) and a random (approximately 1:3) selection of nonrecurring patients. RS was assessed in 690 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples with quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction by using prespecified genes and a previously validated algorithm. Association of RS and recurrence was analyzed by weighted Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Continuous RS was significantly associated with risk of recurrence (P = .013) as was mismatch repair (MMR) gene deficiency (P = .044). In multivariate analyses, RS was the strongest predictor of recurrence (P = .004), independent of T stage, MMR, number of nodes examined, grade, and lymphovascular invasion. In T3 MMR-intact (MMR-I) patients, prespecified low and high RS groups had average 5-year recurrence risks of 13% (95% CI, 10% to 16%) and 21% (95% CI, 16% to 26%), respectively. CONCLUSION: The 12-gene RS predicts recurrence in stage II colon cancer in CALGB 9581. This is consistent with the importance of stromal response and cell cycle gene expression in colon tumor recurrence. RS appears to be most discerning for patients with T3 MMR-I tumors, although markers such as grade and lymphovascular invasion did not add value in this subset of patients.","['Venook, Alan P', 'Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Lopatin, Margarita', 'Ye, Xing', 'Lee, Mark', 'Friedman, Paula N', 'Frankel, Wendy', 'Clark-Langone, Kim', 'Millward, Carl', 'Shak, Steven', 'Goldberg, Richard M', 'Mahmoud, Najjia N', 'Warren, Robert S', 'Schilsky, Richard L', 'Bertagnolli, Monica M']","['Venook AP', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Lopatin M', 'Ye X', 'Lee M', 'Friedman PN', 'Frankel W', 'Clark-Langone K', 'Millward C', 'Shak S', 'Goldberg RM', 'Mahmoud NN', 'Warren RS', 'Schilsky RL', 'Bertagnolli MM']","['University of California San Francisco Cancer Center, 1600 Divisadero Street, San Francisco, CA 94115, USA. venook@cc.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Validation Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0KYI9U9FSJ (Edrecolomab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'DNA Mismatch Repair/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors']",2013/03/27 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2013/03/27 06:00'],"['2013/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2012.45.1096 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2012.45.1096 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 May 10;31(14):1775-81. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.45.1096.

Here we show that Arkadia contains three successive SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) that mediate noncovalent interaction with poly-SUMO2. We identify the third SIM (VVDL) of Arkadia to be the most relevant one in this interaction. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Arkadia can function as a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUBL) by ubiquitinating SUMO chains. While the SIMs of Arkadia are not essential for SnoN/Ski degradation in response to TGF-beta, we show that they are necessary for the interaction of Arkadia with polysumoylated PML in response to arsenic and its concomitant accumulation into PML nuclear bodies. Moreover, Arkadia depletion leads to accumulation of polysumoylated PML in response to arsenic, highlighting a requirement of Arkadia for arsenic-induced degradation of polysumoylated PML. Interestingly, Arkadia homodimerizes but does not heterodimerize with RNF4, the other STUBL involved in PML degradation, suggesting that these two E3 ligases do not act synergistically but most probably act independently during this process. Altogether, these results identify Arkadia to be a novel STUBL that can trigger degradation of signal-induced polysumoylated proteins.","['Erker, Yigit', 'Neyret-Kahn, Helene', 'Seeler, Jacob S', 'Dejean, Anne', 'Atfi, Azeddine', 'Levy, Laurence']","['Erker Y', 'Neyret-Kahn H', 'Seeler JS', 'Dejean A', 'Atfi A', 'Levy L']","['Laboratory of Cell Signaling and Carcinogenesis, INSERM UMR938, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNF4 protein, human)', '0 (SKIL protein, human)', '0 (SUMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (RNF111 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arsenic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/metabolism', 'Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism']",2013/03/27 06:00,2013/07/23 06:00,['2013/03/27 06:00'],"['2013/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.01019-12 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01019-12 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2013 Jun;33(11):2163-77. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01019-12.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to qualitatively assess the effects of diagnosis and treatment on patients with CML to offer recommendations for health-care providers (HCPs) for the better support of patients. METHODS: By use of an ethnographic approach based on in-home interviews, photo journals, and an optional telephone debriefing interview, this study included 50 patients with CML from Brazil, France, Germany, Russia, and Spain, including patients within 18 months of diagnosis and receiving frontline TKI therapy (n = 20), patients between >18 months and 7 years from diagnosis and receiving ongoing frontline therapy (n = 20), and patients who switched to second- or third-line TKI therapy (n = 10). In-home interviews were designed to address patient perceptions and experiences regarding such issues as adherence, disease knowledge, disease management, and relationships with HCPs. Transcripts from these interviews and other data were analyzed to identify similar patterns and themes experienced by patients with CML. RESULTS: The investigation generated a five-stage, patient-centered model of the experience of the patient throughout diagnosis, treatment, and management of CML: crisis, hope, adaptation, new normal, and uncertainty. Patients proceeded through these stages in the course of their disease management. The stages were affected by the patients' emotional and social experiences, their knowledge about CML, their positive experiences with their HCPs and/or treatment, and their optimism about their long-term prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: We identified five common stages experienced by patients with CML and suggest several recommendations for HCPs on the management of patients through their disease journey. By providing support, education, and reassurance, HCPs can help patients as they move through the early stages of crisis and hope. When patients are in the adaptation and new-normal stages, HCPs can help patients achieve and maintain a new normality by setting expectations for the risks/benefits of long-term chronic drug therapy and disease monitoring and by continuing to support patient adherence.","['Guilhot, Francois', 'Coombs, John', 'Szczudlo, Tomasz', 'Zernovak, Oleg', 'Paolantonio, Marc', 'Bender, Christina', 'Macdonald, Nancy J', 'Shapiro, Ari']","['Guilhot F', 'Coombs J', 'Szczudlo T', 'Zernovak O', 'Paolantonio M', 'Bender C', 'Macdonald NJ', 'Shapiro A']","['CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",New Zealand,Patient,The patient,101309314,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anthropology, Cultural', 'Brazil', '*Disease Management', 'Emotions', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*psychology', 'Life Change Events', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Qualitative Research', '*Social Support', 'Uncertainty']",2013/03/27 06:00,2013/08/03 06:00,['2013/03/27 06:00'],"['2013/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40271-013-0006-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Patient. 2013;6(2):81-92. doi: 10.1007/s40271-013-0006-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed 478 patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). All patients were divided into five subgroups according to the percentage of blasts: <2 % (n = 361), >/=2 to<3 % (n = 64), >/=3 to <5 % (n = 28), >/=5 to <12 % (n = 11), and >/=12 % (n = 4). After a median follow-up of 59.5 months (range 3.3-125.9 months) for survivors, patients with higher marrow blasts at transplant showed lower overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). In multivariate analyses, OS and DFS did not show significant differences with blast counts up to 12 %, compared with blast counts of <2 %; by contrast, the presence of >12 % marrow blasts was associated with significantly poorer OS and DFS. In the separate multivariate analyses by cytogenetic risk group, the impact of >12 % marrow blast on survival outcomes was observed in all risk groups. Thus, pre-transplant bone marrow status is an important prognostic factor for AML patients. In addition, the higher relapse rate in patients with >12 % marrow blasts may provide insights into the tolerable blast cell burden that can be overcome by the graft-versus leukemia effect.","['Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Shin, Seung-Hwan', 'Yahng, Seung-Ah', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Eom, Ki-Seong', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Lee, Seok', 'Cho, Seok-Goo', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Lee, Jong-Wook', 'Min, Woo-Sung', 'Park, Chong-Won', 'Kim, Myungshin', 'Lim, Jihyang', 'Kim, Yonggoo', 'Han, Kyungja', 'Kim, Hee-Je']","['Lee SE', 'Yoon JH', 'Shin SH', 'Yahng SA', 'Cho BS', 'Eom KS', 'Kim YJ', 'Min CK', 'Lee S', 'Cho SG', 'Kim DW', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS', 'Park CW', 'Kim M', 'Lim J', 'Kim Y', 'Han K', 'Kim HJ']","[""Department of Hematology, Catholic BMT Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, #505, Banpo-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul 137-701, Korea.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/27 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/03/27 06:00'],"['2013/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-013-1312-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2013 May;97(5):640-9. doi: 10.1007/s12185-013-1312-1.

Previous risk assessments were extended by considering uncertainties in radiation-related leukemia risk model parameters as part of this process, within a Bayesian framework. Estimated red bone marrow doses cumulated during childhood by the average French child due to radon, terrestrial gamma and cosmic rays are 4.4, 7.5 and 4.3 mSv, respectively. The excess fractions of cases (expressed as percentages) associated with these sources of natural radiation are 20 % [95 % credible interval (CI) 0-68 %] and 4 % (95 % CI 0-11 %) under the excess relative and excess absolute risk models, respectively. The large CIs, as well as the different point estimates obtained under these two models, highlight the uncertainties in predictions of radiation-related childhood leukemia risks. These results are only valid provided that models developed from the LSS can be transferred to the population of French children and to chronic natural radiation exposures, and must be considered in view of the currently limited knowledge concerning other potential risk factors for childhood leukemia. Last, they emphasize the need for further epidemiological investigations of the effects of natural radiation on childhood leukemia to reduce uncertainties and help refine radiation protection standards.","['Laurent, Olivier', 'Ancelet, Sophie', 'Richardson, David B', 'Hemon, Denis', 'Ielsch, Geraldine', 'Demoury, Claire', 'Clavel, Jacqueline', 'Laurier, Dominique']","['Laurent O', 'Ancelet S', 'Richardson DB', 'Hemon D', 'Ielsch G', 'Demoury C', 'Clavel J', 'Laurier D']","['Radiobiology and Epidemiology Department, IRSN, PRP-HOM, SRBE, LEPID, French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, Fontenay aux Roses, France. olaurent@uci.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,['Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)'],IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cosmic Radiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Gamma Rays/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', '*Models, Biological', 'Radon/*adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment']",2013/03/27 06:00,2013/10/29 06:00,['2013/03/27 06:00'],"['2012/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00411-013-0464-y [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2013 May;52(2):195-209. doi: 10.1007/s00411-013-0464-y.

An open-label, prospective study was conducted with 48 adults receiving induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients received a single infusion of 15 mg/kg of body weight L-AmB and, eventually, a second dose after 15 days of persistent neutropenia. The primary objective was tolerability and safety. Efficacy was also evaluated as a secondary endpoint. A pharmacokinetic study was performed with 34 patients in order to evaluate any association of plasma L-AmB levels with toxicity and efficacy. Overall, only 6 patients (12.5%) reported Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 3 hypokalemia, which was corrected with potassium supplementation in all cases, and no patient developed clinically relevant nephrotoxicity. Mild infusion-related adverse events occurred after 6 of 53 (11.3%) total infusions, with permanent drug discontinuation in only one case. Proven invasive fungal disease (IFD) was diagnosed in 4 (8.3%) patients. The mean AmB plasma levels at 6 h, 24 h, and 7 days after L-AmB administration were 160, 49.5, and 1 mg/liter, respectively. The plasma AmB levels were higher than the mean values of the overall population in 3 patients who developed CTC grade 3 hypokalemia and did not significantly differ from the mean values of the overall population in 3 patients who developed IFD. Our experience demonstrates the feasibility and safety of a single 15-mg/kg L-AmB dose as antifungal prophylaxis in AML patients undergoing induction chemotherapy.","['Annino, Luciana', 'Chierichini, Anna', 'Anaclerico, Barbara', 'Finolezzi, Erica', 'Norata, Marianna', 'Cortese, Stefania', 'Cassetta, Maria Iris', 'Fallani, Stefania', 'Novelli, Andrea', 'Girmenia, Corrado']","['Annino L', 'Chierichini A', 'Anaclerico B', 'Finolezzi E', 'Norata M', 'Cortese S', 'Cassetta MI', 'Fallani S', 'Novelli A', 'Girmenia C']","['Unita di Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera San Giovanni Addolorata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (liposomal amphotericin B)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2013/03/27 06:00,2013/10/26 06:00,['2013/03/27 06:00'],"['2013/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['AAC.00155-13 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.00155-13 [doi]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Jun;57(6):2596-602. doi: 10.1128/AAC.00155-13.

However, it has exhibited to be less efficient for the non-promyelocytic leukaemia or other types of malignant tumors. The purpose of the present study was to explore new therapeutic strategies based on As2O3 for human multiple myeloma. Here, we first report cryptotanshinone (CPT) and As2O3 synergy for enhanced cytotoxicity in human multiple myeloma U266 cells. In particular, the apoptosis related proteins (e.g., cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase-3 and -9) were significantly increased by the combination treatment (iAs(III) + CPT), whereas, the expression of survival proteins such as Bcl-2 and survivin was suppressed, suggesting that the induction of apoptosis through mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway. In addition, there were no appreciable effects observed in cells after exposure to either As2O3 or CPT alone. In order to better understand the molecular mechanism, we further determined the phosphorylation of STAT3, JNK, ERK and p38. Interestingly, phosphorylation of JNK and p38 were remarkably induced by combination treatment, and no significant inhibition of STAT3 or ERK was observed. In addition, induction of apoptosis in human multiple myeloma cells was partially abrogated only by pretreatment with JNK inhibitor and not by p38 inhibitor, suggesting that JNK pathway may play an important role in induction of apoptosis by the combination of iAs(III) and CPT. Further studies are needed to evaluate this synergistic anticancer effect in vivo. In the near future, this new approach might be used clinically for multiple myeloma (MM) treatment.","['Liu, Pei', 'Xu, Shi', 'Zhang, Min', 'Wang, Wen Wen', 'Zhang, Yan Fang', 'Rehman, Kanwal', 'Naranmandura, Hua', 'Chen, Zhe']","['Liu P', 'Xu S', 'Zhang M', 'Wang WW', 'Zhang YF', 'Rehman K', 'Naranmandura H', 'Chen Z']","['Zhejiang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Metallomics,Metallomics : integrated biometal science,101478346,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '5E9SXT166N (cryptotanshinone)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology']",2013/03/27 06:00,2014/01/28 06:00,['2013/03/27 06:00'],"['2013/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c3mt20272k [doi]'],ppublish,Metallomics. 2013 Jun;5(7):871-8. doi: 10.1039/c3mt20272k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study comprising data from five Southern and Eastern European Cancer Registries aims to compare time trends and examine whether sociodemographic variables, clinical parameters, and proxies of efficient care affect survival. METHODS: Data spanning 1996-2010 were obtained for a total of 3,041 newly diagnosed childhood leukemia and 1,183 lymphoma cases reported by the Greek Nationwide Registry for Childhood Hematological Malignancies, Bulgarian National Cancer Registry, Moscow Region and Turkey (Antalya and Izmir) Cancer Registries. Poisson modeling for the evaluation of time trends and multivariate Cox regression analysis for the assessment of prognostic factors were performed. RESULTS: The incidence of leukemia was increasing in all cases, with Bulgaria and Greece presenting statistically significant annual changes (+3.5, and +1.7 %, respectively), followed by marginally increasing trends in Izmir and Moscow; by contrast, there was a remarkable, statistically significant, decreasing mortality trend for leukemia. Rates for lymphoma remained flat. Greece experienced almost twofold better survival rates for both leukemia and lymphoma, probably due to its higher socioeconomic status during the study period. Overall, patients with leukemia living in rural areas had a 28 % lower prognosis (RR: 1.28, 95 % CI 1.03-1.59), pointing to effects of remoteness, when the most privileged country (Greece) was excluded from the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The favorable mortality trends highlight the progress in Southern-Eastern European countries along their trajectory to converge with Northern-Western EU counterpart states. Socioeconomic status may act as a multipotent factor underlying the study findings.","['Petridou, Eleni Th', 'Dimitrova, Nadya', 'Eser, Sultan', 'Kachanov, Denis', 'Karakilinc, Hulya', 'Varfolomeeva, Svetlana', 'Belechri, Maria', 'Baka, Margarita', 'Moschovi, Maria', 'Polychronopoulou, Sofia', 'Athanasiadou-Piperopoulou, Fani', 'Fragandrea, Ioanna', 'Stiakaki, Eftichia', 'Pourtsidis, Apostolos', 'Stefanadis, Christodoulos', 'Coebergh, Jan-Willem', 'Sergentanis, Theodoros N']","['Petridou ET', 'Dimitrova N', 'Eser S', 'Kachanov D', 'Karakilinc H', 'Varfolomeeva S', 'Belechri M', 'Baka M', 'Moschovi M', 'Polychronopoulou S', 'Athanasiadou-Piperopoulou F', 'Fragandrea I', 'Stiakaki E', 'Pourtsidis A', 'Stefanadis C', 'Coebergh JW', 'Sergentanis TN']","['Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Athens University Medical School, 75 M.

The objective of this study was to generate a novel humanized chimeric protein with human DFF40 fused with GM-CSF for targeting acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. cDNA cloning of human DFF40 and GM-CSF was done and the chimeric gene GM-CSF-DFF40 was generated by overlap extension PCR. The fusion protein was expressed in E.coli, purified, refolded and characterized. In vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated on various AML cell lines. Treated cell lines were screened for various morphological and biochemical changes that are characteristic of apoptosis, by different assays like annexin V-FITC staining, TUNEL assay, JC-1 staining and immunocytochemistry of pro-apoptotic proteins and caspases. Cell cycle analysis of treated cells was done to quantify the percentage of apoptotic cells. The chimeric protein was found to be cytotoxic to AML cells in a dose and time dependent manner. Morphological changes such as formation of apoptotic bodies were revealed by microscopic examination of treated cells after staining. Immunocytochemical staining demonstrated biochemical changes such as changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial co-localization of Bax, cytochrome c release, presence of activated caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation. FACS analysis proved the presence of apoptotic cells following treatment. The chimeric protein GM-CSF-DFF40 was found to mediate targeted killing of AML cells by inducing apoptosis. Thus, this chimeric construct can act as a prospective candidate for targeted therapy of AML and other malignancies where GM-CSF receptor expression is upregulated.","['Mathew, Mrudula', 'Zaineb, K C', 'Verma, Rama Shanker']","['Mathew M', 'Zaineb KC', 'Verma RS']","['Stem Cell and Molecular Biology Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.- (DFFB protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Deoxyribonucleases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Refolding', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction']",2013/03/27 06:00,2013/12/24 06:00,['2013/03/27 06:00'],"['2013/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-013-0840-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2013 Jul;18(7):882-95. doi: 10.1007/s10495-013-0840-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored the feasibility of generating TAA-specific CTLs from stem cell donors of patients with myeloid leukemia to enhance the graft-versus-leukemia effect after stem cell transplantation. CTL lines were manufactured from peripheral blood of 10 healthy donors by stimulation with 15mer peptide libraries of five TAA (proteinase 3 (Pr3), preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma, Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1), human neutrophil elastase (NE) and melanoma-associated antigen A3) known to be expressed in myeloid leukemias. All CTL lines responded to the mix of five TAA and were multi-specific as assessed by interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot. Although donors showed individual patterns of antigen recognition, all responded comparably to the TAAmix. Immunogenic peptides of WT1, Pr3 or NE could be identified by epitope mapping in all donor CTL lines. In vitro experiments showed recognition of partially human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched myeloid leukemia blasts. These findings support the development of a single clinical grade multi-tumor antigen-specific T-cell product from the stem cell source, capable of broad reactivity against myeloid malignancies for use in donor-recipient pairs without limitation to a certain HLA-type.","['Weber, G', 'Gerdemann, U', 'Caruana, I', 'Savoldo, B', 'Hensel, N F', 'Rabin, K R', 'Shpall, E J', 'Melenhorst, J J', 'Leen, A M', 'Barrett, A J', 'Bollard, C M']","['Weber G', 'Gerdemann U', 'Caruana I', 'Savoldo B', 'Hensel NF', 'Rabin KR', 'Shpall EJ', 'Melenhorst JJ', 'Leen AM', 'Barrett AJ', 'Bollard CM']","[""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, The Methodist Hospital and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Elastase/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Myeloblastin/immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*cytology/*immunology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'WT1 Proteins/immunology']",2013/03/27 06:00,2013/09/17 06:00,['2013/03/27 06:00'],"['2012/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201366 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.66 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Jul;27(7):1538-47. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.66.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and myeloid leukemia are the major causes of cancer related morbidity and mortality in Fanconi anemia patients. METHODS: We investigated the effect of a nutrient mixture on Fanconi Anemia human fibroblast cell lines FA-A:PD20 and FA-A:PD220 on matrix metalloproteinase expression, invasion, cell proliferation, morphology and apoptosis. The cell lines were grown in a modified Dulbecco's Eagle medium and at near confluence were treated with the nutrient mixture at increasing doses: 0; 10; 50; 100; 500; 1000 microg/ml. The cells were also treated with PMA to induce MMP-9 expression. RESULTS: Zymography demonstrated MMP-2 and PMA-induced MMP-9 activity. The nutrient mixture inhibited expression of both, MMP-2 and MMP-9, in a dose dependent manner with virtually total inhibition observed at 500 microg/ml. Matrigel invasion was inhibited in both cells lines; with 100% inhibition for FA-A:PD20 at 500 microg/ml and 100% inhibition of FA-A:P220 cells at 100 microg/ml. H&E staining did not indicate any change in cell morphology and causes apoptosis at higher doses. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that the nutrient mixture inhibited matrix metalloproteinase expression, invasion and induced apoptosis, the important parameters for cancer prevention. The results suggest that the nutrient mixture may have therapeutic potential in Fanconi Anemia associated neoplasia.","['Roomi, M W', 'Roomi, N W', 'Bhanap, B', 'Niedzwiecki, A', 'Rath, M']","['Roomi MW', 'Roomi NW', 'Bhanap B', 'Niedzwiecki A', 'Rath M']","['Dr. Rath Research Institute, Cancer Division, Santa Clara, CA-95050, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Tea)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (MMP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (MMP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arginine/pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Fanconi Anemia/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Lysine/pharmacology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/biosynthesis', 'Proline/pharmacology', '*Tea']",2013/03/27 06:00,2014/01/07 06:00,['2013/03/27 06:00'],"['2013/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['4521 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2013 Mar;35(1):20-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the gender ratio at presentation in ALL in India, we used a three-prong approach: (i) center audit, (ii) systematic review of published studies on ALL in India, and (iii) assessment of population based registry data. Data on gender at presentation in ALL were extracted from these multiple sources. In our center audit, we observed a significantly higher of male:female (M:F) ratio of 3.16:1 (P = .046) in ALL as compared to world literature. In the systematic review of all ALL studies from India, 367 articles were identified and reviewed. A total of 4230 and 1843 boys and girls in these studies were assessed and the M:F ratio was 2.503:1; much higher than the world ratio but not significantly different (P = .10). Population-based data obtained from the National Cancer Registry Program also depicted a male preponderance, especially from large cities in India in a consistent manner since 1984. There is also significant (P = .025) interregional variation in the gender ratio in India. Our study clearly demonstrates a consistent male preponderance in childhood ALL in India along with significant interregional variations over the last three decades. There is a clear need of prospective nationwide multicenter assessment of high-resolution data to confirm this important observation and assess its implications, especially on the health care system.","['Kulkarni, Ketan Prasad', 'Marwaha, Ram Kumar']","['Kulkarni KP', 'Marwaha RK']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Stollery Children Hospital, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. ketanpkulkarni@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Sex Characteristics', 'Sex Factors', '*Tertiary Care Centers']",2013/03/27 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/03/27 06:00'],"['2013/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2013.779768 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2013 Sep;30(6):557-67. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2013.779768.

It remains to be established whether chimeric antigen receptor T cells have clinical activity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Two children with relapsed and refractory pre-B-cell ALL received infusions of T cells transduced with anti-CD19 antibody and a T-cell signaling molecule (CTL019 chimeric antigen receptor T cells), at a dose of 1.4x10(6) to 1.2x10(7) CTL019 cells per kilogram of body weight. In both patients, CTL019 T cells expanded to a level that was more than 1000 times as high as the initial engraftment level, and the cells were identified in bone marrow. In addition, the chimeric antigen receptor T cells were observed in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where they persisted at high levels for at least 6 months. Eight grade 3 or 4 adverse events were noted. The cytokine-release syndrome and B-cell aplasia developed in both patients. In one child, the cytokine-release syndrome was severe; cytokine blockade with etanercept and tocilizumab was effective in reversing the syndrome and did not prevent expansion of chimeric antigen receptor T cells or reduce antileukemic efficacy. Complete remission was observed in both patients and is ongoing in one patient at 11 months after treatment. The other patient had a relapse, with blast cells that no longer expressed CD19, approximately 2 months after treatment. Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells are capable of killing even aggressive, treatment-refractory acute leukemia cells in vivo. The emergence of tumor cells that no longer express the target indicates a need to target other molecules in addition to CD19 in some patients with ALL.","['Grupp, Stephan A', 'Kalos, Michael', 'Barrett, David', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Porter, David L', 'Rheingold, Susan R', 'Teachey, David T', 'Chew, Anne', 'Hauck, Bernd', 'Wright, J Fraser', 'Milone, Michael C', 'Levine, Bruce L', 'June, Carl H']","['Grupp SA', 'Kalos M', 'Barrett D', 'Aplenc R', 'Porter DL', 'Rheingold SR', 'Teachey DT', 'Chew A', 'Hauck B', 'Wright JF', 'Milone MC', 'Levine BL', 'June CH']","[""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (S.A.G., D.B., R.A., S.R.R., D.T.T., B.H., J.F.W.);

Rai stage 0 identifies patients with early stage CLL for which there is no effective intervention at the present time and a ""wait and see"" policy is usually adopted. Some biological and clinical studies have reported that green tea constituents, such as epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG), have antitumor effects on hematologic malignancies including CLL. We report data on a clinical trial in which green tea extracts were given orally to 12 patients with stage 0 CLL and 12 healthy subjects. Ten patients and 10 controls completed the 6-month scheduled therapy. Two patients and 2 controls stopped therapy within 1 month because of tachycardia and epigastralgia. Eight out 10 evaluable patients (80 percent) showed a reduction of lymphocytosis and absolute number of circulating Tregs, as well. One patient (10 percent) had a stabilization of lymphocytosis and a reduction of Tregs, and 1 patient (10 percent) showed an increase of both lymphocytosis and Tregs. Only the non-responding patient progressed after 5 months from the end of green tea administration and chemotherapy was given. Interestingly, both IL-10 and TGF-beta serum levels declined throughout the green tea intake period, in both patients and controls. These data seem to indicate that green tea is able to modulate circulating Tregs in CLL patients with early stage of the disease. This can result in the control of lymphocytosis as well as in the prevention of disease progression.","[""D'Arena, G"", 'Simeon, V', 'De Martino, L', 'Statuto, T', ""D'Auria, F"", 'Volpe, S', 'Deaglio, S', 'Maidecchi, A', 'Mattoli, L', 'Mercati, V', 'Musto, P', 'De Feo, V']","[""D'Arena G"", 'Simeon V', 'De Martino L', 'Statuto T', ""D'Auria F"", 'Volpe S', 'Deaglio S', 'Maidecchi A', 'Mattoli L', 'Mercati V', 'Musto P', 'De Feo V']","['IRCCS Centro di Riferimento Oncologico della Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,8911335,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Caffeine/analysis', '*Camellia sinensis', 'Catechin/analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-10/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*drug effects/immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/blood']",2013/03/27 06:00,2013/09/11 06:00,['2013/03/27 06:00'],"['2013/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['11 [pii]', '10.1177/039463201302600111 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol. 2013 Jan-Mar;26(1):117-25. doi: 10.1177/039463201302600111.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It yields large amounts of high-dimensional data, the analysis of which would clearly benefit from efficient computational approaches aiming at automated diagnosis and decision support. This article presents our analysis of flow cytometry data in the framework of the DREAM6/FlowCAP2 Molecular Classification of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Challenge, 2011. In the challenge, example data was provided for a set of 179 subjects, comprising healthy donors and 23 cases of AML. The participants were asked to provide predictions with respect to the condition of 180 patients in a test set. We extracted feature vectors from the data in terms of single marker statistics, including characteristic moments, median and interquartile range of the observed values. Subsequently, we applied Generalized Matrix Relevance Learning Vector Quantization (GMLVQ), a machine learning technique which extends standard LVQ by an adaptive distance measure. Our method achieved the best possible performance with respect to the diagnoses of test set patients. The extraction of features from the flow cytometry data is outlined in detail, the machine learning approach is discussed and classification results are presented. In addition, we illustrate how GMLVQ can provide deeper insight into the problem by allowing to infer the relevance of specific markers and features for the diagnosis.","['Biehl, Michael', 'Bunte, Kerstin', 'Schneider, Petra']","['Biehl M', 'Bunte K', 'Schneider P']","['Johann Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. m.biehl@rug.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['*Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomarkers', 'Computational Biology/*methods', '*Decision Support Techniques', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis']",2013/03/26 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2012/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0059401 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-11173 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e59401. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0059401.

This classification was based on available sequence data that mainly represented the BLV population that is circulating in cattle from the US and South America. In order to aid with a global perspective inclusion of data from Eastern Europe is required. In this study we examined 44 BLV isolates from different geographical regions of Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. Phylogenetic analysis based on a 444bp fragment of env gene revealed that most of isolates belonged to genotypes 4 and 7. Furthermore, we confirmed the existence of a new genotype, genotype 8, which was highly supported by phylogenetic computations. A significant number of amino acid substitutions were found in the sequences of the studied Eastern European isolates, of which 71% have not been described previously. The substitutions encompassed mainly the C-part of the CD4+ epitope, zinc binding peptide region, CD8+ T cell epitope, and overlapping linear epitope E. These observations highlight the use of sequence data to both elucidate phylogenetic relationships and the potential effect on serological detection of geographically diverse isolates.","['Rola-Luszczak, Marzena', 'Pluta, Aneta', 'Olech, Monika', 'Donnik, Irina', 'Petropavlovskiy, Maxim', 'Gerilovych, Anton', 'Vinogradova, Irina', 'Choudhury, Bhudipa', 'Kuzmak, Jacek']","['Rola-Luszczak M', 'Pluta A', 'Olech M', 'Donnik I', 'Petropavlovskiy M', 'Gerilovych A', 'Vinogradova I', 'Choudhury B', 'Kuzmak J']","['Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy, Poland. mrolka@piwet.pulawy.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/genetics', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/virology', 'Epitopes/genetics', 'Europe, Eastern', 'Genes, env', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Siberia']",2013/03/26 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2012/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0058705 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-30111 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e58705. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0058705.

However, in contrast to canonical lipid-kinase functions, the role of PI3K protein kinase activity in regulating cell survival is unknown. We have employed a novel approach to purify and pharmacologically profile protein kinases from primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells that phosphorylate serine residues in the cytoplasmic portion of cytokine receptors to promote hemopoietic cell survival. We have isolated a kinase activity that is able to directly phosphorylate Ser585 in the cytoplasmic domain of the interleukin 3 (IL-3) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptors and shown it to be PI3K. Physiological concentrations of cytokine in the picomolar range were sufficient for activating the protein kinase activity of PI3K leading to Ser585 phosphorylation and hemopoietic cell survival but did not activate PI3K lipid kinase signaling or promote proliferation. Blockade of PI3K lipid signaling by expression of the pleckstrin homology of Akt1 had no significant impact on the ability of picomolar concentrations of cytokine to promote hemopoietic cell survival. Furthermore, inducible expression of a mutant form of PI3K that is defective in lipid kinase activity but retains protein kinase activity was able to promote Ser585 phosphorylation and hemopoietic cell survival in the absence of cytokine. Blockade of p110alpha by RNA interference or multiple independent PI3K inhibitors not only blocked Ser585 phosphorylation in cytokine-dependent cells and primary human AML blasts, but also resulted in a block in survival signaling and cell death. Our findings demonstrate a new role for the protein kinase activity of PI3K in phosphorylating the cytoplasmic tail of the GM-CSF and IL-3 receptors to selectively regulate cell survival highlighting the importance of targeting such pathways in cancer.","['Thomas, Daniel', 'Powell, Jason A', 'Green, Benjamin D', 'Barry, Emma F', 'Ma, Yuefang', 'Woodcock, Joanna', 'Fitter, Stephen', 'Zannettino, Andrew C W', 'Pitson, Stuart M', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Lopez, Angel F', 'Shepherd, Peter R', 'Wei, Andrew H', 'Ekert, Paul G', 'Guthridge, Mark A']","['Thomas D', 'Powell JA', 'Green BD', 'Barry EF', 'Ma Y', 'Woodcock J', 'Fitter S', 'Zannettino AC', 'Pitson SM', 'Hughes TP', 'Lopez AF', 'Shepherd PR', 'Wei AH', 'Ekert PG', 'Guthridge MA']","['Cell Growth and Differentiation Laboratory, Division of Human Immunology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Biol,PLoS biology,101183755,"['0 (Cytokines)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology']",2013/03/26 06:00,2013/09/06 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2012/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pbio.1001515 [doi]', 'PBIOLOGY-D-12-04808 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Biol. 2013;11(3):e1001515. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001515.

PML deficiency occurs commonly in a broad spectrum of human cancers through mechanisms that involve its aberrant ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, several viruses encode viral proteins that promote viral replication through degradation of PML. These observations suggest that restoration of PML should lead to potent antitumor effects or antiviral responses. In this review we will summarize the mechanisms involved in PML degradation with the intent to highlight novel therapeutic strategies to trigger PML restoration.","['Rabellino, Andrea', 'Scaglioni, Pier Paolo']","['Rabellino A', 'Scaglioni PP']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2013/03/26 06:00,2013/03/26 06:01,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2013/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2013.00060 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2013 Mar 22;3:60. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2013.00060. eCollection 2013.,20130322,,PMC3605509,,,['R01 CA137195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['NOTNLM'],"['PML', 'degradation', 'sumoylation', 'tumor suppressor', 'ubiquitination']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ponatinib (AP24534) is an oral ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is in advanced clinical experimentation in leukemia. OBJECTIVE: We tested whether ponatinib inhibited RET kinase and oncogenic activity. METHODS: Ponatinib activity was studied by an in vitro RET immunocomplex kinase assay and immunoblotting. The effects of ponatinib on proliferation of human TT, MZ-CRC-1, and TPC-1 thyroid carcinoma cells, which harbor endogenous oncogenic RET alleles, and of NIH3T3 fibroblasts transfected with oncogenic RET mutants were determined. Ponatinib activity on TT cell xenografted tumors in athymic mice was measured. RESULTS: Ponatinib inhibited immunopurified RET kinase at the IC(5)(0) of 25.8 nM (95% confidence interval [CI] = 23.15-28.77 nM). It also inhibited (IC(5)(0) = 33.9 nM; 95% CI = 26.41-43.58 nM) kinase activity of RET/V804M, a RET mutant displaying resistance to other tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Ponatinib blunted phosphorylation of point-mutant and rearranged RET-derived oncoproteins and inhibited proliferation of RET-transformed fibroblasts and RET mutant thyroid carcinoma cells. Finally, after 3 weeks of treatment with ponatinib (30 mg/kg/d), the volume of TT cell (medullary thyroid carcinoma) xenografts was reduced from 133 mm(3) to an unmeasurable size (difference = 133 mm(3), 95% CI = -83 to 349 mm(3)) (P < .001). Ponatinib-treated TT cell tumors displayed a reduction in the mitotic index, RET phosphorylation, and signaling.

These cells interfere with normal hematopoiesis, can escape into the peripheral blood, and infiltrate CSF and lung. It is likely that many different mutations, epigenetic aberrations, or abnormalities in micro RNA expression can produce the same morphologic disease with these differences responsible for the very variable response to therapy, which is AMLs principal feature. DIAGNOSIS: This rests on demonstration that the marrow or blood has > 20% blasts of myeloid lineage. Blast lineage is assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry, with CD33 and CD13 being surface markers typically expressed by myeloid blasts. It should be realized that clinical/prognostic considerations, not the blast % per se, should be the main factor determining how a patient is treated. RISK STRATIFICATION: Two features determine risk: the probability of treatment-related mortality (TRM) and, more important, even in patients aged >75 with Zubrod performance status 1, the probability of resistance to standard therapy despite not incurring TRM. The chief predictor of resistance is cytogenetics, with a monosomal karyotype (MK) denoting the disease is essentially incurable with standard therapy even if followed by a standard allogeneic transplant (HCT). The most common cytogentic finding is a normal karyotype(NK) and those of such patients with an NPM1 mutation but no FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD), or with a CEBPA mutation, have a prognosis similar to that of patients with the most favorable cytogenetics (inv 16 or t[8;21]) (60-70% cure rate). In contrast, NK patients with a FLT3 ITD have only a 30-40% chance of cure even after HCT. Accordingly analyses of NPM1, FLT3, and CEBPA should be part of routine evaluation, much as is cytogenetics. Risk is best assessed considering several variables simultaneously rather than, for example, only age. Increasing evidence indicates that other mutations and abnormalities in microRNA (miRNA) expression also affect resistance as do post treatment factors, in particular the presence of minimal residual disease. These newer mutations and MRD are discussed in this update. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Patients with inv (16) or t(8;21) or who are NPM1+/FLT3ITD-can receive standard therapy (daunorubicin + cytarabine) and should not receive HCT in first CR. It seems likely that use of a daily daunorubicin dose of 90 mg/m(2) will further improve outcome in these patients. There appears no reason to use doses of cytarabine > 1 g/m(2) (for example bid X 6 days), as opposed to the more commonly used 3 g/m(2) . Patients with an unfavorable karyotype (particularly MK) are unlikely to benefit from standard therapy (even with dose escalation) and are thus prime candidates for clinical trials of new drugs or new approaches to HCT; the latter should be done in first CR. Patients with intermediate prognoses (for example NK and NPM and FLT3ITD negative) should also receive HCT in first CR and can plausibly receive either investigational or standard induction therapy, with the same prognostic information about standard therapy leading one patient to choose the standard and another an investigational option. This update discusses results with newer agents: quizartinib and crenolanib, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, clofarabine and cladribine, azacitidine and decitabine, volasertib, and means to prevent relapse after allogeneic transplant. The diagnosis of AML essentially is made as it was in 2012. Thus this review will emphasize new developments in risk stratification and treatment using as references many papers published in 2012.","['Estey, Elihu H']",['Estey EH'],"['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA. eestey@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', '*Disease Management', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Risk Assessment', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2013/03/26 06:00,2013/05/11 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2013/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23404 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Apr;88(4):318-27. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23404.,,"['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the design of in vivo models ideally utilizing patient-derived material is of critical importance. In this regard, NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid) IL2rg(tmWjl) /Sz (NSG) mice have been reported to provide superior engraftment rates. However, limited data exist on the validity of such a model to constitute a surrogate marker for clinical parameters. We studied primary and serial engraftment on more than 200 NSG mice with 54 primary pediatric B cell precursor acute lymphatic leukemia (B-ALL), myeloid leukemia (AML) and T cell leukemia (T-ALL) samples, characterized the leukemogenic profile and correlated engraftment kinetics with clinical outcome. Median time to engraftment was 7-10 weeks and 90% of the mice engrafted. Male recipients conferred significantly higher engraftment levels than female recipients (p </= 0.004). PCR-based minimal residual disease marker expression and fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of patient-specific genetic aberrations in mice. Transcriptome cluster analysis of genes known to be important in the leukemogenesis of all three diseases revealed that well-known tumor-regulating genes were expressed to a comparable extent in mice and men. The extent of engraftment and overall survival of NSG mice highly correlated with the individual prognosis of B-ALL, AML and T-ALL patients. Thus, we propose an in vivo model that provides a valuable preclinical tool to explore the heterogeneity of leukemic disease and exploit patient-tailored leukemia-targeting strategies within multivariate analyses.","['Woiterski, Jeanette', 'Ebinger, Martin', 'Witte, Kai E', 'Goecke, Barbara', 'Heininger, Vanessa', 'Philippek, Martin', 'Bonin, Michael', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Rottgers, Silja', 'Herr, Wolfgang', 'Lang, Peter', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Hartwig, Udo F', 'Andre, Maya C']","['Woiterski J', 'Ebinger M', 'Witte KE', 'Goecke B', 'Heininger V', 'Philippek M', 'Bonin M', 'Schrauder A', 'Rottgers S', 'Herr W', 'Lang P', 'Handgretinger R', 'Hartwig UF', 'Andre MC']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/deficiency/genetics', '*Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', '*Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcriptome', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2013/03/26 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2012/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.28170 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2013 Oct 1;133(7):1547-56. doi: 10.1002/ijc.28170.

Management typically depends on the clinical diagnosis with few microbiological data. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of consecutive hematologic patients with hepatic or splenic lesions in the infectious diseases unit from April 2009 to December 2010 at the Catholic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center in Korea. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were identified. Their mean age was 46.0 +/- 14.7 years, and 16 (61.5%) were male. Underlying diseases were acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 15, 57.7%) and myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 6, 23.1%). Among the nine nontuberculous infectious lesions, two bacterial, six fungal, and one combined infection were identified. The numbers of confirmed, probable, and possible tuberculosis (TB) cases were one, three, and four, respectively. Two patients had concurrent pulmonary TB. QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT, Cellestis Ltd.) was positive in seven cases, among which six were diagnosed with TB. The sensitivity and specificity of QFT-GIT were 75% and 81.3%. Nine (34.6%) were defined as noninfectious causes. CONCLUSIONS: Causes of hepatic or splenic lesion in hematologic patients were diverse including TB, non-TB organisms, and noninfectious origins. TB should be considered for patients not responding to antibacterial or antifungal drugs, even in the absence of direct microbiological evidence. QFT-GIT may be useful for a differential diagnosis of hepatosplenic lesions in hematologic patients.","['Kwon, Jae-Cheol', 'Kim, Si-Hyun', 'Park, Sun Hee', 'Choi, Su-Mi', 'Lee, Dong-Gun', 'Choi, Jung-Hyun', 'Yoo, Jin-Hong', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Lee, Seok', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Cho, Seok-Goo', 'Lee, Jong-Wook', 'Min, Woo-Sung']","['Kwon JC', 'Kim SH', 'Park SH', 'Choi SM', 'Lee DG', 'Choi JH', 'Yoo JH', 'Kim YJ', 'Lee S', 'Kim HJ', 'Cho SG', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, National Health Insurance Corporation Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Korean J Intern Med,The Korean journal of internal medicine,8712418,['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)'],IM,"['Abscess/*diagnosis/microbiology/mortality/therapy', 'Adult', 'Anti-Infective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*complications/mortality', 'Humans', '*Interferon-gamma Release Tests', 'Liver Abscess/*diagnosis/microbiology/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Republic of Korea', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Splenic Diseases/*diagnosis/microbiology/mortality/therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Tuberculosis/*diagnosis/microbiology/mortality/therapy']",2013/03/26 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3904/kjim.2013.28.2.187 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Intern Med. 2013 Mar;28(2):187-96. doi: 10.3904/kjim.2013.28.2.187.

So far, the impact of the various TP53 defects has not been evaluated in a large cohort of previously treated and relapsed CLL patients. Here, we present the results of TP53 gene sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization for del17p in a phase 3 clinical trial (REACH [Rituximab in the Study of Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia]). Of the 457 patients, 52 had TP53 mutations and 37 had del17p. In 24 (46%) of the TP53 mutated patients, no del17p was found and in 9 of the del17p patients, no TP53 mutation was identified. Based on a predicted proportion of TP53 disruption, a complete disruption of TP53 function, either by a combination of point mutations and/or del17p, was associated with a high risk for disease progression.

As the role of WWOX in human leukemia has not yet been fully elucidated, the present study examined the expression of WWOX in patients with different types of leukemia as well as in leukemia-derived cell lines. Based on the data, WWOX mRNA (WWOX) and protein (Wwox) were significantly reduced or absent in the leukemia patients as well as in the cell lines. In addition, a recombinant expression vector, pGC-FU-WWOX, was constructed and transfected WWOX cDNA into Jurkat cells (acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia) and K562 cells (chronic myeloid leukemia in erythroid crisis) which all lack endogenous Wwox. In vitro experiments indicated that restoration of Wwox in Jurkat and K562 cells significantly suppressed proliferation and colony formation. Of note, apoptosis was also induced by Wwox restoration. Furthermore, we traced the mechanisms underlying this process and found that Wwox restoration could trigger the mitochondrial pathway in leukemia. Our data provide evidence that WWOX exerts a role as a tumor suppressor gene in leukemia, possibly by inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway.","['Cui, Zhaolei', 'Lin, Donghong', 'Cheng, Feng', 'Luo, Lingqing', 'Kong, Lingying', 'Xu, Jianping', 'Hu, Jianda', 'Lan, Fenghua']","['Cui Z', 'Lin D', 'Cheng F', 'Luo L', 'Kong L', 'Xu J', 'Hu J', 'Lan F']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, School of Medical Technology and Engineering, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian 350004, PR China. cuileidizi@163.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (WW Domain-Containing Oxidoreductase)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (WWOX protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidoreductases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'WW Domain-Containing Oxidoreductase', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2013/03/26 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2012/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2013.2361 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2013 Jun;29(6):2154-62. doi: 10.3892/or.2013.2361.

Because limited information is available in Brazil, we analyzed trends in childhood cancer mortality in five Brazilian regions over 29 years. METHODS: Data from children 0-14 years old were extracted from the Health Mortality Information System for 1979 through 2008. Age-adjusted mortality rates, crude mortality rates, and age-specific mortality rates by geographic region of Brazil and for the entire country were analyzed for all cancers and leukemia. Mortality trends were evaluated for all childhood cancers and leukemia using joinpoint regression. RESULTS: Mortality declined significantly for the entire period (1979-2008) for children with leukemia. Childhood cancer mortality rates declined in the South and Southeast, remained stable in the Middle West, and increased in the North and Northeast. Although the mortality rates did not unilaterally decrease in all regions, the age-adjusted mortality rates were relatively similar among the five Brazilian regions from 2006-2008. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancer mortality declined 1.2 to 1.6% per year in the South and Southeast regions.","['Ferman, Sima', 'Santos, Marceli de Oliveira', 'Ferreira, Juliana Moreira de Oliveira', 'Reis, Rejane de Souza', 'Oliveira, Julio Fernando Pinto', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S', 'Camargo, Beatriz de']","['Ferman S', 'Santos Mde O', 'Ferreira JM', 'Reis Rde S', 'Oliveira JF', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Camargo Bd']","['Pediatric Oncology Department, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Clinics (Sao Paulo),"Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",101244734,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Male', 'Mortality/trends', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Sex Distribution', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",2013/03/26 06:00,2013/12/20 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2012/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S1807-59322013000200016 [pii]', '10.6061/clinics/2013(02)oa16 [doi]']",ppublish,Clinics (Sao Paulo). 2013;68(2):219-24. doi: 10.6061/clinics/2013(02)oa16.,,,PMC3584264,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sann-Joong-Kuey-Jian-Tang (SJKJT), a traditional medicinal prescription, has been used to treat lymphadenopathy and exhibits cytotoxic activity in many types of human cancer cells. Our previous studies revealed that SJKJT is capable of inhibiting colon cancer colo 205 cells by inducing autophagy and apoptosis. However, the effects and molecular mechanisms of SJKJT in human hepatocellular carcinoma have not been clearly elucidated. In the present study we evaluated the effects of SJKJT in human hepatic cellular carcinoma Hep-G2 cells. The cytotoxicity of SJKJT in Hep-G2 cells was measured by MTT assay. The cell cycles were analyzed by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS). The protein expression of translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), Mcl-1, Fas, TNF-alpha, Caspase-8, Caspase-3 and Bax in Hep-G2 cells treated with SJKJT was evaluated by western blotting. The protein expression of Caspase-3 was also detected by immunofluorescence staining. The results showed that SJKJT inhibits Hep-G2 cells in a time- and dosedependent manner. During SJKJT treatment for 48 and 72 h, the half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 1.48 and 0.94 mg/ml, respectively. The FACS results revealed that increased doses of SJKJT were capable of increasing the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 phase. Immunofluorescence staining showed that Hep-G2 treated with SJKJT had increased expression of Caspase-3. The western blot results showed that the protein expression of Fas, TNF-alpha, Caspase-8, Caspase- 3 and Bax was upregulated, but that of TCTP and Mcl-1 was downregulated in Hep-G2 cells treated with SJKJT. In conclusion, these findings indicated that SJKJT inhibits Hep-G2 cells. One of the molecular mechanisms responsible for this may be the increased Fas, TNF-alpha, Caspase-8, Caspase- 3 and Bax expression; another mechanism may be via decreasing TCTP and Mcl-1 expression in order to induce apoptosis.","['Chen, Yao-Li', 'Yan, Meng-Yi', 'Chien, Su-Yu', 'Kuo, Shou-Jen', 'Chen, Dar-Ren', 'Cheng, Chun-Yuan', 'Su, Chin-Cheng']","['Chen YL', 'Yan MY', 'Chien SY', 'Kuo SJ', 'Chen DR', 'Cheng CY', 'Su CC']","['Department of Surgery, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua 500-06, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TPT1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (sann-joong-kuey-jian-tang)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/metabolism', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism', 'Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2013/03/26 06:00,2013/11/06 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2012/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/mmr.2013.1381 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2013 May;7(5):1487-93. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2013.1381.

However, the mechanisms contributing to the resistance are yet to be fully understood. Here, we show for the first time that Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein, plays an important role in protecting cells from PDT-induced apoptosis. In contrast to the reduction in the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, sub-lethal PDT induces an increase in Mcl-1 expression. Silencing Mcl-1 sensitizes tumor cells to PDT-induced apoptosis, and ectopic expression of Mcl-1 significantly delays Bax translocation to mitochondria and inhibits caspase-3 activity following PDT. Mcl-1 expression is associated closely with activated AKT signaling following PDT. AKT can regulate Mcl-1 expression through GSK-3beta and NF-kappaB at the protein and transcriptional levels, respectively. Inhibition of AKT by Wortmannin or siRNA significantly reduces the levels of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein and enhances PDT-induced apoptosis. Treatment with Celecoxib, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is shown to downregulate Mcl-1 expression, and enhances PDT-induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. This down-regulation is closely related to the inhibition effect of Celecoxib on the AKT/GSK-3beta pathway, and was blocked upon addition of GSK-3beta inhibitor LiCl or the proteasome inhibitor MG132. These results suggest that Mcl-1 is a potential target for improving the antitumor efficiency of PDT. A loss in Mcl-1 by inhibiting AKT promotes PDT-induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. This also provides a novel rationale for utilizing Celecoxib to improve the efficacy of PDT.","['Song, Jiaxing', 'Chen, Qun', 'Xing, Da']","['Song J', 'Chen Q', 'Xing D']","['MOE Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science & Institute of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510631, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '97067-70-4 (Dihematoporphyrin Ether)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'G4962QA067 (Lithium Chloride)', 'JCX84Q7J1L (Celecoxib)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Celecoxib', 'Cell Survival', 'Dihematoporphyrin Ether/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Lithium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Photochemotherapy/*methods', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Wortmannin', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2013/03/26 06:00,2013/07/20 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2012/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(13)00120-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.03.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2013 Jun 10;319(10):1491-504. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.03.012.

In contrast, CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) drive the immune response toward Th1. The biodegradable material protamine can spontaneously form nanoparticles together with such ODNs. Our aim was to investigate the immune response induced by protamine-based nanoparticles (proticles) with CpG-ODN as an allergen delivery system. Proticles complexed with Ara h 2 extracted from raw peanuts as model allergen were injected subcutaneously into naive BALB/c mice. Ara h 2-specific antibodies were analyzed by ELISA and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell assay. Cytokine levels were investigated in supernatants of stimulated splenocytes. The in vivo distribution after subcutaneous injection was examined via fluorescence imaging. BMDCs were stimulated with proticles, and expression of stimulation and maturation markers as well as cytokines in supernatants was investigated. A favorable increase in Ara h 2-specific IgG2a antibodies was found after immunization with proticles-Ara h 2, whereas Ara h 2-specific IgE was not detectable. Accordingly, the ratio of IL-5/IFN-gamma was low in this group. Granuloma formation was completely absent at injection sites of proticles. The distribution of Ara h 2 after subcutaneous injection was markedly decelerated when complexed to proticles. Stimulation of BMDCs with proticles-Ara h 2 caused upregulation of CD11c and CD80 as well as an increased IL-6 production.

Survival in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has improved to roughly 90% in trials with risk stratification by biological features of leukaemic cells and response to treatment, treatment modification based on patients' pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenomics, and improved supportive care. However, innovative approaches are needed to further improve survival while reducing adverse effects. Prognosis remains poor in infants and adults. Genome-wide profiling of germline and leukaemic cell DNA has identified novel submicroscopic structural genetic changes and sequence mutations that contribute to leukaemogenesis, define new disease subtypes, affect responsiveness to treatment, and might provide novel prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for personalised medicine.","['Inaba, Hiroto', 'Greaves, Mel', 'Mullighan, Charles G']","['Inaba H', 'Greaves M', 'Mullighan CG']","[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital and University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. hiroto.inaba@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/methods', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Genome, Human', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/26 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0140-6736(12)62187-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62187-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2013 Jun 1;381(9881):1943-55. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62187-4.

The infection is a major cause of gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcer disease and increases the risk of gastric cancer. It has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several gastrointestinal, systemic or hematological diseases. The present review aims in deciphering the role of the bacterium in hematological disorders, increasing the awareness of gastroenterologists, hematologists and internal medicine practitioners, regarding the bacterium-associated hematological diseases. The efficacy of H. pylori eradication in increasing the platelet count in adult patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has been confirmed, linking the infection with the disease. Moreover, as the bacterium causes iron deficiency anemia (IDA) by several mechanisms, recent guidelines indicate H. pylori infection (Hp-I) to be sought in IDA patients if histology is negative and to be eradicated if present. Furthermore, it has been widely recognized that anti-H. pylori treatment causes regression of the low-grade B-cell gastric MALT lymphomas. Despite the well established associations of Hp-I with the aforementioned hematological disorders, we highlight the possible role of the infection to other hematological diseases or conditions such as non-Hodgkin lymphomas of the stomach, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, megaloblastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. We finally underline the elevated risk of childhood leukemia and of hemorrhage in patients with coagulation disorders, due to the infection.","['Papagiannakis, Panagiotis', 'Michalopoulos, Christos', 'Papalexi, Fani', 'Dalampoura, Despoina', 'Diamantidis, Michael D']","['Papagiannakis P', 'Michalopoulos C', 'Papalexi F', 'Dalampoura D', 'Diamantidis MD']","['Department of Haematology, Second Department of Internal Medicine, Hippokration General Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH), Faculty of Medicine, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Eur J Intern Med,European journal of internal medicine,9003220,,IM,"['Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/complications/microbiology', 'Anemia, Megaloblastic/complications/microbiology', 'Helicobacter Infections/*complications/drug therapy', '*Helicobacter pylori', 'Hematologic Diseases/*complications/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/complications/microbiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/microbiology', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/complications/microbiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/microbiology', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/complications/microbiology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/complications/microbiology']",2013/03/26 06:00,2014/09/02 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2012/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0953-6205(13)00077-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejim.2013.02.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Intern Med. 2013 Dec;24(8):685-90. doi: 10.1016/j.ejim.2013.02.011.

To investigate the immature and myeloid nature of ETP-ALL we examined global microRNA (miRNA) expression in adult ETP-ALL. miRNA profiling of ETP-ALL (n=8), non-ETP T-ALL (n=6), and healthy controls was performed and results were validated in independent cohorts of 66 ETP-ALL and 111 non-ETP T-ALL using real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, in vitro studies were performed on deregulated miRNAs in acute leukemia. We identified miR-221 and miR-222 as the most upregulated and six miRNAs (miR-151-3p, miR-19a, miR-20b, miR-342-3p, miR-363, and miR-576-3p) as downregulated in ETP-ALL compared to non-ETP T-ALL. In the validation cohorts, miR-221 and miR-222 were significantly upregulated in ETP-ALL, and miR-363 and miR-19a were downregulated in ETP-ALL. ETS1, downregulated in ETP-ALL, was identified as direct target of miR-222. In our in vitro studies miR-222 significantly inhibited proliferation, and caused cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in leukemic cells. In conclusion, our study revealed aberrant miRNA expression in ETP-ALL, with miR-221 and miR-222 as the most overexpressed miRNAs and implied a functional role for miR-222 in leukemic cells. Importantly, miR-222 may impact leukemogenesis by altering expression of the proto-oncogene ETS1 in acute leukemia.","['Coskun, Ebru', 'Neumann, Martin', 'Schlee, Cornelia', 'Liebertz, Frauke', 'Heesch, Sandra', 'Goekbuget, Nicola', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Baldus, Claudia D']","['Coskun E', 'Neumann M', 'Schlee C', 'Liebertz F', 'Heesch S', 'Goekbuget N', 'Hoelzer D', 'Baldus CD']","['Hematology and Oncology, Charite, University Hospital Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN222 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cohort Studies', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/physiology', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cells, T-Lymphoid/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/26 06:00,2013/06/28 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2012/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(13)00073-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2013.02.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2013 Jun;37(6):647-56. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2013.02.019.

Children with congenital heart disease frequently undergo cardiac catheterization procedures for diagnostic or treatment purposes. Despite the clear clinical benefit to the patient, the complexity of these procedures may result in high cumulative radiation exposure. Given children's greater sensitivity to radiation and the longer life span during which radiation health effects can develop, an epidemiological cohort study is being launched in France to evaluate the risks of leukaemia and solid cancers in this specific population. METHODS/DESIGN: The study population will include all children who have undergone at least one cardiac catheterization procedure since 2000 and were under 10 years old and permanent residents of France at the time of the procedure. Electronically stored patient records from the departments of paediatric cardiology of the French national network for complex congenital heart diseases (M3C) are being searched to identify the children to be included. The minimum dataset will comprise: identification of the subject (file number in the centre or department, full name, sex, date and place of birth), and characteristics of the intervention (date, underlying disease, type of procedure, technical details, such as fluoroscopy time and dose area product, (DAP), which are needed to reconstruct the doses received by each child). The cohort will be followed up through linkage with the two French paediatric cancer registries, which have recorded all cases of childhood leukaemia and solid cancers in France since 1990 and 2000, respectively. Radiation exposure will be estimated retrospectively for each child. 4500 children with catherizations between 2000 and 2011 have been already included in the cohort, and recruitment is ongoing at the national level. The study is expected to finally include a total of 8000 children. DISCUSSION: This French cohort study is specifically designed to provide further knowledge about the potential cancer risks associated with paediatric cardiac catheterization procedures. It will also provide new information on typical dose levels associated with these procedures in France. Finally, it should help improve awareness of the importance of radiation protection in these procedures.","['Baysson, Helene', 'Rehel, Jean Luc', 'Boudjemline, Younes', 'Petit, Jerome', 'Girodon, Brigitte', 'Aubert, Bernard', 'Laurier, Dominique', 'Bonnet, Damien', 'Bernier, Marie-Odile']","['Baysson H', 'Rehel JL', 'Boudjemline Y', 'Petit J', 'Girodon B', 'Aubert B', 'Laurier D', 'Bonnet D', 'Bernier MO']","['Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire, PRP-HOM, SRBE, Fontenay aux Roses, France. helene.baysson@irsn.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Public Health,BMC public health,100968562,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cardiac Catheterization/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Assessment']",2013/03/26 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2013/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2458-13-266 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2458-13-266 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Public Health. 2013 Mar 22;13:266. doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-13-266.,20130322,,PMC3621730,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aims of this study were to diagnose. METHODS AND RESULTS: Gross observation showed that severe enlargement of liver, spleen and kidney, and hemorrhage of thymus, muscle and glandular stomach in all submitted birds. The liver and lung of one flock had diffuse, multifocal white raised foci on the surface as well as on the cut-surface. Numerous erythrocytoblasts with bigger volume, basophilic cytoplasm and round nucleus were observed in blood and bone marrow smears. The same erythrocytoblasts were also found crowded in blood vessels and mesenchym of tissues by histological examination, and some had mitotic figures. PCR results showed that three flocks were positive for ALV-J with specific fragment of 924 bp, negative for AEV, ALV-A, ALV-B, Marek's disease virus (MDV) and Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV). The results of immunohistochemistry showed that cytoplasm of histiocytes and erythrocytoblasts in lung and spleen sections was positive for ALV-J antigen. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrated that erythroblastosis was all induced by ALV-J in the three different flocks. This is the first document report of erythroblastosis induced by ALV-J in China flocks.","['Wang, Guihua', 'Jiang, Yanping', 'Yu, Linin', 'Wang, Yue', 'Zhao, Xiaomin', 'Cheng, Ziqiang']","['Wang G', 'Jiang Y', 'Yu L', 'Wang Y', 'Zhao X', 'Cheng Z']","[""Department of Fundamental Veterinary, Molecular pathology lab, College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/epidemiology/pathology/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification/physiology', '*Chickens', 'China/epidemiology', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Kidney/pathology/virology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Liver/pathology/virology', 'Poultry Diseases/epidemiology/pathology/*virology', 'Spleen/pathology/virology']",2013/03/26 06:00,2013/09/10 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2012/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-10-92 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-10-92 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2013 Mar 22;10:92. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-10-92.,20130322,,PMC3614479,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemoresistance and the absence of host immune responses against autochthonous malignancy play a major role in the poor prognosis of AML. The triazene compounds Dacarbazine and Temozolomide are monofunctional alkylators that donate methyl groups to many sites in DNA, including the O(6)-position of guanine producing O(6)-methylguanine (O(6)-MeG). If not repaired, O(6)-MeG frequently mispairs with thymine during DNA duplication. O(6)-MeG:T mismatches can be recognized by the mismatch repair (MMR) system which activates a cascade of molecular events leading to cell cycle arrest and cell death. If MMR is defective, cells continue to divide and GC --> AT transition mutations occur. In preclinical models, such mutations can lead to the appearance of abnormal proteins containing non-self peptides (""chemical xenogenization"" CX) that can be recognized by host cell-mediated immunity. Repair of O(6)-MeG is achieved by the DNA repair protein, O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which removes the methyl adduct in an autoinactivating stoichiometric reaction. High MGMT levels attenuate the pharmacodynamic effects of triazenes. In the last few years, triazenes, alone or with MGMT inhibitors, have been tested in AML. In view of their potential activity as CX inducers, triazenes could offer the additional advantage of host anti-leukemia immune responses. The present paper describes several studies of leukemia treatment with triazenes and a case of acute refractory leukemia with massive skin infiltration by malignant cells. Treatment with Temozolomide and Lomeguatrib, a potent MGMT inhibitor, produced a huge, although transient, blastolysis and complete disappearance of all skin lesions.","['Bonmassar, L', 'Marchesi, F', 'Pascale, E', 'Franzese, O', 'Margison, G P', 'Bianchi, A', ""D'Atri, S"", 'Bernardini, S', 'Lattuada, D', 'Bonmassar, E', 'Aquino, A']","['Bonmassar L', 'Marchesi F', 'Pascale E', 'Franzese O', 'Margison GP', 'Bianchi A', ""D'Atri S"", 'Bernardini S', 'Lattuada D', 'Bonmassar E', 'Aquino A']","[""Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata-IRCCS, Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Triazenes)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Temozolomide', 'Triazenes/chemistry/*therapeutic use']",2013/03/26 06:00,2013/11/10 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2012/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/17 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['CMC-EPUB-20130315-21 [pii]', '10.2174/0929867311320190001 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2013;20(19):2389-401. doi: 10.2174/0929867311320190001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although vaccines encoding L1 and L2 capsid HPV proteins are efficient for the prevention of HPV infection, they are inadequate for treating established tumors. Hence, development of innovative vaccine therapies targeting E6/E7 is important for controlling HPV-induced cancers. We have engineered a nononcogenic mutated E7-specific plasmo-retroVLP vaccine (pVLP-E7), consisting of plasmid DNA, that is able to form recombinant retrovirus-based virus-like particles (VLPs) that display E7 antigen into murine leukemia virus Gag proteins pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein (VSV-G). pVLP-E7 vaccinations were studied for their ability to generate specific immune responses and for induction of protective immunity against tumor cell challenge in preventive and therapeutic models. The produced VLPs induce the maturation of human dendritic cells in vitro and mount specific E7 T cell responses. Intradermic vaccinations of mice with pVLP-E7 show their efficacy to generate antigen-specific T cell responses, to prevent and protect animals from early TC-1 tumor development compared with standard DNA or VLP immunizations. The vaccine efficacy was also evaluated for advanced tumors in mice vaccinated at various time after the injection of TC-1 cells. Data show that pVLP-E7 vaccination can cure mice with already established tumors only when combined with Toll-like receptor-7 (TLR7) and TLR9 agonists. Our findings provide evidence that pVLPs, combining the advantages of DNA and VLP vaccines, appear to be a promising strategy for the treatment of HPV-induced cancers.","['Lescaille, Geraldine', 'Pitoiset, Fabien', 'Macedo, Rodney', 'Baillou, Claude', 'Huret, Christophe', 'Klatzmann, David', 'Tartour, Eric', 'Lemoine, Francois M', 'Bellier, Bertrand']","['Lescaille G', 'Pitoiset F', 'Macedo R', 'Baillou C', 'Huret C', 'Klatzmann D', 'Tartour E', 'Lemoine FM', 'Bellier B']","['Research Unit UMR CNRS 7211/INSERM 959, 75013 Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (E6 protein, Human papillomavirus type 16)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Papillomavirus E7 Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '0 (Vaccines, Virus-Like Particle)', '0 (oncogene protein E7, Human papillomavirus type 16)', '6LTE2DNX63 (L1 protein, Human papillomavirus type 16)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Capsid Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Human papillomavirus 16/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*therapy/*virology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*genetics/immunology', 'Papillomavirus E7 Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Vaccines, DNA/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Vaccines, Virus-Like Particle/administration & dosage/immunology']",2013/03/26 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/hum.2012.037 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2013 May;24(5):533-44. doi: 10.1089/hum.2012.037.

It is also occasionally found in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) mostly in adults and rarely in de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) was used to study six Ph(+)AML, three bi-lineage and four Ph(+)ALL searching for specific genomic profiles. Surprisingly, loss of the IKZF1 and/or CDKN2A genes, the hallmark of Ph(+)ALL, were recurrent findings in Ph(+)AML and accompanied cryptic deletions within the immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes. The latter two losses have been shown to be part of 'hot spot' genome imbalances associated with BCR/ABL1 positive pre-B lymphoid phenotype in CML and Ph(+)ALL. We applied Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) to data from the 'hot spot' regions to the Ph(+)AML and a further 40 BCR/ABL1(+) samples looking for differentiating features. After exclusion of the most dominant markers, SAM identified aberrations unique to de novo Ph(+)AML that involved relevant genes. While the biological and clinical significance of this specific genome signature remains to be uncovered, the unique loss within the immunoglobulin genes provides a simple test to enable the differentiation of clinically similar de novo Ph(+) AML and myeloid blast crisis of CML.","['Nacheva, Ellie P', 'Grace, Colin D', 'Brazma, Diana', 'Gancheva, Katya', 'Howard-Reeves, Julie', 'Rai, Lena', 'Gale, Rosemary E', 'Linch, David C', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Russell, Nigel', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Kottaridis, Panagiotis D']","['Nacheva EP', 'Grace CD', 'Brazma D', 'Gancheva K', 'Howard-Reeves J', 'Rai L', 'Gale RE', 'Linch DC', 'Hills RK', 'Russell N', 'Burnett AK', 'Kottaridis PD']","['UCL Med School, Royal Free Campus, London, UK. e.nacheva@ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome']",2013/03/26 06:00,2013/06/21 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2012/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12301 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 May;161(4):541-50. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12301.

A difference in clinical outcome between single- (sm) and double-mutated (dm) cases has been reported, whereupon CEBPAdm cases were shown to be associated with better overall survival (OS). The occurrence and prognostic impact of concomitant molecular mutations in addition to CEBPAdm has not been assessed until now with exception of GATA2 mutations. Here, we investigated a cohort of 95 AML CEBPAdm cases for concomitant mutations. TET2 was found to be most frequently mutated (34.0%) gene, followed by GATA2 (21.0%), WT1 (13.7%), DNMT3A (9.6%), ASXL1 (9.5%), NRAS (8.4%), KRAS (3.2%), IDH1/2 (6.3%), FLT3-internal tandem duplication (6.3%), FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain (2.1%), NPM1 (2.1%), and RUNX1 (1/94). Patients harbouring additional mutations in the TET2 gene showed significantly worse OS than TET2 wild-type cases (P = 0.035), whereas GATA2-mutated patients showed improved OS (P = 0.032). Serial analyses were performed for 39 CEBPAdm cases with concomitant mutations. Here, we observed that CEBPA mutations present the primary pathogenetic event in the majority of cases (76.9%).

METHODS: The records of 777 patients in two randomized Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG)-CLL programs treated with these agents were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Immune thrombocytopenia occurred in 55 of 777 (7.1%) patients. No significant differences in IT prevalence were seen between patients on chlorambucil or 2-CdA-based regiments (P = 0.33). IT developed at a median time of 0.499 yr (0.06-4.8) from the start of CLL therapy. This time was significantly longer in patients treated with chlorambucil (2.03 yr, 95% CI: 0.06-4.22) in relation to patients treated with 2-CdA-based regiments (0.52 yr, 95%CI: 0.34-0.69, P = 0.049). Overall survival (OS) of patients with IT and those without IT were similar (2.65 yr vs. 3.2 yr P = 0.23) but the severity of bleeding was more pronounced in the 2-CdA group. The responses to IT therapy were 35%, 54% and 75% for steroids, chemotherapy and splenectomy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, an unexpectedly high percentage of IT incidence was demonstrated in patients with CLL requiring chemotherapy. Although no marked differences were seen in IT frequency in patients treated with 2-CdA-based regiments compared to chlorambucil regimen, the clinical course of hemorrhagic diathesis was more severe in 2-CdA group. Also, the time elapsed from study screening to IT diagnosis was significantly shorter in the 2-CdA group than in the chlorambucil group suggesting a causative relationship. The appearance of IT did not influence the median time of OS.","['Blonski, Jerzy Z', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Chojnowski, Krzysztof', 'Gora-Tybor, Joanna', 'Warzocha, Krzysztof', 'Ceglarek, Bernadetta', 'Seferynska, Ilona', 'Calbecka, Malgorzata', 'Kostyra, Aleksandra', 'Stella-Holowiecka, Beata', 'Kloczko, Janusz', 'Dmoszynska, Anna', 'Kowal, Malgorzata', 'Lewandowski, Krzysztof', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek, Jadwiga', 'Wiater, Elzbieta', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz', 'Potoczek, Stanislaw', 'Hellmann, Andrzej', 'Mital, Andrzej', 'Skotnicki, Aleksander', 'Nowak, Wieslaw', 'Sulek, Kazimierz', 'Zawilska, Krystyna', 'Trelinski, Jacek']","['Blonski JZ', 'Robak T', 'Chojnowski K', 'Gora-Tybor J', 'Warzocha K', 'Ceglarek B', 'Seferynska I', 'Calbecka M', 'Kostyra A', 'Stella-Holowiecka B', 'Kloczko J', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Kowal M', 'Lewandowski K', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek J', 'Wiater E', 'Kuliczkowski K', 'Potoczek S', 'Hellmann A', 'Mital A', 'Skotnicki A', 'Nowak W', 'Sulek K', 'Zawilska K', 'Trelinski J']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Chlorambucil/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemorrhage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocytopenia/*complications/immunology/therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2013/03/26 06:00,2013/12/24 06:00,['2013/03/26 06:00'],"['2013/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12112 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2013 Jul;91(1):1-9. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12112.

We describe the establishment and characterisation of a novel disseminated model of AML (AML-NS8), generated by injection into mice of leukaemic blasts freshly isolated from a patient with an aggressive CD56(+) monoblastic AML (M5a). The model reproduced typical manifestations of this leukaemia, including presence of extramedullary masses and central nervous system involvement, and the original phenotype, karyotype and genotype of leukaemic cells were retained in vivo. Recently Polo-Like Kinase 1 (PLK1) has emerged as a new candidate drug target in AML. We therefore tested our PLK1 inhibitor NMS-P937 in this model either in the engraftment or in the established disease settings. Both schedules showed good efficacy compared to standard therapies, with a significant increase in median survival time (MST) expecially in the established disease setting (MST = 28, 36, 62 days for vehicle, cytarabine and NMS-P937, respectively). Importantly, we could also demonstrate that NMS-P937 induced specific biomarker modulation in extramedullary tissues.

We here demonstrate that CD73 helps control graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in mouse models. Survival of wild-type (WT) recipients of either allogeneic donor naive CD73 knock-out (KO) or WT T cells was similar suggesting that donor naive T cell CD73 did not contribute to GVHD. By contrast, donor CD73 KO CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) had significantly impaired ability to mitigate GVHD mortality compared to WT Treg, suggesting that CD73 on Treg is critical for GVHD protection. However, compared to donor CD73, recipient CD73 is more effective in limiting GVHD. Pharmacological blockade of A2A receptor exacerbated GVHD in WT recipients, but not in CD73 KO recipients, suggesting that A2 receptor signaling is primarily implicated in CD73-mediated GVHD protection. Moreover, pharmacological blockade of CD73 enzymatic activity induced stronger alloreactive T cell activity, worsened GVHD and enhanced the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. These findings suggest that both donor and recipient CD73 protects against GVHD but also limits GVL effects.

Here, we sought to understand mechanisms of resistance to tigecycline by establishing a leukemia cell line resistant to the drug. TEX leukemia cells were treated with increasing concentrations of tigecycline over 4 months and a population of cells resistant to tigecycline (RTEX+TIG) was selected. Compared to wild type cells, RTEX+TIG cells had undetectable levels of mitochondrially translated proteins Cox-1 and Cox-2, reduced oxygen consumption and increased rates of glycolysis. Moreover, RTEX+TIG cells were more sensitive to inhibitors of glycolysis and more resistant to hypoxia. By electron microscopy, RTEX+TIG cells had abnormally swollen mitochondria with irregular cristae structures. RNA sequencing demonstrated a significant over-representation of genes with binding sites for the HIF1alpha:HIF1beta transcription factor complex in their promoters. Upregulation of HIF1alpha mRNA and protein in RTEX+TIG cells was confirmed by Q-RTPCR and immunoblotting. Strikingly, upon removal of tigecycline from RTEX+TIG cells, the cells re-established aerobic metabolism. Levels of Cox-1 and Cox-2, oxygen consumption, glycolysis, mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential returned to wild type levels, but HIF1alpha remained elevated.

Meaningful separation of the potentially curative GVT responses from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the most serious toxicity following T-cell replete allo-HCT, has been an elusive goal. GVHD is initiated by alloantigens, although both alloantigens and tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) initiate GVT responses. Emerging data have illuminated a role for antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in inducing alloantigen-specific responses. By using multiple clinically relevant murine models, we show that a specific subset of host-derived APCs-CD8(+) dendritic cells (DCs)-enhances TSA responses and is required for optimal induction of GVT. Stimulation of TLR3, which among host hematopoietic APC subsets is predominantly expressed on CD8(+) DCs, enhanced GVT without exacerbating GVHD. Thus, strategies that modulate host APC subsets without direct manipulation of donor T cells could augment GVT responses and enhance the efficacy of allo-HCT.","['Toubai, Tomomi', 'Sun, Yaping', 'Luker, Gary', 'Liu, Jun', 'Luker, Kathryn E', 'Tawara, Isao', 'Evers, Rebecca', 'Liu, Chen', 'Mathewson, Nathan', 'Malter, Chelsea', 'Nieves, Evelyn', 'Choi, Sung', 'Murphy, Kenneth M', 'Reddy, Pavan']","['Toubai T', 'Sun Y', 'Luker G', 'Liu J', 'Luker KE', 'Tawara I', 'Evers R', 'Liu C', 'Mathewson N', 'Malter C', 'Nieves E', 'Choi S', 'Murphy KM', 'Reddy P']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (CD8 Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/*physiology', 'CD8 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/*immunology/physiology', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Up-Regulation/immunology']",2013/03/23 06:00,2013/08/06 06:00,['2013/03/23 06:00'],"['2013/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58511-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-05-432872 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 May 16;121(20):4231-41. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-05-432872.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We sought to determine the impact of GTX as an adjunct to antifungal therapy in 128 patients with HM and prolonged neutropenia (>/=14 days) with a proven or probable invasive aspergillosis (IA) infection by retrospectively reviewing our institutional database. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients received GTX and 75 did not. By univariate analysis, patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis who received GTX were less likely to respond to antifungal therapy (P = 0.03), and more likely to die of IA (P = 0.009) when compared with the non-GTX group. Among patients who received GTX, 53% developed a pulmonary reaction. Furthermore, IA-related death was associated with the number of GTX given (P = 0.018) and the early initiation of GTX within 7 days after starting antifungal therapy (P = 0.001). By multivariate competing risk analysis, patients who received GTX were more likely to die of IA than patients who did not receive GTX (P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that GTX does not improve response to antifungal therapy and is associated with worse outcomes of IA infection in HM patients, particularly those with pulmonary involvement.","['Raad, I I', 'Chaftari, A M', 'Al Shuaibi, M M', 'Jiang, Y', 'Shomali, W', 'Cortes, J E', 'Lichtiger, B', 'Hachem, R Y']","['Raad II', 'Chaftari AM', 'Al Shuaibi MM', 'Jiang Y', 'Shomali W', 'Cortes JE', 'Lichtiger B', 'Hachem RY']","['Departments of Infection Control, Infectious Diseases and Employee Health.

The present objective was to investigate the impact of disease and treatment on individual QoL and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in long-term survivors of childhood lymphoblastic malignancy treated with conventional therapy versus SCT. PROCEDURE: Survivors of lymphoblastic malignancy treated with (n = 18) or without (n = 52) SCT were recruited a median follow-up time of 18 and 14 years, respectively. The indication for SCT was relapsed disease in 17 of 18 cases. Autologous stem cells were used in 15 cases. Total body irradiation (TBI) was included in the conditioning regimen for all SCT patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted using two validated instruments: SEIQoL-DW (individual QoL) and SF-36 (HRQoL). Content analysis was used to analyze SEIQoL-DW and an overall QoL index score was calculated. Two multiple linear regression analyses were performed to detect factors influencing outcomes. RESULTS: Poorer ratings of overall QoL and more negative consequences related to physical dysfunctions were shown in the SCT group. The findings indicate that being unemployed or on sick leave are associated with a decline in HRQoL and individual QoL rather than SCT, cranial radiation therapy, present age, or sex. CONCLUSION: In this small sample of long-term survivors of SCT, QoL seems reasonably good and similar to that of those having received conventional therapy. However, managing an employment must be acknowledged as an important part of life that has a great impact on QoL.","['Sundberg, Kay K', 'Wettergren, Lena', 'Frisk, Per', 'Arvidson, Johan']","['Sundberg KK', 'Wettergren L', 'Frisk P', 'Arvidson J']","['Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden. kay.sundberg@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', '*Quality of Life', '*Self Report', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2013/03/23 06:00,2013/08/28 06:00,['2013/03/23 06:00'],"['2012/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24519 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Aug;60(8):1382-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24519.

Although reports of treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) associated with TMZ are accumulating, it remains unclear whether TMZ has the same leukemogenic potential as other alkylating agents. METHODS: We performed a single-institution retrospective analysis using a database of 359 glioma patients given nimustine (ACNU)-based therapy, TMZ-based therapy, or combination therapy, who were followed up for a minimum of 2 months, between January 1990 and December 2009, at the National Cancer Center Hospital in Japan. RESULTS: Of the 359 patients, 225 received ACNU alone or ACNU plus other chemotherapeutic drugs (ACNU-based group; median follow-up period, 31.4 mo), 63 patients received ACNU-based therapy followed by TMZ therapy (ACNU-TMZ group; median follow-up period, 19.1 mo), and 71 patients received TMZ alone or TMZ plus other chemotherapeutic drugs (TMZ-based group; median follow-up period, 16.9 mo). Three patients in the ACNU-based group developed MDS/AML (incidence rate: 2.9 cases per 1000 person-years), 2 patients in the ACNU-TMZ group developed MDS/AML (13.0 cases per 1000 person-years), and 1 patient in the TMZ-based group developed ALL (9.9 cases per 1000 person-years). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limitations of this study, published reports and our results suggest that TMZ induces secondary hematological malignancies, particularly ALL, and might shorten the latency period when used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.","['Momota, Hiroyuki', 'Narita, Yoshitaka', 'Miyakita, Yasuji', 'Shibui, Soichiro']","['Momota H', 'Narita Y', 'Miyakita Y', 'Shibui S']","['Corresponding Author: Yoshitaka Narita, PhD, MD, Department of Neurosurgery and Neuro-Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan. yonarita@ncc.go.jp.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Neuro Oncol,Neuro-oncology,100887420,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dacarbazine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glioma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Temozolomide', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/23 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/03/23 06:00'],"['2013/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['not036 [pii]', '10.1093/neuonc/not036 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuro Oncol. 2013 Oct;15(10):1445-50. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/not036.

We found previously that expression of the CML-related Bcr-abl oncoprotein in myeloid progenitor cells increases expression of Fas-associated phosphatase 1 (Fap1). This resulted in Fap1-dependent resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis in these cells. Fap1 also interacts with the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) protein, but the functional significance of this interaction is unknown. Apc participates in a complex that includes glycogen synthase kinase beta (Gsk3beta) and betacatenin. Assembly of this complex results in phosphorylation of betacatenin by Gsk3beta, which facilitates betacatenin ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. In this study, we found increased association of Fap1 with the Apc complex in Bcr-abl(+) myeloid progenitor cells. We also found Fap1-dependent inactivation of Gsk3beta and consequent stabilization of betacatenin in these cells. Consistent with this, Bcr-abl(+) cells exhibited a Fap1-dependent increase in betacatenin activity. Our studies identified Fap1-dependent Gsk3beta inactivation as a molecular mechanism for increased betacatenin activity in CML.","['Huang, Weiqi', 'Bei, Ling', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Huang W', 'Bei L', 'Eklund EA']","['Feinberg School of Medicine and Robert H.

The compounds are dimeric structures of general formula [Ru2(p-cym)2(L)2]X2 where X = Cl(-), PF6(-) and L = deprotonated 5-nitrofuraldehyde TSC (L1), and the N-methyl (L2), N-ethyl (L3) and N-phenyl (L4) derivatives. The precursor [RuCl2(p-cym)]2, all TSC ligands L1-L4and their corresponding complexes 1-4 were screened in vitro for their cytotoxicity against a range of human cancer cell lines (HL-60 acute promyelocytic leukemia, A2780 ovarian adenocarcinoma, MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma and PC3 grade IV prostate carcinoma). While the precursor complex was found to be inactive and L4 exhibited moderate activity only in the MCF7 cell line, the coordination of L4 to the {Ru(p-cym)} moiety remarkably enhanced the activity of the whole complex. In fact, complex 4 [Ru2(p-cym)2(L4)2]Cl2 was found to be the most active agent of the whole series, and was studied further (as well as complex 1 for comparison). Concerning the mode of action, the mechanism of cell death for both 1 and 4 seemed to be related to apoptotic processes, and they strongly interacted with tubulin (involved in the cell cycle) and with integrin (involved in the cytoskeleton formation). As an approach to their pharmacokinetics, the interaction of 1 and 4 with human serum albumin (HSA) was assessed. A quantitative model for the binding of 4 to HSA is proposed from Circular Dichroism data, and validated by fluorescence results. Models of Forster resonance energy transfer and fluorescence quenching afforded the distance of 4 to the lone Trp214 residue. Importantly, HSA binding enhanced the cytotoxicity of 4 and correlated well with the HSA binding data. Our results consistently indicate that [Ru2(p-cymene)2(L4)2]Cl2 is quite promising as a prospective metallodrug for cancer chemotherapy.","['Demoro, Bruno', 'de Almeida, Rodrigo F M', 'Marques, Fernanda', 'Matos, Cristina P', 'Otero, Lucia', 'Costa Pessoa, Joao', 'Santos, Isabel', 'Rodriguez, Alejandra', 'Moreno, Virtudes', 'Lorenzo, Julia', 'Gambino, Dinorah', 'Tomaz, Ana Isabel']","['Demoro B', 'de Almeida RF', 'Marques F', 'Matos CP', 'Otero L', 'Costa Pessoa J', 'Santos I', 'Rodriguez A', 'Moreno V', 'Lorenzo J', 'Gambino D', 'Tomaz AI']","['Catedra de Quimica Inorganica, Facultad de Quimica, Universidad de la Republica, 11800 Montevideo, Uruguay.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Dalton Trans,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",101176026,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coordination Complexes)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (Thiosemicarbazones)', '7UI0TKC3U5 (Ruthenium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Coordination Complexes/chemistry/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Dimerization', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Protein Binding', 'Ruthenium/*chemistry', 'Serum Albumin/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Thiosemicarbazones/*chemistry']",2013/03/23 06:00,2013/11/01 06:00,['2013/03/23 06:00'],"['2013/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c3dt00028a [doi]'],ppublish,Dalton Trans. 2013 May 21;42(19):7131-46. doi: 10.1039/c3dt00028a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SIRT1 is a multifunctional protein and recent studies demonstrate that SIRT1 plays a crucial role in myeloid leukemogenesis and drug resistance. RECENT FINDINGS: SIRT1 expression is typically low in normal adult hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, but is increased in the leukemic stem/progenitor cells of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). SIRT1 activation is mediated in both BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase-dependent and independent manners. SIRT1 activation promotes resistance of CML stem cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations for acquired resistance. SUMMARY: On the basis of current findings, SIRT1 inhibition in combination with BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be explored as a novel approach to eradicate leukemic stem cells and residual disease in chronic phase CML. SIRT1 inhibition may also help prevent acquired resistance through genetic mutations of advanced phases of CML, and extend remission.","['Chen, WenYong', 'Bhatia, Ravi']","['Chen W', 'Bhatia R']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California 91010, USA. wechen@coh.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",IM,"['*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Sirtuin 1/*physiology']",2013/03/23 06:00,2013/10/24 06:00,['2013/03/23 06:00'],"['2013/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e328360ab64 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2013 Jul;20(4):308-13. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e328360ab64.,,,PMC3808881,,,"['R01 CA095684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA143421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA95684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS518417'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although SkE has previously been shown to have cytostatic and/or cytotoxic activities in some tumor cell lines, its mechanism of action has not yet been characterized. We show here that SkE in the high nanomolar range inhibited the growth of various leukemic and solid tumor cell lines. Importantly, SkE was highly efficient at inhibiting chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells that exhibit constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway and, accordingly, it impaired the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. SkE also abrogated MEK1/2 and B-Raf phosphorylation but had no effect on Ras activity. Moreover, SkE was particularly effective against melanoma cell lines carrying the B-Raf-V600E mutation. Importantly, SkE resensitized the PLX-4032-resistant 451Lu melanoma cell line (451Lu-R) and was more efficient than U0126, a MEK inhibitor, and PLX-4032 (PLX) at inducing the apoptosis of two hairy cell leukemia (HCL) patient samples carrying the B-Raf-V600E mutation. Finally, SkE was as efficient as imatinib at inhibiting tumor formation in a xenograft model of CML cells in athymic mice. In conclusion, we show that SkE, a very potent inhibitor of B-Raf-V600E, is highly effective against cancer cell lines that exhibit constitutive activation of the ERK1/2 pathway.","['Robert, Guillaume', 'Jullian, Valerie', 'Jacquel, Arnaud', 'Ginet, Clemence', 'Dufies, Maeva', 'Torino, Stephanie', 'Pottier, Anais', 'Peyrade, Frederic', 'Tartare-Deckert, Sophie', 'Bourdy, Genevieve', 'Deharo, Eric', 'Auberger, Patrick']","['Robert G', 'Jullian V', 'Jacquel A', 'Ginet C', 'Dufies M', 'Torino S', 'Pottier A', 'Peyrade F', 'Tartare-Deckert S', 'Bourdy G', 'Deharo E', 'Auberger P']","['INSERM/U1065, C3M, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quassins)', '0 (simalikalactone E)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Melanoma/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Quassins/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Skin Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2013/03/23 06:00,2013/08/13 06:00,['2013/03/23 06:00'],"['2013/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['791 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.791 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2012 Dec;3(12):1688-99. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.791.,,,PMC3681504,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the roles of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in treatment response of leukemia. In this study, we observed that CDK1 expression was significantly higher in bone marrow from 42 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at recurrence than that at first diagnosis (p = 0.04). AML patients had higher level of nuclear CDK1 in their leukemic blasts tended to have poorer clinical outcome compared with those with lower levels. We showed that CDK1 function is required for all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to achieve the optimal effect in U-937 human leukemic cells. CDK1 modulates the levels of P27(kip) and AKT phosphorylation in response to ATRA treatment. Further, we show, for the first time, that RARgamma in concert with ATRA regulates protein levels of CDK1 and its subcellular localization. The regulation of the subcellular content of CDK1 and RARgamma by ATRA is an important process for achieving an effective response in treatment of leukemia. RARgamma and CDK1 form a reciprocal regulatory circuit in the nucleus and influence the function and protein stability of each other and the level of P27(kip) protein. In addition, expression of wee1 kinase and Cdc25A/C phosphatases also coincide with CDK1 expression and its subcellular localization in response to ATRA treatment. Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which CDK1 and RARgamma coordinate with ATRA to influence cell cycle progression and cellular differentiation.","['Hedblom, Andreas', 'Laursen, Kristian B', 'Miftakhova, Regina', 'Sarwar, Martuza', 'Anagnostaki, Lola', 'Bredberg, Anders', 'Mongan, Nigel P', 'Gudas, Lorraine J', 'Persson, Jenny L']","['Hedblom A', 'Laursen KB', 'Miftakhova R', 'Sarwar M', 'Anagnostaki L', 'Bredberg A', 'Mongan NP', 'Gudas LJ', 'Persson JL']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Experimental Cancer Research, Clinical Research Center, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor gamma)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2013/03/23 06:00,2013/11/12 06:00,['2013/03/23 06:00'],"['2013/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['24313 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.24313 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2013 Apr 15;12(8):1251-66. doi: 10.4161/cc.24313.

We identified the histone demethylase PHF8 as a coactivator that is specifically recruited by RARalpha fusions to activate expression of their downstream targets upon ATRA treatment. Forced expression of PHF8 resensitizes ATRA-resistant APL cells, whereas its downregulation confers resistance. ATRA sensitivity depends on the enzymatic activity and phosphorylation status of PHF8, which can be pharmacologically manipulated to resurrect ATRA sensitivity to resistant cells.

A decrease of either c-Myc protein levels or attenuation of the p53 response rescues LIC activity and disease progression.

Abrogation of quiescence in LICs by Fbxw7 ablation increased their sensitivity to imatinib, and the combination of Fbxw7 ablation with imatinib treatment resulted in a greater depletion of LICs than of normal hematopoietic stem cells in mice.

Moreover, an important therapeutic strategy for treating beta-thalassemia and sickle-cell anemia could be the use of drugs able to induce erythroid differentiation and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) accumulation: in fact, the increased production of this type of hemoglobin can reduce the clinical symptoms and the frequency of transfusions. An important class of erythroid differentiating compounds and HbF inducers is composed by DNA-binding chemotherapeutics: however, they are not used in most instances considering their possible devastating side effects. In this contest, we approached the study of erythrodifferentiating properties of furocoumarins. In fact, upon UV-A irradiation, they are able to covalently bind DNA. Thus, the erythrodifferentiation activity of some linear and angular furocoumarins was evaluated in the experimental K562 cellular model system. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction assay was employed to evaluate the accumulation of different globin mRNAs. The results demonstrated that both linear and angular furocoumarins are strong inducers of erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. From a preliminary screening, we selected the most active compounds and investigated the role of DNA photodamage in their erythroid inducing activity and mechanism of action. Moreover, some cytofluorimetric experiments were carried out to better study cell cycle modifications and the mitochondrial involvement. A further development of the work was carried out studying the erythroid differentiation of photolysis products of these molecules. 5,5'-Dimethylpsoralen photoproducts induced an important increase in gamma-globin gene transcription in K562 cells.","['Salvador, Alessia', 'Brognara, Eleonora', 'Vedaldi, Daniela', 'Castagliuolo, Ignazio', 'Brun, Paola', 'Zuccato, Cristina', 'Lampronti, Ilaria', 'Gambari, Roberto']","['Salvador A', 'Brognara E', 'Vedaldi D', 'Castagliuolo I', 'Brun P', 'Zuccato C', 'Lampronti I', 'Gambari R']","['Department of Drug Sciences, University of Padova, Italy. alessia.salvador.1@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,J Photochem Photobiol B,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

Here, we studied the physiological characteristics and activities of the macroscopic structure of a routinely used 3D culture substrata, the RADA16 self-assembling peptide scaffold. We found that RADA16 exhibited three distinct assembly patterns depending on its concentration, and one of these assemblies, formed with 0.01% (w/v) RADA16, was capable of inducing differentiation of human myelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells into monocytes/macrophages. This activity was largely reduced by destroying the 3D structure of the assembly, suggesting that the assembly intrinsically retained the ability to induce HL-60 differentiation. When cultured in the RADA16 scaffold, HL-60 cells accumulated intracellular cholesterol about 10 times more than normally cultured cells. Both the RADA16 culture and cholesterol loading brought about similar gene expression profiles. These results showed that HL-60 cells can sense the physical properties of the RADA16 scaffold through a mechanism that may involve intracellular pathways of cholesterol synthesis and/or transport.","['Kakiuchi, Yasutaka', 'Hirohashi, Noritaka', 'Murakami-Murofushi, Kimiko']","['Kakiuchi Y', 'Hirohashi N', 'Murakami-Murofushi K']","['Science & Education Center, Ochanomizu University, Ohtsuka, Tokyo, Japan. kakiuchi.yasutaka@ocha.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Hydrogels)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RADA16-I)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogels/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Scaffolds']",2013/03/23 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2013/03/23 06:00'],"['2013/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(13)00416-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.02.105 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2013 Apr 12;433(3):298-304. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.02.105.

Report of four Tunisian cases].,192-6,10.1016/j.mycmed.2012.02.001 [doi],"UNLABELLED: Fungemia is classically caused by a single species and the detection of more than one species in blood samples is uncommon. We report four cases of mixed fungemia (MF) diagnosed in the parasitology-mycology laboratory of Farhat-Hached hospital in Sousse, Tunisia. The MF episodes occurred in two neonates and two adults suffering from acute myeloid leukemia. Two fungal species were detected concomitantly within the same blood culture in all cases. Species combination was detected by the subculture of the blood culture on Candida ID((R)) chromogenic medium in three cases and on Sabouraud agar in one case. Predisposing factors were: indwelling catheters (4/4), broad-spectrum antibiotics (3/4), neutropenia (2/4), exclusive parenteral nutrition (2/4) and Candida colonization (1/4). Patients presented febrile sepsis with no response to broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy in all cases. Outcome under antifungal treatment was favorable in two cases and the two other patients died. CONCLUSION: MF appears similar to the more common monomicrobial fungemia. The use of chromogenic media in routine can improve the detection of MF episodes allowing appropriate antifungal therapy.","['Saghrouni, F', 'Ben Abdeljelil, J', 'Nouri, S', 'Gheith, S', 'Fathallah, A', 'Sboui, H', 'Ben Said, M']","['Saghrouni F', 'Ben Abdeljelil J', 'Nouri S', 'Gheith S', 'Fathallah A', 'Sboui H', 'Ben Said M']","['Laboratoire de parasitologie-mycologie, hopital Farhat-Hached, Sousse, Tunisia. saghrounifatma@yahoo.fr']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",France,J Mycol Med,Journal de mycologie medicale,9425651,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Culture Media)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Candida/*isolation & purification', 'Candida albicans/isolation & purification', 'Candida tropicalis/isolation & purification', 'Candidemia/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology/microbiology', 'Catheter-Related Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology/microbiology', 'Cleft Lip/complications', 'Cleft Palate/complications', 'Coinfection', 'Cross Infection/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology/microbiology', 'Culture Media', 'Epidermolysis Bullosa/complications', 'Fungemia/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology/*microbiology', 'Geotrichosis/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology/*microbiology', 'Geotrichum/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/complications', 'Parenteral Nutrition/adverse effects', 'Tunisia', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/23 06:00,2014/04/16 06:00,['2013/03/23 06:00'],"['2011/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1156-5233(12)00011-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.mycmed.2012.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mycol Med. 2012 Jun;22(2):192-6. doi: 10.1016/j.mycmed.2012.02.001.

The importance of this kinase becomes apparent from the consequences of a specific, reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 that yields a chimeric fusion protein, Bcr-Abl, in which the function of auto-regulatory mechanisms are inactivated. The resultant constitutively active kinase is responsible for development of a systemic leukemogenic phenotype. Studies employing currently available highly specific inhibitors, with high potency to block kinase activity, uncovered unanticipated characteristics of Bcr-Abl fusion protein. It became apparent that the kinase domain, with its primary significance for development and progression of leukemia, is not solely responsible for leukemogenic features of the Bcr-Abl transformed leukemic stem cells. In this review we summarize current understanding of non-enzymatic characteristics of Bcr-Abl, its effect on actin cytoskeleton, and its potential contribution to drug resistance and systemic persistence of leukemic stem cells.","['Bartos, Adrian', 'Dubielecka, Patrycja M']","['Bartos A', 'Dubielecka PM']","['Signal Transduction Lab., Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI 02903, USA.

Puma, Noxa and Bim mRNAs were evaluated by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and correlations between their expression levels and CLL prognostic markers were analyzed. Primary CLL samples were treated in vitro with fludarabine to investigate the role of Puma, Noxa and Bim in the response to chemotherapeutic drugs which act through activation of the p53 pathway. We found that a low expression level of Puma was associated with some markers of poor prognosis. However, the level of Noxa or Bim was not different in patients with CLL with variant clinical features and prognostic factors. Puma expression was up-regulated after fludarabine treatment in primary CLL cells, but there was no significant difference for Noxa and Bim. Up-regulation of Puma occurred only in CLL cells with functional p53. CLL cells with p53 abnormalities were deficient in the activation of Puma by chemotherapeutics. These results suggest that a lack of Puma induction may contribute to the development of resistance to anticancer agents in CLL.","['Zhu, Hai-Jia', 'Liu, Ling', 'Fan, Lei', 'Zhang, Li-Na', 'Fang, Cheng', 'Zou, Zhi-Jian', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Xu, Wei']","['Zhu HJ', 'Liu L', 'Fan L', 'Zhang LN', 'Fang C', 'Zou ZJ', 'Li JY', 'Xu W']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital , Nanjing , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RTL10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",2013/03/23 06:00,2014/06/10 06:00,['2013/03/23 06:00'],"['2013/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.787613 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Dec;54(12):2712-9. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.787613.

Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is a severe mucocutaneous disease, which can occur in association with B-cell malignancies. A correct diagnosis of PNP relies on distinct clinical and histopathological features, and the demonstration, by direct immunofluorescence, of intercellular and basement membrane IgG deposits in the affected tissue. PNP is often refractory to immunosuppressive drugs and frequently has a fatal outcome. We report three cases where sustained remissions of both PNP and CLL were induced by ALZ. In one of these cases, ALZ was able to reinduce a sustained remission of PNP at the reappearance of the disorder years after the primary treatment. In all cases, the PNP diagnosis was confirmed by immunofluorescence. In conclusion, ALZ should be considered as a treatment option in severe CLL-associated PNP. Patients should be carefully selected and receive appropriate infectious prophylaxis before, during and after ALZ treatment, due to the risk of opportunistic infections secondary to combined disease- and drug-induced immunosuppression.","['Bech, R', 'Baumgartner-Nielsen, J', 'Peterslund, N A', 'Steiniche, T', 'Deleuran, M', ""d'Amore, F""]","['Bech R', 'Baumgartner-Nielsen J', 'Peterslund NA', 'Steiniche T', 'Deleuran M', ""d'Amore F""]","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. rikkebecha@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications', 'Male', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Pemphigus/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2013/03/23 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/03/23 06:00'],"['2013/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjd.12324 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2013 Aug;169(2):469-72. doi: 10.1111/bjd.12324.,,['(c) 2013 The Authors BJD (c) 2013 British Association of Dermatologists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Information on CML-CP patients switched from imatinib to nilotinib or dasatinib as second-line therapy was collected retrospectively from 122 US hematologists and oncologists through an online medical chart review. Progression, PFS, and OS were compared using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, and treatment changes using chi-square tests. RESULTS: Of 597 imatinib resistant or intolerant patients, 301 initiated nilotinib and 296 dasatinib as second-line therapy. Nilotinib was associated with a lower risk of progression (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.27; p = 0.021) and longer PFS (HR = 0.48; p = 0.030) than dasatinib, with a median follow-up time of 11 months for nilotinib and 10 months for dasatinib. Nilotinib patients had a lower estimated hazard of mortality than dasatinib patients, though not statistically significant (HR = 0.46; p = 0.067). When treatment changes were classified by the physicians' justifications, fewer nilotinib patients had treatment changes due to ineffectiveness (2.0% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.041) or drug holidays due to intolerance (0.0% vs. 1.7%, p = 0.024) than dasatinib patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among CML-CP patients in this retrospective chart review who switched from imatinib to either nilotinib or dasatinib, nilotinib was associated with a significantly lower risk of progression and longer PFS than dasatinib. Nilotinib patients were also less likely than dasatinib patients to subsequently have treatment changes due to ineffectiveness or drug holidays due to intolerance. These findings could be subject to unobserved confounders.","['Griffin, James D', 'Guerin, Annie', 'Chen, Lei', 'Macalalad, Alexander R', 'Luo, Jiayuan', 'Ionescu-Ittu, Raluca', 'Wu, Eric Qiong']","['Griffin JD', 'Guerin A', 'Chen L', 'Macalalad AR', 'Luo J', 'Ionescu-Ittu R', 'Wu EQ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Dasatinib', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Thiazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/23 06:00,2014/01/24 06:00,['2013/03/23 06:00'],"['2013/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1185/03007995.2013.789012 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2013 Jun;29(6):623-31. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2013.789012.

The implementation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) marked a major advance in CML therapy; however, there are problems with current treatment. For example, relapse occurs when these drugs are discontinued in the majority of patients who have achieved a complete molecular response on TKI and these agents are less effective in patients with mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain. Importantly, TKI can effectively target proliferating mature cells, but do not eradicate quiescent leukaemic stem cells (LSCs), therefore allowing disease persistence despite treatment. It is essential that alternative strategies are used to target the LSC population. BCR-ABL activation is responsible for the modulation of different signalling pathways, which allows the LSC fraction to evade cell death. Several pathways have been shown to be modulated by BCR-ABL, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR, JAK-STAT and autophagy signalling pathways. Targeting components of these survival pathways, alone or in combination with TKI, therefore represents an attractive potential therapeutic approach for targeting the LSC. However, many pathways are also active in normal stem cells. Therefore, potential targets must be validated to effectively eradicate CML stem cells while sparing normal counterparts. This review summarizes the main pathways modulated in CML stem cells, the recent developments and the use of novel drugs to target components in these pathways which may be used to target the LSC population.

It exhibits a steady increase in incidence, thus necessitating an urgent development of effective new treatments. METHODS: Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) and TNFalpha-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL), have emerged as promising new anti-MPM agents. To develop effective new treatments, the proapoptotic effects of PIs, MG132 or Bortezomib, and TRAIL were investigated in MPM cell lines NCI-H2052, NCI-H2452 and NCI-H28, which represent three major histological types of human MPM. RESULTS: Treatment with 0.5-1 muM MG132 alone or 30 ng/mL Bortezomib alone induced a limited apoptosis in MPM cells associated with the elevated Mcl-1 protein level and hyperactive PI3K/Akt signaling. However, whereas 10-20 ng/ml TRAIL alone induced a limited apoptosis as well, TRAIL and PI combination triggered a robust apoptosis in all three MPM cell lines. The robust proapoptotic activity was found to be the consequence of a positive feedback mechanism-governed amplification of caspase activation and cleavage of both Mcl-1 and Akt proteins, and exhibited a relative selectivity in MPM cells than in non-tumorigenic Met-5A mesothelial cells. CONCLUSION: The combinatorial treatment using TRAIL and PI may represent an effective new treatment for MPMs.","['Yuan, Bao-Zhu', 'Chapman, Joshua', 'Ding, Min', 'Wang, Junzhi', 'Jiang, Binghua', 'Rojanasakul, Yon', 'Reynolds, Steven H']","['Yuan BZ', 'Chapman J', 'Ding M', 'Wang J', 'Jiang B', 'Rojanasakul Y', 'Reynolds SH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Mesothelioma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Mesothelioma, Malignant', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pleural Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2013/03/23 06:00,2015/01/28 06:00,['2013/03/23 06:00'],"['2012/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-13-140 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-13-140 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2013 Mar 22;13:140. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-13-140.,20130322,,PMC3665596,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all patients, leukemic LGLs display upregulation of phosphorylated STAT3 (P-STAT3) that activates expression of many antiapoptotic genes. To investigate the mechanisms maintaining STAT3 aberrantly phosphorylated using transcriptional protein and functional assays, we analyzed interleukin (IL)-6 and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3), 2 key factors of the JAK/STAT pathway that induce and inhibit STAT3 activation, respectively. We showed that IL-6 was highly expressed and released by the patients' peripheral blood LGL-depleted population, accounting for a trans-signaling process. By neutralizing IL-6 or its specific receptor with specific antibodies, a significant reduction of P-STAT3 levels and, consequently, LGL survival was demonstrated. In addition, we found that SOCS3 was down-modulated in LGL and unresponsive to IL-6 stimulation. By treating neoplastic LGLs with a demethylating agent, IL-6-mediated SOCS3 expression was restored with consequent P-STAT3 and myeloid cell leukemia-1 down-modulation. Methylation in the SOCS3 promoter was not detectable, suggesting that an epigenetic inhibition mechanism occurs at a different site. Our data indicate that loss of the inhibitor SOCS3 cooperates with IL-6 to maintain JAK/STAT pathway activation, thus contributing to leukemic LGL survival, and suggest a role of demethylating agents in the treatment of this disorder.","['Teramo, Antonella', 'Gattazzo, Cristina', 'Passeri, Francesca', 'Lico, Albana', 'Tasca, Giulia', 'Cabrelle, Anna', 'Martini, Veronica', 'Frezzato, Federica', 'Trimarco, Valentina', 'Ave, Elisa', 'Boscaro, Elisa', 'Piazza, Francesco', 'Facco, Monica', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Zambello, Renato']","['Teramo A', 'Gattazzo C', 'Passeri F', 'Lico A', 'Tasca G', 'Cabrelle A', 'Martini V', 'Frezzato F', 'Trimarco V', 'Ave E', 'Boscaro E', 'Piazza F', 'Facco M', 'Trentin L', 'Semenzato G', 'Zambello R']","['Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2013/03/22 06:00,2013/07/23 06:00,['2013/03/22 06:00'],"['2013/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58674-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-07-441378 [doi]']",ppublish,"Blood. 2013 May 9;121(19):3843-54, S1. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-07-441378.

A prerequisite is stable, undetectable BCR-ABL1. It is not known how many patients achieve this response or the factors associated with its achievement. We examined 423 de novo imatinib-treated patients to determine the cumulative incidence of achieving the discontinuation criteria as defined in the CML8 study (>/=2 years of undetectable BCR-ABL1 [Stable MR(4.5)]), and predictive factors. After 8 years of imatinib, the cumulative incidence of Stable MR(4.5) was 36.5%. Therefore, 9% to 15% of first-line imatinib-treated patients would maintain remission after discontinuation. The BCR-ABL1 level at 3 months and factors at diagnosis were examined for association with Stable MR(4.5): Sokal risk, age, sex, and assigned imatinib dose. The only independent predictors were female sex (54.4% vs 27.2%; P = .018) and the 3-month BCR-ABL1 (P < .001). The highest cumulative incidence of Stable MR(4.5) after 8 years was 78.2% for patients with BCR-ABL1 </= 0.10%(IS) at 3 months (n = 38). Time to major molecular response (MMR) influenced the time to reach Stable MR(4.5) (P < .001), suggesting slower dynamics of response with a delayed MMR.

Obatoclax was developed as a pan-inhibitor of antiapoptotic members of the B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family of proteins, which control the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Resistance to apoptosis through dysregulation of BCL-2 family members is commonly observed in hematological malignancies, and can be linked to therapeutic resistance and poor clinical outcomes. By inhibiting pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins, including MCL-1, obatoclax is proposed to (1) trigger cell death as a single agent, and (2) potentiate the anticancer effects of other therapeutics. Preclinical investigations have supported these proposals and have provided evidence suggestive of a promising therapeutic index for this drug. Phase I trials of obatoclax mesylate in leukemia and lymphoma have defined well-tolerated regimens and have identified transient neurotoxicity as the most common adverse effect of this drug. In these studies, a limited number of objective responses were observed, along with hematological improvement in a larger proportion of treated patients. Published Phase II evaluations in lymphoma and myelofibrosis, however, have not reported robust single-agent activity. Emerging evidence from ongoing preclinical and clinical investigations suggests that the full potential of obatoclax mesylate as a novel anticancer agent may be realized (1) in rational combination treatments, and (2) when guided by molecular predictors of therapeutic response. By understanding the molecular underpinnings of obatoclax response, along with optimal therapeutic regimens and indications, the potential of obatoclax mesylate for the treatment of hematological malignancies may be further clarified.","['Goard, Carolyn A', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Goard CA', 'Schimmer AD']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Core Evid,Core evidence,101256593,,,,2013/03/22 06:00,2013/03/22 06:01,['2013/03/22 06:00'],"['2013/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CE.S42568 [doi]', 'ce-8-015 [pii]']",ppublish,Core Evid. 2013;8:15-26. doi: 10.2147/CE.S42568.

The expression level of MN1, microRNA-20 (miR-20a), and microRNA-181b (miR-181b) in bone marrow mononuclear cells was measured in 158 newly diagnosed AML patients and 20 cases of normal healthy donors by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. All AML patients significantly overexpressed MN1 at the level of 0.01983 (P < 0.001) compared with normal controls. High MN1 expression was associated with spleen involvement (P = 0.037), NPM1 wild type (P = 0.001), lower miR-20a expression levels (P = 0.015), and higher miR-181b expression levels (P = 0.035). MiR-20a (P = 0.029) and miR-181b (P = 0.017) overexpressed in the bone marrow cells of patients with certain subtypes of AML compared with healthy donors. High MN1 expressers had lower complete remission (CR) rates and shorter overall survival (OS) within the Southwest Oncology Group classification. In multivariable models, high MN1 expression was associated with worse CR rates (P = 0.01), relapse-free survival (RFS; P = 0.02), and OS (P = 0.02); high miR-20a expression was associated with higher CR rates (P = 0.008) and longer OS (P = 0.04), whereas high miR-181b expression was associated with lower CR rates (P = 0.03), and shorter RFS (P = 0.045) and OS (P = 0.017). High MN1 expression confers worse prognosis in Chinese adult patients with de novo AML.

Secondary objectives included investigating the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of the combination. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients received vorinostat (200 mg orally, three times a day, for 14 days) on a 21-day cycle, combined with 2 different alvocidib administration schedules: a 1-hour intravenous infusion, daily x 5; or a 30-minute loading infusion followed by a 4-hour maintenance infusion, weekly x 2. The alvocidib dose was escalated using a standard 3+3 design. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled and treated. The alvocidib MTD was 20 mg/m(2) (30-minute loading infusion) followed by 20 mg/m(2) (4-hour maintenance infusion) on days one and eight, in combination with vorinostat. The most frequently encountered toxicities were cytopenias, fatigue, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and QT prolongation. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were cardiac arrhythmia-atrial fibrillation and QT prolongation. No objective responses were achieved although 13 of 26 evaluable patients exhibited stable disease. Alvocidib seemed to alter vorinostat pharmacokinetics, whereas alvocidib pharmacokinetics were unaffected by vorinostat. Ex vivo exposure of leukemia cells to plasma obtained from patients after alvocidib treatment blocked vorinostat-mediated p21(CIP1) induction and downregulated Mcl-1 and p-RNA Pol II for some specimens, although parallel in vivo bone marrow responses were infrequent. CONCLUSIONS: Alvocidib combined with vorinostat is well tolerated. Although disease stabilization occurred in some heavily pretreated patients, objective responses were not obtained with these schedules.","['Holkova, Beata', 'Supko, Jeffrey G', 'Ames, Matthew M', 'Reid, Joel M', 'Shapiro, Geoffrey I', 'Perkins, Edward Brent', 'Ramakrishnan, Viswanathan', 'Tombes, Mary Beth', 'Honeycutt, Connie', 'McGovern, Renee M', 'Kmieciak, Maciej', 'Shrader, Ellen', 'Wellons, Martha D', 'Sankala, Heidi', 'Doyle, Austin', 'Wright, John', 'Roberts, John D', 'Grant, Steven']","['Holkova B', 'Supko JG', 'Ames MM', 'Reid JM', 'Shapiro GI', 'Perkins EB', 'Ramakrishnan V', 'Tombes MB', 'Honeycutt C', 'McGovern RM', 'Kmieciak M', 'Shrader E', 'Wellons MD', 'Sankala H', 'Doyle A', 'Wright J', 'Roberts JD', 'Grant S']","['Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA. bholkova@mcvh-vcu.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*drug therapy', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Piperidines/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vorinostat', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/22 06:00,2013/09/28 06:00,['2013/03/22 06:00'],"['2013/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-2926 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2926 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Apr 1;19(7):1873-83. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2926.

Proteasomes mediate degradation of regulatory proteins of the p53, Bcl-2, and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) families that are aberrantly active in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL remains an incurable disease, and new treatments are especially needed in the relapsed/refractory setting. We therefore investigated the effects of the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (CFZ) in CLL cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumor cells from CLL patients were assayed in vitro using immunoblotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In addition, a p53 dominant-negative construct was generated in a human B-cell line. RESULTS: Unlike bortezomib, CFZ potently induces apoptosis in CLL patient cells in the presence of human serum. CLL cells have significantly lower basal CT-L activity compared to normal B and T cells, although activity is inhibited similarly in T cells versus CLL. Co-culture of CLL cells on stroma protected from CFZ-mediated cytotoxicity; however, PI3K inhibition significantly diminished this stromal protection. CFZ-mediated cytotoxicity in leukemic B cells is caspase-dependent and occurs irrespective of p53 status. In CLL cells, CFZ promotes atypical activation of NF-kappaB evidenced by loss of cytoplasmic IkappaBalpha, phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, and increased p50/p65 DNA binding, without subsequent increases in canonical NF-kappaB target gene transcription. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data provide new mechanistic insights into the activity of CFZ in CLL and support phase I investigation of CFZ in this disease.","['Gupta, Sneha V', 'Hertlein, Erin', 'Lu, Yanhui', 'Sass, Ellen J', 'Lapalombella, Rosa', 'Chen, Timothy L', 'Davis, Melanie E', 'Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Jarjoura, David', 'Byrd, John C', 'Lucas, David M']","['Gupta SV', 'Hertlein E', 'Lu Y', 'Sass EJ', 'Lapalombella R', 'Chen TL', 'Davis ME', 'Woyach JA', 'Lehman A', 'Jarjoura D', 'Byrd JC', 'Lucas DM']","['College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzyl Compounds)', '0 (Boc-D-FMK)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated)', '0 (Indolizines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Pyridinium Compounds)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '4V8ECV0NBQ (dinaciclib)', '72X6E3J5AR (carfilzomib)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Benzyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Caspase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclic N-Oxides', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated/pharmacology', 'Indolizines', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Subunits/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyridinium Compounds/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2013/03/22 06:00,2013/11/13 06:00,['2013/03/22 06:00'],"['2013/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-2754 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2754 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 May 1;19(9):2406-19. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2754.

The anti-cancer activity of reovirus has been attributed to both its direct oncolytic activity and the enhancement of anti-tumor immune responses. In this study, we have investigated the direct effect of reovirus on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and its potential to enhance innate immune responses against AML, including the testing of primary samples from patients. Reovirus was found to replicate in and kill AML cell lines, and to reduce cell viability in primary AML samples. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon alpha (IFNalpha) and the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (known as RANTES [regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed, and secreted]) were also secreted from AML cells in response to virus treatment. In addition, reovirus-mediated activation of natural killer (NK) cells, within the context of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, stimulated their anti-leukemia response, with increased NK degranulation and IFNgamma production and enhanced killing of AML targets. These data suggest that reovirus has the potential as both a direct cytotoxic and an immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of AML.","['Hall, Kathryn', 'Scott, Karen J', 'Rose, Ailsa', 'Desborough, Michael', 'Harrington, Kevin', 'Pandha, Hardev', 'Parrish, Christopher', 'Vile, Richard', 'Coffey, Matt', 'Bowen, David', 'Errington-Mais, Fiona', 'Melcher, Alan A']","['Hall K', 'Scott KJ', 'Rose A', 'Desborough M', 'Harrington K', 'Pandha H', 'Parrish C', 'Vile R', 'Coffey M', 'Bowen D', 'Errington-Mais F', 'Melcher AA']","[""Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine, St. James's University Hospital , Leeds, United Kingdom .""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biores Open Access,BioResearch open access,101579333,,,,2012/01/01 00:00,2012/01/01 00:01,['2013/03/22 06:00'],"['2013/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1089/biores.2012.0205 [doi]', '10.1089/biores.2012.0205 [pii]']",ppublish,Biores Open Access. 2012 Jan;1(1):3-15. doi: 10.1089/biores.2012.0205.,,,PMC3559227,,,['13244/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,['NOTNLM'],"['NK cells', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'immunotherapy', 'oncolytic virus', 'reovirus']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only those patients able to achieve a second remission with no minimal residual disease (MRD) have a hope for long-term survival in the context of a subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We have treated five relapsed B-ALL subjects with autologous T cells expressing a CD19-specific CD28/CD3zeta second-generation dual-signaling chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) termed 19-28z. All patients with persistent morphological disease or MRD(+) disease upon T cell infusion demonstrated rapid tumor eradication and achieved MRD(-) complete remissions as assessed by deep sequencing polymerase chain reaction. Therapy was well tolerated, although significant cytokine elevations, specifically observed in those patients with morphologic evidence of disease at the time of treatment, required lymphotoxic steroid therapy to ameliorate cytokine-mediated toxicities. Indeed, cytokine elevations directly correlated to tumor burden at the time of CAR-modified T cell infusions. Tumor cells from one patient with relapsed disease after CAR-modified T cell therapy, who was ineligible for additional allo-HSCT or T cell therapy, exhibited persistent expression of CD19 and sensitivity to autologous 19-28z T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which suggests potential clinical benefit of additional CAR-modified T cell infusions. These results demonstrate the marked antitumor efficacy of 19-28z CAR-modified T cells in patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL and the reliability of this therapy to induce profound molecular remissions, forming a highly effective bridge to potentially curative therapy with subsequent allo-HSCT.","['Brentjens, Renier J', 'Davila, Marco L', 'Riviere, Isabelle', 'Park, Jae', 'Wang, Xiuyan', 'Cowell, Lindsay G', 'Bartido, Shirley', 'Stefanski, Jolanta', 'Taylor, Clare', 'Olszewska, Malgorzata', 'Borquez-Ojeda, Oriana', 'Qu, Jinrong', 'Wasielewska, Teresa', 'He, Qing', 'Bernal, Yvette', 'Rijo, Ivelise V', 'Hedvat, Cyrus', 'Kobos, Rachel', 'Curran, Kevin', 'Steinherz, Peter', 'Jurcic, Joseph', 'Rosenblat, Todd', 'Maslak, Peter', 'Frattini, Mark', 'Sadelain, Michel']","['Brentjens RJ', 'Davila ML', 'Riviere I', 'Park J', 'Wang X', 'Cowell LG', 'Bartido S', 'Stefanski J', 'Taylor C', 'Olszewska M', 'Borquez-Ojeda O', 'Qu J', 'Wasielewska T', 'He Q', 'Bernal Y', 'Rijo IV', 'Hedvat C', 'Kobos R', 'Curran K', 'Steinherz P', 'Jurcic J', 'Rosenblat T', 'Maslak P', 'Frattini M', 'Sadelain M']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA. brentjer@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Sci Transl Med,Science translational medicine,101505086,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/22 06:00,2013/09/27 06:00,['2013/03/22 06:00'],"['2013/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['5/177/177ra38 [pii]', '10.1126/scitranslmed.3005930 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Transl Med. 2013 Mar 20;5(177):177ra38. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.3005930.,,,PMC3742551,,,"['R25 CA020449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI097403/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA076292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA148821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS480775'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, direct evidence of a link between infection and the fate of internalized virus has been difficult to obtain. To directly address this question, we generated human 293 cell lines stably expressing comparable cell surface levels of three different members of the somatostatin receptor family (SSTR) which have natural differences in intracellular trafficking. Utilizing a glycoprotein that recognizes SSTR, we found that distinctive receptor subtype-specific destinations correlated with observable differences in the level of infection. Infection via SSTR-2 and -3 is restricted at a point after receptor binding and endocytosis but prior to penetration into the host cytoplasm. In contrast, entry via SSTR-5 featured a slower internalization with greater dependence on cholesterol. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that virus bound to SSTR-5 was directed to an intracellular environment that allowed near-wild-type (WT) levels of penetration, possibly due to a more favorable complement of host cell proteases, whereas SSTR-2 and -3 directed virions to a degradative compartment in which cytosol penetration was less efficient. Taken together, the results support that the superior receptor capacity of SSTR-5 results from its internalization into a cellular compartment that is more favorable to the cytoplasmic penetration of viral cores and reverse transcription. They suggest that the intracellular destination of internalized complexes is an important characteristic of a virus receptor and may have exerted a selective pressure on the choice of an entry receptor during evolution of viral glycoproteins.","['Krueger, Robin L', 'Albritton, Lorraine M']","['Krueger RL', 'Albritton LM']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology & Biochemistry, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Somatostatin)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Somatostatin/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Virus/*biosynthesis', '*Virus Internalization']",2013/03/22 06:00,2013/06/25 06:00,['2013/03/22 06:00'],"['2013/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00398-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00398-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 May;87(10):5916-25. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00398-13.

Although several ongoing trials are evaluating the level of expression of ERCC1, no consensus has been reached regarding a method for evaluation. METHODS: We used the 8F1 antibody to measure the level of expression of ERCC1 protein by means of immunohistochemical analysis in a validation set of samples obtained from 494 patients in two independent phase 3 trials (the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group JBR.10 and the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9633 trial from the Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation Biology project). We compared the results of repeated staining of the entire original set of samples obtained from 589 patients in the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial Biology study, which had led to the initial correlation between the absence of ERCC1 expression and platinum response, with our previous results in the same tumors. We mapped the epitope recognized by 16 commercially available ERCC1 antibodies and investigated the capacity of the different ERCC1 isoforms to repair platinum-induced DNA damage. RESULTS: We were unable to validate the predictive effect of immunostaining for ERCC1 protein. The discordance in the results of staining for ERCC1 suggested a change in the performance of the 8F1 antibody since 2006. We found that none of the 16 antibodies could distinguish among the four ERCC1 protein isoforms, whereas only one isoform produced a protein that had full capacities for nucleotide excision repair and cisplatin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical analysis with the use of currently available ERCC1 antibodies did not specifically detect the unique functional ERCC1 isoform. As a result, its usefulness in guiding therapeutic decision making is limited.

Accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment is important since the disease can be aggressive in these patients. This paper is a case report with literature review, emphasizing on the diagnosis and treatment of Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis. FINDINGS: A 27-year-old male with chronic myelogenous leukemia with history of bone marrow transplantation presented with floaters in his right eye. Fundus exam showed bilateral, multifocal retinochoroiditis with subsequent development of a mild vitritis. Serum cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis antibody titers and syphilis screen were negative. Aqueous polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis revealed the presence of Toxoplasma gondii DNA OU. Clindamycin (1.0 mg/0.1 mL) was injected bilateral intravitreal OU twice at 4 days apart with subsequent resolution of retinochoroiditis. CONCLUSIONS: When evaluating retinochoroiditis in an immunocompromised patient, one must keep a high index of suspicion for atypical presentations of well-known disease entities. Aqueous and vitreous samples for PCR can be useful in obtaining an accurate diagnosis and therefore provide appropriate management for the patient. Intravitreal clindamycin is an option for treatment in these patients.","['Hazan, Albert', 'Patel, Rakesh M', 'Levinson, David', 'Mian, Umar', 'Gritz, David C']","['Hazan A', 'Patel RM', 'Levinson D', 'Mian U', 'Gritz DC']","['Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10467, USA. dgritz@montefiore.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Ophthalmic Inflamm Infect,Journal of ophthalmic inflammation and infection,101553216,,,,2013/03/22 06:00,2013/03/22 06:01,['2013/03/22 06:00'],"['2012/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/22 06:01 [medline]']","['1869-5760-3-23 [pii]', '10.1186/1869-5760-3-23 [doi]']",epublish,J Ophthalmic Inflamm Infect. 2013 Jan 28;3(1):23. doi: 10.1186/1869-5760-3-23.,20130128,,PMC3605077,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E. Fries (Annonaceae). The crude oils, obtained by hydrodistillation procedures, were chemically analyzed by GC/MS. The obtained data indicated the predominance of sesquiterpenes (89.8 +/- 0.7%), the main compounds being germacrene D (47 +/-+/- 1%) and bicyclogermacrene (37 +/- 1%). These oils also contained the monoterpene verbanyl acetate (0.5 +/- 0.06%) and the diterpene phytol (1.2 +/- 0.3%). The crude oils obtained from leaves were pooled and tested in vitro against six cancer cell lineages--murine melanoma (B16F10-Nex2), human glioblastome (U87), human cervical carcinoma (HeLa), human leukemia (HL-60), human colon carcinoma (HCT), human breast adenocarcinoma (SKBr), and human melanoma (A2058), as well as against a non-tumorigenic human cell line (HFF). Since the essential oil reduced more than 50% of the viability of several tumor cells at 100 microg/mL, indicating the presence of active compounds, the crude material was subjected to fractionation over a SiO2/AgNO3 column. This procedure afforded different fractions composed of pure as well as different mixtures of bicyclogermacrene and germacrene D, which were tested against the same tumor cell lines, indicating a significant cytotoxic potential against HL-60 cells. These results suggested that the crudeoils and their components, mainly germacrene D, could be used as prototypes for the development of new anti-cancer agents for the treatment of human leukemia.","['da Silva, Erica Biolcati P', 'Matsuo, Alisson L', 'Figueiredo, Carlos R', 'Chaves, Mariana H', 'Sartorelli, Patricia', 'Lago, Joao Henrique G']","['da Silva EB', 'Matsuo AL', 'Figueiredo CR', 'Chaves MH', 'Sartorelli P', 'Lago JH']","['Instituto de Ciencias Ambientais, Quimicas e Farmaceuticas, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, 09972-270 Diadema, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Prod Commun,Natural product communications,101477873,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Oils, Volatile)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annonaceae/*chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Oils, Volatile/*analysis/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry']",2013/03/22 06:00,2013/04/30 06:00,['2013/03/22 06:00'],"['2013/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nat Prod Commun. 2013 Feb;8(2):277-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on in vitro and in vivo evidence, we report here that fenretinide, a well-tolerated vitamin A derivative, is capable of eradicating LSCs but not normal hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells at physiologically achievable concentrations. Fenretinide exerted a selective cytotoxic effect on primary AML CD34(+) cells, especially the LSC-enriched CD34(+)CD38(-) subpopulation, whereas no significant effect was observed on normal counterparts. Methylcellulose colony formation assays further showed that fenretinide significantly suppressed the formation of colonies derived from AML CD34(+) cells but not those from normal CD34(+) cells. Moreover, fenretinide significantly reduced the in vivo engraftment of AML stem cells but not normal hematopoietic stem cells in a nonobese diabetic/SCID mouse xenotransplantation model. Mechanistic studies revealed that fenretinide-induced cell death was linked to a series of characteristic events, including the rapid generation of reactive oxygen species, induction of genes associated with stress responses and apoptosis, and repression of genes involved in NF-kappaB and Wnt signaling. Further bioinformatic analysis revealed that the fenretinide-down-regulated genes were significantly correlated with the existing poor-prognosis signatures in AML patients. Based on these findings, we propose that fenretinide is a potent agent that selectively targets LSCs, and may be of value in the treatment of AML.","['Zhang, Hui', 'Mi, Jian-Qing', 'Fang, Hai', 'Wang, Zhao', 'Wang, Chun', 'Wu, Lin', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Minden, Mark', 'Yang, Wen-Tao', 'Wang, Huan-Wei', 'Li, Jun-Min', 'Xi, Xiao-Dong', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Zhang, Ji', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Wang, Kan-Kan']","['Zhang H', 'Mi JQ', 'Fang H', 'Wang Z', 'Wang C', 'Wu L', 'Zhang B', 'Minden M', 'Yang WT', 'Wang HW', 'Li JM', 'Xi XD', 'Chen SJ', 'Zhang J', 'Chen Z', 'Wang KK']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Computational Biology', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2013/03/21 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2013/03/21 06:00'],"['2013/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1302352110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1302352110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Apr 2;110(14):5606-11. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1302352110.

Since peripheral blood stem cell bank from unrelated volunteer donor has been started in Japan, use of PBSC allografts may be increased. Therefore we surveyed the outcomes of Japanese leukemia children after PBSC and BM transplantation. PROCEDURE: This retrospective study compared the outcomes of 661 children (0-18 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who received their first allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT; n = 90) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT; n = 571) from HLA-matched siblings between January 1996 and December 2007. RESULT: Neutrophil recovery was faster after PBSCT than after BMT (ALL: P < 0.0001; AML: P = 0.0002), as was platelet recovery (ALL: P = 0.0008; AML: P = 0.0848). However, the cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was higher after PBSCT than after BMT (ALL: 26.0% vs. 9.9%, P = 0.0066; AML: 41.6% vs. 11.1%, P < 0.0001). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was lower after PBSCT than after BMT for ALL (40.6% vs. 57.1%, P = 0.0257). The 5-year overall survival (OS) was lower after PBSCT than after BMT for ALL (42.4% vs. 63.7%, P = 0.0032) and AML (49.8% vs. 71.8%, P = 0.0163). Multivariate analysis revealed the use of PBSC was a significant risk factor for DFS and OS. PBSCT and BMT did not differ in relapse rate, acute GvHD for ALL and AML, or in DFS for AML. CONCLUSION: PBSC allografts in Japanese children engraft faster but are associated with poorer survival and increased chronic GvHD.","['Shinzato, Aki', 'Tabuchi, Ken', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Inoue, Masami', 'Inagaki, Jiro', 'Yabe, Hiromasa', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Kato, Koji', 'Ohta, Hideaki', 'Kigasawa, Hisato', 'Kitoh, Toshiyuki', 'Ogawa, Atsushi', 'Takahashi, Yoshiyuki', 'Sasahara, Yoji', 'Kato, Shun-Ichi', 'Adachi, Souichi']","['Shinzato A', 'Tabuchi K', 'Atsuta Y', 'Inoue M', 'Inagaki J', 'Yabe H', 'Koh K', 'Kato K', 'Ohta H', 'Kigasawa H', 'Kitoh T', 'Ogawa A', 'Takahashi Y', 'Sasahara Y', 'Kato S', 'Adachi S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asians', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*mortality/therapy', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', '*Living Donors', 'Male', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/therapy', 'Risk Factors', '*Siblings', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2013/03/21 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/03/21 06:00'],"['2012/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24524 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Sep;60(9):1513-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24524.

Consecutive consenting patients (acute myeloid leukemia: N = 71; acute lymphoblastic leukemia: N = 37), at a median age of 37 (16-57) years, who had relapsed 7.9 (1.3-132) months post-HSCT, were treated with three cytarabine-based intensive regimens as reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), followed by infusion of mobilized HSC from the original donors. There were four treatment-related mortalities (TRMs). Of 104 evaluable cases, 72 patients (67%) achieved complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi). The median overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort was 11.6 months. The OS of patients achieving CR/CRi after the first RIC/HSCT was 18.8 months, as compared with 3.9 months for those not (P < 0.01). For 32 patients with nonremission, 11 received a repeat RIC-HSCT, leading to CR/CRi in three cases. Therefore, 75/108 (69%) of patients achieved CR/CRi after one or two courses of RIC-HSCT. Among CR/CRi patients, 48 cases relapsed again after 6.1 (1.0-64.4) months. Thirty cases received a repeat RIC-HSCT, leading to CR/CRi in 22 patients. Multivariate analyses showed a significant impact of remission duration after initial HSCT (P = 0.026) and the presence of acute graft-versus-host disease after RIC-HSCT (P = 0.011) on CR/CRi. RIC-HSCT as primary treatment for acute leukemic relapses post-HSCT induced a high CR rate with low TRM.

Overall, 4% of patients carried mutant RAS alleles. Notably, FLT3 mutations, which were found in 2% of patients, were mutually exclusive with RAS mutations. Patients with RAS mutations had a higher white blood cell count as well as bone marrow blasts compared with patients carrying wild-type RAS. However, no differences were observed between both groups regarding the risk of AML transformation (9% vs. 7%) and overall survival (395 days vs. 500 days, P = 0.057).

Given the progressive ageing of the general population, the incidence of the disease in elderly people is expected to further increase in the years to come. Along with cytogenetics at diagnosis, age represents the most relevant prognostic factor in AML, in that the outcome steadily declines with increasing age. Reasons for poor prognosis include more frequent unfavourable karyotype and other adverse biologic characteristics, such as high rates of expression of genes drug resistance related and high prevalence of secondary AML. Noticeably, as compared with young adults, poorer results in elderly patients have been reported within any cytogenetic and molecular prognostic subgroup, because of frequent comorbid diseases, which render many patients ineligible to intensive chemotherapy. Therefore, predictive models have been developed with the aim of achieving best therapeutic results avoiding unnecessary toxicity. Following conventional induction therapy, older AML patients have complete remission rates in the range of 45-65%, and fewer than 10% of them survive for a minimum of 5 years. On the other hand, hypomethylating agents, such as azacytidine and decitabine offer the possibility of long-term disease control without necessarily achieving complete remission and can represent a reasonable alternative to intensive chemotherapy. Either intensive chemotherapy or hypomethylating agents have lights and shadows, and the therapeutic selection is often influenced by physician's and patient's attitude rather than definite criteria. Research is progress in order to assess predictive biologic factors, which would help clinicians in the selection of patients who can take actual benefit from different therapeutic options.","['Ferrara, Felicetto']",['Ferrara F'],"['Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA-Cytosine Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Cytosine Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/surgery', 'Middle Aged', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2013/03/21 06:00,2014/04/26 06:00,['2013/03/21 06:00'],"['2012/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.2046 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2014 Mar;32(1):1-9. doi: 10.1002/hon.2046.

Although accumulating evidence indicates inherited predisposition to ALL, the genetic basis of ALL susceptibility in diverse ancestry has not been comprehensively examined. METHODS: We performed a multiethnic genome-wide association study in 1605 children with ALL and 6661 control subjects after adjusting for population structure, with validation in three replication series of 845 case subjects and 4316 control subjects. Association was tested by two-sided logistic regression. RESULTS: A novel ALL susceptibility locus at 10p12.31-12.2 (BMI1-PIP4K2A, rs7088318, P = 1.1 x 10(-11)) was identified in the genome-wide association study, with independent replication in European Americans, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans (P = .001, .009, and .04, respectively). Association was also validated at four known ALL susceptibility loci: ARID5B, IKZF1, CEBPE, and CDKN2A/2B. Associations at ARID5B, IKZF1, and BMI1-PIP4K2A variants were consistent across ethnicity, with multiple independent signals at IKZF1 and BMI1-PIP4K2A loci. The frequency of ARID5B and BMI1-PIP4K2A variants differed by ethnicity, in parallel with ethnic differences in ALL incidence. Suggestive evidence for modifying effects of age on genetic predisposition to ALL was also observed. ARID5B, IKZF1, CEBPE, and BMI1-PIP4K2A variants cumulatively conferred strong predisposition to ALL, with children carrying six to eight copies of risk alleles at a ninefold (95% confidence interval = 6.9 to 11.8) higher ALL risk relative to those carrying zero to one risk allele at these four single nucleotide polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate strong associations between inherited genetic variation and ALL susceptibility in children and shed new light on ALL molecular etiology in diverse ancestry.","['Xu, Heng', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Perez-Andreu, Virginia', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Fan, Yiping', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Scheet, Paul', 'Burchard, Esteban Gonzalez', 'Eng, Celeste', 'Huntsman, Scott', 'Torgerson, Dara G', 'Dean, Michael', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Martin, Paul L', 'Camitta, Bruce M', 'Bowman, W Paul', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Carroll, William L', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Bhojwani, Deepa', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Evans, William E', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Yang, Jun J']","['Xu H', 'Yang W', 'Perez-Andreu V', 'Devidas M', 'Fan Y', 'Cheng C', 'Pei D', 'Scheet P', 'Burchard EG', 'Eng C', 'Huntsman S', 'Torgerson DG', 'Dean M', 'Winick NJ', 'Martin PL', 'Camitta BM', 'Bowman WP', 'Willman CL', 'Carroll WL', 'Mullighan CG', 'Bhojwani D', 'Hunger SP', 'Pui CH', 'Evans WE', 'Relling MV', 'Loh ML', 'Yang JJ']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-3678, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (ARID5B protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '142805-41-2 (CEBPE protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (PIP4K2A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 7)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'African Americans/*genetics', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Hispanic or Latino/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 7/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*ethnology/*genetics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Whites/*genetics']",2013/03/21 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2013/03/21 06:00'],"['2013/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['djt042 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djt042 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2013 May 15;105(10):733-42. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djt042.

Induction by fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide (FMC), for up to 4 cycles, was followed by alemtuzumab (A) consolidation, up to 12 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 25 patients treated with FMC, 21 subsequently received alemtuzumab. Overall response rate to FMC was 68%, comprising 6 complete remissions (all bone-marrow confirmed) and 11 partial remissions. Alemtuzumab consolidation increased the intent-to-treat overall response rate to 92% (12 complete remissions; 11 partial remissions). Median overall survival after FMC-A was 17.1 months and median progression-free survival was 11.9 months. Progression-free survival tended to be shorter for patients with high-level T-cell leukemia 1 oncoprotein expression. Hematologic toxicities were the most frequent grade 3/4 side effects under FMC-A. Exclusively in the 21 alemtuzumab-consolidated patients, 13 cytomegalovirus reactivations were observed; 9 of these 13 represented a clinically relevant infection. CONCLUSIONS: FMC-A is a safe and efficient protocol in T-PLL, which compares favorably to published data.","['Hopfinger, Georg', 'Busch, Raymonde', 'Pflug, Natali', 'Weit, Nicole', 'Westermann, Anne', 'Fink, Anna-Maria', 'Cramer, Paula', 'Reinart, Nina', 'Winkler, Dirk', 'Fingerle-Rowson, Gunter', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Kandler, Gabriele', 'Eichhorst, Barbara', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Herling, Marco']","['Hopfinger G', 'Busch R', 'Pflug N', 'Weit N', 'Westermann A', 'Fink AM', 'Cramer P', 'Reinart N', 'Winkler D', 'Fingerle-Rowson G', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Dohner H', 'Kandler G', 'Eichhorst B', 'Hallek M', 'Herling M']","['Third Medical Department, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives']",2013/03/21 06:00,2013/08/24 06:00,['2013/03/21 06:00'],"['2012/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.27972 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2013 Jun 15;119(12):2258-67. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27972.

RNA and DNA were extracted from bone marrow samples of 186 (106 male and 80 female) pediatric patients younger than 17 year with de novo AML. Mutations and chromosomal rearrangements were detected by sequencing of a corresponding gene. NPM1 mutations were found in 5.2%, FLT3 mutations in 12.1%, c-KIT mutations in 3.7% of the patients. NPM1 mutations were associated with the absence of chromosomal aberrations (P=0.007) and FLT3/ITD (P=0.018). New data on incidence of c-KIT mutations in various AML subtypes as well as new variations of c-KIT mutations in the exon 8 are presented. The results are compared to previously published studies on NPM1, FLT3, c-KIT mutations in various populations. No statistically significant differences in survival rates between groups with or without of FLT3, NPM1, c-KIT mutations were found (P>0.05). Meanwhile, 4-year overall survival rates were higher in patients having NPM1 mutations comparing with NPM1/WT patients (100% vs. 50%) and in patients having FLT3 mutations comparing with FLT3/WT patients (70% vs. 50%).

METHODS: Twenty-four patients with MSCC were recruited from 3 Egyptian pediatric oncology centers and assessed for MSCC clinical presentations, evaluation, and treatment response. RESULTS: There was a median delay of 42 days from the onset of symptom until confirmed diagnosis. All studied patients presented inability to walk; 79% had pain (more in older patients) and 17% had sphincteric dysfunction. A total of 58.3% had a single level of cord compression, 41.7% had multiple levels. Thoracic spine was commonly involved (41%). Final diagnosis was: neuroblastoma (29.2%), soft-tissue sarcomas (20.8%), neuroectodermal tumor (16.6%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (12.5%), astrocytoma (4.2%), malignant teratoma (8.4%), Wilms tumor (4.2%), and leukemia (4.2%). Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine was diagnostic in all cases. A total of 83.3% of patients received emergency steroid therapy and 75% showed improvement. Disease-specific therapy was multimodality therapy in 88.5% with 71.42% showing improvement. Lymphomas had the best neurological outcome (100%) followed by soft-tissue sarcomas (80%) and neural tumors (72.7%). The 3-year overall survival was 79.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal cord compression is a serious complication and unacceptable management delay can result in preventable loss of function. Emergency magnetic resonance imaging evaluation is the most sensitive diagnostic imaging.

Disorders of this process can lead to the emergence and development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and can determine the resistance of leukemic cells to chemotherapy. The levels of BCL-2 mRNA were determined in 20 children with pre-B ALL using RT-polymerase chain reaction and the percentage of BCL-2+ cells in 51 patients using flow cytofluorometry. Similar levels of BCL-2 mRNA (P=0.18) with a higher percentage of cells BCL-2+ (P=0.04) were shown in the bone marrow of patients with pre-B ALL compared to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We could not find any connection between the level of BCL-2 mRNA or the percentage of BCL-2+ cells and selected clinical features. A high percentage of BCL-2+ cells and high levels of BCL-2 mRNA did not affect the 5-year overall survival probability nor the 5-year relapse-free survival probability. These results may indicate a high activity of mechanisms promoting the development of the final form of the BCL-2 protein from mRNA in leukemic cells.

The goals of the present study were to investigate the effect of ageing and the role of PON1 on the anti-inflammatory activity of HDL, and to determine whether extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) consumption could improve the atheroprotective activity of HDL. HDL and PON1 were isolated from the plasma of ten young (Y-HDL and Y-PON1) and ten elderly (E-HDL and E-PON1) healthy volunteers before and after 12 weeks of EVOO consumption. Inflammation was assessed by measuring intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression. THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukaemia cell line) monocyte chemotaxis was measured using a Boyden chamber. Oxidative damage to HDL was assessed by measuring conjugated diene formation and changes in electrophoretic migration. Y-HDL had more anti-inflammatory activity than E-HDL. The conjugated diene content and the electrophoretic mobility of E-HDL were higher than those of Y-HDL. Y-PON1 had significant anti-inflammatory activity, reducing ICAM-1 expression by 32.64 (SD 2.63)%, while E-PON1 had no significant effect.

Disease progression can be monitored by the proviral load and may depend on genetic factors, however, it is not well understood why some HTLV-1 infected people develop the disease while others do not. The present study attempts to assess the molecular diversity of gp46 glycoprotein in HAM/TSP patients and Health Carrier (HC) individuals. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 10 individuals, and DNA was extracted from PBMCs to measure the HTLV-1 proviral load. The gp46 coding sequences were amplified PCR, cloned and sequenced. The molecular characterization was performed using bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: The median HTLV-1 proviral load of HC (n = 5) and HAM/TSP (n = 5) patients was similar (average 316,227 copies/106 PBMCs). The gp46 molecular characterization of 146 clones (70 HC and 76 HAM/TSP) revealed an overall diversity, within HC and HAM/TSP clones, of 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively. Five frequent mutations were detected among groups (HAM/TSP and HC clone sequences). A single amino acid (aa) substitution (S35L) was exclusive for the HC group, and three gp46 substitutions (F14S, N42H, G72S) were exclusive for the HAM/TSP group. The remaining frequent mutation (V247I) was present in both groups (p = 0.0014). The in silico protein analysis revealed that the mutated alleles F14S and N42H represent more hydrophilic and flexible protein domains that are likely to be less antigenic. The Receptor Binding Domain is quite variable in the HAM/TSP group. Two other domains (aa 53-75 and 175-209) that contain multiple linear T-cell epitopes showed genetic diversity in both HAM/TSP and HC groups. Further analysis revealed 27 and 13 T-cell epitopes for class I HLA alleles and class II HLA alleles, when analyzing the entire gp46. CONCLUSIONS: The most common gp46 mutations were not associated clinical status because they were found in only one individual, except for the V247I mutation, that was found at viral clones from HAM/TSP ad HC individuals. Because of this, we cannot associate any of the gp46 found mutations with the clinical profile.","['Mota-Miranda, Aline C A', 'Barreto, Fernanda K', 'Amarante, Maria F C', 'Batista, Everton', 'Monteiro-Cunha, Joana P', 'Farre, Lourdes', 'Galvao-Castro, Bernardo', 'Alcantara, Luiz C J']","['Mota-Miranda AC', 'Barreto FK', 'Amarante MF', 'Batista E', 'Monteiro-Cunha JP', 'Farre L', 'Galvao-Castro B', 'Alcantara LC']","['Centro de Pesquisa Goncalo Moniz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, CPqGM/FIOCRUZ, Rua Waldemar Falcao 121, Brotas, Salvador, Bahia, 40295-001, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carrier State/immunology/*virology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/chemistry/genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/*genetics/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry/*genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology/*virology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/chemistry/*genetics/immunology']",2013/03/21 06:00,2013/08/31 06:00,['2013/03/21 06:00'],"['2012/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-10-75 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-10-75 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2013 Mar 6;10:75. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-10-75.,20130306,,PMC3599561,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The monomorphous medium-size neoplastic cells infiltrated into portal areas and sinus of liver as well as the cords and sinus of the spleen. Necrosis, mitotic figures and significant apoptosis could be seen easily. These neoplastic cells demonstrated a typical immunophenotype of CD3epsilon+, CD56+, CD16+, Granzyme B+, TIA-1+. T-cell receptor gamma (TCR-gamma) gene rearrangement analysis showed germline configuration and the result of in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA (EBER-ISH) was positive. The patient has undergone an aggressive clinical course and died of multi-organ function failure 14 days later after admission.

Three decades of intense effort have not identified clinical strategies that can reliably separate the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect from the alloimmune reaction that drives clinical GVHD. For patients who require HCT and for whom two or more human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1-matched donor candidates can be identified, consideration of donor and recipient genotype at additional genetic loci both within and outside the major histocompatibility complex may offer the possibility of selecting the donor [candidate(s)] that poses the lowest probability of GVHD and the highest probability of a potent GVL effect. Strategies for engineering conventional donor lymphocyte infusion also hold promise for prevention or improved treatment of post-transplant relapse. The brightest prospects for selectively enhancing the anti-leukemic efficacy of allogeneic HCT, however, are likely to be interventions that are designed to enhance specific antitumor immunity via vaccination or adoptive cell transfer, rather than those that attempt to exploit donor alloreactivity against the host. Adoptive transfer of donor-derived T cells genetically modified for tumor-specific reactivity, in particular, has the potential to transform the practice of allogeneic HCT by selectively enhancing antitumor immunity without causing GVHD.","['Warren, E H', 'Deeg, H J']","['Warren EH', 'Deeg HJ']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. ehwarren@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Chromosome Mapping', 'Genetic Loci/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2013/03/21 06:00,2013/09/05 06:00,['2013/03/21 06:00'],"['2013/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tan.12090 [doi]'],ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 2013 Apr;81(4):183-93. doi: 10.1111/tan.12090.,,['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],PMC3645301,,,"['P01 AI033484/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL105914/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI033484/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL105914/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS447774'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, as they are all rare diseases, they are little known by clinicians, who therefore tend to suspect the most common forms. Second, making a definite diagnosis often requires complex laboratory techniques that are available in only a few centers. Finally, half of the patients have forms that have not yet been described. As a consequence, many patients with inherited thrombocytopenias are misdiagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia, and are at risk of receiving futile treatments. Misdiagnosis is particularly frequent in patients whose low platelet count is discovered in adult life, because, in these cases, even the inherited origin of thrombocytopenia may be missed. Making the correct diagnosis promptly is important, as we recently learned that some forms of inherited thrombocytopenia predispose to other illnesses, such as leukemia or kidney failure, and affected subjects therefore require close surveillance and, if necessary, prompt treatments. Moreover, medical treatment can increase platelet counts in specific disorders, and affected subjects can therefore receive drugs instead of platelet transfusions when selective surgery is required. In this review, we will discuss how to suspect, diagnose and manage inherited thrombocytopenias, with particular attention to the forms that frequently present in adults. Moreover, we describe four recently identified disorders that belong to this group of disorders that are often diagnosed in adults: MYH9-related disease, monoallelic Bernard-Soulier syndrome, ANKRD26-related thrombocytopenia, and familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute leukemia.","['Balduini, C L', 'Savoia, A', 'Seri, M']","['Balduini CL', 'Savoia A', 'Seri M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Pavia-IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy. c.balduini@smatteo.pv.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,"['0 (ANKRD26 protein, human)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MYH9 protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Motor Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bernard-Soulier Syndrome/diagnosis', 'Blood Platelet Disorders/diagnosis', 'Blood Platelets/cytology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Diseases/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia/blood/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Motor Proteins/genetics', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Platelet Count', 'Thrombocytopenia/*diagnosis/*genetics']",2013/03/21 06:00,2014/02/08 06:00,['2013/03/21 06:00'],"['2013/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jth.12196 [doi]'],ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2013 Jun;11(6):1006-19. doi: 10.1111/jth.12196.,,['(c) 2013 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.'],,,,['GGP10089/TI_/Telethon/Italy'],,['NOTNLM'],"['bleeding disorders', 'inherited disorders', 'platelets', 'thrombocytopenia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some suggest that the effects of Gaucher's disease may be linked to cancer, while others implicate the therapies used to treat Gaucher's disease. This debate is not entirely surprising, as the speculations linking Gaucher's disease with cancer fail to address the roles of ceramide and glucosylceramide in cancer biology. In this review, we will discuss, in the context of cancer biology, ceramide metabolism to glucosylceramide, the roles of glucosylceramide in multidrug-resistance, and the role of ceramide as an anticancer lipid. This review should reveal that it is most practical to associate elevated glucosylceramide, which accompanies Gaucher's disease, with the progression of cancer. Furthermore, this review proposes that the therapies used to treat Gaucher's disease, which augment ceramide accumulation, are likely not linked to correlations with cancer.","['Barth, Brian M', 'Shanmugavelandy, Sriram S', 'Tacelosky, Diana M', 'Kester, Mark', 'Morad, Samy A F', 'Cabot, Myles C']","['Barth BM', 'Shanmugavelandy SS', 'Tacelosky DM', 'Kester M', 'Morad SA', 'Cabot MC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Crit Rev Oncog,Critical reviews in oncogenesis,8914610,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Ceramides/metabolism', 'Gaucher Disease/*complications/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysophospholipids/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*metabolism', 'Sphingolipids/*metabolism', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",2013/03/21 06:00,2013/07/28 06:00,['2013/03/21 06:00'],"['2013/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['0dc6d82859623d4b,12a2ce2d137f73aa [pii]', '10.1615/critrevoncog.2013005814 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncog. 2013;18(3):221-34. doi: 10.1615/critrevoncog.2013005814.,,,PMC3604879,,,"['R01 GM077391/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA143755/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM77391/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA143755/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS448954'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphoid malignancy can precede the diagnosis of A-T, particularly in young children with mild neurological symptoms. We studied a consanguineous family with four A-T variant patients, three of them developed T-ALL at a young age before the diagnosis of A-T was established.

All four patients are homozygous for the two mutations, while their parents are heterozygous for the mutations. ATM protein level was low in all patients and the response to the radiomimetic agent, neocarzinostatin, was reduced.

In addition, these subclones were screened according to their phagocytic activity and the characteristics of mature Sertoli cells, such as the expression of androgen receptors (ARs) and progesterone receptors, by using western blotting and immunocytochemical analysis, in addition to their morphology and proliferation rates. After the third round of subcloning, 12 subclones were selected for the final selection using RT-PCR for identification of genes specifically expressed by various testicular cells.

Molecularly, RA activates PML/RARA-dependent transcription and also initiates its proteasome-mediated degradation. In contrast, arsenic, the other potent anti-APL therapy, only induces PML/RARA degradation by specifically targeting its PML moiety. The respective contributions of RA-triggered transcriptional activation and proteolysis to clinical response remain disputed. Here, we identify synthetic retinoids that potently activate RARA- or PML/RARA-dependent transcription, but fail to down-regulate RARA or PML/RARA protein levels. Similar to RA, these uncoupled retinoids elicit terminal differentiation, but unexpectedly fail to impair leukemia-initiating activity of PML/RARA-transformed cells ex vivo or in vivo. Accordingly, the survival benefit conferred by uncoupled retinoids in APL mice is dramatically lower than the one provided by RA. Differentiated APL blasts sorted from uncoupled retinoid-treated mice retain PML/RARA expression and reinitiate APL in secondary transplants. Thus, differentiation is insufficient for APL eradication, whereas PML/RARA loss is essential.

The cAMP-activated protein kinase, PKA, inhibits Raf-1 by phosphorylation on S259. Here, we show that the cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterase-8A (PDE8A) associates with Raf-1 to protect it from inhibitory phosphorylation by PKA, thereby enhancing Raf-1's ability to stimulate ERK signaling. PDE8A binds to Raf-1 with high (picomolar) affinity. Mapping of the interaction domain on PDE8A using peptide array technology identified amino acids 454-465 as the main binding site, which could be disrupted by mutation. A cell-permeable peptide corresponding to this region disrupted the PDE8A/Raf-1 interaction in cells, thereby reducing ERK activation and the cellular response to EGF. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive PDE8A in cells displayed a dominant negative phenotype on ERK activation. These effects were recapitulated at the organism level in genetically modified (PDE8A(-/-)) mice. Similarly, PDE8 deletion in Drosophila melanogaster reduced basal ERK activation and sensitized flies to stress-induced death. We propose that PDE8A is a physiological regulator of Raf-1 signaling in some cells.","['Brown, Kim M', 'Day, Jon P', 'Huston, Elaine', 'Zimmermann, Bastian', 'Hampel, Kornelia', 'Christian, Frank', 'Romano, David', 'Terhzaz, Selim', 'Lee, Louisa C Y', 'Willis, Miranda J', 'Morton, David B', 'Beavo, Joseph A', 'Shimizu-Albergine, Masami', 'Davies, Shireen A', 'Kolch, Walter', 'Houslay, Miles D', 'Baillie, George S']","['Brown KM', 'Day JP', 'Huston E', 'Zimmermann B', 'Hampel K', 'Christian F', 'Romano D', 'Terhzaz S', 'Lee LC', 'Willis MJ', 'Morton DB', 'Beavo JA', 'Shimizu-Albergine M', 'Davies SA', 'Kolch W', 'Houslay MD', 'Baillie GS']","['Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Science, Cellular and Systems Biology, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Pde8a protein, mouse)']",IM,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/genetics/*metabolism"", 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Gene Deletion', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/genetics/*physiology', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*metabolism', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance']",2013/03/20 06:00,2013/06/20 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1303004110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1303004110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Apr 16;110(16):E1533-42. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1303004110.

It is also deregulated in several types of solid tumors; however, its role in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis is not yet known. Here we show that miR-9 is detected in hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells, and that its expression increases during hematopoietic differentiation. Ectopic expression of miR-9 strongly accelerates terminal myelopoiesis and promotes apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, in hematopoietic progenitor cells, the inhibition of miR-9 with a miRNA sponge blocks myelopoiesis. Ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1), required for normal embryogenesis, is considered an oncogene because its inappropriate up-regulation induces malignant transformation in solid and hematopoietic cancers. Here we show that EVI1 binds to the promoter of miR-9-3, leading to DNA hypermethylation of the promoter and repression of miR-9. Moreover, miR-9 expression reverses a myeloid differentiation block that is induced by EVI1. Our findings indicate that EVI1, when inappropriately expressed, delays or blocks myeloid differentiation at least in part by DNA hypermethylation and down-regulation of miR-9. It was reported that Forkhead box class O genes (FoxOs) inhibit myeloid differentiation and prevent differentiation of leukemia-initiating cells. Here we identify both FoxO1 and FoxO3 as direct targets of miR-9 in hematopoietic cells and find that up-regulation of FoxO3 inhibits miR-9-induced myelopoiesis. These results reveal a unique role of miR-9 in myelopoiesis and in the pathogenesis of EVI1-induced myeloid neoplasms and provide insights into the epigenetic regulation of miR9 in tumorigenesis.","['Senyuk, Vitalyi', 'Zhang, Yunyuan', 'Liu, Yang', 'Ming, Ming', 'Premanand, Kavitha', 'Zhou, Lan', 'Chen, Ping', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Rowley, Janet D', 'Nucifora, Giuseppina', 'Qian, Zhijian']","['Senyuk V', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu Y', 'Ming M', 'Premanand K', 'Zhou L', 'Chen P', 'Chen J', 'Rowley JD', 'Nucifora G', 'Qian Z']","['Department of Medicine, and Cancer Research Center, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL 60621, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FOXO1 protein, human)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (MIRN92 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Myelopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2013/03/20 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1302645110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1302645110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Apr 2;110(14):5594-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1302645110.

Proteomic techniques have allowed us to identify the multiprotein complex that is nucleated by constitutively active Syk in AML cells. This complex differs from the B-lymphoid Syk interactome with respect to several proteins, especially the integrin receptor Mac-1, the Fc-gamma receptor I (FcgammaRI), and the transcription factors STAT3 and STAT5. We show in several AML cell line models that tonic signals derived from the Fc-gamma chain lead to Syk-dependent activation of STAT3 and STAT5, which in turn induces cell survival and proliferation. Moreover, stimulation of Mac-1 or FcgammaRI intensifies the constitutive Syk-mediated STAT3/5 activation in AML cells, a scenario likely to take place in the bone marrow niche. In accordance with these findings, we observed that beta2 integrins, including Mac-1, trigger proliferation of AML cells in an AML cell/stroma coculture model.

NK cell dysfunctions have been reported in various hematologic malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Here we investigated the role of tumor cell-released soluble and exosomal ligands for NK cell receptors that modulate NK cell activity. Soluble CLL plasma factors suppressed NK cell cytotoxicity and down-regulated the surface receptors CD16 and CD56 on NK cells of healthy donors. The inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity was attributed to the soluble ligand BAG6/BAT3 that engages the activating receptor NKp30 expressed on NK cells. Soluble BAG6 was detectable in the plasma of CLL patients, with the highest levels at the advanced disease stages. In contrast, NK cells were activated when BAG6 was presented on the surface of exosomes. The latter form was induced in non-CLL cells by cellular stress via an nSmase2-dependent pathway. Such cells were eliminated by lymphocytes in a xenograft tumor model in vivo. Here, exosomal BAG6 was essential for tumor cell killing because BAG6-deficient cells evaded immune detection. Taken together, the findings show that the dysregulated balance of exosomal vs soluble BAG6 expression may cause immune evasion of CLL cells.","['Reiners, Katrin S', 'Topolar, Daniela', 'Henke, Alexander', 'Simhadri, Venkateswara R', 'Kessler, Jorg', 'Sauer, Maike', 'Bessler, Martina', 'Hansen, Hinrich P', 'Tawadros, Samir', 'Herling, Marco', 'Kronke, Martin', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Pogge von Strandmann, Elke']","['Reiners KS', 'Topolar D', 'Henke A', 'Simhadri VR', 'Kessler J', 'Sauer M', 'Bessler M', 'Hansen HP', 'Tawadros S', 'Herling M', 'Kronke M', 'Hallek M', 'Pogge von Strandmann E']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BAG6 protein, human)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD56 Antigen/metabolism/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Exosomes/metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Escape/*drug effects/genetics', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics/immunology']",2013/03/20 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58714-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-01-476606 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 May 2;121(18):3658-65. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-01-476606.

We determined whether cercosporamide, an antifungal agent that was recently shown to act as a unique Mnk inhibitor, exhibits antileukemic properties. Treatment of AML cells with cercosporamide resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of eIF4E phosphorylation. Such suppression of Mnk kinase activity and eIF4E phosphorylation by cercosporamide resulted in dose-dependent suppressive effects on primitive leukemic progenitors (CFU-L) from AML patients and enhanced the antileukemic properties of cytarabine (Ara-C) or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 inhibition. Similarly, the combination of cercosporamide with cytarabine resulted in enhanced antileukemic responses in a xenograft mouse model in vivo. Altogether, this work demonstrates that the unique Mnk inhibitor cercosporamide suppresses phosphorylation of eIF4E and exhibits antileukemic effects, in support of future clinical-translational efforts involving combinations of Mnk inhibitors with cytarabine and/or mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of AML.","['Altman, Jessica K', 'Szilard, Amy', 'Konicek, Bruce W', 'Iversen, Philip W', 'Kroczynska, Barbara', 'Glaser, Heather', 'Sassano, Antonella', 'Vakana, Eliza', 'Graff, Jeremy R', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Altman JK', 'Szilard A', 'Konicek BW', 'Iversen PW', 'Kroczynska B', 'Glaser H', 'Sassano A', 'Vakana E', 'Graff JR', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

Only four patients had immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL) that could be solely attributed to the CLL clone; another six had both a plasma cell clone and a CLL clone that shared the same light chain. Median overall survival was 15.6 months for patients with AL and 58.1 months for patients with non-AL. For patients with AL management involved chemotherapy targeted toward monoclonal plasma cells, lymphocytes or both, and for patients with non-AL no specific amyloid treatment was administered.

In contrast, high hyperdiploidy (51-67 chromosomes) has a favorable prognosis. Correct classification and appropriate risk stratification of near haploidy is frequently hampered by the presence of apparently high hyperdiploid clones that arise by endoreduplication of the original near haploid clone. We evaluated next-generation-sequencing (NGS) to distinguish between ""high hyperdiploid"" leukemic clones of near haploid and true high hyperdiploid origin. Five high hyperdiploid ALL cases and the ""high hyperdiploid"" cell line MHH-CALL-2, derived from a near haploid clone, were tested for uniparental isodisomy. NGS showed that all disomic chromosomes of MHH-CALL-2, but none of the patients, were of uniparental origin, thus reliably discriminating these subtypes. Whole-exome- and whole-genome-sequencing of MHH-CALL-2 revealed homozygous non-synonymous coding mutations predicted to be deleterious for the protein function of 63 genes, among them known cancer-associated genes, such as FANCA, NF1, TCF7L2, CARD11, EP400, histone demethylases, and transferases (KDM6B, KDM1A, PRDM11). Only eight of these were also, but heterozygously, mutated in the high hyperdiploid patients. Structural variations in MHH-CALL-2 include a homozygous deletion (MTAP/CDKN2A/CDKN2B/ANRIL), a homozygous inversion (NCKAP5), and an unbalanced translocation (FAM189A1). Together, the sequence variations provide MHH-CALL-2 with capabilities typically acquired during cancer development, e.g., loss of cell cycle control, enhanced proliferation, lack of DNA repair, cell death evasion, and disturbance of epigenetic gene regulation. Poorer prognosis of near haploid ALL most likely results from full penetrance of a large array of detrimental homozygous mutations.","['Chen, Cai', 'Bartenhagen, Christoph', 'Gombert, Michael', 'Okpanyi, Vera', 'Binder, Vera', 'Rottgers, Silja', 'Bradtke, Jutta', 'Teigler-Schlegel, Andrea', 'Harbott, Jochen', 'Ginzel, Sebastian', 'Thiele, Ralf', 'Fischer, Ute', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Hu, Jianda', 'Borkhardt, Arndt']","['Chen C', 'Bartenhagen C', 'Gombert M', 'Okpanyi V', 'Binder V', 'Rottgers S', 'Bradtke J', 'Teigler-Schlegel A', 'Harbott J', 'Ginzel S', 'Thiele R', 'Fischer U', 'Dugas M', 'Hu J', 'Borkhardt A']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Exome/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Haploidy', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2013/03/20 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22054 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2013 Jun;52(6):564-79. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22054.

Histone modifications, including acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation, collaborate with DNA CpG island methylation to regulate gene expression. The dynamic process of histone methylation is the latest of these epigenetic modifications to be described, and the identification and characterization of LSD1 as a demethylase of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4) has confirmed that both the enzyme and the modified histone play important roles as regulators of gene expression. LSD1 activity contributes to the suppression of gene expression by demethylating promoter-region mono- and dimethyl-H3K4 histone marks that are associated with active gene expression. As most post-translational modifications are reversible, the enzymes involved in the modification of histones have become targets for chemotherapeutic intervention. In this study, we examined the effects of the polyamine analogue LSD1 inhibitor 2d (1,15-bis{N (5)-[3,3-(diphenyl)propyl]-N(1)-biguanido}-4,12-diazapentadecane) in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. In each line studied, 2d evoked cytotoxicity and inhibited LSD1 activity, as evidenced by increases in the global levels of mono- and di-methylated H3K4 proteins. Global increases in other chromatin modifications were also observed following exposure to 2d, suggesting a broad response to this compound with respect to chromatin regulation. On a gene-specific level, treatment with 2d resulted in the re-expression of e-cadherin, a tumor suppressor gene frequently silenced by epigenetic modification in AML. Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the e-cadherin promoter further confirmed that this re-expression was concurrent with changes in both active and repressive histone marks that were consistent with LSD1 inhibition. As hematologic malignancies have demonstrated promising clinical responses to agents targeting epigenetic silencing, this polyamine analogue LSD1 inhibitor presents an exciting new avenue for the development of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of AML.","['Murray-Stewart, Tracy', 'Woster, Patrick M', 'Casero, Robert A Jr']","['Murray-Stewart T', 'Woster PM', 'Casero RA Jr']","['The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Bunting Blaustein Bldg, Room 551, 1650 Orleans Street, Baltimore, MD, 21287, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Amino Acids,Amino acids,9200312,"['0 (1,15-bis(N5-(3,3-(diphenyl)propyl)-N1-biguanido)-4,12-diazapentadecane)', '0 (Benzhydryl Compounds)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Guanidines)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Benzhydryl Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cadherins/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', '*Gene Silencing', 'Guanidines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Demethylases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2013/03/20 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2013/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00726-013-1485-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Amino Acids. 2014 Mar;46(3):585-94. doi: 10.1007/s00726-013-1485-1.

Numerous factors, including hormone receptors (progesterone receptor), cytokines [leukemia inhibitory factors (LIF)], and adherence molecules such as E-cadherin are involved in the cross-talk that occurs between the embryo and endometrium. Studies show that a lack of these genes impact endometrial receptivity. In this study, we compare the expression levels of E-cadherin, LIF, and progesterone receptor (PgR) genes in blastocysts that have been obtained from superovulated mice to those obtained from natural cycles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, for the experimental group, a total of 17 virgin female NMRI mice (6- 8 weeks old) were injected with 7.5 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG). Their blastocysts (approximately n= 120) were flushed out after 3.5 days, following administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The control group consisted of blastocysts from 62 female mice that were mated with male mice. The natural cycle blastocysts were flushed out from the female mice uteri 3.5 days after mating. The expression levels of E-cadherin, LIF, t PgR genes were examined by quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Data were analyzed by the student's t-test (one sample t-test). RESULTS: Expression levels of all studied genes were significantly lower in the hormone-treated group compared to the natural cycle blastocysts (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Although ovarian stimulation is utilized to obtain more oocytes in ART cycles, it seems that this could disadvantageous to implantation because of the decrease in expression levels of certain genes. Because of the important roles of E-cadherin, LIF, and progesterone receptor in the implantation process, we have shown lower expression levels of these genes in mouse blastocysts obtained from ovarian-stimulated mice than those derived from the natural cycle. The results observed in this study have shown the possibility of an unfavorable effect on implantation and pregnancy rate.","['Movaghar, Bahar', 'Askarian, Saeedeh']","['Movaghar B', 'Askarian S']","['1.

FLT3-ITD exhibits altered signaling quality, including aberrant activation of STAT5. To identify genes affecting FLT3-ITD-mediated STAT5 signaling, we performed an esiRNA-based RNAi screen utilizing a STAT5-driven reporter assay. Knockdowns that caused reduced FLT3-ITD-mediated STAT5 signaling were enriched for genes encoding proteins involved in protein secretion and intracellular protein transport, indicating that modulation of protein transport processes could potentially be used to reduce constitutive STAT5 signaling in FLT3-ITD-positive cells. The relevance of KDELR1, a component involved in the Golgi-ER retrograde transport, was further analyzed. In FLT3-ITD-expressing leukemic MV4-11 cells, downregulation of KDELR1 resulted in reduced STAT5 activation, proliferation and colony-forming capacity. Stable shRNA-mediated depletion of KDELR1 in FLT3-ITD-expressing 32D cells likewise resulted in reduced STAT5 signaling and cell proliferation. Importantly, these cells also showed a reduced capacity to generate a leukemia-like disease in syngeneic C3H/HeJ mice. Together our data suggest intracellular protein transport as a potential target for FLT3-ITD driven leukemias, with KDELR1 emerging as a positive modulator of oncogenic FLT3-ITD activity.","['Caldarelli, A', 'Muller, J P', 'Paskowski-Rogacz, M', 'Herrmann, K', 'Bauer, R', 'Koch, S', 'Heninger, A K', 'Krastev, D', 'Ding, L', 'Kasper, S', 'Fischer, T', 'Brodhun, M', 'Bohmer, F-D', 'Buchholz, F']","['Caldarelli A', 'Muller JP', 'Paskowski-Rogacz M', 'Herrmann K', 'Bauer R', 'Koch S', 'Heninger AK', 'Krastev D', 'Ding L', 'Kasper S', 'Fischer T', 'Brodhun M', 'Bohmer FD', 'Buchholz F']","['Department of Medical Systems Biology, University Hospital and Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, University of Technology Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', '*Genome', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Proteins/*physiology', '*RNA Interference', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*metabolism']",2013/03/20 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2012/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201383 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.83 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Dec;27(12):2301-10. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.83.

Little is known of the relationship between different cytogenetic subtypes in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the recently reported copy number abnormalities affecting significant leukemia associated genes. In a consecutive series of 1427 childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, we have determined the incidence and type of copy number abnormalities using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. We have shown strong links between certain deletions and cytogenetic subtypes, including the novel association between RB1 deletions and intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21. In this study, we characterized the different copy number abnormalities and show heterogeneity of PAX5 and IKZF1 deletions and the recurrent nature of RB1 deletions. Whole gene losses are often indicative of larger deletions, visible by conventional cytogenetics. An increased number of copy number abnormalities is associated with NCI high risk, specifically deletions of IKZF1 and CDKN2A/B, which occur more frequently among these patients. IKZF1 deletions and rearrangements of CRLF2 among patients with undefined karyotypes may point to the poor risk BCR-ABL1-like group. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated in a large representative cohort of children with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia that the pattern of copy number abnormalities is highly variable according to the primary genetic abnormality.","['Schwab, Claire J', 'Chilton, Lucy', 'Morrison, Heather', 'Jones, Lisa', 'Al-Shehhi, Halima', 'Erhorn, Amy', 'Russell, Lisa J', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Harrison, Christine J']","['Schwab CJ', 'Chilton L', 'Morrison H', 'Jones L', 'Al-Shehhi H', 'Erhorn A', 'Russell LJ', 'Moorman AV', 'Harrison CJ']","['Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/classification/*methods', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Infant', 'Male', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/20 06:00,2014/07/08 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.085175 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.085175 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Jul;98(7):1081-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.085175.

There is considerable interest in understanding differences in its use and trends on a global level and the macro-economic factors associated with these differences. Data on the numbers of hematopoietic stem cell transplants performed in the 3-year period 2006-2008 were obtained from Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation member registries and from transplant centers in countries without registries. Population and macro-economic data were collected from the World Bank and from the International Monetary Fund. Transplant rates were analyzed by indication, donor type, country, and World Health Organization regional offices areas and related to selected health care indicators using single and multiple linear regression analyses. Data from a total of 146,808 patients were reported by 1,411 teams from 72 countries over five continents. The annual number of transplants increased worldwide with the highest relative increase in the Asia Pacific region. Transplant rates increased preferentially in high income countries (P=0.02), not in low or medium income countries. Allogeneic transplants increased for myelodysplasia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute leukemias, and non-malignant diseases but decreased for chronic myelogenous leukemia. Autologous transplants increased for autoimmune and lymphoproliferative diseases but decreased for leukemias and solid tumors. Transplant rates (P<0.01), donor type (P<0.01) aand disease indications (P<0.01) differed significantly between countries and regions. Transplant rates were associated with Gross National Income/capita (P<0.01) but showed a wide variation of explanatory content by donor type, disease indication and World Health Organization region. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation activity is increasing worldwide. The preferential increase in high income countries, the widening gap between low and high income countries and the significant regional differences suggest that different strategies are required in individual countries to foster hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as an efficient and cost-effective treatment modality.","['Gratwohl, Alois', 'Baldomero, Helen', 'Gratwohl, Michael', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Bouzas, Luis Fernando', 'Horowitz, Mary', 'Kodera, Yoshihisa', 'Lipton, Jeff', 'Iida, Minako', 'Pasquini, Marcelo C', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Szer, Jeff', 'Madrigal, Alejandro', 'Frauendorfer, Karl', 'Niederwieser, Dietger']","['Gratwohl A', 'Baldomero H', 'Gratwohl M', 'Aljurf M', 'Bouzas LF', 'Horowitz M', 'Kodera Y', 'Lipton J', 'Iida M', 'Pasquini MC', 'Passweg J', 'Szer J', 'Madrigal A', 'Frauendorfer K', 'Niederwieser D']","['The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Transplant Activity Survey Office, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Global Health/*economics/standards/*trends', 'Gross Domestic Product/trends', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*economics/standards/*trends', 'Humans', 'Registries/standards', 'Retrospective Studies', 'World Health Organization/economics']",2013/03/20 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.076349 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.076349 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Aug;98(8):1282-90. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.076349.

The most differently expressed proteins were aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A2 (ALDH1A2) and vimentin. Both proteins were verified using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. ALDH1A2 protein was found to be effective in AraC resistance. ALDH1A2 knock-down induced sensitivity to AraC treatment in K562AC cells, and ALDH1A2 overexpressed K562S cells acquired the AraC resistance. Furthermore, the findings also suggest that ALDH1A2 expression is increased after the appearance of AraC resistance in clinical cases.

Benzophenones are known to display many pharmacological properties including cytotoxic activities. The present study was aimed at investigating the cytotoxicity and the modes of action of four naturally occurring benzophenones 2,2',5,6'-tetrahydroxybenzophenone (1), isogarcinol (2), isoxanthochymol (3) and guttiferone E (4) on a panel of eleven cancer cell lines including various sensitive and drug-resistant phenotypes. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined using a resazurin reduction assay, whereas the caspase-Glo assay was used to detect the activation of caspases 3/7, caspase 8 and caspase 9 in cells treated with compounds 2-4. Flow cytometry was used for cell cycle analysis and detection of apoptotic cells, analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) as well as measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS). RESULTS: The four tested benzophenones inhibited the proliferation of all tested cancer cell lines including sensitive and drug-resistant phenotypes. Collateral sensitivity of cancer cells to compounds 1-4 was generally better than to doxorubicin. Compound 2 showed the best activity with IC50 values below or around 1 muM against HCT116 colon carcinoma cells (p53+/+) (0.86 muM) and leukemia CCRF-CEM (1.38 muM) cell lines. Compounds 2-4 strongly induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells via caspases 3/7, caspase 8 and caspase 9 activation and disruption of MMP. CONCLUSIONS: The studied benzophenones are cytotoxic compounds that deserve more detailed exploration in the future, to develop novel anticancer drugs against sensitive and otherwise drug-resistant phenotypes.","['Kuete, Victor', 'Tchakam, Patricia D', 'Wiench, Benjamin', 'Ngameni, Bathelemy', 'Wabo, Hippolyte K', 'Tala, Michel F', 'Moungang, Marlyse L', 'Ngadjui, Bonaventure T', 'Murayama, Tetsuya', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Kuete V', 'Tchakam PD', 'Wiench B', 'Ngameni B', 'Wabo HK', 'Tala MF', 'Moungang ML', 'Ngadjui BT', 'Murayama T', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Phytomedicine,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,9438794,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzophenones)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (isoxanthochymol)', '74F950KV9S (guttiferone E)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)', ""PRR8K3H9VN (2,2',4,4'-tetrahydroxybenzophenone)""]",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzophenones/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Phenotype', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2013/03/20 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2012/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0944-7113(13)00049-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phymed.2013.02.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Phytomedicine. 2013 Apr 15;20(6):528-36. doi: 10.1016/j.phymed.2013.02.003.

Mouse models with conditional knockout of the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) genes have revealed a role of DNA methylation in mediating the self-renewal and differentiation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and the leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Recently, various mutations of DNMT3A and other DNA methylation regulators have been identified in hematologic malignancies. Functional analysis of these mutations may lead to a better understanding of the disease mechanisms, and even the discovery of new biomarkers and/or drug targets, as well as more rational design of therapeutic regimens. Moreover, DNMTs inhibitors as epigenetic drugs have already been approved by US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use and some clinical trials are currently underway in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This review focuses on the biology of DNMTs with regard to epigenetic regulation, HSC renewal/differentiation, and drug discovery for targeted therapy, and delineates the latest studies that have been conducted to unfold the relationship between aberrant DNMTs and hematologic malignancies.","['Li, Keqin Kathy', 'Luo, Liu-Fei', 'Shen, Yang', 'Xu, Jie', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Chen, Sai-Juan']","['Li KK', 'Luo LF', 'Shen Y', 'Xu J', 'Chen Z', 'Chen SJ']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Mutation']",2013/03/20 06:00,2013/09/04 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0037-1963(13)00006-1 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2013.01.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2013 Jan;50(1):48-60. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2013.01.005.,,['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

These alterations commonly affect genes that play important roles in the cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The ability to identify epigenetic modifications to these important genes has increased exponentially due to advances in technology. As a result, there are well-defined, gene-specific epigenetic aberrations associated with NHL comprising follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The identification of these genes is important because they may be used as biomarkers for prognosis, diagnosis and in developing improved treatment strategies. Also important, in the control of gene expression, is the packaging of DNA within the nucleus of a cell. This packaging can be distorted by epigenetic alterations and may alter the accessibility of certain regions of the genome in cancer cells. This review discusses the impact of known epigenetic aberration on the regulation of gene expression in NHL and provides insight into the spatial conformation of the genome (DNA packaging) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Taylor, Kristen H', 'Briley, Aaron', 'Wang, Zheng', 'Cheng, Jianlin', 'Shi, Huidong', 'Caldwell, Charles W']","['Taylor KH', 'Briley A', 'Wang Z', 'Cheng J', 'Shi H', 'Caldwell CW']","['Department of Pathology and Anatomical Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65212, USA. taylorkh@health.missouri.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Histones)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histones/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics']",2013/03/20 06:00,2013/09/04 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0037-1963(13)00004-8 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2013.01.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2013 Jan;50(1):38-47. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2013.01.003.,,['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Even though mutations have been shown to occur in MDS, a notable proportion of these affect genes involved in epigenetic maintenance, suggesting a dominant role of epigenomic dysregulation in the pathogenesis of MDS. Aberrant DNA methylation is the dominant and most well-studied epigenetic alteration in MDS. Various genes, including cell cycle regulators, apoptotic genes, and DNA repair genes, are epigenetically silenced and have roles in pathogenesis and transformation to leukemia. The involvement of these genes in MDS pathophysiology and prognosis is reviewed and reveals distinct methylation patterns between high- and low-risk subsets of this disease. Furthermore, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors azacitdine and decitabine are approved for treatment even though the optimal dosing strategies are still being developed. We have reviewed the mechanisms of action of these agents in MDS and show that demethylation may not correlate well with their efficacy, thus suggesting alternative modes of action. We also show that DNMT inhibitors may have potent anti-leukemic stem cell effects at lower doses and also review the mechanisms of resistance to these agents. Altogether, these studies show that even though DNA methylation has been studied extensively in MDS, its role in prognosis and response to therapy is still unclear. The use of deep sequencing and genome-wide methylome analysis will potentially uncover prognostic signatures and reveal the complexity of epigenetic dysregulation in this disease.","['Khan, Hina', 'Vale, Cristina', 'Bhagat, Tushar', 'Verma, Amit']","['Khan H', 'Vale C', 'Bhagat T', 'Verma A']","['Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics']",2013/03/20 06:00,2013/09/04 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0037-1963(13)00002-4 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2013.01.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2013 Jan;50(1):16-37. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2013.01.001.,,['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

CD69 is a marker of early activation of lymphocytes. We investigated the effects of HTLV-1 infection on the expression of CD69. The CD69 gene was upregulated in all viral protein Tax-expressing HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines, except MT-2 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with ATL compared with uninfected T-cell line, Tax-negative ATL-derived T-cell lines and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Flow cytometric analysis and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the enhanced expression of CD69 in HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines and in ATL cells in lymph nodes and skin lesions, and its absence in MT-2 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CD69 expression was induced following infection of human T-cell line with HTLV-1, and specifically by Tax. Tax transcriptionally activated CD69 gene through both nuclear factor-kappaB and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response element-binding protein signaling pathways. Detailed analysis of the CD69 promoter indicated that the Tax-induced expression of CD69 was regulated by multiple cis-acting elements and by the interplay of transcription factors of the nuclear factor-kappaB, early growth response and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response element-binding protein families. The lack of CD69 expression in MT-2 is due to epigenetic mechanism involving deacetylation, but not methylation. We conclude that CD69 is a Tax-regulated gene, and its regulation by Tax may play a role in cellular activation and HTLV-1-induced disease pathogenesis.","['Ishikawa, Chie', 'Kawakami, Hirochika', 'Uchihara, Jun-Nosuke', 'Senba, Masachika', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Ishikawa C', 'Kawakami H', 'Uchihara JN', 'Senba M', 'Mori N']","['Department of Microbiology and Oncology, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan. chiezo@lab.u-ryukyu.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics/metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/*genetics/pathology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lectins, C-Type/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/pathology/virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology/virology', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2013/03/20 06:00,2013/07/13 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2012/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-4889(13)00097-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.03.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2013 Jun;1833(6):1542-52. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.03.006.

As is true for many autoimmune or inflammatory rheumatic diseases, AAV diagnosis and therapy are associated with an increased risk of de novo cancer development, likely as a result of impaired immunosurveillance, direct oncogenicity of immunosuppressive agents and perhaps malignant degeneration of tissues undergoing chronic immune stimulation. Data from several studies suggest a standardised incidence ratio of cancer in AAV of 1.6-2.0 compared to the general population and a possibly higher risk in GPA than in MPA. The most prominent cancers observed in AAV include urinary tract cancer, leukaemia and non-melanoma skin cancer. The effect of individual therapeutic agents is difficult to dissect, but cyclophosphamide has emerged as a major contributor to cancer development because of its direct carcinogenic properties. Awareness of cancer risk in AAV calls for increased implementation of measures to prevent or screen for cancer and development of less carcinogenic therapies. Cancer has also been suggested as a potential trigger or cause of AAV. Although some studies found that prior or concomitant history of cancer increases the risk of AAV, available data are inconsistent and suggest that the fraction of AAV that might be attributable to cancer is at best small.","['Mahr, Alfred', 'Heijl, Caroline', 'Le Guenno, Guillaume', 'Faurschou, Mikkel']","['Mahr A', 'Heijl C', 'Le Guenno G', 'Faurschou M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Saint-Louis, Paris, France. alfred.mahr@sls.aphp.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol,Best practice & research.

The root of Gentiana dahurica Fisch (Gentianaceae) is one of the four officially validated ""Qin-Jiao"" as listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. In addition, it is a common Tibetan medicinal herb used for the treatment of tonsillitis, urticaria, and RA, while the flowers have been used as a Mongolian herb for curing cough sore throat and eliminating the phlegm due to its anti-inflammatory effect. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to characterize the anti-inflammatory compounds in ""Qin-Jiao"", on the basis of detailed investigation on not only the phytochemical study of Gentiana dahurica, but also the bioactive evaluation on compounds obtained presently and previously from different ""Qin-Jiao"" origins and Gentiana species. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ethanol extract of air-dried roots of Gentiana dahurica was suspended into H2O and extracted with EtOAc and n-BuOH, successively. Repeated column chromatography (CC) and semi-preparative HPLC were carried out on each of the fractions. The isolated compounds were determined by detailed spectroscopic analysis and acidic hydrolysis. Anti-inflammatory activities of 18 isolates, together with 12 typical compounds obtained previously by our group from the other ""Qin-Jiao"" origins (Gentiana crassicaulis, Gentiana straminea) and Gentiana rigescens, were tested by inhibitory effects on LPS-induced NO production in macrophage RAW264.7 cells and TPA-induced cyclooxygenases-2 and -1 (COXs-2/1) production on zebrafish model. RESULTS: A new lignan glycoside (1) was identified, together with 20 known compounds, including 10 iridoid glycosides (2-11), three steroids (12-14), four lignans (15-18), one phenylpropanoid (19) and two triterpenes (20-21). Anti-inflammatory bioassay showed that only compound 21 displayed potential inhibitory effect on NO production (IC50=16.85 muM), while 20 tested compounds had inhibitory activities on COXs-2/1. Among them, the triterpenoid 21 was the most active compound with an inhibitory value of 78% at a concentration of 30 muM. All the tested compounds showed no cytotoxicity on five human cancer cell lines (40muM) and zebrafish (30 muM), except for 21 displaying weak cytotoxicity on human myeloid leukemia HL-60 (IC50=16.43 muM). CONCLUSION: Most of compounds particularly iridoid glycosides from ""Qin-Jiao"" display potential inhibitory effect on COXs-2/1. The results support the historical importance of the well-known TCM herb, ""Qin-Jiao"", having been commonly used for fighting RA. As major components, the bioactive iridoid glycosides should play important role in the anti-inflammatory effect of ""Qin-Jiao"". Although further research will be required to evaluate the selective activities of the COXs-2/1 inhibitors, this work validates the medicinal use of ""Qin-Jiao"" and provides information for different ""Qin-Jiao"" origins having different treating effects on RA.","['Wang, Yan-Ming', 'Xu, Min', 'Wang, Dong', 'Yang, Chong-Ren', 'Zeng, Yang', 'Zhang, Ying-Jun']","['Wang YM', 'Xu M', 'Wang D', 'Yang CR', 'Zeng Y', 'Zhang YJ']","['State Key Laboratory of Phytochemistry and Plant Resources in West China, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650201, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-1,3-acetate)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 1)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclooxygenase 1/metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/metabolism', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', '*Gentiana', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Plant Roots', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/analogs & derivatives', 'Zebrafish']",2013/03/20 06:00,2013/10/24 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(13)00159-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2013.03.016 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2013 May 20;147(2):341-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2013.03.016.

SLC48A1 (heme responsive gene-1, HRG-1), the sole member of the SLC48 family, is associated with the endosome and appears to transport heme from the endosome into the cytosol.","['Khan, Anwar A', 'Quigley, John G']","['Khan AA', 'Quigley JG']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. aakhan@uic.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Mol Aspects Med,Molecular aspects of medicine,7603128,"['0 (FLVCR1 protein, human)', '0 (FLVCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Hemeproteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (SLC48A1 protein, human)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Cerebrovascular Disorders/genetics', 'Endosomes/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Heme/*metabolism', 'Hemeproteins/*metabolism', 'Homeostasis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/*physiology', '*Models, Molecular', '*Multigene Family', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2013/03/20 06:00,2013/09/10 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2011/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0098-2997(12)00096-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mam.2012.07.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Aspects Med. 2013 Apr-Jun;34(2-3):669-82. doi: 10.1016/j.mam.2012.07.013.,,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases (IIDDs) of the central nervous system (CNS) in patients following allo-HSCT. METHODS: A nested case-control study was conducted in a large cohort of 1365 patients, who underwent allo-HSCT at the Institute of Hematology and Peking University People's Hospital, between January 2004 and December 2009, 36 patients of whom developed CNS IIDDs. Kaplan-Meier method, univariate and multivariate Cox regression were applied in our statistical analysis using SPSS 16.0. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of all cases of IIDDs at 6 years posttransplantation was 3.6%. Thirty-five patients (97.2%) suffered IIDDs after transplantation, 16 patients (44.4%) between day 0 to day 100 post-transplantation, 10 patients (27.8%) between day 100 to 1 year post-transplantation, and 9 patients (25.0%) 1 year post-transplantation. Multivariate regression analysis identified donor type (P = 0.031), infection (P = 0.009), and acute lymphatic leukemia (P = 0.017) as independent risk factors for posttransplantation IIDDs. The median survival time of patients with IIDDs was 514 days after transplantation (95%CI: 223 - 805). Survival at 6 years was significantly lower in patients who developed the diseases compared to those who did not (26.6% vs. 73.5%, P < 0.001). Of the 36 patients experiencing IIDDs, 58.3% (n = 21) died. The causes of death were graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (n = 4), underlying disease relapse (n = 3), infections (n = 12), and other causes (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: IIDDs is an uncommon but serious complication of allo-HSCT, especially in patients with a primary diagnosis of acute lymphatic leukemia, mismatched transplants, and infections. Our study results indicate that patients with IIDDs tend toward a poor prognosis following allo-HSCT.","['Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Liu, Dai-Hong', 'Chen, Huan', 'Han, Wei', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Wang, Feng-Rong', 'Wang, Jing-Zhi', 'Wang, Yu', 'Zhao, Ting', 'Chen, Yao', 'Fu, Hai-Xia', 'Wang, Min']","['Zhang XH', 'Huang XJ', 'Liu KY', 'Xu LP', 'Liu DH', 'Chen H', 'Han W', 'Chen YH', 'Wang FR', 'Wang JZ', 'Wang Y', 'Zhao T', 'Chen Y', 'Fu HX', 'Wang M']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Central Nervous System', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Demyelinating Autoimmune Diseases, CNS/*etiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/20 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2013 Mar;126(6):1096-102.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is an oncogenic member of the Retroviridae family. Complete genomic sequences of BLV strains isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from cattle have been previously reported. However, a detailed characterization of the complete genome of BLV strains directly isolated from bovine tumors is much needed in order to contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of leukemogenesis induced by BLV in cattle. In this study, we performed a molecular characterization of BLV complete genomes from bovine B-cell lymphosarcoma isolates. A nucleotide substitution was found in the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) site of the 5' long terminal repeat (5'LTR) of the BLV isolates. All amino acid substitutions in Tax previously found to be related to stimulate high transcriptional activity of 5'LTR were not found in these studies. Amino acid substitutions were found in the nucleocapsid, gp51 and G4 proteins. Premature stop-codons in R3 were observed. Few mutations or amino acid substitutions may be needed to allow BLV provirus to achieve silencing. Substitutions that favor suppression of viral expression in malignant B cells might be a strategy to circumvent effective immune attack.","['Moratorio, Gonzalo', 'Fischer, Sabrina', 'Bianchi, Sergio', 'Tome, Lorena', 'Rama, Gonzalo', 'Obal, Gonzalo', 'Carrion, Federico', 'Pritsch, Otto', 'Cristina, Juan']","['Moratorio G', 'Fischer S', 'Bianchi S', 'Tome L', 'Rama G', 'Obal G', 'Carrion F', 'Pritsch O', 'Cristina J']","['Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Nucleares, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay. cristina@cin.edu.uy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Vet Res,Veterinary research,9309551,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*virology', '*Genome, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*veterinary/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Sequence Alignment/veterinary']",2013/03/20 06:00,2014/04/26 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2012/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1297-9716-44-19 [pii]', '10.1186/1297-9716-44-19 [doi]']",epublish,Vet Res. 2013 Mar 18;44:19. doi: 10.1186/1297-9716-44-19.,20130318,,PMC3618307,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/HE967301', 'GENBANK/HE967302', 'GENBANK/HE967303']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A nontoxic moiety of Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin mediates the cellular uptake, whereas the streptavidin unit serves as a binding platform for biotin-labeled cargo molecules. In the present study, we used the C2-streptavidin transporter to introduce biotin-conjugated p53 protein into various mammalian cell lines. The p53 tumor suppressor protein is inactivated in many human cancers by multiple mechanisms and therefore the restoration of its activity in tumor cells is of great therapeutic interest. Recombinant p53 was expressed in insect cells and biotin-labeled. Biotin-p53 retained its specific high-affinity DNA-binding as revealed by gel-shift analysis. Successful conjugation of biotin-p53 to the C2-streptavidin transporter was monitored by an overlay blot technique and confirmed by real-time surface plasmon resonance, providing a KD-value in the low nM range. C2-streptavidin significantly enhanced the uptake of biotin-p53 into African Green Monkey (Vero) epithelial cells as shown by flow cytometry. Using cell fractionation, the cytosolic translocation of biotin-p53 was detected in Vero cells as well as in HeLa cervix carcinoma cells. In line with this finding, confocal microscopy displayed cytoplasmic staining of biotin-p53 in HeLa and HL60 leukemia cells. Internalized biotin-p53 partially colocalized with early endosomes, as confirmed by confocal microscopy. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the successful conjugation of biotin-p53 to C2-streptavidin and its subsequent receptor-mediated endocytosis into different human tumor cell lines.","['Fahrer, Jorg', 'Schweitzer, Brigitte', 'Fiedler, Katja', 'Langer, Torben', 'Gierschik, Peter', 'Barth, Holger']","['Fahrer J', 'Schweitzer B', 'Fiedler K', 'Langer T', 'Gierschik P', 'Barth H']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Ulm Medical Center, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '9013-20-1 (Streptavidin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biotin/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Streptavidin/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Vero Cells']",2013/03/20 06:00,2014/01/18 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bc300563c [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2013 Apr 17;24(4):595-603. doi: 10.1021/bc300563c.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 119 patients who relapsed after standard-dose FCR. The patient cohort consisted of patients who relapsed after FCR administered as first-line therapy (Group 1, n = 63) and patients relapsing after FCR administered in second/subsequent line; (Group 2, n = 56). RESULTS: Basic parameters (age, clinical stage, cytogenetics, molecular genetics) did not differ significantly between these subgroups. Likewise, median progression-free survival (PFS) was not considerably different after FCR (18.6 vs. 14.7 months). Subsequent therapy for relapsed disease included FCR retreatment, R-CHOP, alemtuzumab, or rituximab plus high-dose dexamethasone. Overall response rates for the two groups did not significantly differ (59% vs. 44%). Although PFS after subsequent therapy was relatively short, longer PFS was observed in Group 1 (13.3 vs. 5.9 months; P = 0.01), in patients with response duration >/= 24 months after previous FCR (13 vs. 6.1 months; P < 0.01), and in patients who achieved complete remission after FCR (10.8 vs. 7.9 months in partial remission; P = 0.01). Newly detected 17p deletions were observed in 5/62 patients, and new p53 mutations in 6/34 FCR-treated patients.

Tumor associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) are overexpressed on a variety of cancer cell surfaces, which present tempting targets for anticancer vaccine development. However, such carbohydrates are often poorly immunogenic. To overcome this challenge, we show here that the display of a very weak TACA, the monomeric Tn antigen, on bacteriophage Qbeta virus-like particles elicits powerful humoral responses to the carbohydrate. The effects of adjuvants, antigen display pattern, and vaccine dose on the strength and subclasses of antibody responses were established. The local density of antigen rather than the total amount of antigen administered was found to be crucial for induction of high Tn-specific IgG titers. The ability to display antigens in an organized and high density manner is a key advantage of virus-like particles such as Qbeta as vaccine carriers. Glycan microarray analysis showed that the antibodies generated were highly selective toward Tn antigens. Furthermore, Qbeta elicited much higher levels of IgG antibodies than other types of virus-like particles, and the IgG antibodies produced reacted strongly with the native Tn antigens on human leukemia cells. Thus, Qbeta presents a highly attractive platform for the development of carbohydrate-based anticancer vaccines.","['Yin, Zhaojun', 'Comellas-Aragones, Marta', 'Chowdhury, Sudipa', 'Bentley, Philip', 'Kaczanowska, Katarzyna', 'Benmohamed, Lbachir', 'Gildersleeve, Jeffrey C', 'Finn, M G', 'Huang, Xuefei']","['Yin Z', 'Comellas-Aragones M', 'Chowdhury S', 'Bentley P', 'Kaczanowska K', 'Benmohamed L', 'Gildersleeve JC', 'Finn MG', 'Huang X']","['Department of Chemistry, Chemistry Building, Room 426, 578 South Shaw Lane, Michigan State University , East Lansing, Michigan 48824, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Tn antigen)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Bacteriophages/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Capsid/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neoplasms/immunology/prevention & control']",2013/03/20 06:00,2014/08/29 06:00,['2013/03/20 06:00'],"['2013/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/cb400060x [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2013;8(6):1253-62. doi: 10.1021/cb400060x.

Although complete remission rate is around 50-60% the 2 years survival is only in the magnitude of 10-20%. This is mainly due to an overrepresentation of adverse prognostic factors present in elderly AML. As relapses emerge from residual disease present after chemotherapy, intensification of treatment could emerge as a rational strategy. Intensification of chemotherapy by increasing the dose of anthracyclines or addition of gemtuzumab ozogamycin (Mylotarg) to standard chemotherapy indeed has proved to be of advantage in elderly AML. In younger AML autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (AuPBSCT) as post remission treatment in comparison to intensive consolidation chemotherapy has been investigated in a few randomized studies. AuPBSCT showed reduced relapse rates with low non-relapse mortality rates. In elderly AML intensification by AuPBSCT also have been performed although randomized studies are lacking. Nevertheless, in the previous years various reports have suggested the potential utility of AuHSCT in AML of the elderly with encouraging results, albeit mostly in highly selected patients. Acceptable toxicity and a relatively low rate of transplant-related mortality has been notified. However relapses occurred which, irrespective of age, still remains the major cause of treatment failure of AuHSCT in AML. In this review we summarize the experience of AuPBSCT in elderly AML.","['Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Janssen, Jeroen Jwm', 'Huijgens, Peter C']","['Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Janssen JJ', 'Huijgens PC']","['Department of Haematology, VU.

In the following study, we determined the effect of historical data on the rates of peripheral blood smears over a 3-month period and then the detection rate of patients with acute leukaemia. METHODS: All results of complete blood counts (CBCs) tested on three ADVIA 120 analyzers at the regional Rabin Medical Centre, Beilinson Campus over a 3-month period were accessed on a computerised laboratory information system. Over a 3-month period, we determined the proportion of total CBC and patients with criteria for a manual differential count and the actual number of peripheral blood smears done. Finally, we determined the proportion of 100 consecutive patients with acute leukaemia detected using our criteria that included limiting reflex testing according to historical data. RESULTS: Over the 3-month period, there were 34,827 tests done in 12,785 patients. Without historical data, our smear rate would have been 24.5%, but with the availability of historical data, the blood smear review rate was 5.6%. The detection rate for cases of acute leukaemia was 100%.

Telomeres can also be maintained by a recombination-based mechanism, alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Cells using ALT are characterized by the presence of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies (APB), long, heterogeneously sized telomeres, extrachromosomal telomeric circular DNA, and elevated telomeric recombination. Consistent with other reports, we found that liposarcomas containing APBs, but lacking telomerase expression, always contained C-rich circles (C-circles), and these C-circles were never present in the absence of APBs, indicating a tight link between these features in ALT cells. However, a rare subgroup of tumors showing evidence of telomere maintenance by both telomerase and ALT did not contain C-circles. To test the hypothesis that telomerase expression disrupts the tight link between APBs and C-circles, we used ALT cell lines that were engineered to express telomerase. Introduction of telomerase activity in these ALT cells resulted in, on average, shorter telomeres with retention of APBs. However, at high passage, the level of C-circles was significantly reduced, which was paralleled by a switch from C-strand overhangs to G-strand overhangs. We propose that by extending critically short telomeres in these cells, telomerase is disrupting a key step in the ALT pathway necessary for production and/or maintenance of C-circles.","['Plantinga, Matthew J', 'Pascarelli, Kara M', 'Merkel, Anna S', 'Lazar, Alexander J', 'von Mehren, Margaret', 'Lev, Dina', 'Broccoli, Dominique']","['Plantinga MJ', 'Pascarelli KM', 'Merkel AS', 'Lazar AJ', 'von Mehren M', 'Lev D', 'Broccoli D']","['Department of Laboratory Oncology Research, Curtis and Elizabeth Anderson Cancer Institute, Memorial University Medical Center, Savannah, Georgia 31404, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Inclusion Bodies/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Telomere/*metabolism', '*Telomere Homeostasis', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1/metabolism']",2013/03/19 06:00,2014/04/18 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-13-0013 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-13-0013 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2013 Jun;11(6):557-67. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-13-0013.

Here, we show that CLL cells express lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) and that inhibition of this Src family tyrosine kinase with the specific inhibitor [4-amino-5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-7H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-7-yl-cyclopentane (Lck-i)], or reduction of its expression with siRNA, blocks the induction of CD79a, Syk, inhibitor of IkappaB kinase (IKK), Akt, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation by BCR cross-linking in these cells. Furthermore, we show that CLL cells with high levels of LCK expression have higher levels of BCR-mediated IKK, Akt, and ERK phosphorylation as well as cell survival than CLL cells with low levels of LCK expression. We also show that treatment of CLL cells with Lck-i inhibits BCR cross-linking-induced cell survival. Taken together, these data show a major role for LCK in proximal and distal BCR-mediated signaling in CLL cells and suggest that LCK expression is important in the pathogenesis of this disease. On a clinical level, these studies advocate the use of specific LCK inhibitors in the treatment of progressive CLL.","['Talab, Fatima', 'Allen, John C', 'Thompson, Victoria', 'Lin, Ke', 'Slupsky, Joseph R']","['Talab F', 'Allen JC', 'Thompson V', 'Lin K', 'Slupsky JR']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,['EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",2013/03/19 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-12-0415-T [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-12-0415-T [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2013 May;11(5):541-54. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-12-0415-T.

In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a lentivirus, the presence of phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate triggers a conformational change allowing the MA domain to bind the plasma membrane (PM). In this study, the MA protein from bovine leukemia virus (BLV) was used to investigate the mechanism of viral Gag binding to the membrane during replication of a deltaretrovirus. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to measure the binding affinity of MA for two RNA constructs derived from the BLV genome as well as for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The importance of electrostatic interactions and the ability of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) to compete with nucleic acids for binding to MA were also investigated. Our data show that IP6 effectively competes with RNA and DNA for BLV MA binding, while [NaCl] of greater than 100 mM is required to produce any observable effect on DNA-MA binding. These results suggest that BLV assembly may be highly dependent on the specific interaction of the MA domain with components of the PM, as observed previously with HIV-1. The mode of MA binding to nucleic acids and the implications for BLV assembly are discussed.","['Qualley, Dominic F', 'Lackey, Crystal M', 'Paterson, Justin P']","['Qualley DF', 'Lackey CM', 'Paterson JP']","['Department of Chemistry, Berry College, Mt.

In the present study, we determined the transcriptome of HMC-1.2 cells and compared the expression data with those reported in the literature for normal human resting lung and tonsillar mast cells as well as leukocytes from peripheral blood and mononuclear cells from bone marrow aspirates of patients with D816 V-positive systemic mastocytosis. Our results suggest that HMC-1.2 cells are an appropriate model for the investigation of this variant of systemic mast cell activation disease. The data confirm previous suggestions that the pathologically increased activity of mast cells in patients with D816 V-positive systemic mastocytosis can be deduced from the detection of mutation-related changes in the gene expression profile in leukocytes from peripheral blood and in mononuclear cells from bone marrow aspirates. Thus, mutation-related changes of the expression profile can serve as surrogates (besides clustering of mast cells, expression of CD25, and increased release of tryptase) for the presence of the mutation D816 V in tyrosine kinase Kit in patients with systemic mastocytosis according to the WHO criteria. Whether this also holds true for systemic mast cell activation disease caused by other mutations in Kit or other mast cell activity-related genes is a subject for future studies.","['Haenisch, B', 'Herms, S', 'Molderings, G J']","['Haenisch B', 'Herms S', 'Molderings GJ']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunol Res,Immunologic research,8611087,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Lung/cytology', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/genetics/*immunology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tryptases/metabolism']",2013/03/19 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12026-013-8391-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Res. 2013 May;56(1):155-62. doi: 10.1007/s12026-013-8391-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, data in hematological cancers are lacking on which types of CAM are being used, what information sources on CAM patients use and to what extent CAM is being addressed in the consultation with the hematologist. METHODS: We developed a standardized questionnaire on CAM which was provided online to the representatives of the worldwide Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Advocates Network. RESULTS: A total of 53 leaders of patients' advocacy groups for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients from 35 countries responded to the survey. In almost all countries, CAM is important for CML patients and is widely used in addition to conventional leukemia treatment. Mostly, patients have to pay by themselves. General practitioners, herbalists, healers and naturopaths are the main sources for CAM treatments. Information on CAM is derived most frequently from the Internet, and family and friends, but rarely provided by the oncologist. Disclosure of CAM use to the oncologist is low, but increases if oncologists offer CAM. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of very different health care systems, the features of CAM usage are similar in the different countries. We suggest extending the cooperation of self-help and scientists in order to provide training of oncologists on CAM and quality-controlled, evidence-based information on CAM on the Internet both for patients as well as health professionals as a promising strategy to increase safe use of CAM in patients with CML.","['Elsner, Thomas', 'Muecke, Ralph', 'Micke, Oliver', 'Prott, Franz J', 'Muenstedt, Karsten', 'Waldmann, Anita', 'Geissler, Jan', 'Huebner, Jutta']","['Elsner T', 'Muecke R', 'Micke O', 'Prott FJ', 'Muenstedt K', 'Waldmann A', 'Geissler J', 'Huebner J']","['J.W.

In this study, using real-time PCR and ELISA, we found that VEGF and VEGFR-1 are highly expressed in U937 leukemia cells and primary leukemia cells (M4/M5 subtypes), which are associated with an increased migration rate and extramedullary disease. In order to elucidate the role of VEGFR-1 in acute leukemia, we used a lentivirus-mediated shRNA expression system to specifically inhibit VEGFR-1 expression in the U937 cell line. In addition, a series of in vitro experiments were conducted, including cell proliferation and migration assays and drug treatments. Our results showed that shRNA reduced the proliferation and migration of U937 cells. RNA interference targeting VEGFR-1 in combination with bevacizumab did not exert synergistic antitumor effects. However, shRNA enhanced the sensitivity of the U937 cells to cytarabine by decreasing the IC50 of cytarabine, reducing the number of cells in the S phase and suppressing the expression of the survivin gene. Taken together, these results suggest that VEGFR-1 interference may serve as a novel antitumor therapeutic strategy for the treatment of leukemia.","['Xiu, Bing', 'Zhang, Wenjun', 'Huang, Binbin', 'Chen, Jingde', 'Lu, Huina', 'Fu, Jianfei', 'Xiong, Hong', 'Liang, Aibin']","['Xiu B', 'Zhang W', 'Huang B', 'Chen J', 'Lu H', 'Fu J', 'Xiong H', 'Liang A']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji University, Putuo, Shanghai 200065, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '2S9ZZM9Q9V (Bevacizumab)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Bevacizumab', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA Interference/drug effects', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'S Phase/drug effects/genetics', 'U937 Cells', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/genetics/metabolism']",2013/03/19 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2012/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2013.2348 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2013 May;29(5):2030-8. doi: 10.3892/or.2013.2348.

We evaluated all adult patients who received allo-HSCT at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 1999 and 2008. Among the 2879 allo-HSCT patients, 73 (2.5%) were diagnosed with AI. Enteritis (26%) and pneumonia (24%) were the most common clinical manifestations; pneumonia was the most common cause of adenovirus-associated death. A multivariable Bayesian logistic regression showed that when the joint effects of all covariates were accounted for, cord blood transplant, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) </= 200/mm(3) and male gender were associated with a higher probability of disseminated AI. The OS was significantly worse for patients with AI that was disseminated rather than localized (median of 5 months vs median of 28 months, P<0.001) and for patients with ALC </= 200/mm(3) (P<0.001).

We generated human anti-CD19zeta CAR cytotoxic T lymphocytes and cytokine-induced killer cells and studied their sensitivity to the expression of adhesion molecules for the killing of primary B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) targets. Despite a very low basal expression of surface adhesion molecules, B-ALL blasts were lysed by the anti-CD19zeta-CAR transduced effectors as expected. We next investigated the regulatory role of adhesion molecules during CAR-mediated cytolysis. The blocking of these accessory molecules strongly limited the chimeric effector's cytotoxicity. Thereafter, B-ALL cells surface adhesion molecule level expression was induced by IFN-gamma or by the combined use of CD40L and IL-4 and the cells were submitted to anti-CD19zeta-CAR transduced effectors lysis. Upregulation of adhesion molecules expression by blasts potentiated their killing. The improved cytotoxicity observed was dependent on target surface expression of adhesion molecules, particularly CD54. Taken together, these results indicate that adhesion molecules, and principally CD54, are involved in the efficiency of recognition by effector chimeric zeta. These observations have potential implications for the design of immunotherapy treatment approaches for hematological malignancies and tumors based on the adoption of CAR effector cells.","['Laurin, David', 'Marin, Virna', 'Biagi, Ettore', 'Pizzitola, Irene', 'Agostoni, Valentina', 'Gallot, Geraldine', 'Vie, Henri', 'Jacob, Marie Christine', 'Chaperot, Laurence', 'Aspord, Caroline', 'Plumas, Joel']","['Laurin D', 'Marin V', 'Biagi E', 'Pizzitola I', 'Agostoni V', 'Gallot G', 'Vie H', 'Jacob MC', 'Chaperot L', 'Aspord C', 'Plumas J']","['Etablissement Francais du Sang, 29 av du Maquis du Gresivaudan, BP35, 38701 La Tronche, France. david.laurin@efs.sante.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Up-Regulation']",2013/03/19 06:00,2013/09/05 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/CJI.0b013e318288f8c1 [doi]', '00002371-201304000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2013 Apr;36(3):181-9. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0b013e318288f8c1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PARTICIPANTS: All term and late pre-term neonates admitted with clinically apparent seizures and not having any transient metabolic disorders (hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia) were randomly assigned. INTERVENTION: Phenobarbitone (n=54) or phenytoin (n=55) intravenously 20 mg/kg/dose over 20-30 min. Neonates whose seizures were not controlled by the assigned drug were then crossed over to be treated with other drug in same dose. PRIMARY OUTCOME VARIABLE: Clinical control of seizures (seizure free period of 24 hours after giving anticonvulsant). RESULTS: Baseline characteristics including mean birthweight, gestation age and sex were comparable in both groups. Seizures were controlled in 8 of the 55 (14.5%) neonates who received phenytoin, as compared to 39 of 54 (72.2%) neonates who received phenobarbitone (P <0.001).

Here we show that in the haematopoietic system this process is governed by polycomb chromobox (Cbx) proteins. Cbx7 is specifically expressed in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and its overexpression enhances self-renewal and induces leukaemia. This effect is dependent on integration into polycomb repressive complex-1 (PRC1) and requires H3K27me3 binding. In contrast, overexpression of Cbx2, Cbx4 or Cbx8 results in differentiation and exhaustion of HSCs. ChIP-sequencing analysis shows that Cbx7 and Cbx8 share most of their targets; we identified approximately 200 differential targets. Whereas genes targeted by Cbx8 are highly expressed in HSCs and become repressed in progenitors, Cbx7 targets show the opposite expression pattern. Thus, Cbx7 preserves HSC self-renewal by repressing progenitor-specific genes. Taken together, the presence of distinct Cbx proteins confers target selectivity to PRC1 and provides a molecular balance between self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs.","['Klauke, Karin', 'Radulovic, Visnja', 'Broekhuis, Mathilde', 'Weersing, Ellen', 'Zwart, Erik', 'Olthof, Sandra', 'Ritsema, Martha', 'Bruggeman, Sophia', 'Wu, Xudong', 'Helin, Kristian', 'Bystrykh, Leonid', 'de Haan, Gerald']","['Klauke K', 'Radulovic V', 'Broekhuis M', 'Weersing E', 'Zwart E', 'Olthof S', 'Ritsema M', 'Bruggeman S', 'Wu X', 'Helin K', 'Bystrykh L', 'de Haan G']","['European Institute for the Biology of Ageing (ERIBA), Section Ageing Biology and Stem Cells, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen 9700 AD, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,"['0 (Cbx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cbx7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Cbx8 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Cbx4 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/mortality/*pathology', 'Ligases', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/metabolism']",2013/03/19 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2012/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['ncb2701 [pii]', '10.1038/ncb2701 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2013 Apr;15(4):353-62. doi: 10.1038/ncb2701.

We previously generated transgenic mice expressing catalytically inactive RAG1 (dominant-negative recombination activating gene 1 [dnRAG1] mice) that develop an early-onset indolent CD5(+) B-cell lymphocytosis attributed to a defect in secondary V(D)J rearrangements initiated to edit autoreactive B-cell receptor (BCR) specificity. Hypothesizing that CD5(+) B cells in these animals represent potential CLL precursors, we crossed dnRAG1 mice with CLL-prone Emu-TCL1 mice to determine whether dnRAG1 expression in Emu-TCL1 mice accelerates CLL onset. Consistent with this hypothesis, CD5(+) B-cell expansion and CLL progression occurred more rapidly in double-transgenic mice compared with Emu-TCL1 mice. Nevertheless, CD5(+) B cells in the 2 mouse strains exhibited close similarities in phenotype, immunoglobulin gene usage, and mutation status, and expression of genes associated with immune tolerance and BCR signaling. Gene expression profiling further revealed a potential role for prolactin signaling in regulating BCR editing.

We examined the occurrence of treatment-emergent mutations and their impact on response in patients from the ENESTnd phase 3 trial. At the 3-year data cutoff, mutations were detected in approximately twice as many patients (21) on imatinib 400 mg once daily as on nilotinib (11 patients each on nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and nilotinib 400 mg twice daily). The majority of mutations occurred in patients with intermediate or high Sokal scores. Most mutations (14 [66.7%]) emerging during imatinib treatment were imatinib-resistant and nilotinib-sensitive. Incidence of the T315I mutation was low (found in 3, 2, and 3 patients on nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and imatinib, respectively) and mostly occurred in patients with high Sokal scores. Of the patients with emergent mutations, 1 of 11, 2 of 11, and 7 of 21 patients on nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and imatinib, respectively, progressed to accelerated phase/blast crisis (AP/BC) on treatment.

It regulates the expression of genes important for lineage determination, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Deregulation of c-myb expression is known to be involved in the development of human tumors, especially certain types of leukemia and breast and colon cancer. The c-Myb protein has thus been identified as an interesting therapeutic target. We recently discovered that some sesquiterpene lactones suppress Myb-dependent gene expression which is a new mechanism for these natural products' potential anti-cancer activity. We developed a test system to screen compounds for inhibitory activity on Myb-inducible reporter gene activation. Using this system we have now investigated 60 sesquiterpene lactones for their capacity to inhibit c-Myb-dependent gene activation. The IC50 values were in a range between 0.7 and >30 muM. The furanoheliangolide goyazensolide and the pseudoguaianolide helenalin acetate (IC50 = 0.6 and 0.7 muM, respectively) represent the most active inhibitors of c-Myb dependent gene expression found up to present. Control measurements for cell viability (MTS assay) proved that the observed activity on c-Myb dependent gene expression is not a function of cytotoxicity/unspecific cell damage. Structure-activity relationships were investigated by a QSAR approach based on flexible alignment of the most active compounds and a common pharmacophore model. These investigations resulted in a QSAR model which indicates that the potency of inhibitory activity on c-Myb-dependent transcription does not only depend on the presence of reactive Michael-acceptor features but also on their optimal spatial arrangement in the molecule.","['Schomburg, Caroline', 'Schuehly, Wolfgang', 'Da Costa, Fernando B', 'Klempnauer, Karl-Heinz', 'Schmidt, Thomas J']","['Schomburg C', 'Schuehly W', 'Da Costa FB', 'Klempnauer KH', 'Schmidt TJ']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology and Phytochemistry (IPBP), University of Munster, Hittorfstr. 56, D-48149 Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur J Med Chem,European journal of medicinal chemistry,0420510,"['0 (Lactones)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (mim-1 protein, Gallus gallus)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chickens', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Lactones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2013/03/19 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2012/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0223-5234(13)00120-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejmech.2013.02.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Med Chem. 2013 May;63:313-20. doi: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2013.02.018.

Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) functions as the Ca(2+) release channel on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. Much attention has been dedicated to mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake via mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM) which is involved in intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis; however, the molecular mechanisms that link the MAM to mitochondria still remain elusive. We previously reported that Tespa1 (thymocyte-expressed, positive selection-associated gene 1) expressed in lymphocytes physically interacts with IP3R. In this study, we first performed double-immunocytochemical staining of Tespa1 with a mitochondrial marker or an ER marker on an acute T lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Jurkat cells, by using anti-ATP synthase or anti-calnexin antibody, respectively, and demonstrated that Tespa1 was localized very close to mitochondria and the Tespa1 localization was overlapped with restricted portion of ER. Next, we examined the effects of Tespa1 on the T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation-induced Ca(2+) flux by using Ca(2+) imaging in Jurkat cells. Reduction of Tespa1 protein by Tespa1-specific siRNA diminished TCR stimulation-induced Ca(2+) flux into both mitochondria and cytoplasm through the analyses of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) indicator (Rhod-2) and the cytoplasmic Ca(2+) indicator (Fluo-4), respectively. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assay in HEK293 cells revealed that exogenous Tespa1 protein physically interacted with a MAM-associated protein, GRP75 (glucose-regulated protein 75), but not with an outer mitochondrial membrane protein, VDAC1 (voltage-dependent anion channel 1). All these results suggested that Tespa1 will participate in the molecular link between IP3R-mediated Ca(2+) release and mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in the MAM compartment.","['Matsuzaki, Hiroshi', 'Fujimoto, Takahiro', 'Tanaka, Masatoshi', 'Shirasawa, Senji']","['Matsuzaki H', 'Fujimoto T', 'Tanaka M', 'Shirasawa S']","['Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (TESPA1 protein, human)', '0 (VDAC1 protein, human)', '0 (glucose-regulated proteins)', '139873-08-8 (Calnexin)', 'EC 1.6.- (Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1)', 'EC 3.6.3.- (Mitochondrial Proton-Translocating ATPases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antibodies/chemistry/immunology', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calnexin/genetics/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors/genetics/metabolism', 'Intracellular Membranes/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Ion Transport', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Mitochondrial Proton-Translocating ATPases/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1/genetics/metabolism']",2013/03/19 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2013/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(13)00405-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.02.099 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2013 Apr 12;433(3):322-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.02.099.

Poly-herbal preparations containing Hemidesmus are often used by traditional medical practitioners for the treatment of cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the cytodifferentiative, cytostatic and cytotoxic potential of a decoction of Hemidesmus indicus's roots (0.31-3 mg/mL) on a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The decoction of Hemidesmus indicus was characterized by HPLC to quantify its main phytomarkers. Induction of apoptosis, cell-cycle analysis, levels of specific membrane differentiation markers were evaluated by flow cytometry. The analysis of cell differentiation by nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reducing activity, adherence to the plastic substrate, alpha-napthyl acetate esterase activity and morphological analysis was performed through light microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: Starting from the concentration of 0.31 mg/ml, Hemidesmus indicus induced cytotoxicity and altered cell-cycle progression, through a block in the G0/G1 phase. The decoction caused differentiation of HL-60 cells as shown by NBT reducing activity, adherence to the plastic substrate, alpha-naphtyl acetate esterase activity, and increasing expression of CD14 and CD15. The morphological analysis by LM and TEM clearly showed the presence of granulocytes and macrophages after Hemidesmus indicus treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The cytodifferentiating, cytotoxic and cytostatic activities of Hemidesmus indicus offers a scientific basis for its use in traditional medicine. Its potent antileukemic activity provides a pre-clinical evidence for its traditional use in anticancer pharmacology. Further experiments are worthwhile to determine the in vivo anticancer potential of this plant decoction and its components.","['Ferruzzi, L', 'Turrini, E', 'Burattini, S', 'Falcieri, E', 'Poli, F', 'Mandrone, M', 'Sacchetti, G', 'Tacchini, M', 'Guerrini, A', 'Gotti, R', 'Hrelia, P', 'Cantelli-Forti, G', 'Fimognari, C']","['Ferruzzi L', 'Turrini E', 'Burattini S', 'Falcieri E', 'Poli F', 'Mandrone M', 'Sacchetti G', 'Tacchini M', 'Guerrini A', 'Gotti R', 'Hrelia P', 'Cantelli-Forti G', 'Fimognari C']","['Department of Pharmacy and BioTechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (FUT4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fucosyltransferases/metabolism', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Hemidesmus/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Lewis X Antigen/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Macrophages/drug effects/immunology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Preparations/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Plant Roots', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Time Factors']",2013/03/19 06:00,2013/10/25 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2012/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/01 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(13)00103-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2013.02.009 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2013 May 2;147(1):84-91. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2013.02.009.

In conclusion, astaxanthin could relieve the symptoms and halt the progression of pulmonary fibrosis, partly by preventing transdifferentiation, inhibiting proliferation, and promoting apoptosis of activated cells.","['Wang, Meirong', 'Zhang, Jinjin', 'Song, Xiaodong', 'Liu, Wenbo', 'Zhang, Lixia', 'Wang, Xiuwen', 'Lv, Changjun']","['Wang M', 'Zhang J', 'Song X', 'Liu W', 'Zhang L', 'Wang X', 'Lv C']","['Medicine Research Center, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai 264003, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,"['0 (ACTA2 protein, human)', '0 (Actins)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CDH1 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Vimentin)', '0 (Xanthophylls)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '8XPW32PR7I (astaxanthine)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'RMB44WO89X (Hydroxyproline)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bleomycin/adverse effects/metabolism', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cadherins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Transdifferentiation/*drug effects', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyproline/genetics/metabolism', 'Lung/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/*prevention & control', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vimentin/genetics/metabolism', 'Xanthophylls/pharmacology']",2013/03/19 06:00,2014/01/11 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2012/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0278-6915(13)00177-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2013.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2013 Jun;56:450-8. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2013.03.004.

The mechanisms by which oxysterols may influence proliferation are manifold: they control the transcription and the turnover of the key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, by binding to Insig-1, Insig-2 and liver X receptors. Oxysterols are thought to be generated in proportion to the rate of cholesterol synthesis. Although there is no consensus about the mechanism by which these oxysterols are generated in vivo, it clearly has to be ubiquitous. The 25- and the 27-cholesterol hydroxylases, present in almost all tissues, are possible candidates. Cholesterol uptake from lipoproteins, intracellular vesicle transport and lipid transfer are also modified by oxysterols. Oxysterols interfere with ERK, hedgehog and wnt pathways of proliferation and differentiation. When administered in vitro to cancer cell lines, oxysterols invariably both slow down proliferation and provoke cell death. Perhaps is it sufficient to stop proliferation of a cancer to provoke its eradication. Therefore, the two facets of oxysterol action that seem important for cancer treatment, cytostaticity and cytotoxicity, will be discussed.","['de Weille, Jan', 'Fabre, Christine', 'Bakalara, Norbert']","['de Weille J', 'Fabre C', 'Bakalara N']","['Institut des Neurosciences de Montpellier, U1051 INSERM, 80 rue Augustin Fliche, 34295 Montpellier Cedex 05, France.

We investigated whether allo-HLA class II-directed T cells with beneficial GVL reactivity induced in NOD/scid mice engrafted with human chronic myelogenous leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis after treatment with donor lymphocyte infusion - mediated detrimental xenogeneic GVHD as a result of broad off-target cross-reactivity. The results demonstrate that beneficial GVL reactivity and xenogeneic GVHD are mediated by separate T cells. GVL reactivity was mediated by human T cells recognizing allo-HLA class II molecules, whereas xenoreactivity was exerted by human T cells recognizing H-2 molecules. Taken together, our data indicate a limited risk for detrimental off-target effects by allo-HLA class II-directed T cells and thereby provide a basis for the development of strategies for selecting allo-HLA-restricted T cells with selective GVL reactivity for adoptive transfer after HLA-mismatched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Stevanovic, Sanja', 'Nijmeijer, Bart A', 'van Schie, Marianke L J', 'Salvatori, Daniela C F', 'Maas, Saskia', 'Griffioen, Marieke', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['Stevanovic S', 'Nijmeijer BA', 'van Schie ML', 'Salvatori DC', 'Maas S', 'Griffioen M', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. s.stevanovic@lumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/transplantation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2013/03/19 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2012/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(13)00107-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.03.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2013 Jun;19(6):867-75. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.03.003.

Here we demonstrate that astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) is one of such pathways, involving in cell cycle and apoptosis regulation and contributing to enhanced proliferation and chemoresistance in HL-60 and U937 AML cells. The pleiotropic effects of AEG-1 on AML were found to correlate with two novel target genes, Aurora kinase A (AURKA) and Akt1. Down-regulation of AEG-1 by short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) could not only decrease AURKA expression both on mRNA and protein levels but also decrease the levels of pAkt473 and pAkt308 (the active forms of phosphorylated Akt), similar effect as using AURKA inhibitor Tozasertib (VX680). Furthermore, the AEG-1 shRNA-induced malignant phenotype changes could be mitigated by forced overexpression of AURKA through increased Akt1 activation and phosphorylation in AML cells. On the other hand, although exogenous expression of AEG-1 could increase both AURKA and Akt expression levels the simultaneous use of AURKA inhibitor Tozasertib blocked AEG-1's role of up-regulation of Akt expression in ECV304 cells, suggesting that AURKA might be a key mediator of AEG-1 in regulating Akt activation, and a key effector of AEG-1 in maintaining the malignant state of AML. Moreover, knockdown AEG-1 expression also changed the expression levels of PTEN, survivin and stathmin, the genes that have been reported to be involved in the development of several other malignant tumors. Our results provide evidence for AEG-1's carcinogenesis role in AML and reveal a novel functional link between AEG-1 and AURKA on Akt1 activation. AEG-1 can be an important candidate as a drug design target within AURKA signal pathway for more specific killing of AML cells while sparing normal cells.","['Long, Min', 'Hao, Miaowang', 'Dong, Ke', 'Shen, Jianjun', 'Wang, Xi', 'Lin, Fang', 'Liu, Li', 'Wei, Junxia', 'Liang, Yingmin', 'Yang, Jian', 'Gu, Fangna', 'Zhang, Huizhong']","['Long M', 'Hao M', 'Dong K', 'Shen J', 'Wang X', 'Lin F', 'Liu L', 'Wei J', 'Liang Y', 'Yang J', 'Gu F', 'Zhang H']","[""Department of Medical Laboratory and Research Center, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MTDH protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Stathmin)', '0 (Survivin)', '639089-54-6 (VX680)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity', 'Aurora Kinase A', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Centrosome/metabolism', 'Cisplatin/toxicity', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Stathmin/metabolism', 'Survivin', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2013/03/19 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2013/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(13)00067-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.03.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2013 Jun;25(6):1438-46. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.03.001.

With both models a significant correlation between higher score and shorter TTFT could be found.

Results of this comparative analysis showed that after the 2nd year area under curve (AUC) for TTFT was higher than 0.60 for both models and kept unmodified this trend over the time.

This new method proved more sensitive for our needs, than the current protocols available in the public domain. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of 51 cattle, which had given rise to doubtful serological test results by ELISA, and from mesenteric lymph nodes of six cattle that were slaughtered as EBL suspect cases. Additionally, fourteen DNA samples were obtained from animals with a strong BLV antibody response by ELISA. All real-time data were compared to results obtained from three different nested PCR methods. All 14 strongly positive ELISA samples were positive in all PCR tests. The real-time assay in comparison to the conventional PCR methods detected 7.8% (4/51) more specimens positive for BLV nucleic acid and showed a detection limit down to one copy. These observations represent the first report in the value of using a real-time method to help elucidate the disease status of animals when inconclusive ELISA results are obtained in the diagnostic laboratory. Thus, this method should be recommended for use in countries which have implemented an EBL-eradication programme, where a low level of BLV infection is evident.","['Rola-Luszczak, Marzena', 'Finnegan, Christopher', 'Olech, Monika', 'Choudhury, Bhudipa', 'Kuzmak, Jacek']","['Rola-Luszczak M', 'Finnegan C', 'Olech M', 'Choudhury B', 'Kuzmak J']","['OIE Reference Laboratory for EBL, Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy, Poland. mrolka@piwet.pulawy.pl']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Clinical Laboratory Techniques/*methods', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Poland', 'Proviruses/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serologic Tests/methods', 'Veterinary Medicine/*methods', 'Virology/methods']",2013/03/19 06:00,2013/10/22 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2012/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0166-0934(13)00063-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.02.014 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 2013 May;189(2):258-64. doi: 10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.02.014.

METHODS: We examined the views of leukemia patients undergoing treatment in clinics located in the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. An initial written survey was provided to 100 patients (64.1% response rate) followed by a follow-up survey (62.5% response rate) covering the topics of informed consent, withdrawal, anonymity, incidental findings and the return of results, ownership, and trust. RESULTS: The majority (59.6%) preferred one-time consent, 30.3% desired a tiered consent approach that provides multiple options, and 10.1% preferred re-consent for future research. When asked different questions on re-consent, most (58%) reported that re-consent was a waste of time and money, but 51.7% indicated they would feel respected and involved if asked to re-consent. The majority of patients (62.2%) stated they had a right to withdraw their consent, but many changed their mind in the follow-up survey explaining that they should not have the right to withdraw consent. Nearly all of the patients (98%) desired being informed of incidental health findings and explained that the information was useful. Of these, 67.3% of patients preferred that researchers inform them and their doctors of the results. The majority of patients (62.2%) stated that the research institution owns the samples whereas 19.4% stated that the participants owned their samples. Patients had a great deal of trust in doctors, hospitals and government-funded university researchers, moderate levels of trust for provincial governments and industry-funded university researchers, and low levels of trust towards industry and insurance companies. CONCLUSIONS: Many cancer patients surveyed preferred a one-time consent although others desired some form of control. The majority of participants wanted a continuing right to withdraw consent and nearly all wanted to be informed of incidental findings related to their health. Patients had a great deal of trust in their medical professionals and publically-funded researchers as opposed to profit-based industries and insurance companies.","['Master, Zubin', 'Claudio, Jaime O', 'Rachul, Christen', 'Wang, Jean C Y', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Caulfield, Timothy']","['Master Z', 'Claudio JO', 'Rachul C', 'Wang JC', 'Minden MD', 'Caulfield T']","['Alden March Bioethics Institute, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue, MC 153, Albany, NY 12208-3478, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,,IM,"['*Biological Specimen Banks', '*Ethics, Research', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informed Consent', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Perception', 'Public Health Surveillance', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2013/03/19 06:00,2013/08/21 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2012/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1755-8794-6-8 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8794-6-8 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2013 Mar 8;6:8. doi: 10.1186/1755-8794-6-8.,20130308,,PMC3599691,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The natural product silvestrol has potent antitumor activity in several malignancies, but its therapeutic impact on distinct molecular high-risk AML subsets remains to be fully investigated. We examined here the preclinical activity of silvestrol in FLT3-ITD and FLT3 wild-type (wt) AML. METHODS: Silvestrol in vitro anti-leukemic activity was examined by colorimetric cell viability assay, colony-forming and flow cytometry assays assessing growth inhibition and apoptosis, respectively. Pharmacological activity of silvestrol on FLT3 mRNA translation, mRNA and protein expression was determined by RNA-immunoprecipitation, qRT-PCR and immunoblot analyses, respectively. Silvestrol in vivo efficacy was investigated using MV4-11 leukemia-engrafted mice. RESULTS: Silvestrol shows antileukemia activity at nanomolar concentrations both in FLT3-wt overexpressing (THP-1) and FLT3-ITD (MV4-11) expressing AML cell lines (IC50 = 3.8 and 2.7 nM, respectively) and patients' primary blasts [IC50 = ~12 nM (FLT3-wt) and ~5 nM (FLT3-ITD)]. Silvestrol increased apoptosis (~4fold, P = 0.0001), and inhibited colony-formation (100%, P < 0.0001) in primary blasts. Silvestrol efficiently inhibited FLT3 translation reducing FLT3 protein expression by 80-90% and decreased miR-155 levels (~60%), a frequently co-regulated onco-miR in FLT3-ITD-positive AML. The median survival of silvestrol-treated vs vehicle-treated mice was 63 vs 29 days post-engraftment, respectively (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Silvestrol exhibits significant in vivo and in vitro antileukemic activities in AML through a novel mechanism resulting in inhibition of FLT3 and miR-155 expression. These encouraging results warrant a rapid translation of silvestrol for clinical testing in AML.","['Alachkar, Houda', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Harb, Jason G', 'Lucas, David M', 'Oaks, Joshua J', 'Hickey, Christopher J', 'Pan, Li', 'Kinghorn, A Douglas', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Byrd, John C', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Alachkar H', 'Santhanam R', 'Harb JG', 'Lucas DM', 'Oaks JJ', 'Hickey CJ', 'Pan L', 'Kinghorn AD', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Perrotti D', 'Byrd JC', 'Garzon R', 'Grever MR', 'Marcucci G']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. michael.grever@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Il2rg protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (silvestrol)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2013/03/19 06:00,2013/07/26 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2013/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-6-21 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-6-21 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2013 Mar 16;6:21. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-6-21.,20130316,,PMC3623627,,,"['P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50-CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA125066/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA125066/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently chemotherapies are frequently associated with treatment-related death and long-term side effects. Therefore, alternative approaches with lower toxicity are highly desired. Ginsenosides and metabolites are the main ingredients responsible for the multiple pharmaceutical functions of ginseng, which is one of the most commonly consumed herbal medicines world widely. In the present study, we demonstrated that compound K, a major ginsenoside metabolite, inhibited the growth of the clinically relevant pediatric AML cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This growth inhibitory effect was attributable to suppression of DNA synthesis during cell proliferation. Furthermore, we observed significant G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by compound K. The induction of apoptosis was accompanied by DNA double strand breaks. Our findings suggest that as a low toxic natural reagent, compound K could be a potential drug for pediatric AML intervention and to improve the outcome of pediatric AML treatment.","['Chen, Yan', 'Xu, Yajing', 'Zhu, Yan', 'Li, Xiaolin']","['Chen Y', 'Xu Y', 'Zhu Y', 'Li X']","['Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410008, P,R, China. yanchen2012@126.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,2013/03/19 06:00,2013/03/19 06:01,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2013/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/19 06:01 [medline]']","['1475-2867-13-24 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-2867-13-24 [doi]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2013 Mar 12;13(1):24. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-13-24.,20130312,,PMC3602037,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are rapidly being integrated into routine cancer care. However, the expanding spectrum of TK-mutations, bioavailability issues and the emerging problem of primary or secondary TKI-therapy resistance have lead to the search for novel second generation TKIs to improve target potency and to overcome resistant clones.Quizartinib was recently demonstrated to be a selective FLT3 inhibitor with excellent pharmacokinetics and promising in vivo activity in a phase II study for FLT3 ITD + AML patients. In vitro kinase assays have suggested that in addition to FLT3, quizartinib also targets related class III RTK isoforms. METHODS: Various FLT3 or KIT leukemia cell lines and native blasts were used to determine the antiproliferative and proapoptotic efficacy of quizartinib. To better compare differences between the mutant kinase isoforms, we generated an isogenic BaF3 cell line expressing different FLT3, KIT or BCR/ABL isoforms. Using immunoblotting, we examined the effects of quizartinib on activation of mutant KIT or FLT3 isoforms. RESULTS: Kinase inhibition of (mutant) KIT, PDGFR and FLT3 isoforms by quizartinib leads to potent inhibition of cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis in in vitro leukemia models as well as in native leukemia blasts treated ex vivo. However, the sensitivity patterns vary widely depending on the underlying (mutant)-kinase isoform, with some isoforms being relatively insensitive to this agent (e.g. FLT3 D835V and KIT codon D816 mutations). Evaluation of sensitivities in an isogenic cellular background confirms a direct association with the underlying mutant-TK isoform--which is further validated by immunoblotting experiments demonstrating kinase inhibition consistent with the cellular sensitivity/resistance to quizartinib. CONCLUSION: Quizartinib is a potent second-generation class III receptor TK-inhibitor--but specific, mutation restricted spectrum of activity may require mutation screening prior to therapy.","['Kampa-Schittenhelm, Kerstin Maria', 'Heinrich, Michael Charles', 'Akmut, Figen', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Schittenhelm, Marcus Matthias']","['Kampa-Schittenhelm KM', 'Heinrich MC', 'Akmut F', 'Dohner H', 'Dohner K', 'Schittenhelm MM']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Rheumatology, Immunology and Pulmology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany. kerstin.kampa-schittenhelm@med.uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Benzothiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2013/03/19 06:00,2013/11/06 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2012/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-12-19 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-12-19 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2013 Mar 7;12:19. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-12-19.,20130307,,PMC3637582,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In macrophages and dendritic cells, SAMHD1 restricts virus replication by diminishing the deoxynucleotide triphosphate pool to a level below that which supports lentiviral reverse transcription. HIV-2 and related SIVs encode the accessory protein Vpx to induce the proteasomal degradation of SAMHD1 following virus entry. While SAMHD1 has been shown to restrict HIV-1 and SIV, the breadth of its restriction is not known and whether other viruses have a means to counteract the restriction has not been determined. RESULTS: We show that SAMHD1 restricts a wide array of divergent retroviruses, including the alpha, beta and gamma classes. Murine leukemia virus was restricted by SAMHD1 in macrophages yet removal of SAMHD1 did not alleviate the block to infection because of an additional block to viral nuclear import. Prototype foamy virus (PFV) and Human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1) were the only retroviruses tested that were not restricted by SAMHD1. PFV reverse transcribes predominantly prior to entry and thus is unaffected by the dNTP level in the target cell. It is possible that HTLV-1 has a mechanism to render the virus resistant to SAMHD1-mediated restriction. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that SAMHD1 has broad anti-retroviral activity against which most viruses have not found an escape.","['Gramberg, Thomas', 'Kahle, Tanja', 'Bloch, Nicolin', 'Wittmann, Sabine', 'Mullers, Erik', 'Daddacha, Waaqo', 'Hofmann, Henning', 'Kim, Baek', 'Lindemann, Dirk', 'Landau, Nathaniel R']","['Gramberg T', 'Kahle T', 'Bloch N', 'Wittmann S', 'Mullers E', 'Daddacha W', 'Hofmann H', 'Kim B', 'Lindemann D', 'Landau NR']","['Microbiology Department, New York University School of Medicine, New York, USA. thomas.gramberg@viro.med.uni-erlangen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['EC 3.1.5.- (SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1)', 'EC 3.1.5.- (SAMHD1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Dendritic Cells/metabolism/virology', 'HIV-1/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Macrophages/immunology/*virology', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/*virology', 'Retroviridae/classification/*drug effects/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",2013/03/19 06:00,2013/09/17 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2012/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-10-26 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-10-26 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2013 Mar 5;10:26. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-10-26.,20130305,,PMC3605129,,,"['A1067059/PHS HHS/United States', '5T32 A1007180/PHS HHS/United States', 'F31 GM095190/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI049781/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM104198/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular basis of CAPE-mediated cellular activity remains to be clarified. Here, we show that CAPE preferentially induced S- and G2 /M-phase cell-cycle arrests and initiated apoptosis in human cervical cancer lines. The effect was found to be associated with increased expression of E2F-1, as there is no CAPE-mediated induction of E2F-1 in the pre-cancerous cervical Z172 cells. CAPE also up-regulated the E2F-1 target genes cyclin A, cyclin E and apoptotic protease activating of factor 1 (Apaf-1) but down-regulated cyclin B and induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl-1). These results suggest the involvement of E2F-1 in CAPE-mediated growth inhibition and cell-cycle arrest. Transient transfection studies with luciferase reporters revealed that CAPE altered the transcriptional activity of the apaf-1 and mcl-1 promoters. Further studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that E2F-1 binding to the apaf-1 and cyclin B promoters was increased and decreased, respectively, in CAPE-treated cells. Furthermore, E2F-1 silencing abolished CAPE-mediated effects on cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis and related gene expression. Taken together, these results indicate a crucial role for E2F-1 in CAPE-mediated cellular activities in cervical cancer cells.","['Hsu, Tzu-Hui', 'Chu, Chin-Chen', 'Hung, Mei-Whey', 'Lee, Hwei-Jen', 'Hsu, Hsien-Jun', 'Chang, Tsu-Chung']","['Hsu TH', 'Chu CC', 'Hung MW', 'Lee HJ', 'Hsu HJ', 'Chang TC']","['Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (Caffeic Acids)', '0 (Cytostatic Agents)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', 'G960R9S5SK (caffeic acid phenethyl ester)', 'ML9LGA7468 (Phenylethyl Alcohol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Caffeic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytostatic Agents/pharmacology', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Phenylethyl Alcohol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology']",2013/03/19 06:00,2013/07/23 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2012/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/febs.12242 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2013 Jun;280(11):2581-93. doi: 10.1111/febs.12242.

Clinical treatment of CLL is often limited due to drug resistance and severe therapy-induced toxicities. We hypothesized that the omega 3 (n-3) fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and/or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), would increase the sensitivity of malignant B-lymphocytes to anti-cancer drugs doxorubicin, vincristine and/or fludarabine in vitro and that increased sensitivity is achieved by alterations in cell-cycle progression leading to growth inhibition and/or enhanced cell death. We further postulate that enhanced sensitivity is dependent on the formation of lipid peroxides and to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). METHODS: In the present study, B-CLL-derived leukemic cell lines EHEB and MEC-2 and the B-Prolymphocytic leukemic-derived (PLL) cell line JVM-2 were tested for in vitro sensitivity against doxorubicin, vincristine or fludarabine in the presence or absence of vehicle, arachidonic acid (omega 6), EPA or DHA. Cell cycle analysis and Annexin-V assays were performed to determine cell cycle progression and % apoptotic cells, respectively. Assays for malondialdehyde, a measure of lipid peroxidation, and DCF fluorescence assays, a measure of intracellular ROS, were performed to determine if enhanced sensitivity of cells to the drugs by n-3 was dependent on the formation of ROS. RESULTS: Our results indicated that: 1) EPA and DHA differentially sensitized B-leukemic cell lines EHEB, JVM-2 and MEC-2 to doxorubicin, vincristine and fludarabine in vitro; 2) n-3 alone and with drug treatment increased cell death and induced G2/M arrest in a cell-type specific manner; 3) lipid peroxidation increased in the presence of n-3; 4) there was higher lipid peroxidation in MEC-2 cells in presence of DHA and doxorubicin than with either alone; 5) n-3 increased generation of ROS in MEC-2, and 6) the addition of vitamin-E abrogated the increase in ROS generation and chemo-sensitivity of MEC-2 to doxorubicin by DHA. CONCLUSION: N-3's are promising chemo-sensitizing agents for the treatment of CLL. Selective enhancement of chemo-sensitivity of EHEB, JVM-2 and MEC-2 to drugs by n-3 that is not dependent on increased lipid peroxidation and ROS generation indicates alternative mechanisms by which n-3 enhances chemo-sensitivity.","['Fahrmann, Johannes F', 'Hardman, W Elaine']","['Fahrmann JF', 'Hardman WE']","['Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Marshall University School of Medicine, Huntington, WV, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lipids Health Dis,Lipids in health and disease,101147696,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Annexin A5', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arachidonic Acid/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Malondialdehyde', 'Organ Specificity', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology', 'Vitamin E/pharmacology']",2013/03/19 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2013/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-511X-12-36 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-511X-12-36 [doi]']",epublish,Lipids Health Dis. 2013 Mar 16;12:36. doi: 10.1186/1476-511X-12-36.,20130316,,PMC3627749,,,['R01 CA114018/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Ninety-four of 543 AML patients diagnosed with NPM1 mutation between 1987 and 2007 were studied. The expression of surface antigens on leukemic cells was evaluated with respect to clinical manifestations and outcomes. In order to validate the prognostic effect of the immunophenotypic cluster, another 36 patients with NPM1 mutation diagnosed between 2008 and 2010 were analyzed. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients with NPM1 mutations and complete immunophenotyping data were enrolled for a hierarchical cluster analysis and the result was correlated with clinico-laboratory characteristics. Clustering analysis divided the patients with NPM1 mutations into the following two groups: group I, CD34(-)/CD7(-), but with variable expression of HLA-DR; and group II, HLA DR(+)/CD34(+)/CD7(+). With a median follow-up of 53 months, the group II patients had a significantly shorter relapse-free survival (RFS, median: 3 vs. 23 months, p = 0.006) and overall survival (OS, median: 11 vs. 40 months, p = 0.02) than group I patients. Multivariate analysis of variables, including clinico-laboratory data and other gene mutations revealed that the immunophenotypic cluster is an independent prognostic factor (RFS, p = 0.002; OS, p = 0.024). In order to confirm the prognostic effect of the immunophenotypic cluster, another 36 patients with NPM1 mutation diagnosed between 2008 and 2010 were validated. Hierarchical cluster analysis also showed two distinct clusters, group I patient showed significant better RFS (p = 0.021), and OS (p = 0.055).

Yaku'amide A (1) was isolated from a sponge Ceratopsion sp. as an extremely potent cytotoxin. Its structure was determined except for the C4-stereochemistry in the N-terminal acyl group (NTA). This tridecapeptide consists of 2 proteinogenic and 11 nonproteinogenic amino acid residues and is capped with NTA and a C-terminal amine (CTA). alpha,beta-Dehydrovaline, E- and Z-alpha,beta-dehydroisoleucines are the most unusual nonproteinogenic residues of 1 and necessitated development of new methodologies for their assembly. Consequently, Cu-mediated cross-coupling reactions were efficiently employed for E/Z-selective syntheses of the three dipeptides with the dehydroisoleucines and for construction of the tetrapeptide with the dehydrovaline. The peptide was then elongated from the tetrapeptide in a stepwise fashion to deliver the two possible C4-epimers of 1. Extensive NMR studies revealed that the natural 1 possessed the C4S-stereochemistry, and biological assays using P388 mouse leukemia cells demonstrated that both C4-epimers possessed comparable toxicities. The present synthetic methodologies for construction of the highly unsaturated peptide sequence of 1 will allow studies of the relationships between the conformational properties of dehydro amino acid residues and cytotoxicity.","['Kuranaga, Takefumi', 'Sesoko, Yusuke', 'Sakata, Komei', 'Maeda, Naoya', 'Hayata, Atsushi', 'Inoue, Masayuki']","['Kuranaga T', 'Sesoko Y', 'Sakata K', 'Maeda N', 'Hayata A', 'Inoue M']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,7503056,"['0 (Oligopeptides)', ""0 (yaku'amide A)""]",IM,"['Molecular Structure', 'Oligopeptides/*chemical synthesis/*chemistry']",2013/03/19 06:00,2013/09/27 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ja401457h [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Chem Soc. 2013 Apr 10;135(14):5467-74. doi: 10.1021/ja401457h.

METHOD: The expression of circadian clock genes, including circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock), brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1 (Bmal1), period (Per)1/2, and cryptochrome (Cry)1/2, and the proline and acidic amino acid-rich basic leucine zipper (PAR bZip) genes, a transcriptional activator of Per2, including D site of albumin promoter binding protein (Dbp), hepatic leukaemia factor (Hlf), and thyrotroph embryonic factor (Tef), and a transcriptional repressor of Per2, E4-binding protein 4 (E4bp4), in TNF-alpha-stimulated synovial cells was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The D-box motifs in the Per2 promoter were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis, and the promoter activity of the Per2 gene was examined using the luciferase assay. RESULTS: TNF-alpha enhanced the mRNA expression of Bmal1 and Cry1 but did not affect that of Clock, Per1, or Cry2. However, TNF-alpha inhibited the mRNA expression of the Per2 gene, as well as Dbp, Hlf, and Tef, but enhanced the mRNA expression of E4bp4. Furthermore, TNF-alpha inhibited the transcriptional activity of the wild-type Per2 gene in a manner dependent on the D-box 1 and D-box 2 motifs in the Per2 promoter. CONCLUSIONS: TNF-alpha modulates the expression of the Per2 gene through the D-box binding proteins DBP, HLF, TEF, and E4BP4, in rheumatoid synovial cells, and thereby may contribute to the pathogenesis of RA.","['Yoshida, K', 'Hashiramoto, A', 'Okano, T', 'Yamane, T', 'Shibanuma, N', 'Shiozawa, S']","['Yoshida K', 'Hashiramoto A', 'Okano T', 'Yamane T', 'Shibanuma N', 'Shiozawa S']","['Department of Biophysics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Rheumatol,Scandinavian journal of rheumatology,0321213,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CLOCK Proteins)']",IM,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/genetics/physiopathology', 'CLOCK Proteins/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Circadian Clocks/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Humans', '*Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Synovial Membrane/cytology', 'Transfection/methods', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*pharmacology']",2013/03/19 06:00,2013/09/11 06:00,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/03009742.2013.765031 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Rheumatol. 2013;42(4):276-80. doi: 10.3109/03009742.2013.765031.

DDX43 promoter hypomethylation was observed in 22 (25.3%) CML patients. No significant correlation was found between the hypomethylation of the DDX43 promoter with the age, sex, white blood cell counts, hemoglobin concentration, platelet counts, and chromosomal abnormalities of CML patients (p>0.05). The frequency of DDX43 hypomethylation in patients in the chronic phase, in the accelerated phase, and in blast crisis was 23.4% (15/64), 25.0% (2/8), and 33.3% (5/15), respectively (p>0.05).

No study has yet analyzed these parameters from a global perspective and then identified specific deficits in a mixed childhood cancer population. Within this cross-sectional pilot study, motor performance and quality of life of 26 pediatric cancer patients were assessed after inpatient medical treatment, using standardized motor test batteries (MOT 4-6; DMT 6-18) and a quality of life questionnaire (KINDL(R)). Reference data have been mainly provided by the German ""Children and Young People Health Survey"" (KiGGS). Patients achieved lower motor performance scores (p = .000) (more than 27% below the average of healthy peers). Specific deficits were identified in motor speed and motor control (4-6 years), as well as in endurance, strength and coordination under time pressure (6-17 years). In terms of quality of life, no significant differences were examined compared to healthy children of the same age.

However, the significant limitations of these assays have resulted in efforts to move array CGH from use as a discovery tool in the research laboratory into the clinical laboratory as an alternative method for the evaluation of genomic prognostic markers in patients with CLL. OBJECTIVE: The HemeScan() array was developed as a clinical tool to provide prognostic marker identification with simultaneous diagnostic monitoring of the entire genome in CLL and other hematological malignancies. METHODS: The authors review representative data from clinical testing of HemeScan for genomic aberration identification in CLL and present suggestions for the integration of array CGH genome scanning into the clinical laboratory.

AMA are directed against members of 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase complex, including mainly the E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase, the E2 subunit of branched chain 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase complex and the E2 subunit of the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Apart from AMA, PBC is characterized by the presence of PBC-specific antinuclear antibodies (ANA). The molecular targets of these PBC-specific ANA have been characterized as gp210, lamin B receptor, nucleoporin 62, sp100 and promyelocytic leukemia proteins. OBJECTIVE: To discuss the molecular diagnostics of PBC in the context of AMA and PBC-specific ANA detection by the use of conventional and 'new' novel technologies. METHODS: Critical analysis of all published data regarding PBC serology between 1985 and 2007 was performed in order to suggest a diagnostic algorithm for the serological diagnosis of PBC. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: AMA are first detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on frozen sections of rat liver, kidney and stomach substrates. However, because IIF is time-consuming, labor-intensive and observer-dependent, molecular-based assays such as immunoblot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays have been developed with high sensitivity and specificity. Similarly, molecular-based assays have also been developed for the detection of PBC-specific ANA. The latter investigation seems to be of outmost importance because these autoantibodies can be used as a positive tool in the diagnosis of AMA-negative PBC while at the same time identifying a subgroup of PBC patients with more advanced disease. New test systems for the detection of PBC-specific antibodies based on the xMultiple Analyte Profiling Luminex methodology seems to be the future in molecular diagnostics of PBC as it was expected first to decrease the cost and second to speed up an accurate serological profile, although they may decrease further the proportion of AMA-negative PBC cases.","['Rigopoulou, Eirini I', 'Dalekos, George N']","['Rigopoulou EI', 'Dalekos GN']","['University of Thessaly, Department of Medicine, Academic Liver Unit and Research Lab of Internal Medicine, Medical School, Papakiriazi 22 Street, 41222 Larissa, Greece +30 2410 565251 ; +30 2410 565250 ; dalekos@med.uth.gr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Expert Opin Med Diagn,Expert opinion on medical diagnostics,101392201,,,,2008/06/01 00:00,2008/06/01 00:01,['2013/03/19 06:00'],"['2013/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1517/17530059.2.6.621 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Med Diagn. 2008 Jun;2(6):621-34. doi: 10.1517/17530059.2.6.621.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Asteraceae), exhibited potent 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activity and melanogenesis-inhibitory activity in alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH)-stimulated B16 melanoma cells. Eight caffeoylquinic acids, 1 and 6-12, five flavonoids, 13-17, two benzoic acid derivatives, 18 and 19, three coumarin derivatives, 20-22, four steroids, 23-26, and six triterpenoids, 27-32, were isolated from the MeOH extract.

Lysyl oxidases (LOXs) are copper-dependent amine oxidases that play a critical role in the biogenesis of connective tissue by crosslinking extracellular matrix proteins, collagen and elastin. Expression of LOX gene family members is increased in disorders associated with increased fibrosis. To evaluate involvement of LOX gene family in various MPNs. In-situ hybridization was used to detect Lysyl-Oxidase family members in bone marrow biopsies from patients with different MPNs. We compared normal bone marrows and those from patients with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Serum levels of lysyl-oxidase from patients with PMF and healthy controls were also examined. LOX gene family was not detected in normal bone marrows. All members of the LOX gene family were over expressed in PMF. In other MPNs a differential pattern of expression was observed. Differences in gene expression were statistically significant (P < 0.010). The medianserum LOX levels in normal controls was 28.4 +/- 2.5 ng\ml and 44.6 +/- 9.44 ng\ml in PMF (P = 0.02). The varying pattern of expression of LOX genes may reflect differences in the pathophysiology of bone marrow fibrosis in these MPNs. These observations could be used as the basis for future targeted therapy directed against bone marrow fibrosis.","['Tadmor, T', 'Bejar, J', 'Attias, D', 'Mischenko, E', 'Sabo, E', 'Neufeld, G', 'Vadasz, Z']","['Tadmor T', 'Bejar J', 'Attias D', 'Mischenko E', 'Sabo E', 'Neufeld G', 'Vadasz Z']","['The Hematology Unit, Bnai-Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.4.- (Amino Acid Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.4.3.- (LOXL1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.4.3.- (LOXL2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.4.3.- (LOXL3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.4.3.13 (Protein-Lysine 6-Oxidase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Oxidoreductases/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Fibrosis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Polycythemia Vera/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein-Lysine 6-Oxidase/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/enzymology/metabolism/pathology']",2013/03/16 06:00,2013/06/20 06:00,['2013/03/16 06:00'],"['2013/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23409 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 May;88(5):355-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23409.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the anti-allergic effects of acteoside has not yet been elucidated. Here, we used microarray analysis to determine the global gene expression profile of KU812 cells treated with acteoside and calcium ionophore A23187 plus phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (A23187+PMA), and the results were validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting. Microarray analysis results showed that of the 201 genes in the microarray, 149 genes were up-regulated, while 52 genes were down-regulated. The significantly down-regulated genes have functions as chemokine and IgE receptors, as well as for immune response. Results of the validation of the microarray results using real-time PCR showed a significant decrease in the expressions of Fc fragment of IgE, high affinity I, receptor for; alpha polypeptide (FCER1A) and nuclear factor of activated T cell, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 1 (NFATC1) genes. Furthermore, Western blotting showed a decrease in the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Jun N terminal kinase (JNK), revealing the role of JNK MAPK in acteoside-mediated allergy inhibition. We determined that the anti-allergy effects of acteoside were due to the down-regulation of the expressions of the chemokine ligand 1 (CCL1), CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, FCER1A and NFATC1 genes and the inhibition of the MAPK pathway through decreased JNK phosphorylation.","['Motojima, Hideko', 'Villareal, Myra O', 'Iijima, Rieko', 'Han, Junkyu', 'Isoda, Hiroko']","['Motojima H', 'Villareal MO', 'Iijima R', 'Han J', 'Isoda H']","['Alliance for Research on North Africa (ARENA), University of Tsukuba, Tennodai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8572, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Nat Med,Journal of natural medicines,101518405,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Calcium Ionophores)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '3TGX09BD5B (acteoside)', '56937-68-9 (phorbolol myristate acetate)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Basophils/*drug effects/immunology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cistanche/chemistry', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Glucosides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity, Immediate/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Phenols/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2013/03/16 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/03/16 06:00'],"['2012/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11418-013-0753-4 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Med. 2013 Oct;67(4):790-8. doi: 10.1007/s11418-013-0753-4.

We found that, in Bcl-3-silenced cells, caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 activation is accelerated and tBid mitochondrial content is increased. It is important to note that, although mitochondrial Smac levels were reduced after UV exposure, the rate of reduction was slightly higher in Bcl-3 silenced cells than in control cells.

The latter targets have been particularly useful for the treatment of multiple myeloma, transforming a previously uniformly, fatal disease to one of a more chronic and potentially curable disorder. Subsequently, new treatment approaches are less likely to be based on the more classic types of cytocidal therapy, which, although successful and essential for the more aggressive disorders that are immediately life-threatening, tend to be less so, with respect to quality of life, risk versus benefit ratio and overall curability for the indolent diseases. Because the majority of newer agents are not available to the clinicians practicing in the community, a number of treatment options developed over the past two decades are capable of significantly improving the quality of life of patients with advanced CLL. The initial clinical approach to the patient should be based on performance status, age, comorbidities, and increasingly on prognostic factors elucidated over the past three decades. Initially, both simple laboratory studies and easily measurable clinical manifestations were used to guide the clinician (lymphocyte count, anemia, thrombocytopenia, enlarging lymph nodes, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly), and clinical staging systems were developed. At present a cadre of biologic factors, including cytogenetic alterations, gene expression profiles with subsequent immunoglobulin abnormalities, and expression of CD38 and Zap-70, are now available and are standard decision-making criteria to treat a patient with CLL. An initial period of observation allows the clinician along with the patient to gather all the information necessary to make an informed treatment decision. Frequently, a ""watch and wait"" approach, which for CLL does not appear to harm the patient, is the most appropriate decision. Complications of CLL, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, will lead to treatment at least temporarily in those patients who might otherwise have not needed therapy. Frontline therapy will range from easily administrable single-agents to combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens. Experimental protocols, utilizing ""post state of the art"" treatments, are available in the form of research protocols at major treatment centers. At the present time, it is premature to recommend bone marrow ablative therapy as initial treatment unless the prognosis appears grave and the patient can withstand the rigors of this approach.","['Kempin, Sanford']",['Kempin S'],"['Beth Israel Comprehensive Cancer Center, 325 West 15th Street, New York, NY 10011, USA. skempin@chpnet.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Quality of Life']",2013/03/16 06:00,2014/01/24 06:00,['2013/03/16 06:00'],"['2013/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11864-013-0229-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2013 Jun;14(2):144-55. doi: 10.1007/s11864-013-0229-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome are characterized by different survival times and ability to transform into acute myeloid leukemia. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study included the assessment of the relationship between the images obtained by magnetic resonance scans of lumbar spine and the clinical symptoms of the disease in patients diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome, as well as the assessment of the correlation of the images with the phase of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia. MATERIAL/METHODS: The study-related tests were carried out in Specialist Hospital No. 1 in Bytom between 2006 and 2011 and involved 53 patients aged 55/77, divided into groups according to the diagnosed subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome. The study also included the prognosis of overall survival and time to transformation into AML on the basis of valid classifications. The spinal magnetic resonance scans were obtained from medical documentation. The analysis included images obtained using T1- and T2-weighted sequences in sagittal, transverse and frontal planes in all patients, images obtained using the STIR sequence from 21 patients as well as 40 images obtained after contrast administration. The statistical analysis of the results was carried out using STATISTICA software. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results demonstrated that the magnetic resonance scans revealed statistically significant changes in the images of bone marrow in vertebral body scans; with a decrease in the intensity of MRI signals correlated with the RAEB subtype, particularly with transformation into acute myeloid leukemia as well as with the high IPSS risk score with regard to the time of survival and transformation into acute myeloid leukemia. The research-related test results indicate the importance of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnostics and the assessment of the disease dynamics.","['Kwiatkowska-Pamula, Anna', 'Ziolko, Ewa', 'Muc-Wierzgon, Malgorzata', 'Nowakowska-Zajdel, Ewa', 'Podwinska, Ewa', 'Adamczyk, Tomasz']","['Kwiatkowska-Pamula A', 'Ziolko E', 'Muc-Wierzgon M', 'Nowakowska-Zajdel E', 'Podwinska E', 'Adamczyk T']","['Clinical Department of Internal Diseases, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Hospital No.1 in Bytom, Bytom, Poland ; Department of Hematology, Hospital No. 1 in Bytom, Bytom, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Pol J Radiol,Polish journal of radiology,101175532,,,,2013/03/16 06:00,2013/03/16 06:01,['2013/03/16 06:00'],"['2012/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.12659/PJR.883766 [doi]', 'poljradiol-78-1-42 [pii]']",ppublish,Pol J Radiol. 2013 Jan;78(1):42-9. doi: 10.12659/PJR.883766.,,,PMC3596144,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MRI of the spine', 'marrow imaging', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between the 28 patients treated with MTX (MTX-treated group) and the 26 who were not (non-MTX group), there was no difference in age, interval between onset of RA and LPD, and lymphoma stage. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that in the MTX-treated group, 15 (53 %) patients had mature B-cell LPD, eight (29 %) mature T/NK-cell LPD, and five (18 %) had Hodgkin lymphoma. In the non-MTX group, 22 (84 %) had mature B-cell LPD, 2 (8 %) had mature T/NK-cell LPD, and 2 (8 %) had Hodgkin lymphoma. The frequency of mature T/NK-cell LPD was significantly higher in the MTX-treated group (p < 0.05). Of the eight patients in the MTX-treated group with mature T/NK-cell LPD, two had large granular lymphocytic leukemia and the other six had a variety of different histological types with frequent CD8 but not CD56 expression. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was significantly higher in the MTX-treated group (p < 0.05); evidence of latent type II EBV infection was found in four of the eight patients with mature T/NK-cell LPD. Withdrawal of MTX led to complete remission in seven patients with mature T/NK-cell LPD irrespective of EBV infection. Our findings highlight that mature T/NK-cell LPD is a frequent complication in RA patients treated with MTX. EBV infection may play a role in the pathogenesis of T/NK-cell LPD, as well as B-cell LPD and Hodgkin lymphoma in MTX-treated RA patients.","['Kondo, Seiji', 'Tanimoto, Kazuki', 'Yamada, Kozue', 'Yoshimoto, Goichi', 'Suematsu, Eiichi', 'Fujisaki, Tomoaki', 'Oshiro, Yumi', 'Tamura, Kazuo', 'Takeshita, Morishige', 'Okamura, Seiichi']","['Kondo S', 'Tanimoto K', 'Yamada K', 'Yoshimoto G', 'Suematsu E', 'Fujisaki T', 'Oshiro Y', 'Tamura K', 'Takeshita M', 'Okamura S']","['Department of Hematology, Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center, 1-8-1 Jigyohama, Chuo-ku, Fukuoka, Japan. skondo@koseikan.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,"['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antirheumatic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/complications/*drug therapy', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",2013/03/16 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2013/03/16 06:00'],"['2012/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00428-013-1389-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Virchows Arch. 2013 Apr;462(4):399-407. doi: 10.1007/s00428-013-1389-1.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is an ancient Chinese medicine, which is used to treat psoriasis, asthma, and acute promyelocytic leukemia. AIM: We wanted to research the effect of arsenic trioxide on asthma. METHODS: Using a murine model of asthma, the airway hyperresponsiveness was conducted by the Buxco pulmonary function apparatus. Total cell counts of BALF were counted with a counting chamber. Histopathological analysis of lung tissues was conducted by hematoxylin-eosin or periodic acid-schiff stain. CD4+T cells were purified from the spleen by positive selection, using immunomagnetic beads. Apoptosis measurements were done with Annexin-V/PI staining. Western blot analysis and real time-PCR were performed to assess the expression of C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), respectively. RNA interference was conducted to inhibit the expression of CHOP. RESULTS: We found that arsenic trioxide treatment alleviated airway hyperresponsiveness and reduced inflammation of the lung in asthmatic mice. Furthermore, arsenic trioxide treatment promoted apoptosis of CD4+T cells in vivo and in vitro. When CD4+T cells were cultured with arsenic trioxide for 5 h at a concentration of 5 muM, the expression of GRP78 and CHOP was increased. Treatment of CD4+T cells with CHOP siRNA, provided partial resistance to arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis of CD4+T cells CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrated that arsenic trioxide can reduce the severity of asthma attacks and induce the apoptosis of CD4+ T cell which the ER stress-CHOP pathway involved.","['Li, K', 'Zhang, L', 'Xiang, X', 'Gong, S', 'Ma, L', 'Xu, L', 'Wang, G', 'Liu, Y', 'Ji, X', 'Liu, S', 'Chen, P', 'Zeng, H', 'Li, J']","['Li K', 'Zhang L', 'Xiang X', 'Gong S', 'Ma L', 'Xu L', 'Wang G', 'Liu Y', 'Ji X', 'Liu S', 'Chen P', 'Zeng H', 'Li J']","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410011, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Ir J Med Sci,Irish journal of medical science,7806864,"['0 (Anti-Asthmatic Agents)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Ddit3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oxides)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Asthmatic Agents/pharmacology', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Asthma/drug therapy/immunology/physiopathology', 'Bronchial Hyperreactivity/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/immunology', 'Bronchoconstriction/drug effects', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', '*Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Female', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Lung/drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",2013/03/16 06:00,2014/07/01 06:00,['2013/03/16 06:00'],"['2012/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11845-013-0928-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Ir J Med Sci. 2013 Dec;182(4):573-83. doi: 10.1007/s11845-013-0928-8.

Ery5 induced cytotoxicity in HL-60 cells by involving activation of bax and cleavage of caspase 3, which contributed towards activation of both apoptotic and autophagic pathways. Trolox and tiron, even at non-toxic concentrations, contributed to the cytotoxicity of Ery5 by activation of autophagic proteins like ATG7, ATG12 and LC3-II. Z-VAD-fmk mediated reduction in the cytotoxicity and expression of autophagic proteins, further suggested that autophagy induced by Ery5 is largely dependent upon caspases. Interestingly, Ery5 induced autophagy was accompanied by the downregulation of PI3K/AKT pathway whereas, trolox and tiron strongly enhanced this effect. In addition to that treatment of cells with Ery5, trolox and tiron individually, displayed a marked upregulation of Bax. The involvement of Bax in trolox and tiron induced enhancement of the cytotoxicity of Ery5 was confirmed, when siRNA induced silencing of Bax led to increased viability of the cells and exerted a strong inhibitory effect on LC3-II accumulation and p62 degradation in case of cells treated by the combination of Ery5 with trolox or tiron. Additionally, an important role of PARP in Ery5 mediated cell death has been suggested by PARP silencing experiments, however, potentiation of autophagic cytotoxicity by trolox and tiron did not seem to be dependent on PARP-1. Therefore, Bax seems to play a vital role in trolox and tiron mediated potentiation of autophagic cell death by Ery5 in HL-60 cells.","['Kumar, Suresh', 'Kumar, Ajay', 'Pathania, Anup Singh', 'Guru, Santosh Kumar', 'Jada, Srinivas', 'Sharma, Parduman Raj', 'Bhushan, Shashi', 'Saxena, Ajit Kumar', 'Kumar, H M Sampath', 'Malik, Fayaz']","['Kumar S', 'Kumar A', 'Pathania AS', 'Guru SK', 'Jada S', 'Sharma PR', 'Bhushan S', 'Saxena AK', 'Kumar HM', 'Malik F']","['Department of Cancer Pharmacology, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine CSIR, Canal Road, Jammu 180001, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (ATG12 protein, human)', '0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 12)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Chromans)', '0 (Ery5 compound)', '0 (Lignans)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '001E35HGVF (magnolol)', '4X87R5T106 (1,2-Dihydroxybenzene-3,5-Disulfonic Acid Disodium Salt)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (RET protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Atg7 protein, human)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Autophagy-Related Protein 7)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes)', 'S18UL9710X (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid)']",IM,"['1,2-Dihydroxybenzene-3,5-Disulfonic Acid Disodium Salt/*pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Autophagy/*drug effects/genetics', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 12', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 7', 'Biphenyl Compounds/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromans/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lignans/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Phenols/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*genetics/metabolism']",2013/03/16 06:00,2013/11/12 06:00,['2013/03/16 06:00'],"['2013/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-013-0805-y [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2013 May;18(5):605-17. doi: 10.1007/s10495-013-0805-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, our findings revealed that the sequential activity of Foxo3a by guanosine 5'-triphosphate can impede cellular proliferation and suppress p73 expression as oncoprotein in K562 cells; thus identifying Foxo3a as a tumor suppressor in these p53 null cells. However, down-regulation of Foxo3a-dependent p73 expression causes cell differentiation along the erythroid lineage.

Low hematologic toxicity is a remarkable characteristic of this novel second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and this has been ascribed to its minimal activity against the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and KIT. Low-grade, typically self-limiting diarrhea, which usually appears within the first few weeks after treatment initiation, represents the predominant toxicity of bosutinib. Other treatment-associated adverse events are mostly mild to moderate. Bosutinib has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic, accelerated, or blast phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML in adult patients with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. This review summarizes the main properties of bosutinib and the currently available data on its clinical potential in the treatment of CML.","['Amsberg, Gunhild Keller-von', 'Koschmieder, Steffen']","['Amsberg GK', 'Koschmieder S']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Cancer Center Hamburg, University Hospital Hamburg Eppendorf, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,2013/03/16 06:00,2013/03/16 06:01,['2013/03/16 06:00'],"['2013/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S19901 [doi]', 'ott-6-099 [pii]']",ppublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2013;6:99-106. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S19901.

Higher miR-29b pretreatment expression is associated with improved response to decitabine and better outcome in AML. Thus, designing a strategy to increase miR-29b levels in AML blasts may be of therapeutic value. However, free synthetic miRs are easily degraded in bio-fluids and have limited cellular uptake. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel transferrin-conjugated nanoparticle delivery system for synthetic miR-29b (Tf-NP-miR-29b). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Delivery efficiency was investigated by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and quantitative PCR. The expression of miR-29b targets was measured by immunoblotting. The antileukemic activity of Tf-NP-miR-29b was evaluated by measuring cell proliferation and colony formation ability and in a leukemia mouse model. RESULTS: Tf-NP-miR-29b treatment resulted in more than 200-fold increase of mature miR-29b compared with free miR-29b and was approximately twice as efficient as treatment with non-transferrin-conjugated NP-miR-29b. Tf-NP-miR-29b treatment significantly downregulated DNMTs, CDK6, SP1, KIT, and FLT3 and decreased AML cell growth by 30% to 50% and impaired colony formation by approximately 50%. Mice engrafted with AML cells and then treated with Tf-NP-miR-29b had significantly longer survival compared with Tf-NP-scramble (P = 0.015) or free miR-29b (P = 0.003). Furthermore, priming AML cell with Tf-NP-miR-29b before treatment with decitabine resulted in marked decrease in cell viability in vitro and showed improved antileukemic activity compared with decitabine alone (P = 0.001) in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Tf-NP effectively delivered functional miR-29b, resulting in target downregulation and antileukemic activity and warrants further investigation as a novel therapeutic approach in AML.","['Huang, Xiaomeng', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Yu, Bo', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Wang, Hongyan', 'Hoellerbauer, Pia', 'Mims, Alice', 'Klisovic, Rebecca', 'Walker, Alison R', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Blum, William', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Byrd, John C', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Lee, Robert J', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Lee, Ly James', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Huang X', 'Schwind S', 'Yu B', 'Santhanam R', 'Wang H', 'Hoellerbauer P', 'Mims A', 'Klisovic R', 'Walker AR', 'Chan KK', 'Blum W', 'Perrotti D', 'Byrd JC', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Lee RJ', 'Garzon R', 'Muthusamy N', 'Lee LJ', 'Marcucci G']","['Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (1,2-dioleoyl-glycero-3-phosphatidyl ethanolamine)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Transferrin)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '9KJL21T0QJ (Linoleic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Linoleic Acid/chemistry', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/chemistry', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry', 'RNA Interference', 'Transferrin/*chemistry', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2013/03/16 06:00,2013/11/13 06:00,['2013/03/16 06:00'],"['2013/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-3191 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3191 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 May 1;19(9):2355-67. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3191.

It is not only a key player in regulating cellular growth and proliferation, but also behaves as a potent suppressor of apoptosis. CK2 has been frequently found to be deregulated (mostly hyperactivated) in all cancers, prostate cancer being prominent of them. In the recent past, tumor suppressor PML (promyelocytic leukemia) has been shown to be a target of phosphorylation by CK2. This phosphorylation promotes the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of PML thereby effectively curbing its role as a tumor suppressor. Among many others, PML has also been established to mediate its tumor suppressive role by mitigating the inactivation of active AKT (pAKT) inside the nucleus by assembling a dephosphorylating platform for nuclear pAKT. One of the immediate consequences, of this inactivation is the stabilization of FOXO3a, another well-established tumor suppressor, inside the nucleus and its downstream activities. Here, we propose a novel signaling axis apexed by deregulated CK2, dismantling the association of PML and PHLPP2 (we also report PHLPP2 to be a novel interacting partner of PML inside the nucleus), ultimately leading to the inactivation and nuclear exclusion of FOXO3a, thereby downregulating p21/p27/Bim in which degradation of PML and the concomitant stabilization of pAKT plays a cardinal part.","['Chatterjee, A', 'Chatterjee, U', 'Ghosh, M K']","['Chatterjee A', 'Chatterjee U', 'Ghosh MK']","['Division of Cancer Biology and Inflammatory Disorder, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4, Raja S.C.

Incubation of Kasumi-1 cells in hypoxia induced growth arrest, apoptosis and reduction of AML1/ETO protein expression. The conditional expression of AML1/ETO in U937-A/E cells showed that hypoxia induces marked apoptosis in AML1/ETO-expressing cells only, pointing to AML1/ETO as a factor predisposing cells to hypoxia-induced apoptosis. In AML1/ETO-expressing cells, hypoxia enhanced TRAIL expression and its proapoptotic effects. AML1/ETO was found to bind TRAIL promoter and induce TRAIL transcription, although TRAIL expression was restrained by a concomitant relative transcription block. In hypoxia, such a TRAIL repression was removed and an increase of TRAIL expression was induced. Finally, blocking anti-TRAIL antibodies markedly reduced (Kasumi-1 cells) or completely inhibited (U937-A/E cells) hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicated that hypoxia induces apoptosis in AML1/ETO-expressing cells via a TRAIL/caspase 8-dependent autocrine loop and that TRAIL is a key regulator of hypoxia-induced apoptosis in these cells.","['Barbetti, V', 'Tusa, I', 'Cipolleschi, M G', 'Rovida, E', 'Dello Sbarba, P']","['Barbetti V', 'Tusa I', 'Cipolleschi MG', 'Rovida E', 'Dello Sbarba P']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche Sperimentali e Cliniche, Sezione di Patologia e Oncologia Sperimentali, Universita degli Studi di Firenze and Istituto Toscano Tumori, Firenze, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Caspase 8/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Hypoxia/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oxygen/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2013/03/16 06:00,2013/08/24 06:00,['2013/03/16 06:00'],"['2013/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201349 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.49 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Mar 14;4:e536. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.49.,20130314,,PMC3613827,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the contribution of AA to TPA-induced differentiation of human leukemia HL-60 cells. We found that treatment of HL-60 cells with TPA resulted in increases in cell attachment and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-positive cells, which were significantly enhanced by the addition of AA. Stimulation of TPA-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by AA was detected in HL-60 cells via a DCHF-DA analysis, and the addition of the antioxidant, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), was able to reduce TPA+AA-induced differentiation in accordance with suppression of intracellular peroxide elevation by TPA+AA. Furthermore, activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by TPA+AA was identified in HL-60 cells, and the ERK inhibitor, PD98059, but not the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, inhibited TPA+AA-induced NBT-positive cells. Suppression of TPA+AA-induced ERK protein phosphorylation by PD98059 and NAC was detected, and AA enhanced ERK protein phosphorylation by TPA was in HL-60 cells. AA clearly increased TPA-induced HL-60 cell differentiation, as evidenced by a marked increase in CD11b expression, which was inhibited by NAC and PD98059 addition. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as well as AA showed increased intracellular peroxide production and differentiation of HL-60 cells elicited by TPA. Evidence of AA potentiation of differentiation by TPA in human leukemia cells HL-60 via activation of ROS-dependent ERK protein phosphorylation was first demonstrated herein.","['Chien, Chih-Chiang', 'Wu, Ming-Shun', 'Shen, Shing-Chuan', 'Yang, Liang-Yo', 'Wu, Wen-Shin', 'Chen, Yen-Chou']","['Chien CC', 'Wu MS', 'Shen SC', 'Yang LY', 'Wu WS', 'Chen YC']","['Division of Nephrology, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Scotland,Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids,"Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",8802730,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",2013/03/16 06:00,2013/09/27 06:00,['2013/03/16 06:00'],"['2012/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0952-3278(13)00007-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.plefa.2013.01.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids. 2013 Apr;88(4):289-98. doi: 10.1016/j.plefa.2013.01.004.

A specific chemokine receptor, CXCR4, has multiple critical functions in normal physiologies including embryonic development of the cardiovascular, hemopoietic and central nervous systems, and underlies problematic pathologies such as HIV infection, cancer metastasis, leukemia progression and rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS AND RESULTS: A tetradecamer peptide, T140, derived from the horseshoe crab, and its biologically stable derivative, 4F-benzoyl-TN14003, were found to be powerful CXCR4 antagonists that block HIV entry to cells. These peptides have also shown remarkable inhibitory activity against cancer metastasis and progression in a variety of cancers. Slow release administration of 4F-benzoyl-TN14003, for example, was found to significantly reduce pulmonary metastasis of breast cancer cells in severe combined immunodeficient mice. This peptide also shows inhibitory effects against melanoma metastasis and Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferation in mice, suppresses the delayed-type hypersensitivity response induced by sheep red blood cells and reduced collagen-induced arthritis in both mouse models of arthritis. CONCLUSION: T140 analogues have the potential to become promising agents for chemotherapy of AIDS, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.

This study examined the risk of developing cancer (i.e. SIR) that occurs in association with CD. METHODS: The subjects were 770 CD patients managed at our hospital department, which specializes in inflammatory bowel disease, during the approximately 25 years from July 1985 to August 2010. The number of expected cancer patients in a healthy population matched for sex and age with the CD patients in our hospital was then calculated. The relative risk, or SIR, was also calculated. RESULTS: The total observation period was 10,552 person-years, during which 19 cases (2.5%) of cancer were discovered in 770 subjects. The cancer cases included nine cases of colorectal cancer (CRC), one case of small bowel cancer, one case of stomach cancer, three cases of acute myeloid leukemia, two cases of endometrial cancer, one case of lung cancer, one case of skin cancer, and one case of thyroid cancer. The SIR for cancers in Japan in 2003 was 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-1.35) for all cancers, 2.79 (95% CI 1.28-5.29) for CRC, and 6.94 (95% CI 1.43-20.3) for leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Among the cancers in CD patients in our hospital, no significant difference was seen in the risk for all cancers in comparison with the standard population. However, the risks for CRC and leukemia were significantly higher than in the standard population.","['Yano, Yutaka', 'Matsui, Toshiyuki', 'Hirai, Fumihito', 'Okado, Yuki', 'Sato, Yuho', 'Tsurumi, Kozue', 'Ishikawa, Satoshi', 'Beppu, Tsuyoshi', 'Koga, Akihiro', 'Yoshizawa, Naoyuki', 'Higashi, Daijiro', 'Futami, Kitaro']","['Yano Y', 'Matsui T', 'Hirai F', 'Okado Y', 'Sato Y', 'Tsurumi K', 'Ishikawa S', 'Beppu T', 'Koga A', 'Yoshizawa N', 'Higashi D', 'Futami K']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Fukuoka University Chikushi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan. yutakay@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,J Gastroenterol Hepatol,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,8607909,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Asians', 'Child', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Crohn Disease/*complications/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/16 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/03/16 06:00'],"['2013/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jgh.12189 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2013 Aug;28(8):1300-5. doi: 10.1111/jgh.12189.,,"['(c) 2013 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley', 'Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.']",,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"[""Crohn's disease"", 'Japanese', 'anti-TNF-alpha', 'cancer', 'standardized incidence ratio (SIR)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we review the current state of knowledge of the class of targeted agents known as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, with a focus on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Flavopiridol (alvocidib) is the best studied of the CDK inhibitors, producing a dramatic cytotoxic effect in vitro and in vivo, with the principal limiting factor of acute tumor lysis. Unfortunately, flavopiridol has a narrow therapeutic window and is relatively non-selective with several off-target (i.e. non-CDK) effects, which prompted development of the second-generation CDK inhibitor dinaciclib. Dinaciclib appears to be both more potent and selective than flavopiridol, with at least an order of magnitude greater therapeutic index, and is currently in phase III clinical trials. In additional to flavopiridol and dinaciclib, we also review the current status of other members of this class, and provide commentary as to the future direction of combination therapy including CDK inhibitors.","['Blachly, James S', 'Byrd, John C']","['Blachly JS', 'Byrd JC']",['Division of Hematology.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2013/03/16 06:00,2014/05/09 06:00,['2013/03/16 06:00'],"['2013/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.783911 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Oct;54(10):2133-43. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.783911.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is essential for the function and survival of cardiomyocytes. Hence, agents that target the EGFR pathway are cardiotoxic. Tocotrienols protect from radiation injury, but may also enhance the therapeutic effects of EGFR pathway inhibitors in cancer treatment. This study investigated the effects of local irradiation on the EGFR pathway in the heart and tests whether tocotrienols may modify radiation-induced changes in this pathway. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats received image-guided localized heart irradiation with 21 Gy. Twenty four hours before irradiation, rats received a single dose of tocotrienol-enriched formulation or vehicle by oral gavage. At time points from 2 h to 9 months after irradiation, left ventricular expression of EGFR pathway mediators was studied. RESULTS: Irradiation caused a decrease in the expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and neuregulin-1 (Nrg-1) mRNA from 6 h up to 10 weeks, followed by an upregulation of these ligands and the receptor erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB)4 at 6 months. In addition, the upregulation of Nrg-1 was statistically significant up to 9 months after irradiation. A long-term upregulation of ErbB2 protein did not coincide with changes in transcription or post-translational interaction with the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Pretreatment with tocotrienols prevented radiation-induced changes at 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Local heart irradiation causes long-term changes in the EGFR pathway. Studies have to address how radiation may interact with cardiotoxic effects of EGFR inhibitors.","['Sridharan, Vijayalakshmi', 'Sharma, Sunil K', 'Moros, Eduardo G', 'Corry, Peter M', 'Tripathi, Preeti', 'Lieblong, Benjamin J', 'Guha, Chandan', 'Hauer-Jensen, Martin', 'Boerma, Marjan']","['Sridharan V', 'Sharma SK', 'Moros EG', 'Corry PM', 'Tripathi P', 'Lieblong BJ', 'Guha C', 'Hauer-Jensen M', 'Boerma M']","['University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Division of Radiation Health, Little Rock, Arkansas 72205, USA. vmohanseenivasan@uams.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', '0 (Tocotrienols)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'Heart/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Male', 'Myocardium/*metabolism', 'Radiation Tolerance/drug effects/*physiology', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Tocotrienols/*pharmacology']",2013/03/16 06:00,2013/09/06 06:00,['2013/03/16 06:00'],"['2013/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09553002.2013.782110 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2013 Jul;89(7):539-47. doi: 10.3109/09553002.2013.782110.

Required for reacquisition of pluripotency in the developing germ cell, PRDM14 initiates lymphoblastic leukemia when misexpressed in murine bone marrow. Activation of pluripotency in somatic cells can lead to aneuploidy and copy number alterations during iPS cell generation, and we hypothesized that PRDM14-induced lymphoblastic leukemias would demonstrate significant chromosomal damage. High-resolution oligo array comparative genomic hybridization demonstrated infrequent aneuploidy but frequent amplification and deletion, with amplifications occurring in a 5:1 ratio with deletions. Many deletions (i.e., Cdkn2a, Ebf1, Pax5, Ikzf1) involved B-cell development genes and tumor suppressor genes, recapitulating deletions occurring in human leukemia. Pathways opposing senescence were frequently deactivated via Cdkn2a deletion or Tbx2 amplification, with corollary gene expression. Additionally, gene expression studies of abnormal pre-leukemic B-precursors showed downregulation of genes involved in chromosomal stability (i.e., Xrcc6) and failure to upregulate DNA repair pathways. We propose a model of leukemogenesis, triggered by pluripotency genes like Prdm14, which involves ongoing DNA damage and failure to activate non-homologous end-joining secondary to aberrant gene expression.","['Simko, Stephen J', 'Voicu, Horatiu', 'Carofino, Brandi L', 'Justice, Monica J']","['Simko SJ', 'Voicu H', 'Carofino BL', 'Justice MJ']","[""Baylor College of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,2013/03/15 06:00,2013/03/15 06:01,['2013/03/15 06:00'],"['2013/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3390/cancers4041050 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancers (Basel). 2012 Dec 1;4(4):1050-1066. doi: 10.3390/cancers4041050.

One of the hallmarks of mES cells, their compact growth morphology, results from tight cell adhesion mediated through E-cadherin, beta-catenin (Ctnnb1) and alpha-catenin with the actin cytoskeleton. beta-catenin is also involved in canonical Wnt signaling, which has also been suggested to control mES cell stemness. Here, we analyze Ctnnb1(-/-) mES cells in which cell adhesion is preserved by an E-cadherin-alpha-catenin (Ealpha) fusion protein (Ctnnb1(-/-)Ealpha mES cells), and show that mimicking only the adhesive function of beta-catenin is necessary and sufficient to maintain the mES cell state, making beta-catenin/Wnt signaling obsolete in this process. Furthermore, we propose a role for E-cadherin in promoting the Lif signaling cascade, showing an association of E-cadherin with the Lifr-Gp130 receptor complex, which is most likely facilitated by the extracellular domain of E-cadherin. Without Ealpha, and thus without maintained cell adhesion, Ctnnb1(-/-) mES cells downregulate components of the Lif signaling pathway, such as Lifr, Gp130 and activated Stat3, as well as pluripotency-associated markers. From these observations, we hypothesize that the changes in gene expression accompanying the loss of pluripotency are a direct consequence of dysfunctional cell adhesion. Supporting this view, we find that the requirement for intact adhesion can be circumvented by the forced expression of constitutively active Stat3. In summary, we put forward a model in which mES cells can be propagated in culture in the absence of Ctnnb1, as long as E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion is preserved.","['del Valle, Ignacio', 'Rudloff, Stefan', 'Carles, Annaick', 'Li, Yong', 'Liszewska, Ewa', 'Vogt, Riana', 'Kemler, Rolf']","['del Valle I', 'Rudloff S', 'Carles A', 'Li Y', 'Liszewska E', 'Vogt R', 'Kemler R']","['Department of Molecular Embryology, Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Freiburg, Germany. delvalle@immunbio.mpg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (alpha Catenin)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cadherins/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/*physiology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics/*physiology', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Luciferases', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'alpha Catenin/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/genetics/*metabolism']",2013/03/15 06:00,2013/06/08 06:00,['2013/03/15 06:00'],"['2013/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [medline]']","['dev.088690 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.088690 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2013 Apr;140(8):1684-92. doi: 10.1242/dev.088690.

CALM-AF10-driven leukemias are characterized by HOXA gene up-regulation and a global reduction in H3K79 methylation. DOT1L, the H3K79 methyltransferase, interacts with the octapeptide/leucine zipper domain of AF10, and this region has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for CALM-AF10-mediated transformation. However, the precise role of CALM in leukemogenesis remains unclear. Here, we show that CALM contains a nuclear export signal (NES) that mediates cytoplasmic localization of CALM-AF10 and is necessary for CALM-AF10-dependent transformation. Fusions of the CALM NES (NES(CALM)-AF10) or NES motifs from heterologous proteins (ABL1, Rev, PKIA, APC) in-frame with AF10 are sufficient to immortalize murine hematopoietic progenitors in vitro. The CALM NES is essential for CALM-AF10-dependent Hoxa gene up-regulation and aberrant H3K79 methylation, possibly by mislocalization of DOT1L. Finally, we observed that CALM-AF10 leukemia cells are selectively sensitive to inhibition of nuclear export by Leptomycin B. These findings uncover a novel mechanism of leukemogenesis mediated by the nuclear export pathway and support further investigation of the utility of nuclear export inhibitors as therapeutic agents for patients with CALM-AF10 leukemias.","['Conway, Amanda E', 'Scotland, Paula B', 'Lavau, Catherine P', 'Wechsler, Daniel S']","['Conway AE', 'Scotland PB', 'Lavau CP', 'Wechsler DS']","['Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AF10-CALM fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Export Signals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PICALM protein, mouse)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)', 'Y031I2N1EO (leptomycin B)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/*physiology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins/*physiology', 'Nuclear Export Signals/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Survival Rate']",2013/03/15 06:00,2013/08/07 06:00,['2013/03/15 06:00'],"['2013/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58418-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-06-435792 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jun 6;121(23):4758-68. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-06-435792.

It is a popular Chinese herbal medicine with the potential to treat hematologic malignancies. In this study, we investigated the anticancer effects of wogonoside in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary patient-derived AML cells. Wogonoside exerted antiproliferative properties both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, it efficiently inhibited the proliferation of U937 and HL-60 cells through the induction of G1 phase arrest and the promotion of differentiation. We also demonstrated that wogonoside significantly increased the transcription of phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) due to its influence on the expression of cell cycle- and differentiation-related genes, including the upregulation of p21waf1/cip1 and downregulation of the oncogenic protein c-Myc. Wogonoside also promoted PLSCR1 trafficking into the nucleus and facilitated its binding to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 1 (IP3R1) promoter, thus increasing the expression of IP3R1. Finally, inhibition of PLSCR1 expression with small interfering RNA partially blocked wogonoside-induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation and disturbed the wogonoside-associated molecular events. The results of this study therefore suggest that wogonoside may represent a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of AML.","['Chen, Yan', 'Hui, Hui', 'Yang, Hao', 'Zhao, Kai', 'Qin, Yansu', 'Gu, Cong', 'Wang, Xiaotang', 'Lu, Na', 'Guo, Qinglong']","['Chen Y', 'Hui H', 'Yang H', 'Zhao K', 'Qin Y', 'Gu C', 'Wang X', 'Lu N', 'Guo Q']","[""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (PLSCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Phospholipid Transfer Proteins)', 'ETX4944Z3R (wogonoside)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Flavanones/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Glucosides/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phospholipid Transfer Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects/genetics', 'Tissue Distribution/drug effects', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2013/03/15 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2013/03/15 06:00'],"['2013/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58717-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-11-466219 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 May 2;121(18):3682-91. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-11-466219.

The PML protein is responsible for the assembly and function of characteristic nuclear domains known as PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), which have been implicated in a variety of cellular functions, including growth suppression, apoptosis, and cellular senescence. PML's many roles have been linked, at least in part, to its functional interaction with the tumor suppressor p53. It has been shown that PML favors both p53 accumulation and transcriptional activity; in turn, PML expression is directly regulated by p53, and this reciprocal regulation contributes to p53-mediated apoptosis and senescence. Nevertheless, genetic proof and in vivo assessment of the relevance of this functional crosstalk are still missing. Here we show that complete Pml inactivation, in a context of p53 heterozygosity, redistributes and expands the tumor spectrum leading to the formation of angiosarcomas and increased lymphomagenesis. Importantly, we find that Pml inactivation decreases the rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the remaining p53 allele, revealing the relevancy of p53 haploinsufficiency to tumorigenesis. Our results thus lend in vivo genetic support to the importance of the crosstalk between these two critical tumor suppressor genes.","['Papa, Antonella', 'Cordon-Cardo, Carlos', 'Bernardi, Rosa', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Papa A', 'Cordon-Cardo C', 'Bernardi R', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Genetics Program, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA ; Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Cancer,Genes & cancer,101516546,,,,2013/03/15 06:00,2013/03/15 06:01,['2013/03/15 06:00'],"['2012/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1947601912473604 [doi]', '10.1177_1947601912473604 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Cancer. 2012 Sep;3(9-10):599-603. doi: 10.1177/1947601912473604.,,,PMC3591099,,,['R01 CA071692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['NOTNLM'],"['Pml', 'angiosarcoma', 'p53']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The silencing function of PRC2 complex is mostly attributed to its intrinsic activity for methylating H3K27. Unlike in B-cell lymphomas, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) mutations in myeloid malignancies are inactivating/hypomorphic. When we assessed the mutational status in myeloid malignancies (N=469 cases examined), we found EZH2 and EED/SUZ12 mutations in 8% and 3.3% of cases, respectively. In addition to mutant cases, reduced EZH2 expression was also found in 78% cases with hemizygous deletion (-7/del7q cases involving EZH2 locus) and 41% of cases with diploid chromosome 7, most interestingly cases with spliceosomal mutations (U2AF1/SRSF2 mutations; 63% of cases). EZH2 mutations were characterized by decreased H3K27 trimethylation and increased chromatin relaxation at specific gene loci accompanied by higher transcriptional activity. One of the major downstream target is HOX gene family, involved in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal. HOXA9 was found to be overexpressed in cases with decreased EZH2 expression either by EZH2/spliceosomal mutations or because of -7/del7q. In summary, our results suggest that loss of gene repression through a variety of mutations resulting in reduced H3K27 trimethylation may contribute to leukemogenesis.","['Khan, S N', 'Jankowska, A M', 'Mahfouz, R', 'Dunbar, A J', 'Sugimoto, Y', 'Hosono, N', 'Hu, Z', 'Cheriyath, V', 'Vatolin, S', 'Przychodzen, B', 'Reu, F J', 'Saunthararajah, Y', ""O'Keefe, C"", 'Sekeres, M A', 'List, A F', 'Moliterno, A R', 'McDevitt, M A', 'Maciejewski, J P', 'Makishima, H']","['Khan SN', 'Jankowska AM', 'Mahfouz R', 'Dunbar AJ', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Hosono N', 'Hu Z', 'Cheriyath V', 'Vatolin S', 'Przychodzen B', 'Reu FJ', 'Saunthararajah Y', ""O'Keefe C"", 'Sekeres MA', 'List AF', 'Moliterno AR', 'McDevitt MA', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Makishima H']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Histones)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Histones/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2013/03/15 06:00,2013/08/10 06:00,['2013/03/15 06:00'],"['2013/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201380 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.80 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Jun;27(6):1301-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.80.

HA22 is composed of an Fv that binds to CD22 fused to a portion of Pseudomonas exotoxin A. HA22 is very active in drug-resistant hairy cell leukemia but is less active in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. To understand why some patients do not respond to HA22, we isolated an HA22-resistant lymphoma cell line and showed that resistance was due to the inability of HA22 to ADP-ribosylate and inactivate EF2. We analyzed the diphthamide synthesis genes and found that the WDR85 gene was deleted. We show that WDR85 knockdown conferred HA22 resistance to sensitive cells and that sensitivity was restored by introduction of a WDR85 cDNA into resistant cells. Analysis of EF2 in the mutant cells revealed a novel form of diphthamide with an additional methyl group that prevented ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of EF2. The abnormal methylation appeared to be catalyzed by DPH5. Inactivation of the WDR85 gene could be a mechanism of immunotoxin resistance in patients undergoing immunotoxin therapy.","['Wei, Hui', 'Bera, Tapan K', 'Wayne, Alan S', 'Xiang, Laiman', 'Colantonio, Simona', 'Chertov, Oleg', 'Pastan, Ira']","['Wei H', 'Bera TK', 'Wayne AS', 'Xiang L', 'Colantonio S', 'Chertov O', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factor 2)', '0 (Proteins)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', '75645-22-6 (diphthamide)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DPH7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Gene Deletion', 'Histidine/*analogs & derivatives/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Methylation/drug effects', 'Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 2/genetics/*metabolism', '*Proteins']",2013/03/15 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2013/03/15 06:00'],"['2013/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)33437-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.461343 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 Apr 26;288(17):12305-12. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.461343.

Until a decade ago, HCT was the preferred treatment for CML, with 5-year overall survival rates of approximately 80%, 40%, and 20% for patients in chronic, accelerated, and blast crisis phases, respectively. Relapse after transplant is a problem for patients who undergo transplant in advanced phase disease and those undergoing a T-depleted transplant. Until the introduction of TKIs, therapy for relapsed CML after transplant relied on interferon and/or donor leukocyte infusion (DLI). Although effective in inducing remission, DLI is associated with clinically significant graft-versus-host disease or myelosuppression, with an accompanying treatment-related mortality of 5% to 20%. TKIs have emerged as an attractive alternative therapy for persistent or relapsing CML after HCT. Similar to DLI, the effectiveness of TKI posttransplant is largely determined by the phase of disease at relapse, showing very good response in patients experiencing relapse in the chronic phase, with high rates (>60%) of hematologic and cytogenetic remissions, but less favorable outcomes in patients with advanced disease, with only a minority experiencing durable cytogenetic or molecular remissions. Molecular monitoring of the BCR-ABL chimeric mRNA posttransplant is important for early detection of patients at high risk of relapse.","['Bar, Merav', 'Radich, Jerald']","['Bar M', 'Radich J']","['From the Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2013/03/15 06:00,2013/09/05 06:00,['2013/03/15 06:00'],"['2013/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['11/3/308 [pii]', '10.6004/jnccn.2013.0042 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2013 Mar 1;11(3):308-15. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2013.0042.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An extramedullary blast crisis mimicking a T-cell lymphoma is a rare finding. CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old man presented with multiple lymphadenopathy 2 months after diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive CML in the chronic phase. Cervical lymph node biopsy later indicated an extramedullary blast crisis resembling T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (TLBL). The tumor mass was composed of primitive lymphoid cells expressing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), CD3, CD43, CD5, CD99, and Bcl-2. Although the pathological diagnosis, confirmed by 2 independent pathological centers, was more typical of TLBL, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed the bcr-abl fusion gene within the blastic tumor cells. The FISH finding confirmed that the mass represented an extramedullary, immature blastic transformation of CML rather than a de novo T-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of de novo TLBL should be suspected before excluding the extramedullary blast phase of CML.","['Wei, Jia', 'Huang, Mei', 'Wang, Ying', 'Zhou, Jianfeng']","['Wei J', 'Huang M', 'Wang Y', 'Zhou J']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Blast Crisis/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male']",2013/03/15 06:00,2013/09/13 06:00,['2013/03/15 06:00'],"['2013/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [medline]']","['000348681 [pii]', '10.1159/000348681 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2013;36(3):119-22. doi: 10.1159/000348681.

This study evaluated the clinical and economic outcomes of these agents when used in AML patients undergoing consolidation chemotherapy. METHODS: A retrospective chart review (2003-10) of AML patients receiving consolidation chemotherapy was performed. Patients were followed through their first cycle of consolidation chemotherapy. Antifungal prescribing patterns, clinical outcomes and resource consumptions were recorded. A decision analytical model was developed to depict the downstream consequences of using each antifungal agent, with success defined as completion of the designated course of initial antifungal prophylaxis without developing invasive fungal disease (IFD). Cost-effectiveness and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 106 consecutive patients were analysed. Baseline characteristics and predisposing factors for IFD were comparable between groups. Three IFDs (one proven, one probable and one suspected) occurred, all in the posaconazole group. Patients receiving posaconazole had the highest rate of intolerance requiring drug cessation (13% versus 7% in each of the fluconazole and voriconazole groups). Fluconazole conferred overall savings per patient of 26% over posaconazole and 13% over voriconazole. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated a mean cost saving with fluconazole of AU$8430 per patient (95% CI AU$5803-AU$11 054) versus posaconazole and AU$3681 per patient (95% CI AU$990-AU$6319) versus voriconazole. One-way sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that, in the setting of consolidation therapy for AML, fluconazole is the most cost-effective approach to antifungal prophylaxis compared with posaconazole or voriconazole.","['Heng, Siow-Chin', 'Slavin, Monica A', 'Al-Badriyeh, Daoud', 'Kirsa, Sue', 'Seymour, John F', 'Grigg, Andrew', 'Thursky, Karin', 'Bajel, Ashish', 'Nation, Roger L', 'Kong, David C M']","['Heng SC', 'Slavin MA', 'Al-Badriyeh D', 'Kirsa S', 'Seymour JF', 'Grigg A', 'Thursky K', 'Bajel A', 'Nation RL', 'Kong DC']","['Centre for Medicine Use and Safety, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 381 Royal Parade, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Chemoprevention/*economics/methods', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Economics, Pharmaceutical', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*prevention & control', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Voriconazole', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/15 06:00,2013/12/29 06:00,['2013/03/15 06:00'],"['2013/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['dkt068 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dkt068 [doi]']",ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 2013 Jul;68(7):1669-78. doi: 10.1093/jac/dkt068.

One of these, Sp100, is expressed from a single-copy gene and spliced into four isoforms (A, B, C, and HMG), which differentially regulate transcription. Here we evaluate Sp100 function in single cells using an inducible cytomegalovirus-promoter-regulated transgene, visualized as a chromatinized transcription site. Sp100A is the isoform most strongly recruited to the transgene array, and it significantly increases chromatin decondensation. However, Sp100A cannot overcome Daxx- and alpha-thalassemia mental retardation, X-linked (ATRX)-mediated transcriptional repression, which indicates that PML-NB/ND10 factors function within a regulatory hierarchy. Sp100A increases and Sp100B, which contains a SAND domain, decreases acetyl-lysine regulatory factor levels at activated sites, suggesting that Sp100 isoforms differentially regulate transcription by modulating lysine acetylation. In contrast to Daxx, ATRX, and PML, Sp100 is recruited to activated arrays in cells expressing the herpes simplex virus type 1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, ICP0, which degrades all Sp100 isoforms except unsumoylated Sp100A. The recruitment Sp100A(K297R), which cannot be sumoylated, further suggests that sumoylation plays an important role in regulating Sp100 isoform levels at transcription sites. This study provides insight into the ways in which viruses may modulate Sp100 to promote their replication cycles.","['Newhart, Alyshia', 'Negorev, Dmitri G', 'Rafalska-Metcalf, Ilona U', 'Yang, Tian', 'Maul, Gerd G', 'Janicki, Susan M']","['Newhart A', 'Negorev DG', 'Rafalska-Metcalf IU', 'Yang T', 'Maul GG', 'Janicki SM']","['Molecular and Cellular Oncogenesis Program, Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CALCOCO2 protein, human)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (ATRX protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (X-linked Nuclear Protein)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Antigens, Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Autoantigens/*metabolism', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cytomegalovirus/*physiology', 'DNA Helicases/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Proteolysis', 'Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Latency', 'X-linked Nuclear Protein']",2013/03/15 06:00,2013/11/15 06:00,['2013/03/15 06:00'],"['2013/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['mbc.E12-09-0669 [pii]', '10.1091/mbc.E12-09-0669 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2013 May;24(9):1454-68. doi: 10.1091/mbc.E12-09-0669.

Double mutations in CEBPA can be detected using various techniques, but it is a notoriously difficult gene to sequence due to its high GC-content. Here we developed a two-step gene expression classifier for accurate and standardized detection of CEBPA double mutations. The key feature of the two-step classifier is that it explicitly removes cases with low CEBPA expression, thereby excluding CEBPA hypermethylated cases that have similar gene expression profiles as a CEBPA double mutant, which would result in false-positive predictions. In the second step, we have developed a 55 gene signature to identity the true CEBPA double-mutation cases. This two-step classifier was tested on a cohort of 505 unselected AML cases, including 26 CEBPA double mutants, 12 CEBPA single mutants, and seven CEBPA promoter hypermethylated cases, on which its performance was estimated by a double-loop cross-validation protocol. The two-step classifier achieves a sensitivity of 96.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 81.1 to 99.3) and specificity of 100.0% (95% CI 99.2 to 100.0). There are no false-positive detections. This two-step CEBPA double-mutation classifier has been incorporated on a microarray platform that can simultaneously detect other relevant molecular biomarkers, which allows for a standardized comprehensive diagnostic assay. In conclusion, gene expression profiling provides a reliable method for CEBPA double-mutation detection in patients with AML for clinical use.","['van Vliet, Martin H', 'Burgmer, Pia', 'de Quartel, Linda', 'Brand, Jaap P L', 'de Best, Leonie C M', 'Vietor, Henk', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'van Beers, Erik H']","['van Vliet MH', 'Burgmer P', 'de Quartel L', 'Brand JP', 'de Best LC', 'Vietor H', 'Lowenberg B', 'Valk PJ', 'van Beers EH']","['Skyline Diagnostics BV, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,101494210,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Prognosis']",2013/03/15 06:00,2013/10/31 06:00,['2013/03/15 06:00'],"['2013/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/gtmb.2012.0437 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2013 May;17(5):395-400. doi: 10.1089/gtmb.2012.0437.

The cross-linking of the IgE/FcvarepsilonRI complex, through cognate allergens, on the surface of mast cells and basophil cells results in mediator release, and thus leads to the symptoms of type I hypersensitivity responses in mammals. To develop a baseline value for subsequent equine anti-allergy drug and vaccine research, the interaction of equine IgE with its high-affinity FcvarepsilonRI receptor was investigated following the cloning and expression of equine IgE with specificity for NIP-HSA (4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitrophenylacetic acid conjugated to human serum albumin). Receptor recognition and effector functions were assessed in Rat Basophil Leukemia (RBL-2H3.1) cells transfected with the alpha chain of equine and canine FcvarepsilonRI. Results obtained showed that the equine FcvarepsilonRI receptor recognizes both equine and canine IgE and supports similar beta-hexosaminidase release levels from RBL cells transfected with equine FcvarepsilonRI, peaking at 36.68% at 100ngml(-1) antigen and 32.00% at 100ngml(-1) antigen respectively. Furthermore, the binding kinetics of the equine IgE to the equine FcvarepsilonRI receptor and the canine IgE to the same receptor was measured to be KA=6.33x10(9)M(-1) and KA=1.84x10(9)M(-1) respectively.

The retroviral envelope protein, however, is the source of significant disadvantages such as immunogenicity, poor stability (half-life of transduction activity of 5-7 h at 37 degrees C for amphotropic murine leukemia virus), and difficult production and purification. To address these problems, we report the construction of efficient hybrid vectors through the association of murine leukemia virus (MLV)-like particles (M-VLP) with synthetic liposomes comprising DOTAP, DOPE, and cholesterol (phi/M-VLP). We conclude that the lipid composition is a significant determinant of the transfection efficiency and uptake of phi/M-VLP in HEK293 cells with favorable compositions for transfections being those with low DOTAP, low DOPE, and high cholesterol content. Cellular uptake, however, was dependent on DOTAP content alone. By extrusion of liposomes prior to vector assembly, the size of these hybrid vectors could also be decreased to approximately 300 nm, as confirmed via DLS and TEM. phi/M-VLP were also robust on storage in terms of vector size and transfection efficiency and provided stable transgene expression over a period of three weeks. We conclude that the noncovalent combination of biocompatible synthetic lipids with inactive retroviral particles to form a highly efficient hybrid vector is a significant extension to the development of novel gene delivery platforms.","['Keswani, Rahul K', 'Pozdol, Ian M', 'Pack, Daniel W']","['Keswani RK', 'Pozdol IM', 'Pack DW']","['Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '2462-63-7 (dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'MR86K0XRQP (1,2-dioleoyloxy-3-(trimethylammonium)propane)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cholesterol/chemistry', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated/chemistry', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors/chemistry', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Liposomes/*administration & dosage/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/chemistry', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/chemistry', 'Transfection']",2013/03/15 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/03/15 06:00'],"['2013/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp300561y [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2013 May 6;10(5):1725-35. doi: 10.1021/mp300561y.

Now that poor prognostic markers can be identifed, the challenge is to determine what should be done with these data. It is important that all available biomarkers be measured in ongoing clinical trials so that the optimal therapy can be selected for patients in particular prognostic subgroups. It is also possible that in the future poor prognostic markers can be used to determine whether a patient should be offered early therapy rather than a 'watch and wait' approach until symptoms appear. The results of ongoing and planned trials investigating the value of prognostic biomarkers in CLL should allow the design of specific therapies for different groups of patients. However, until this information is available, poor prognosis markers should not be used to determine whether a patient with CLL should be treated or whether therapy should be altered.","['Butler, Tom', 'Gribben, John G']","['Butler T', 'Gribben JG']","['Specialist Registrar in Haematology, Barts and the London NHS Trust Queen Mary University of London, Cancer Research UK Medical Oncology Unit, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Charterhouse Square, EC1M 6BQ, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Expert Opin Med Diagn,Expert opinion on medical diagnostics,101392201,,,,2008/01/01 00:00,2008/01/01 00:01,['2013/03/15 06:00'],"['2013/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1517/17530059.2.1.101 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Med Diagn. 2008 Jan;2(1):101-12. doi: 10.1517/17530059.2.1.101.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Mcl-1(L)/Mcl-1(S) ratio is determined in the alternative pre-mRNA splicing step that is regulated by splicing factor 3B1 (SF3B1). Here, we report that meayamycin B, a potent inhibitor of SF3B1, reversed the dominant isoform from Mcl-1(L) to Mcl-1(S) at the mRNA and protein levels.

The proportion of the cytotoxic T cells and part of the T-cells subsets in peripheral blood were detected by flow cytometry in 35 cases of MDS, including 19 refractory anemia (MDS-RA), 16 refractory anemia with excess blasts (MDS-RAEB), 17 AA, 15 AML patients and 10 normal donors respectively. The results showed that compared with the control group, the percentage of Tc1, Tc1/Tc2, CD8(+)HLA-DR(+), CD3(+)CD8(+)CD28(+), CD8(+)CD45RO(+) cells was significantly higher and the percentage of CD8(+)CD45RA(+) was significantly lower in AA and MDS-RA group.

The clinical data of 12 MDS and AML patients treated with decitabine were analyzed retrospectively. Among 12 patients there were 1 case of MDS-RA, 2 cases of MDS-RAEB-I, 3 cases of MDS-RAEB-II, 2 cases of AML-M4, 2 cases of AML-M5, 1 case of AML-M6 and 1 case of AML-M0. In decitabine chemotherapy program for 5 days (n = 8), decitabine 20 mg/(m(2).d) x 5 days was applied, 4 weeks for 1 cycle; in program for 3 days (n = 2), decitabine 15 mg/m(2), once 8 h for 3 days, 6 weeks for 1 cycle; another program (n = 2), decitabine 20 mg/(m(2).d) every other day for 5 times. For 1 patient achieved complete remission (CR) after treatment with decitabine, ID4 gene methylated level was detected by MS-PCR and ML-PCR before and after treatment. The results showed that 2 cases achieved CR, 1 case partial remission, 5 cases stable disease, 1 case progress of disease and 3 cases died. Disease control rate was 66.67% (8/12), the effective rate 25% (3/12). The average survival time was (11.5 +/- 2.1) months. 1-year OS rate was 40%, 2-year OS rate was 16.7%. MS-PCR detection showed that the decitabine could significantly reduce the ID4 gene methylation level. It is concluded that decitabine can stabilize disease status of MDS patients, reduce blood transfusion dependence and improve the life quality of patients, and even some patients who transformed from MDS to leukemia achieved CR after treatment with decitabine. Decitabine can reduce the ID4 gene methylation level. The main adverse reaction of decitabine was myelosuppression, infection and so on. So the blood transfusions, antibiotics and other supportive treatments for these patients are needed. Most of patients well tolerate the adverse effects of decitabine after active symptomatic and supportive treatment. The efficacy and survival rate of patients in this study were similar to that of application of decitabine to treat MDS in other domestic studies.","['Yang, Hua', 'Zhu, Hai-Yan', 'Jiang, Meng-Meng', 'Wang, Quan-Shun', 'Han, Xiao-Ping', 'Huang, Wen-Rong', 'Jing, Yu', 'Wang, Shu-Hong', 'Zhang, Song-Song', 'Mei, Jun-Hui', 'Yu, Li']","['Yang H', 'Zhu HY', 'Jiang MM', 'Wang QS', 'Han XP', 'Huang WR', 'Jing Y', 'Wang SH', 'Zhang SS', 'Mei JH', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Azacitidine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/15 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/03/15 06:00'],"['2013/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2013)01-0121-05 [pii]', '10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2013.01.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Feb;21(1):121-5. doi: 10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2013.01.025.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human t (8;21) AML cell line Kasumi-1 cells were treated with VPA at different concentration for 3 d, the mRNA and protein expression levels of Ang1 and Ang2 were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot respectively. Nude mice model with xenograft Kasumi-1 tumor was established by subcutaneous inoculation of Kasumi-1 cells. The CD34, Ang1 and Ang2 protein levels were analyzed by immunohistochemistry method. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Ang1, Ang2 and VEGF were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. The results showed that in vitro, VPA at 3 mmol/L downregulated the Ang mRNA relative expression level for Ang1 from 0.360 +/- 0.116 to 0.040 +/- 0.008, Ang2 from 0.540 +/- 0.049 to 0.146 +/- 0.038. The animal experiment further verified that VPA 500 mg/kg, ip, for 14 d, reduced the relative expression of Ang1, Ang2 and VEGF mRNA and proteins in Kasumi-1 tumor of nude mice, and reduced microvascular density in xenograft tumor of nude mice (8.470 +/- 0.300 vs 2.600 +/- 0.200).

Then the cell differentiating direction was observed by chemical staining, the degree of differentiation was determined by surface antigen CD11b/CD14 detection, and the apoptosis was excluded by phosphatidylserine valgus analysis, by which cellular differentiating model was constructed. Furthermore, RT-PCR and Western blot were employed to verify the differentially expression of NME3 before and after differentiation of HL-60 cells.

Within two weeks the number of human granulosa cells increases from less than 500,000 to more than 50 millions cells per follicle and differentiates into groups of cells with a variety of specialized functions involved in steroidogenesis, nursing the oocyte, and forming a functional syncitium. Both the rapid proliferation and different specialized functions of the granulosa cells can only be explained through the involvement of stem cells. However, luteinizing granulosa cells were believed to be terminally differentiated cells. Only recently, stem and progenitor cells with FSH-receptor activity were identified in populations of luteinizing granulosa cells obtained during oocyte collected for assisted reproduction. In the presence of the leukaemia-inhibiting factor (LIF), it was possible to culture a subpopulation of the luteinizing granulosa cells over prolonged time periods. Furthermore, when embedded in a matrix consisting of collagen type I, these cells continued to express the FSH receptor over prolonged time periods, developed globular formations that surrogated as follicle-like structures, providing a promising tool for reproductive biology.","['Kossowska-Tomaszczuk, Katarzyna', 'De Geyter, Christian']","['Kossowska-Tomaszczuk K', 'De Geyter C']","['Clinic of Gynecological Endocrinology and Reproductive Medicine and Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland. kct@nardis.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, FSH)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Collagen Type I/metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Granulosa Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, FSH/biosynthesis', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism']",2013/03/14 06:00,2013/09/04 06:00,['2013/03/14 06:00'],"['2012/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/310859 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2013;2013:310859. doi: 10.1155/2013/310859.

The observation that increased epigenetic silencing of potential tumor suppressor genes correlates with disease progression in some CML patients treated with IM suggests a relationship between epigenetic silencing and resistance development. We hypothesize that promoter hypermethylation of HOXA4 could be an epigenetic mechanism mediating IM resistance in CML patients. Thus a study was undertaken to investigate the promoter hypermethylation status of HOXA4 in CML patients on IM treatment and to determine its role in mediating resistance to IM. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of 95 CML patients (38 good responders and 57 resistant) and 12 normal controls. All samples were bisulfite treated and analysed by methylation-specific high-resolution melt analysis. Compared to the good responders, the HOXA4 hypermethylation level was significantly higher (P = 0.002) in IM-resistant CML patients. On comparing the risk, HOXA4 hypermethylation was associated with a higher risk for IM resistance (OR 4.658; 95% CI, 1.673-12.971; P = 0.003). Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that promoter hypermethylation of HOXA4 gene could be an epigenetic mechanism mediating IM resistance in CML patients.","['Elias, Marjanu Hikmah', 'Baba, Abdul Aziz', 'Husin, Azlan', 'Sulong, Sarina', 'Hassan, Rosline', 'Sim, Goh Ai', 'Abdul Wahid, S Fadilah', 'Ankathil, Ravindran']","['Elias MH', 'Baba AA', 'Husin A', 'Sulong S', 'Hassan R', 'Sim GA', 'Abdul Wahid SF', 'Ankathil R']","['Human Genome Centre, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Health Campus 16150 Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '127609-92-1 (HOXA4 protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Benzamides/*administration & dosage', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing/*drug effects', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Transcription Factors']",2013/03/14 06:00,2013/09/04 06:00,['2013/03/14 06:00'],"['2012/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/129715 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2013;2013:129715. doi: 10.1155/2013/129715.

However, the mechanisms through which CXCR4 contributes to breast cancer cell growth and metastases are poorly understood. In this study, we examined the putative in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer effects of the specific CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3465. Here, we report that AMD3465 triggers a reduction in breast cancer cell invasiveness in vitro, and promotes marked changes in oncogenic signaling proteins including a reduction in STAT3, JAK2, AKT, and CXCR4 phosphorylation and the reduced expression of GSK3 and cMYC. Using three breast cancer cell lines as murine syngeneic immunocompetent breast cancer models, we found that AMD3465 inhibited breast tumor formation and reduced tumor cell metastases to the lung and liver. Furthermore, treatment with AMD3465 significantly reduced the infiltration of myeloid CD11b positive cells at the aforementioned metastatic sites as well as the spleen implying this agent could regulate the formation of the tumor microenvironment and conceivably the premetastatic niche. In conclusion, our studies suggest that AMD3465 inhibits breast cancer growth and metastases by acting on tumor cells as well as immune cells that constitute the tumor microenvironment. This process appears to be regulated, at least in part, through the modulation of oncogenic signaling that includes the STAT3 pathway. Thus, CXCR4 could be a novel target for breast cancer therapy.","['Ling, Xiaoyang', 'Spaeth, Erika', 'Chen, Ye', 'Shi, Yuexi', 'Zhang, Weiguo', 'Schober, Wendy', 'Hail, Numsen Jr', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Ling X', 'Spaeth E', 'Chen Y', 'Shi Y', 'Zhang W', 'Schober W', 'Hail N Jr', 'Konopleva M', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

It is of great interest to test whether WT1 SNPs can be used as a molecular marker in other cancer types in order to improve risk and treatment stratification. We performed sequencing analysis on all 10 exons of the WT1 gene in a total of 182 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Six different SNPs were identified, in descending order for minor allele frequency: rs2234582, rs16754, rs1799925, rs5030315, rs2234583, and rs2234581. At least one minor allele for WT1 SNP was identified in 61% of ccRCC patients. In the entire study population, only 6% carried two copies of the minor allele. The genotypes of WT1 SNPs in 78 tumour-free kidney tissue specimens were found to be in 95% concordance with corresponding tumour samples. No correlation was observed between WT1 SNP genotypes and RNA expression level. WT1 SNP genotypes did not associate with clinical and pathological characteristics. We found favourable outcomes associated with the homozygous minor allele for WT1 SNP. However, SNP genotypes did not show to be of prognostic significance when comparing wild-type versus homozygous or heterozygous for the minor allele in the entire cohort. None of the previously reported WT1 mutations in AML was found in the present study. A novel WT1 missense mutation was identified in only one patient. Our data suggest that common WT1 mutations are not involved in ccRCC. Due to too few cases harbouring the homozygous minor allele, the prognostic impact needs to be verified in larger study populations.","['Li, Xingru', 'Wang, Sihan', 'Sitaram, Raviprakash T', 'Andersson, Charlotta', 'Ljungberg, Borje', 'Li, Aihong']","['Li X', 'Wang S', 'Sitaram RT', 'Andersson C', 'Ljungberg B', 'Li A']","['Department of Medical Biosciences, Clinical Chemistry, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sweden']",2013/03/14 06:00,2013/09/04 06:00,['2013/03/14 06:00'],"['2012/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0058396 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-33902 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e58396. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0058396.

This study reviewed clinical and cytogenetic characteristics of patients with t-MN at a single institution in Korea. METHODS: The study subjects included 39 consecutive patients diagnosed with t-MN. Each subject's clinical history of previous diseases, treatments, and laboratory data was reviewed, including cytogenetics. The primary diagnosis was hematologic malignancy in 14 patients and solid tumor in 25 patients. RESULTS: Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML, 66.7%) was found to be more common than therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS). Primary hematologic malignancies that were commonly implicated included mature B-cell neoplasm and acute leukemia. Breast cancer was the most common primary solid tumor. The mean time interval from cytotoxic therapy initiation to t-MN detection was 49 months. Chromosomal aberrations were observed in 35 patients, and loss of chromosome 5, 7, or both accounted for 41% of all cases. Balanced rearrangements occurred in 13 patients; these patients showed shorter latency intervals (mean, 38 months) than patients with loss of chromosome 5 or 7 (mean, 61 months). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we determined the clinical and cytogenetic characteristics of Korean patients with t-MN. Although our results were generally consistent with those of previous reports, we found that t-MN resulting from de novo leukemia was common and that t-AML was more common than t-MDS at presentation.

Because MDSs display remarkable clinical, pathologic, and cytogenetic heterogeneity, with variable evolution and survival ranging from months to years, the predictive factors of prognosis have a key role in optimal therapeutic decisions.The purpose of this paper is to analyze prognostic factors within a group of patients diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndromes. The prognostic factors taken into account are: the number and depth of cytopenias, percentage of bone marrow blasts, cytogenetic abnormalities, intensity of anemia and transfusional dependence. These factors are related to overall survival, leukemia free survival, bone marrow failure complications, leukemic evolution, treatment decisions and the response to treatment. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study group comprises of 119 patients diagnosed with de novo MDS, between 2008 and 2011 in the Hematology Department of Coltea Clinical Hospital. In this monitoring period the patients were stratified according to the FAB (French-American-British) morphologic classification. RESULTS: This study revealed that the outcomes of patients with MDS is influenced by the percentage of bone marrow blasts at diagnosis, the number and severity of hematopoietic lineage affected by cytopenia and by the presence of chromosomal abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: The studied prognostic factors have predictive value in terms of survival, leukemic transformation, treatment response and development of bone marrow failure-related characteristic complications.","['Triantafyllidis, Irina', 'Ciobanu, Anca', 'Stanca, Oana', 'Lupu, Anca Roxana']","['Triantafyllidis I', 'Ciobanu A', 'Stanca O', 'Lupu AR']","['Coltea Clinical Hospital, Department of Hematology Bucharest, Romania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Romania,Maedica (Bucur),Maedica,101526930,,,,2013/03/14 06:00,2013/03/14 06:01,['2013/03/14 06:00'],"['2012/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/14 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Maedica (Bucur). 2012 Dec;7(4):295-302.,,,PMC3593279,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['IPSS', 'complications', 'risk groups']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These studies involve the identification of the first cancer-associated chromosomal abnormality and the subsequent development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that inhibit BCR-ABL kinase activity in CML. It becomes clear that leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in CML which are resistant to TKIs, and eradication of LSCs appears to be extremely difficult. Therefore, one of the major issues in current CML biology is to understand the biology of LSCs and to investigate why LSCs are insensitive to TKI monotherapy for developing curative therapeutic strategies. Studies from our group and others have revealed that CML LSCs form a hierarchy similar to that seen in normal hematopoiesis, in which a rare stem cell population with limitless self-renewal potential gives rise to progenies that lack such potential. LSCs also possess biological features that are different from those of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and are critical for their malignant characteristics. In this review, we summarize the latest progress in CML field, and attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms of survival regulation of LSCs.","['Zhang, Haojian', 'Li, Shaoguang']","['Zhang H', 'Li S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Protein Cell,Protein & cell,101532368,"['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",2013/03/14 06:00,2013/09/07 06:00,['2013/03/14 06:00'],"['2012/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13238-013-2115-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Cell. 2013 Mar;4(3):186-96. doi: 10.1007/s13238-013-2115-0.

At the endothelial cell surface, A2 and S100A10 (p11) form a heterotetramer, which accelerates tissue plasminogen activator-dependent activation of the fibrinolytic protease, plasmin. In antiphospholipid syndrome, anti-A2 antibodies are associated with clinical thrombosis, whereas overexpression of A2 in acute promyelocytic leukemia promotes hyperfibrinolytic bleeding. A2 is upregulated in hypoxia, and mice deficient in A2 are resistant to oxygen-induced retinal neovascularization, suggesting a role for A2 in human retinal vascular proliferation. In solid malignancies, the (A2*p11)(2) tetramer may promote cancer cell invasion, whereas in multiple myeloma A2 enables malignant plasmacyte growth and predicts prognosis. In the central nervous system, the p11 enables membrane insertion of serotonin receptors that govern mood. In the peripheral nervous system, p11 directs sodium channels to the plasma membrane, enabling pain perception. In cerebral cortex neurons, A2 stabilizes the microtubule-associated tau protein, which, when mutated, is associated with frontotemporal dementia. In inflammatory dendritic cells, A2 maintains late endosomal/lysosomal membrane integrity, thus modulating inflammasome activation and cytokine secretion in a model of aseptic arthritis. Together, these findings suggest an emerging, multifaceted role for A2 in human health and disease.","['Luo, Min', 'Hajjar, Katherine A']","['Luo M', 'Hajjar KA']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Thromb Hemost,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,0431155,"['0 (Annexin A2)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', '0 (S100 calcium binding protein A10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A2/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Fibrinolysis/physiology', 'Humans', 'S100 Proteins/metabolism']",2013/03/14 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/03/14 06:00'],"['2013/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0033-1334143 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Thromb Hemost. 2013 Jun;39(4):338-46. doi: 10.1055/s-0033-1334143.

To identify a subset of ATL in which CBT is feasible, we retrospectively analyzed 27 patients treated with CBT at three institutions in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. The estimated overall survival (OS) rate at 3 years was 27.4 %. Of 16 patients who received CBT during remission (complete, CR, or partial, PR), the OS rate at 3 years was 50 %, while during refractory periods (non-CR or non-PR), the OS rate was 9.1 %. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) was given to 18 patients, and myeloablative conditioning (MAC) was used in nine, with 3-year OS of 50.0 and 0 %, respectively. Of the 19 deaths, nine were due to progressive disease, eight (five MAC and three RIC) to infection, and two to multiple organ failure.

Nucleotides and deoxynucleotides are required by living cells for syntheses of RNA, DNA, and cofactors such as NADP(+), FAD(+), coenzyme A and ATP. Nucleotides contain purine and pyrimidine bases, which can be synthesized through salvage pathway as well. Amido phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), also known as glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (GPAT), is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the PPAT (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase) gene. APRT catalyzes the first committed step of the de novo pathway using its substrate, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP). As APRT is inhibited by many folate analogues, therefore, in this study we focused on the inhibitory effects of three folate analogues on APRT activity. This is extension of our previous wet lab work to analyze and dissect molecular interaction and inhibition mechanism using molecular modeling and docking tools in the current study. Comparative molecular docking studies were carried out for three diamino folate derivatives employing a model of the human enzyme that was built using the 3D structure of Bacillus subtilis APRT (PDB ID; 1GPH) as the template. Binding orientation of interactome indicates that all compounds having nominal cluster RMSD in same active site's deep narrow polar fissure. On the basis of comparative conformational analysis, electrostatic interaction, binding free energy and binding orientation of interactome, we support the possibility that these molecules could behave as APRT inhibitors and therefore may block purine de novo biosynthesis. Consequently, we suggest that PY899 is the most active biological compound that would be a more potent inhibitor for APRT inhibition than PY873 and DIA, which also confirms previous wet lab report.","['Batool, Sidra', 'Nawaz, Muhammad Sulaman', 'Kamal, Mohammad A']","['Batool S', 'Nawaz MS', 'Kamal MA']","['Functional Informatics Laboratory National Center for Bioinformatics, Quaid-I-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (2,4-diamino-6-(3,4,5-trimethoxyanilino)methylpyrido(3,2-d)pyrimidine)', '0 (2,4-diamino-6-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazoline)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Phthalic Acids)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'EC 2.4.2.14 (Amidophosphoribosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Amidophosphoribosyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bacillus subtilis/enzymology', 'Binding Sites', 'Computer Simulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phthalic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Sequence Alignment']",2013/03/14 06:00,2014/04/15 06:00,['2013/03/14 06:00'],"['2012/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-013-9944-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2013 Oct;31(5):1355-63. doi: 10.1007/s10637-013-9944-9.

Recently, we showed that the cAMP-induced destabilization of p53 in DNA-damaged cells occurs as a result of enhanced interaction between p53 and HDM2. In this report, we present results showing that increased levels of cAMP in cells with DNA damage enhances the deacetylation of p53, an event that facilitates the interaction of p53 with HDM2, thus annulling the stabilizing effect of DNA damage on p53. The combined inhibition of the HDAC and SIRT1 deacetylases abolished the cAMP-mediated deacetylation of p53, implying that cAMP-mediated deacetylation of p53 is dependent on the activity of these two classes of histone deacetylases. Importantly, diminishing the activity of HDACs and SIRT1 was also found to reverse the inhibitory effect of cAMP on the DNA damage-induced p53 stabilization and apoptosis, suggesting the involvement of the p53 acetylation pathway in the anti-apoptotic effect of cAMP signalling.","['Kloster, Martine Muller', 'Naderi, Elin Hallan', 'Haaland, Ingvild', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Blomhoff, Heidi Kiil', 'Naderi, Soheil']","['Kloster MM', 'Naderi EH', 'Haaland I', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Blomhoff HK', 'Naderi S']","['Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirtuin 1/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/*metabolism']",2013/03/14 06:00,2013/11/02 06:00,['2013/03/14 06:00'],"['2012/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2013.1853 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2013 May;42(5):1815-21. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2013.1853.

As the disease progressed, we observed serial morphologic changes from immature mast cells with myeloblasts to only metachromatic blasts and atypical mast cells as mast cell leukemia; FISH analysis showed that the neoplastic mast cells originated from the same clone as the leukemic myeloblasts of AML.","['Bae, Mi Hyun', 'Kim, Hyun-Ki', 'Park, Chan-Jeoung', 'Seo, Eul-Ju', 'Park, Sang Hyuk', 'Cho, Young-Uk', 'Jang, Seongsoo', 'Chi, Hyun-Sook', 'Lee, Kyu-Hyung']","['Bae MH', 'Kim HK', 'Park CJ', 'Seo EJ', 'Park SH', 'Cho YU', 'Jang S', 'Chi HS', 'Lee KH']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Korea (South),Ann Lab Med,Annals of laboratory medicine,101571172,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/diagnosis/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/pathology', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Recurrence', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2013/03/14 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/03/14 06:00'],"['2012/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2012/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3343/alm.2013.33.2.125 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Lab Med. 2013 Mar;33(2):125-9. doi: 10.3343/alm.2013.33.2.125.

Among the identified potential target genes of FRA-2/JUND was SOX4. Here, we examine the expression and function of SOX4 in ATL. SOX4 was indeed consistently expressed in primary ATL cells. FRA-2/JUND efficiently activated the SOX4 promoter via an AP-1 site. Knockdown of SOX4 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) strongly suppressed cell growth of ATL cell lines. Microarray analyses revealed that SOX4 knockdown reduced the expression of genes such as germinal center kinase related (GCKR), NAK-associated protein 1 (NAP1), and histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8). We confirmed consistent expression of GCKR, NAP1, and HDAC8 in primary ATL cells. We also showed direct activation of the HDAC8 promoter by SOX4. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of GCKR, NAP1, and HDAC8 each significantly suppressed cell growth of ATL cell lines. Taken together, we have revealed an important oncogenic cascade involving FRA-2/JUND and SOX4 in ATL, which leads to the expression of genes such as GCKR, NAP1, and HDAC8.","['Higuchi, Tomonori', 'Nakayama, Takashi', 'Arao, Tokuzo', 'Nishio, Kazuto', 'Yoshie, Osamu']","['Higuchi T', 'Nakayama T', 'Arao T', 'Nishio K', 'Yoshie O']","['Department of Microbiology, Kinki University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (FOSL2 protein, human)', '0 (Fos-Related Antigen-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOX4 protein, human)', '0 (SOXC Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fos-Related Antigen-2/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/physiology', 'Histone Deacetylases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Microarray Analysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'SOXC Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2013/03/14 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2013/03/14 06:00'],"['2013/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58712-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-07-441022 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 May 2;121(18):3640-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-07-441022.

To investigate the mechanism of leukemogenesis in this disorder, a xenograft model of TAM was established using NOD/Shi-scid, interleukin (IL)-2Rgamma(null) mice. Serial engraftment after transplantation of cells from a TAM patient who developed ML-DS a year later demonstrated their self-renewal capacity. A GATA1 mutation and no copy number alterations (CNAs) were detected in the primary patient sample by conventional genomic sequencing and CNA profiling. However, in serial transplantations, engrafted TAM-derived cells showed the emergence of divergent subclones with another GATA1 mutation and various CNAs, including a 16q deletion and 1q gain, which are clinically associated with ML-DS. Detailed genomic analysis identified minor subclones with a 16q deletion or this distinct GATA1 mutation in the primary patient sample. These results suggest that genetically heterogeneous subclones with varying leukemia-initiating potential already exist in the neonatal TAM phase, and ML-DS may develop from a pool of such minor clones through clonal selection.

METHODS: HMGA2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression plasmids were constructed, including a pair of random scrambled sequences. Human gastric cancer cell line MKN-45 cells were divided into three groups: blank control group (non-transfected cells), transfected group (cells transfected with HMGA2 shRNA recombinant plasmid) and scrambled sequence group (transfected with random scrambled plasmid). Cells were transfected with HMGA2 shRNA recombinant plasmids and scrambled plasmid in vitro, and the cells transfection efficiency was assayed by fluorescence microscopy. The HMGA2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, gastric cancer cells apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, cell proliferation was detected by methyl thiazol tetrazolium, and the protein expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), P27, caspase-9 and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) were analyzed by Western blotting. RESULTS: Compared with the blank control group and the scrambled sequence group, the levels of HMGA2 mRNA and protein expression in the transfected group were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The relative HMGA2 mRNA expression levels of the blank control group, transfected group and scrambled sequence group were 0.674 +/- 0.129, 0.374 +/- 0.048 and 0.689 +/- 0.124, respectively. The relative HMGA2 protein expression levels of the blank control group, transfected group and scrambled sequence group were 0.554 +/- 0.082, 0.113 +/- 0.032 and 0.484 +/- 0.123, respectively. Moreover, transfection with the scrambled sequence had no effect on the expression of HMGA2. After being transfected with shRNA for 24, 48 and 72 h, the cell apoptotic rates of the transfected group were 21.65% +/- 0.28%, 39.98% +/- 1.82% and 24.51% +/- 0.93%, respectively, which significantly higher than those of blank control group (4.72% +/- 1.34%, 5.83% +/- 0.13% and 5.22% +/- 1.07%) and scrambled sequence group (4.28% +/- 1.33%, 7.87% +/- 1.43% and 6.71% +/- 0.92%). After 24, 48 and 72 h, the cell proliferation inhibition rates in the transfected group were 31.57% +/- 1.17%, 39.45% +/- 2.07% and 37.56% +/- 2.32%, respectively; the most obvious cell proliferation inhibition appeared at 48 h after transfection. Compared with the blank control group and scrambled sequence group, after transfection of shRNA for 72 h, the protein expression levels of PI3K (0.042 +/- 0.005 vs 0.069 +/- 0.003, 0.067 +/- 0.05), Akt (0.248 +/- 0.004 vs 0.489 +/- 0.006, 0.496 +/- 0.104) and Bcl-2 (0.295 +/- 0.084 vs 0.592 +/- 0.072, 0.594 +/- 0.109) were significantly reduced.

The ALT cells remained telomerase-negative after TSA treatment. ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies and telomere sister chromatid exchanges, typical ALT phenotypes, markedly increased in the TSA-treated cells, while the telomere length remained unchanged.

We examined the effects of PP242 and rapamycin on mTOR signalling and evaluated potential crosstalk with the NOTCH signalling in eight leukemia cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the effects of treatment with these inhibitors on cell growth and protein expression. RESULTS: PP242 suppressed growth more potently than did rapamycin. In two cell lines poorly sensitive to PP242, PP242 failed to inhibit v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) phosphorylation. Suppression of mTOR phosphorylation was weaker in myeloid cell lines. Rapamycin induced eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) hyperphosphorylation in three cell lines. Phosphorylation of both isoforms (p70 and p85) of S6 kinase (S6K) was suppressed in three cell lines; only p70 was suppressed in the others. NOTCH1 expression and activation were up-regulated by PP242 in one cell line but down-regulated in another.

The aim of this study was to survey the prevalence of feline haemoplasmas in 320 cats from the north-central region of Portugal by the use of real-time PCR, as well as to evaluate any associations between infection, clinical presentation and risk factors. The overall prevalence of infection by feline haemoplasmas was 43.43% (139/320), where 41.56% (133/320) corresponded to Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum (CMhm), 12.81% (41/320) to Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), 4.38% (14/320) to Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum and 1.25% (4/320) to Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis. Almost 13% (47/320) of the samples were co-infected, with the most common co-infection being CMhm and Mhf (23.74%). Infection was found statistically significant with feline immunodeficiency/feline leukaemia virus status (P = 0.034), but no significant association was found for breed, sex, fertility status (neutered/spayed/entire), age, clinical status, living conditions (in/outdoor), anaemia status, or the presence/absence of ticks or fleas.

Clinical research efforts are currently focusing on targeted therapies that induce apoptosis in AML cells. Herein, the effects and mechanisms of the novel flavone 3,3'-diamino-4'-methoxyflavone (DD1) on AML cell dysfunction were investigated in AML cells (monoblast U937, myelomonocyte OCI-AML3, promyelocyte NB4, myeloblast HL-60) and blood samples from patients with AML. The administration of DD1 inhibited proliferation and induced death of AML cell lines and reduced the clonogenic activity of AML, but not normal, blood cells. The flavone's apoptotic action in U937 cells was associated with recruitment of mitochondria, Bax activation, Bad dephosphorylation (at Ser(136)), activation of caspases -8, -9, and -3 and cleavage of the caspase substrate PARP-1. DD1 induced a marked decrease in (i) Thr(389)-phosphorylation and (ii) protein levels of the caspase-3 substrate P70 ribosomal S6 kinase (P70S6K, known for its ability to phosphorylate Bad). Caspase-dependent apoptosis and P70S6K degradation were simultaneously prevented by the caspase inhibitors. Importantly, DD1 was shown to directly inhibit the proteasome's chymotrypsin-like activity in U937 cells. Apoptotic activity of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib was also related to Bax activation and P70S6K downregulation. Accordingly, DD1 failed to induce P70S6K cleavage, Bax stimulation and apoptosis in K562 cells resistant to bortezomib. These results indicate that DD1 has the potential to eradicate AML cells and support a critical role for Bax and P70S6K in DD1-mediated proteasome inhibition and apoptosis of leukemia cells.","['Piedfer, Marion', 'Bouchet, Sandrine', 'Tang, Ruoping', 'Billard, Christian', 'Dauzonne, Daniel', 'Bauvois, Brigitte']","['Piedfer M', 'Bouchet S', 'Tang R', 'Billard C', 'Dauzonne D', 'Bauvois B']","['Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Universite Paris-Descartes, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"[""0 (4'-methoxyflavone)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2013/03/14 06:00,2013/07/13 06:00,['2013/03/14 06:00'],"['2012/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-4889(13)00074-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.02.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2013 Jun;1833(6):1316-28. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.02.016.

The BCL2 family of proteins and bioactive sphingolipids are intricately linked during apoptotic cell death. In fact, many chemotherapeutic drugs are known to cause accumulation of the pro-apoptotic sphingolipid ceramide; however, the mechanism by which this occurs is not completely understood. In the present study we demonstrate that direct inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins with ABT-263 is sufficient to induce C(16)-ceramide synthesis in multiple cell lines, including human leukaemia and myeloma cells. ABT-263 activates CerS (ceramide synthase) activity only in cells expressing BAK or in cells capable of activating BAK. Importantly, recombinant BAK is sufficient to increase in vitro CerS activity in microsomes purified from Bak-KO (knockout) cells and activated BAK more potently activates CerS than inactive BAK. Likewise, ABT-263 addition to wild-type, but not Bak-deficient, microsomes increases CerS in vitro activity. Furthermore, we present a feed-forward model by which BAK activation of CerS by chemotherapeutic drugs leads to elevated ceramide levels that result in synergistic channel formation by ceramide (or one of its metabolites) and BAX/BAK.","['Beverly, Levi J', 'Howell, Lauren A', 'Hernandez-Corbacho, Maria', 'Casson, Lavona', 'Chipuk, Jerry E', 'Siskind, Leah J']","['Beverly LJ', 'Howell LA', 'Hernandez-Corbacho M', 'Casson L', 'Chipuk JE', 'Siskind LJ']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA. levi.beverly@louisville.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '4201-58-5 (N-palmitoylsphingosine)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.3.1.- (dihydroceramide desaturase)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidoreductases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/*metabolism']",2013/03/14 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2013/03/14 06:00'],"['2013/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20130147 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20130147 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2013 May 15;452(1):111-9. doi: 10.1042/BJ20130147.,,,PMC3642864,,,"['R01DK093462/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK093462/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR17677/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA157740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR017677/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '8P20GM103482-10/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103482/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA138313/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS453844'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 66 +/- 6% and 76 +/- 5% respectively, and thus lower than in younger children (83 +/- 1%, 91 +/- 1%; P < 0.001).

FLT3 ITD is an unstable aberration and may be lost or acquired at relapse. Recent whole genome sequencing studies have suggested that FLT3 ITD(+)ve AML relapse may evolve from small subclones undetectable at diagnosis by routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We developed a patient-specific real-time quantitative-PCR (RQ-PCR) to implement FLT3 ITD detection in six AML patients whose blasts carried wild-type FLT3 at diagnosis and who relapsed with FLT3 ITD by routine PCR. Patient-specific forward primers were designed after cloning and sequencing the FLT3 ITD in each case. The assay allowed retrospective detection of FLT3 ITD in diagnostic samples of 4/6 cases and to establish the kinetics of clonal evolution preceding relapse. After conventional chemotherapy, all patients had early relapse despite having been classified as NPM1(+)ve/FLT3 ITD(-)ve at presentation, with shorter remissions being observed in four patients re-classified as FLT3 ITD(+)ve by the new assay. Notably, FLT3 ITD clone became detectable by conventional PCR in three patients tested during remission after initial treatment.

The traditional clinical staging systems continue to be used for treatment decisions, but they do not allow for predictions in early-stage patients. Molecular and cytogenetic risk factors allow us to predict the risk for disease progression response to 'standard' therapy and prognosis. Increasing evidence indicates robust connections of several CLL risk factor markers to B-cell receptor (BCR) function and signaling. AREAS COVERED: Several CLL risk factors (immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region mutational status, CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, CCL3 plasma levels) are related to the function of the BCR, a key factor in CLL pathogenesis. Their implications in the context of novel BCR-targeted therapies will be discussed. EXPERT OPINION: With the emergence of inhibitors of BCR-associated kinases (Btk-, Syk- and PI3 kinase inhibitors) in CLL and other B cell malignancies, BCR-related risk factors may help with identification of patients who are likely to respond and/or for response assessment (i.e., CCL3 plasma levels). The negative prognostic impact of BCR-related risk factors may improve with the use of these new, targeted agents.","['Burger, Jan A']",['Burger JA'],"['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Leukemia , Unit 428, PO Box 301402, Houston, TX 77230 1402 , USA +1 713 563 1487 or +1 713 792 1865 ; +1 713 794 4297 ; jaburger@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Expert Opin Med Diagn,Expert opinion on medical diagnostics,101392201,,,,2012/01/01 00:00,2012/01/01 00:01,['2013/03/14 06:00'],"['2013/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1517/17530059.2012.637108 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Med Diagn. 2012 Jan;6(1):49-57. doi: 10.1517/17530059.2012.637108.

DNA methylation is one of the most commonly occurring epigenetic events. OBJECTIVE/METHODS: The rationale and use of hypomethylation agents in adult acute myeloid leukemia are discussed. Data in this review came from the published literature. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: In leukemias, alterations in DNA methylation are characterized by the hypermethylation of several genes. Hypermethylation represses transcription of the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes leading to gene silencing. This change is reversible making it an important therapeutic target. Drugs such as methyltranferase inhibitors including 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, and histone deacetylase inhibitors are being used in the treatment of these hematological malignancies.","['Thomas, Xavier', 'Chelghoum, Youcef', 'Barraco, Fiorenza', 'Troncy, Jacques']","['Thomas X', 'Chelghoum Y', 'Barraco F', 'Troncy J']","[""Hopital Edouard Herriot, Leukemia Unit, Service d'Hematologie, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69437 Lyon cedex 03, France +33 4 72 11 73 95 ; +33 4 72 11 74 04 ; xavier.thomas@chu-lyon.fr.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Expert Opin Drug Discov,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,,,,2009/02/01 00:00,2009/02/01 00:01,['2013/03/14 06:00'],"['2013/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1517/17460440802707337 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2009 Feb;4(2):195-205. doi: 10.1517/17460440802707337.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the last two decades, there has been an intense search to find novel biomarkers that can predict prognosis as well as guide treatment decisions. Two of the most reliable molecular prognostic markers, both of which are offered in routine diagnostics, are the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene mutational status and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detection of prognostically relevant genomic aberrations (e.g. 11q-, 13q-, +12 and 17p-). In addition to these markers, a myriad of additional biomarkers have been postulated as potential prognosticators in CLL, on the protein (e.g. CD38, ZAP70, TCL1), the RNA (e.g. LPL, CLLU1, micro-RNAs) and the genomic (e.g. TP53, NOTCH1, SF3B1 and BIRC3 mutations) level. Efforts are now being made to test these novel markers in larger patient cohorts as well as in prospective trials, with the ultimate goal to combine the ""best"" markers in a ""CLL prognostic index"" applicable for the individual patient. Although it is clear that these studies have significantly improved our knowledge regarding both prognostication and the biology of the disease, there is still an immediate need for recognizing biomarkers that can predict therapy response, and efforts should now focus on addressing this pertinent issue. In the present article, we review the extensive literature in the field of prognostic markers in CLL, focus on the most clinically relevant markers and discuss future directions regarding biomarkers in CLL.","['Rosenquist, Richard', 'Cortese, Diego', 'Bhoi, Sujata', 'Mansouri, Larry', 'Gunnarsson, Rebeqa']","['Rosenquist R', 'Cortese D', 'Bhoi S', 'Mansouri L', 'Gunnarsson R']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University , Uppsala , Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis']",2013/03/14 06:00,2014/05/09 06:00,['2013/03/14 06:00'],"['2013/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.783913 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Nov;54(11):2351-64. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.783913.

We found that purity of the NK cells (CD3(-) CD56(+) /CD16(+) ) increased from less than 30% to above 95% after a 3-week expansion and proliferation of the cells was sustained for more than 8 weeks. The surface expression of NK cell activating and inhibitory receptors, except for NKp80, was clearly increased with the expansion, and NK cell-mediated killing activity was also enhanced significantly. However, these changes in both phenotype and function were clearly reversed by JSI-124, a specific signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) inhibitor. Taken together, data showed that the combination of mbIL-21 and CD137L could efficiently induce the formation of functional human NK cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and STAT-3 inhibition could impair this induction. Therefore, STAT-3 activation may benefit human NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity, and provide valuable clinical applications in NK cell immunotherapy against viral infectious diseases and cancers.","['Wang, X', 'Lee, D A', 'Wang, Y', 'Wang, L', 'Yao, Y', 'Lin, Z', 'Cheng, J', 'Zhu, S']","['Wang X', 'Lee DA', 'Wang Y', 'Wang L', 'Yao Y', 'Lin Z', 'Cheng J', 'Zhu S']","['Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, Yanbian University, Yanji, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (4-1BB Ligand)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF9 protein, human)', '0 (Triterpenes)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)', 'SHQ47990PH (cucurbitacin I)']",IM,"['4-1BB Ligand/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Engineering', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/genetics/*immunology', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Protein Binding', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*agonists/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Triterpenes/pharmacology']",2013/03/14 06:00,2013/04/26 06:00,['2013/03/14 06:00'],"['2012/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cei.12034 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2013 Apr;172(1):104-12. doi: 10.1111/cei.12034.,,['(c) 2012 British Society for Immunology.'],PMC3719936,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), MLL-AF4 skewed hematoendothelial specification but was insufficient for transformation, suggesting that additional oncogenic insults seem required for MLL-AF4-mediated transformation. MLL-AF4+ pro-B-ALL expresses enormous levels of FLT3, occasionally because of activating mutations, thus representing a candidate cooperating event in MLL-AF4+ pro-B-ALL. Here, we explored the developmental impact of FLT3 activation alone, or together with MLL-AF4, in the hematopoietic fate of hESCs. FLT3 activation does not affect specification of hemogenic precursors but significantly enhances the formation of CD45(+) blood cells, and CD45(+)CD34(+) blood progenitors with clonogenic potential. However, overexpression of FLT3 mutations or wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT) completely abrogates hematopoietic differentiation from MLL-AF4-expressing hESCs, indicating that FLT3 activation cooperates with MLL-AF4 to inhibit human embryonic hematopoiesis. Cell cycle/apoptosis analyses suggest that FLT3 activation directly affects hESC specification rather than proliferation or survival of hESC-emerging hematopoietic derivatives. Transcriptional profiling of hESC-derived CD45(+) cells supports the FLT3-mediated inhibition of hematopoiesis in MLL-AF4-expressing hESCs, which is associated with large transcriptional changes and downregulation of genes involved in hematopoietic system development and function. Importantly, FLT3 activation does not cooperate with MLL-AF4 to immortalize/transform hESC-derived hematopoietic cells, suggesting the need of alternative (epi)-genetic cooperating hits.","['Bueno, Clara', 'Ayllon, Veronica', 'Montes, Rosa', 'Navarro-Montero, Oscar', 'Ramos-Mejia, Veronica', 'Real, Pedro J', 'Romero-Moya, Damia', 'Arauzo-Bravo, Marcos J', 'Menendez, Pablo']","['Bueno C', 'Ayllon V', 'Montes R', 'Navarro-Montero O', 'Ramos-Mejia V', 'Real PJ', 'Romero-Moya D', 'Arauzo-Bravo MJ', 'Menendez P']","['Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research, Pfizer-University of Granada-Andalusian Regional Government, Granada, Spain. clara.bueno@genyo.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2013/03/13 06:00,2013/07/23 06:00,['2013/03/13 06:00'],"['2013/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58676-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-11-470146 [doi]']",ppublish,"Blood. 2013 May 9;121(19):3867-78, S1-3. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-11-470146.

Within the CD34+CD38- population, the intermediate and high groups expressed higher levels of IL1RAP than did corresponding normal cells. With the aim to target AML stem cells, an anti-IL1RAP monoclonal antibody was generated followed by isotype switching for improved antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity activity. Using this antibody, we achieved selective killing of AML MNC, CD34+CD38+, and CD34+CD38- cells. Our findings demonstrate that IL1RAP is a promising new therapeutic target in AML.","['Askmyr, Maria', 'Agerstam, Helena', 'Hansen, Nils', 'Gordon, Sandra', 'Arvanitakis, Alexandros', 'Rissler, Marianne', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Richter, Johan', 'Jaras, Marcus', 'Fioretos, Thoas']","['Askmyr M', 'Agerstam H', 'Hansen N', 'Gordon S', 'Arvanitakis A', 'Rissler M', 'Juliusson G', 'Richter J', 'Jaras M', 'Fioretos T']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (IL1RAP protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1 Receptor Accessory Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies/*pharmacology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor Accessory Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*immunology/pathology']",2013/03/13 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2013/03/13 06:00'],"['2013/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58720-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-09-458935 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 May 2;121(18):3709-13. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-09-458935.

Given its protection capacity against such relevant drugs as cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), gemcitabine, decitabine, or azacytidine and the highly hematopoiesis-specific toxicity profile of several of these agents, cytidine deaminase (CDD) represents another interesting candidate CTX-R gene and our group recently has established the myeloprotective capacity of CDD gene transfer in a number of murine transplant studies. Clinically, CDD overexpression appears particularly suited to optimize treatment strategies for acute leukemias and myelodysplasias given the efficacy of ara-C (and to a lesser degree decitabine and azacytidine) in these disease entities. This article will review the current state of the art with regard to CDD gene transfer and point out potential scenarios for a clinical application of this strategy.

Further studies found a positive correlation between increased serum oxLDL and an increased risk of the three cancers. In contrast, our previous studies found a negative correlation between the serum oxLDL levels and the risk of leukemia and esophageal cancer. Identification of the variability of cytotoxicity of oxLDL-induced on different types of cell lines is important for understanding the mechanism of oxLDL involved in the tumorigenesis. In the present study, we investigated the effective impacts of oxLDL on the proliferation and apoptosis for the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and two cancer cell lines (EC-9706 and K562/AO2 with multi-drug resistance). HUVEC, K562/AO2 and EC-9706 cell lines were cultured in the presence of oxLDL, and cell proliferation was tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, apoptosis and cell cycle by flow cytometer, mRNA expression by RT-PCR and protein expression by Western blot. OxLDL could inhibit proliferation and apoptosis of the three cell lines; however, there were significant differences of effective action on the viability and apoptosis. The dose of oxLDL-induced cytotoxicity on HUVEC was higher than that on the two tumor cells. The antibody of lectin-like oxLDL receptor-1 (LOX-1-ab) can block oxLDL-induced cytotoxicity. Cells apoptosis is mediated by reducing Bcl-2 and increasing Bax and caspase-3 mRNA and protein expression. This study showed the dose of oxLDL-induced cytotoxicity on HUVEC was higher than that on K562/AO2 and EC-9706 tumor cells.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of family-centered ACP. DESIGN AND SETTING: Two-group randomized controlled trial in a pediatric oncology program. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty adolescents aged 14 to 21 years with cancer and their surrogates or families were enrolled in the study between January 17, 2011, and March 29, 2012. INTERVENTION: Thirty dyads received 3- to 60-minute sessions 1 week apart. Intervention dyads completed (1) the Lyon Family-Centered ACP Survey, (2) the Respecting Choices interview, and (3) Five Wishes. Control subjects received standard care plus information. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Statement of treatment preferences and Decisional Conflict Scale score. RESULTS: The mean age of the adolescents was 16 years; 36 (60%) were male, 30 (50%) white, 26 (43%) black, and 4 (7%) Asian. Diagnoses were as follows: leukemia (14 patients [47%]), brain tumor (8 [27%]), solid tumor (6 [20%]), and lymphoma (2 [7%]). Significantly increased congruence was observed for intervention dyads compared with controls for 4 of the 6 disease-specific scenarios; for example, for situation 2 (""treatment would extend my life by not more than 2 to 3 months""), intervention dyads demonstrated higher congruence (kappa = 0.660; P < .001) vs control dyads (kappa = -0.0636; P = .70). Intervention adolescents (100%) wanted their families to do what is best at the time, whereas fewer control adolescents (62%) gave families this leeway. Intervention adolescents were significantly better informed about end-of-life decisions (t = 2.93; effect size, 0.961; 95% CI, 0.742-1.180; P = .007). Intervention families were more likely to concur on limiting treatments than controls. An ethnic difference was found in only one situation. CONCLUSIONS: Advance care planning enabled families to understand and honor their adolescents' wishes. Intervention dyads were more likely than controls to limit treatments. Underserved African American families were willing to participate.","['Lyon, Maureen E', 'Jacobs, Shana', 'Briggs, Linda', 'Cheng, Yao Iris', 'Wang, Jichuan']","['Lyon ME', 'Jacobs S', 'Briggs L', 'Cheng YI', 'Wang J']","[""Centers for Translational Science, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010, USA. mlyon@cnmc.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,JAMA Pediatr,JAMA pediatrics,101589544,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Advance Care Planning', 'African Americans', 'Communication Barriers', 'Conflict, Psychological', 'Decision Making', 'District of Columbia', '*Family/ethnology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Legal Guardians', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/ethnology/*therapy', '*Parent-Child Relations/ethnology', 'Patient Preference', 'Pilot Projects', 'Poverty', '*Professional-Family Relations', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/13 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2013/03/13 06:00'],"['2013/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1663080 [pii]', '10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.943 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Pediatr. 2013 May;167(5):460-7. doi: 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.943.,,,,,['JAMA Pediatr. 2013 May;167(5):489-90.

To provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of this disease, we identified the high expression of EVI1-regulated G protein-coupled receptor 56 (GPR56), and the association of high cell adhesion and antiapoptotic activities in EVI1(high) AML cells. Knockdown of GPR56 expression decreased the cellular adhesion ability through inactivation of RhoA signaling, resulting in a reduction of cellular growth rates and enhanced apoptosis. Moreover, in Gpr56(-/-) mice, the number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) was significantly decreased in the bone marrow (BM) and, conversely, was increased in the spleen, liver and peripheral blood. The number of Gpr56(-/-) HSC progenitors in the G0/G1-phase was significantly reduced and was associated with impaired cellular adhesion. Finally, the loss of GPR56 function resulted in a reduction of the in vivo repopulating ability of the HSCs.

Employing gene-expression profiling, we here identified the pro-angiogenic factor adrenomedullin (AM) as the most highly upregulated gene in MM cells exposed to hypoxia. Malignant plasma cells from the majority of MM patients, belonging to distinct genetic subgroups, aberrantly express AM. Already under normoxic conditions, a subset of MM highly expressed and secreted AM, which could not be further enhanced by hypoxia or cobalt chloride-induced stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1alpha. In line with this, expression of AM did not correlate with expression of a panel of established hypoxia-/HIF1alpha-target genes in MM patients. We demonstrate that MM-driven promotion of endothelial cell proliferation and tube formation is augmented by inducible expression of AM and strongly repressed by inhibition of endogenous and hypoxia-induced AM activity. Together, our results demonstrate that MM cells, both in a hypoxia-dependent and -independent fashion, aberrantly express and secrete AM, which can mediate MM-induced angiogenesis. Thus, AM secretion can be a major driving force for the angiogenic switch observed during MM evolution, which renders AM a putative target for MM therapy.","['Kocemba, K A', 'van Andel, H', 'de Haan-Kramer, A', 'Mahtouk, K', 'Versteeg, R', 'Kersten, M J', 'Spaargaren, M', 'Pals, S T']","['Kocemba KA', 'van Andel H', 'de Haan-Kramer A', 'Mahtouk K', 'Versteeg R', 'Kersten MJ', 'Spaargaren M', 'Pals ST']","['Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '148498-78-6 (Adrenomedullin)']",IM,"['Adrenomedullin/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/*genetics', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2013/03/13 06:00,2013/10/22 06:00,['2013/03/13 06:00'],"['2012/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/09 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201376 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.76 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Aug;27(8):1729-37. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.76.

At elevated levels relative to pro-apoptotic effector members, the survival proteins prevent cancer cells from initiating apoptosis in the face of many intrinsic tumour-suppressing pathways and extrinsic therapeutic treatments aimed at controlling tumorigenesis. Recent studies, including genome-wide analyses, have begun to focus attention on a particularly enigmatic member of the family-myeloid cell leukaemia 1 (Mcl1). For reasons that are not clear, Mcl1 in cancer cells is turned over rapidly, eliminated primarily through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

As the pro-cancer activity of Mcl1 requires elevated expression levels of the protein, the cancer genome adapts to ensure either high levels of synthesis or evasion of degradation, or both.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 were employed as experimental materials. The MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was used to determine the safe dose range of acetylharpagide. TNF-alpha (20 ng/ml) was used to model THP-HUVECs adhesion/transmigration and trypsin was used to model wounding of HUVECs under controlled shear stress of 0.1 Pa and 0.2 Pa (5 h) by Bioflux1000 assays accordingly. Effects of acetylharpagide were dynamically monitored by microscopic time-lapse photography. Acetylharpagide within the concentration of 0-200 muM showed no sign of toxicity to HUVECs and THP-1. Acetylharpagide dose-dependently inhibited THP-1 adhesion to TNF-alpha activated HUVECs monolayer with an IC50 of 171 muM under static conditions. Acetylharpagide at 200 muM inhibited leukocyte adhesion and transmigration to HUVECs monolayer activated by TNF-alpha under 0.1 Pa shear stress (P < 0.05). The compound at 200 muM also inhibited HUVECs migration under 0.2 Pa in the wound healing model compared with the control group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory effects of acetylharpagide are possibly related to inhibiting leukocytes adhesion and transmigration. Moreover, acetylharpagide also inhibits the endothelial cells migration notably, which might be the additional action responsible for its effect in reliving-chronic inflammatory progress.","['You, Yun', 'Wang, Jinyu', 'Tong, Yan', 'Hao, Qingxiu', 'Li, Yujie', 'Yang, Hongjun', 'Huang, Luqi', 'Liao, Fulong']","['You Y', 'Wang J', 'Tong Y', 'Hao Q', 'Li Y', 'Yang H', 'Huang L', 'Liao F']","['Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Clin Hemorheol Microcirc,Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation,9709206,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Pyrans)', '6926-14-3 (8-O-acetylharpagide)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Movement', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Pyrans/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Stress, Mechanical']",2013/03/13 06:00,2015/08/12 06:00,['2013/03/13 06:00'],"['2013/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1T36321220722886 [pii]', '10.3233/CH-131704 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Hemorheol Microcirc. 2014;56(3):205-17. doi: 10.3233/CH-131704.,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acetylharpagide', 'biomechanopharmacology', 'endothelial cells', 'inflammation', 'shear stress']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though several mechanisms associated with drug resistance have been studied in detail, the role of carbohydrate modification remains unexplored. Here, we investigated the contribution of 9-O-acetylated N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) to survival and drug resistance development in ALL cells. A strong induction of 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac including 9-O-acetyl GD3 was detected in ALL cells that developed resistance against vincristine or nilotinib, drugs with distinct cytotoxic mechanisms. Removal of 9-O-acetyl residues from Neu5Ac on the cell surface by an O-acetylesterase made ALL cells more vulnerable to such drugs. Moreover, removal of intracellular and cell surface-resident 9-O-acetyl Neu5Ac by lentiviral transduction of the esterase was lethal to ALL cells in vitro even in the presence of stromal protection. Interestingly, expression of the esterase in normal fibroblasts or endothelial cells had no effect on their survival. Transplanted mice induced for expression of the O-acetylesterase in the ALL cells exhibited a reduction of leukemia to minimal cell numbers and significantly increased survival. This demonstrates that Neu5Ac 9-O-acetylation is essential for survival of these cells and suggests that Neu5Ac de-O-acetylation could be used as therapy to eradicate drug-resistant ALL cells.","['Parameswaran, Reshmi', 'Lim, Min', 'Arutyunyan, Anna', 'Abdel-Azim, Hisham', 'Hurtz, Christian', 'Lau, Kam', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Yu, Robert K', 'von Itzstein, Mark', 'Heisterkamp, Nora', 'Groffen, John']","['Parameswaran R', 'Lim M', 'Arutyunyan A', 'Abdel-Azim H', 'Hurtz C', 'Lau K', 'Muschen M', 'Yu RK', 'von Itzstein M', 'Heisterkamp N', 'Groffen J']","[""Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Saban Research Institute, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/therapeutic use/urine', 'Cell Survival', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2013/03/13 06:00,2013/06/08 06:00,['2013/03/13 06:00'],"['2013/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20121482 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20121482 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2013 Apr 8;210(4):805-19. doi: 10.1084/jem.20121482.

This study aims to investigate the molecular apoptotic mechanisms of baicalein in CCRF-CEM leukemic cells and to evaluate the combined therapeutic efficacy of baicalein with several commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs in CCRF-CEM cells. Our results demonstrate that baicalein induces mitochondria-dependent cleavage of caspases-9 and -3 and PARP with concomitant decreases in IAP family proteins, survivin, and XIAP. Furthermore, our results present for the first time that baicalein triggers a convergence of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways via the death receptor-caspase 8-tBid signaling cascade in CCRF-CEM cells. In addition, we also present for the first time that the combination of baicalein and vincristine results in a synergistic therapeutic efficacy. Overall, this combination strategy is recommended for future clinical trials in the treatment of pediatric leukemia owing to baicalein's beneficial effects in alleviating the vomiting, nausea, and skin rashes caused by chemotherapy.","['Chen, Yun-Ju', 'Wu, Chieh-Shan', 'Shieh, Jeng-Jer', 'Wu, Jyh-Horng', 'Chen, Hsing-Yu', 'Chung, Ting-Wen', 'Chen, Yu-Kuo', 'Lin, Chi-Chen']","['Chen YJ', 'Wu CS', 'Shieh JJ', 'Wu JH', 'Chen HY', 'Chung TW', 'Chen YK', 'Lin CC']","['Department of Child Care, College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan 71005, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,2013/03/12 06:00,2013/03/12 06:01,['2013/03/12 06:00'],"['2012/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/124747 [doi]'],ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2013;2013:124747. doi: 10.1155/2013/124747.

However, flow cytometric tube-to-tube variation may make interpretation difficult, particularly when the CLL-like B-cell count straddles the recommended threshold. This study investigates the extent, and potential sources, of this variability. METHODS: Flow cytometric enumeration was performed on 20 samples with CLL-like B cells and 10 control specimens using single platform (SP) and two DP tubes A: kappa, lambda, CD5, CD10, CD19, CD38, CD45, CD20 and B: FMC-7, CD23, CD19, CD5, with and without racking to remove doublets. In addition, reproducibility studies were performed. RESULTS: Three specimens showed discordant CLL-like B-cell counts relative to the threshold of 5 x 10(9) /L. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a systematic bias with DP Tube B > A (5.9%) and SP > DP Tube A (9.5%). The doublet percent varied between specimens, but did not account for the bias between DP tubes. Variation was also seen in enumeration of other cell types, suggesting multiple potential sources of inconsistency. CONCLUSIONS: Significant tube-to-tube variation may be seen in CLL-like B-cell counts. The precise cause of these differences is uncertain, but is likely multifactorial. If the clinical utility of an absolute threshold for the diagnosis of CLL can be confirmed, it will be important to establish recommendations for standardization, similar to those employed for CD4 and CD34 enumeration.","['Rollins-Raval, Marian A', 'Fisher, Jason', 'Craig, Fiona E']","['Rollins-Raval MA', 'Fisher J', 'Craig FE']","['Division of Hematopathology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213-2582, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

They are involved in the regulation of gene expression mainly at a posttranscriptional level. This function depends on their complementarity to the 3'UTR regions of mRNAs. MicroRNAs are essential for proper development and functioning of the organism. They are so important because of their participation in such processes as angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell cycle control and oncogenesis. Over thirty percent of human genes are controlled by miRNAs. This indicates the great importance of these molecules. Alterations of numerous cellular processes can be caused by the dysregulation of miRNA expression. Such disturbances are observed in cancer cells, and signatures of microRNA expression are specific to particular types of cancer. It is suggested that miRNAs may serve as diagnostic and prognostic factors in oncologic and hematooncologic disorders. The expression of specific miRNAs can indicate benign or aggressive course of disease. The overall survival or time to treatment are also possible to estimate based on the microRNA expression profile. Knowledge about changes in miRNA expression observed in leukemia patients may enable the selection of appropriate individual therapy. Recent reports indicate that various hematooncologic disorders may be well characterized by microRNAs circulating in plasma or serum. It is of great potential importance, considering the availability of material for analysis, simplicity of diagnostic procedures and shortening of time required to conduct them.","['Grenda, Anna', 'Budzynski, Michal', 'Filip, Agata A']","['Grenda A', 'Budzynski M', 'Filip AA']","['Zaklad Genetyki Nowotworow z Pracownia Cytogenetyczna, Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie, Lublin. an.grenda@gmail.com']",['pol'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics']",2013/03/12 06:00,2013/06/07 06:00,['2013/03/12 06:00'],"['2013/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1038361 [pii]', '10.5604/17322693.1038361 [doi]']",epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2013 Mar 8;67:174-85. doi: 10.5604/17322693.1038361.,20130308,,,,,,,,,,Biogeneza czasteczek mikroRNA oraz ich znaczenie w powstawaniu i przebiegu wybranych zaburzen hematologicznych.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An important mechanism of tumor development is neoangiogenesis. A potent antiangiogenic factor, bevacizumab (Avastin, AVA), has been poorly explored in CLL so far. In the current study we assessed cytotoxic activity of AVA alone or in combinations with drugs routinely used in this disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells isolated from 60 CLL patients were treated with AVA alone or in combination with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (MoAb), rituximab (RIT), anti-CD52 MoAb, alemtuzumab (ALT), 2-CdA (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine), FA (fludarabine), MAF (mafosfamide) or RAPA (rapamycin). Cytotoxicity was assessed by propidium iodide staining. Apoptosis was evaluated using annexin-V and TUNEL assays. Additionally, a drop of mitochondrial potential (DYm) as well as expression of apoptosis-regulating proteins Bax, Bak, Bid, Bad, Bcl-2, Mcl-2, XIAP, FLIP, Akt and Bcl-2-A1 were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: At the dose of 40 mug/ml, after 48 hours of incubation, AVA induced significant cytotoxicity against CLL cells. The drug triggered apoptosis, with activation of caspase-3 and -9, but not caspase-8, along with a drop of DYm. Incubation with AVA induced significant overexpression of proapoptotic Bak and Bad as well as downregulation of antiapoptotic Mcl-2 and Akt proteins. Combination of AVA with RIT, ALT or RAPA significantly increased cytotoxicity when compared with the effects of single drugs. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, this is the first report showing proapoptotic activity of AVA against CLL cells.

Simultaneous activities of multiple miRNAs can be monitored from their expression profiles under various conditions. We often build up coexpression networks from such profiles. Unfortunately, due to the change of experimental setups (or conditions), the expression profiles do change, and consequently, the patterns of the coexpression networks vary. To obtain a robust functional relationship between miRNAs, by integrating different coexpression networks in a systems biology approach, we have to combine them properly. Here, we evaluate the state-of-the-art techniques and propose a novel integrative measure, and a corresponding methodology, that might be useful for identifying the dependence between coexpression and functional similarity. We establish the results by evaluating the expression profiles of miRNAs taken from bone marrow samples of patients with leukemia. The findings highlight the potential of the integrative algorithm in analyzing the expression profiles of miRNAs for further study.","['Bhattacharyya, Malay', 'Das, Manali', 'Bandyopadhyay, Sanghamitra']","['Bhattacharyya M', 'Das M', 'Bandyopadhyay S']","['Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Kalyani, Nadia 741235, India. malaybhattacharyya@klyuniv.ac.in']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,0012737,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Computer Simulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval/methods', 'Leukemia', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', '*Models, Biological', '*Signal Transduction']",2013/03/12 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/03/12 06:00'],"['2013/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1109/TBME.2013.2250285 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng. 2013 Aug;60(8):2167-73. doi: 10.1109/TBME.2013.2250285.

A variety of epidemiological and experimental evidence supports this hypothesis. Nevertheless, there are a number of conflicting reports regarding the degree of immune protection conferred, the immune cell types responsible for protection, and the potential contributions of immunosuppressive therapies to tumor induction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the adaptive immune system actively suppresses tumorigenesis in a Sleeping Beauty (SB) mouse model of cancer. SB transposon mutagenesis was performed in either a wild-type or immunocompromised (Rag2-null) background. Tumor latency and multiplicity were remarkably similar in both immune cohorts, suggesting that the adaptive immune system is not efficiently suppressing tumor formation in our model. Exceptions included skin tumors, which displayed increased multiplicity in wild-type animals, and leukemias, which developed with shorter latency in immune-deficient mice. Overall tumor distribution was also altered such that tumors affecting the gastrointestinal tract were more frequent and hemangiosarcomas were less frequent in immune-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice. Finally, genetic profiling of transposon-induced mutations identified significant differences in mutation prevalence for a number of genes, including Uba1. Taken together, these results indicate that B and T cells function to shape the genetic profile of tumors in various tumor types, despite being ineffective at clearing SB-induced tumors. To our knowledge, this study represents the first forward genetic screen designed to examine tumor immunosurveillance mechanisms.","['Rogers, Laura M', 'Olivier, Alicia K', 'Meyerholz, David K', 'Dupuy, Adam J']","['Rogers LM', 'Olivier AK', 'Meyerholz DK', 'Dupuy AJ']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Roy J. and Lucille A.

We previously reported that Tax-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) contributed to graft-versus-ATL effects in ATL patients after allo-HSCT. However, the role of HTLV-1-specific CD4(+) T cells in the effects remains unclear. In this study, we showed that Tax-specific CD4(+) as well as CD8(+) T cell responses were induced in some ATL patients following allo-HSCT. To further analyze HTLV-1-specific CD4(+) T cell responses, we identified a novel HLA-DRB1*0101-restricted epitope, Tax155-167, recognized by HTLV-1-specific CD4(+) Th1-like cells, a major population of HTLV-1-specific CD4(+) T cell line, which was established from an ATL patient at 180 d after allo-HSCT from an unrelated seronegative donor by in vitro stimulation with HTLV-1-infected cells from the same patient. Costimulation of PBMCs with both the identified epitope (Tax155-167) and known CTL epitope peptides markedly enhanced the expansion of Tax-specific CD8(+) T cells in PBMCs compared with stimulation with CTL epitope peptide alone in all three HLA-DRB1*0101(+) patients post-allo-HSCT tested. In addition, direct detection using newly generated HLA-DRB1*0101/Tax155-167 tetramers revealed that Tax155-167-specific CD4(+) T cells were present in all HTLV-1-infected individuals tested, regardless of HSCT. These results suggest that Tax155-167 may be the dominant epitope recognized by HTLV-1-specific CD4(+) T cells in HLA-DRB1*0101(+)-infected individuals and that Tax-specific CD4(+) T cells may augment the graft-versus-Tax effects via efficient induction of Tax-specific CD8(+) T cell responses.","['Tamai, Yotaro', 'Hasegawa, Atsuhiko', 'Takamori, Ayako', 'Sasada, Amane', 'Tanosaki, Ryuji', 'Choi, Ilseung', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Maeda, Yasuhiro', 'Yamano, Yoshihisa', 'Eto, Tetsuya', 'Koh, Ki-Ryang', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa', 'Suehiro, Youko', 'Kato, Koji', 'Takemoto, Shigeki', 'Okamura, Jun', 'Uike, Naokuni', 'Kannagi, Mari']","['Tamai Y', 'Hasegawa A', 'Takamori A', 'Sasada A', 'Tanosaki R', 'Choi I', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Maeda Y', 'Yamano Y', 'Eto T', 'Koh KR', 'Nakamae H', 'Suehiro Y', 'Kato K', 'Takemoto S', 'Okamura J', 'Uike N', 'Kannagi M']","['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Aged', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/*transplantation', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Products, tax/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2013/03/12 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2013/03/12 06:00'],"['2013/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1202971 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1202971 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 Apr 15;190(8):4382-92. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1202971.

Abnormal tyrosine kinase activation in AML has been associated with poor prognosis and provides strategic targets for novel therapy development. We found that Mer receptor tyrosine kinase was over-expressed in a majority of pediatric (29/36, 80%) and adult (10/10, 100%) primary AML patient blasts at the time of diagnosis, and 100% of patient samples at the time of relapse. Mer was also found to be expressed in 12 of 14 AML cell lines (86%). In contrast, normal bone marrow myeloid precursors expressed little to no Mer. Following AML cell line stimulation with Gas6, a Mer ligand, we observed activation of prosurvival and proliferative signaling pathways, including phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, MSK1, CREB, ATF1, AKT and STAT6. To assess the phenotypic role of Mer in AML, two independent short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs were used to decrease Mer expression in the AML cell lines Nomo-1 and Kasumi-1. Reduction of Mer protein levels significantly increased rates of myeloblast apoptosis two to threefold in response to serum starvation. Furthermore, myeloblasts with knocked-down Mer demonstrated decreased colony formation by 67-87%, relative to control cell lines (P<0.01). NOD-SCID-gamma mice transplanted with Nomo-1 myeloblasts with reduced levels of Mer had a significant prolongation in survival compared with mice transplanted with the parental or control cell lines (median survival 17 days in parental and control cell lines, versus 32-36 days in Mer knockdown cell lines, P<0.0001).

Despite the extent of the phenomenon, the regulation and specificity of the splicing machinery are only partially understood. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing of pre-mRNA by ADAR enzymes has been linked to splicing regulation in several cases. Here we used bioinformatics approaches, RNA-seq and exon-specific microarray of ADAR knockdown cells to globally examine how ADAR and its A-to-I RNA editing activity influence alternative mRNA splicing. Although A-to-I RNA editing only rarely targets canonical splicing acceptor, donor, and branch sites, it was found to affect splicing regulatory elements (SREs) within exons. Cassette exons were found to be significantly enriched with A-to-I RNA editing sites compared with constitutive exons. RNA-seq and exon-specific microarray revealed that ADAR knockdown in hepatocarcinoma and myelogenous leukemia cell lines leads to global changes in gene expression, with hundreds of genes changing their splicing patterns in both cell lines. This global change in splicing pattern cannot be explained by putative editing sites alone. Genes showing significant changes in their splicing pattern are frequently involved in RNA processing and splicing activity. Analysis of recently published RNA-seq data from glioblastoma cell lines showed similar results. Our global analysis reveals that ADAR plays a major role in splicing regulation. Although direct editing of the splicing motifs does occur, we suggest it is not likely to be the primary mechanism for ADAR-mediated regulation of alternative splicing. Rather, this regulation is achieved by modulating trans-acting factors involved in the splicing machinery.","['Solomon, Oz', 'Oren, Shirley', 'Safran, Michal', 'Deshet-Unger, Naamit', 'Akiva, Pinchas', 'Jacob-Hirsch, Jasmine', 'Cesarkas, Karen', 'Kabesa, Reut', 'Amariglio, Ninette', 'Unger, Ron', 'Rechavi, Gideon', 'Eyal, Eran']","['Solomon O', 'Oren S', 'Safran M', 'Deshet-Unger N', 'Akiva P', 'Jacob-Hirsch J', 'Cesarkas K', 'Kabesa R', 'Amariglio N', 'Unger R', 'Rechavi G', 'Eyal E']","['Cancer Research Center, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer 52621, Ramat Gan, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,RNA,"RNA (New York, N.Y.)",9509184,"['0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '5A614L51CT (Inosine)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (ADARB1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/genetics/metabolism', 'Adenosine Deaminase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Inosine/genetics', 'RNA Editing/genetics', 'RNA Precursors/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins']",2013/03/12 06:00,2013/06/20 06:00,['2013/03/12 06:00'],"['2013/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [medline]']","['rna.038042.112 [pii]', '10.1261/rna.038042.112 [doi]']",ppublish,RNA. 2013 May;19(5):591-604. doi: 10.1261/rna.038042.112.

Recently, AK4 was reported to play a role in protection from stress: In HEK293 cells, hypoxia increases AK4 expression but does not affect proliferation or viability, while RNA interference (RNAi) directed against AK4 inhibits proliferation and promotes death. By contrast, we show here that HepG2 cells showed much higher AK4 levels, which decreased under hypoxia along with markedly reduced cell proliferation and increased cell death. Nevertheless, RNAi directed against AK4 inhibited cell proliferation and caused death in both cell types, although cell cycle parameters were affected only in HepG2 cells. Hence reductions of AK4 levels were always associated with cell death. These results extend the notion of a stress-protective function of AK4 to a novel physiological context and show that AK4-mediated stress protection is not limited to one particular death scenario. Our data also allow the hypothesis that the different basal AK4 levels reflect different basal stress levels, causing alternative responses to additional stress.","['Kong, Fanzhi', 'Binas, Bert', 'Moon, Jae Hee', 'Kang, Sung Soo', 'Kim, Hyo Joon']","['Kong F', 'Binas B', 'Moon JH', 'Kang SS', 'Kim HJ']","['Division of Molecular & Life Science, College of Science & Technology, Hanyang University, Ansan, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.4.3 (Adenylate Kinase)']",IM,"['Adenylate Kinase/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Death/genetics', 'Cell Hypoxia/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'Stress, Physiological/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",2013/03/12 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2013/03/12 06:00'],"['2012/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0003-9861(13)00065-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.abb.2013.02.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2013 May;533(1-2):11-7. doi: 10.1016/j.abb.2013.02.014.

Lack of efficient therapy for advanced HCC is a pressing problem worldwide. This study aimed to determine the efficacy and mechanism of combined sorafenib and radiation therapy treatment for HCC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: HCC cell lines (PLC5, Huh-7, Sk-Hep1, and Hep3B) were treated with sorafenib, radiation, or both, and apoptosis and signal transduction were analyzed. RESULTS: All 4 HCC cell lines showed resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis; however, this resistance could be reversed in the presence of sorafenib. Inhibition of phospho-STAT3 was found in cells treated with sorafenib or sorafenib plus radiation and subsequently reduced the expression levels of STAT3-related proteins, Mcl-1, cyclin D1, and survivin. Silencing STAT3 by RNA interference overcame apoptotic resistance to radiation in HCC cells, and the ectopic expression of STAT3 in HCC cells abolished the radiosensitizing effect of sorafenib. Moreover, sorafenib plus radiation significantly suppressed PLC5 xenograft tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that sorafenib sensitizes resistant HCC cells to radiation-induced apoptosis via downregulating phosphorylation of STAT3 in vitro and in vivo.","['Huang, Chao-Yuan', 'Lin, Chen-Si', 'Tai, Wei-Tien', 'Hsieh, Chi-Ying', 'Shiau, Chung-Wai', 'Cheng, Ann-Lii', 'Chen, Kuen-Feng']","['Huang CY', 'Lin CS', 'Tai WT', 'Hsieh CY', 'Shiau CW', 'Cheng AL', 'Chen KF']","['Department of Oncology, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Survivin)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*therapy', 'Chemoradiotherapy/methods', 'Cyclin D1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Liver Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA Interference', 'Radiation Tolerance/drug effects', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sorafenib', 'Survivin']",2013/03/12 06:00,2013/07/26 06:00,['2013/03/12 06:00'],"['2012/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0360-3016(13)00106-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2013.01.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2013 Jul 1;86(3):456-62. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2013.01.025.

We demonstrate herein that normal tissue-derived epithelial cells (NECs) exert protective effects on the survival of leukemic cells, which may partially account for high resistance to antileukemic therapies in patients with ATL. Viral gene-silenced, ATL-derived cell lines (ATL cells) dramatically escaped from histone deacetylase inhibitor-induced apoptosis by direct co-culture with NECs. Adhesions to NECs suppressed p21(Cip1) expression and increased a proportion of resting G0/G1 phase cells in trichostatin A (TSA)-treated ATL cells. ATL cells adhering to NECs down-regulated CD25 expression and enhanced vimentin expression, suggesting that most ATL cells acquired a quiescent state by cell-cell interactions with NECs. ATL cells adhering to NECs displayed highly elevated expression of the cancer stem cell marker CD44. Blockade of CD44 signaling diminished the NEC-conferred resistance of ATL cells to TSA-induced apoptosis. Co-culture with NECs also suppressed the expression of NKG2D ligands on TSA-treated ATL cells, resulting in decreased natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Combined evidence suggests that interactions with normal epithelial cells augment the resistance of ATL cells to TSA-induced apoptosis and facilitate immune evasion by ATL cells.","['Miyatake, Yukiko', 'Oliveira, Andre L A', 'Jarboui, Mohamed Ali', 'Ota, Shuichi', 'Tomaru, Utano', 'Teshima, Takanori', 'Hall, William W', 'Kasahara, Masanori']","['Miyatake Y', 'Oliveira AL', 'Jarboui MA', 'Ota S', 'Tomaru U', 'Teshima T', 'Hall WW', 'Kasahara M']","['Department of Pathology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan. yukimiya@med.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', '*Cytoprotection/drug effects', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/metabolism', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2013/03/12 06:00,2014/03/26 06:00,['2013/03/12 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0002-9440(13)00099-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.01.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2013 May;182(5):1832-42. doi: 10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.01.015.

Symptoms of cardiotoxicity include acute cardiac conduction disturbances, such as QT prolongation. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of alpha-lipoic acid (LA) on acute As(2)O(3)-induced ECG abnormalities (QTc interval prolongation) in anesthetized guinea pigs. Intravenous injection of As(2)O(3) in guinea pigs caused QTc interval prolongation, which was significantly attenuated by co-treatment with LA (0.35, 3.5 and 35 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner. In isolated guinea pig cardiomyocytes, the decrease in IKs current induced by As(2)O3 (1 muM) was rapidly restored to the basal level by the addition of LA (10 muM). Consistent with this finding, the As(2)O(3)-induced QTc interval prolongation was also improved rapidly by post-treatment with LA in guinea pigs. Electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis detected an expected peak of arsenic-LA complex in vitro, indicating that LA and As(2)O3 form a new compound in vivo. In addition, pre-treatment with a chelating agent, British anti-Lewisite (BAL, 3.5 or 35 mg/kg), also attenuated the As(2)O(3)-induced QTc interval prolongation. In this study, co- and post-treatments with LA and pre-treatment with BAL ameliorated As(2)O(3)-induced acute QT prolongation in anesthetized guinea pigs. Because LA and probably BAL may bind to As(2)O(3), these agents may exert protective effects through their chelating activity. Further studies are needed to determine whether LA is beneficial as a prophylactic or rescue agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia patients treated with As(2)O(3).","['Kumazaki, Masafumi', 'Ando, Hitoshi', 'Kakei, Masafumi', 'Ushijima, Kentarou', 'Taniguchi, Yosuke', 'Yoshida, Masashi', 'Yamato, Shiho', 'Washino, Satoshi', 'Koshimizu, Taka-Aki', 'Fujimura, Akio']","['Kumazaki M', 'Ando H', 'Kakei M', 'Ushijima K', 'Taniguchi Y', 'Yoshida M', 'Yamato S', 'Washino S', 'Koshimizu TA', 'Fujimura A']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Pharmacology, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi 329-0498, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Cardiotonic Agents)', '0 (Delayed Rectifier Potassium Channels)', '0 (Oxides)', '73Y7P0K73Y (Thioctic Acid)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Anesthesia', 'Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Cardiotonic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Delayed Rectifier Potassium Channels/physiology', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Long QT Syndrome/chemically induced/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects/physiology', 'Oxides', 'Thioctic Acid/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2013/03/12 06:00,2013/11/06 06:00,['2013/03/12 06:00'],"['2012/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(13)00132-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.02.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2013 Apr 5;705(1-3):1-10. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.02.027.

Literature data about high-dose imatinib used front-line as single treatment or with different combinations is also examined. A literature search for relevant studies was undertaken mainly in PubMed. This review is aimed to summarize the safety of different treatments and to discuss the current management of most common side effects. Literature evidence supports the fact that side effects associated to TKIs seem to differ between agents, but most of side effects reported occur early within the treatment course.

It was therefore of interest to investigate the effects of these oxysterols on oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells in the CNS. To this end, 158N murine oligodendrocytes were treated with 7KC or 7betaOHC inducing an apoptotic mode of cell death characterized by condensation/fragmentation of the nuclei, dephosphorylation of Akt and GSK3, mitochondrial depolarization involving Mcl-1, and caspase-3 activation. In contrast, under treatment with 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHC), no cell death was observed. When the cells were stained with Fura-2, no significant Ca(2+) rise was found with the different oxysterols, whereas strong signals were detected with ionomycin used as positive control. At concentrations which induced apoptosis, 7KC but not 7betaOHC accumulated in lipid rafts. Although not cytotoxic, 27OHC was mainly detected in lipid rafts. It is noteworthy that alpha-tocopherol (but not ellagic acid and resveratrol) was able to counteract 7KC- and 7betaOHC-induced apoptosis and to decrease the accumulation of 7KC and 27OHC in lipid rafts. Thus, in 158N cells, the ability of oxysterols to trigger a mode of cell death by apoptosis involving GSK-3 and caspase-3 activation is independent of the increase in the Ca(2+) level and of their accumulation in lipid raft microdomains.","['Ragot, Kevin', 'Mackrill, John J', 'Zarrouk, Amira', 'Nury, Thomas', 'Aires, Virginie', 'Jacquin, Agnes', 'Athias, Anne', 'Pais de Barros, Jean-Paul', 'Vejux, Anne', 'Riedinger, Jean-Marc', 'Delmas, Dominique', 'Lizard, Gerard']","['Ragot K', 'Mackrill JJ', 'Zarrouk A', 'Nury T', 'Aires V', 'Jacquin A', 'Athias A', 'Pais de Barros JP', 'Vejux A', 'Riedinger JM', 'Delmas D', 'Lizard G']","[""Universite de Bourgogne, Equipe 'Biochimie du peroxysome, inflammation et metabolisme lipidique' EA 7270/INSERM, Dijon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Hydroxycholesterols)', '0 (Ketocholesterols)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sterols)', '566-26-7 (cholest-5-en-3 beta,7 alpha-diol)', '6T2NA6P5SQ (27-hydroxycholesterol)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'H4N855PNZ1 (alpha-Tocopherol)', 'O7676FE78M (7-ketocholesterol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Hydroxycholesterols/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Ketocholesterols/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Membrane Microdomains/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oligodendroglia/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Sterols/*metabolism', 'alpha-Tocopherol/pharmacology']",2013/03/12 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/03/12 06:00'],"['2012/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(13)00151-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2013.02.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2013 Jul 1;86(1):67-79. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2013.02.028.

We demonstrated in our previous study that the up-regulation of TIMP-2 promoted SHI-1 cell invasion in vitro. We investigated in the present study whether TIMP-2 would have the same effect in vivo. A retroviral vector carrying human TIMP-2 cDNA was constructed and transfected into SHI-1 cells. Three subclone cells (S1, S2 and S3) that highly expressed TIMP-2 were selected to establish nude mouse models of acute leukemia. Times of leukemic onset in mice of S1, S2 and S3 groups were all earlier than that of the SHI-1 group, whereas the survival times of S1, S2 and S3 groups were all shorter than that of the SHI-1 group (p < 0.05). Histopathological results demonstrated severe leukemic infiltration in numerous organs in each group. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay showed that several organs expressed the MLL/F6 fusion gene. Moreover, the numbers of organs infiltrated by leukemic cells in S1, S2 and S3 groups were more than those in the SHI-1 group (p < 0.05). Up-regulating TIMP-2 expression enhanced SHI-1 cell invasion in nude mice and resulted in more severe leukemia infiltration. This phenomenon suggests that targeted therapy with TIMP-2 for acute leukemia should be performed with prudence.","['Wang, Chunling', 'Cai, Xiaohui', 'Chen, Baoan', 'He, Zhengmei', 'Chen, Zixing', 'Cen, Jiannong', 'Li, Zhenjiang']","['Wang C', 'Cai X', 'Chen B', 'He Z', 'Chen Z', 'Cen J', 'Li Z']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University , Nanjing , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (MLL-AF6 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TIMP2 protein, human)', '127497-59-0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2013/03/12 06:00,2014/06/10 06:00,['2013/03/12 06:00'],"['2013/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.783214 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Dec;54(12):2707-11. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.783214.

METHODS: B6.129 mice were crossed to produce WT, apoE(-/-), apoE(+/-), iNOS(-/-), iNOS(+/-) and apoE(-/-)iNOS(-/-) groups. Variants were confirmed by PCR. Serum lipid parameters (triglycerides, TG; total cholesterol, TC; high density lipoprotein, HDL; and low density lipoprotein, LDL), NO levels and placental electronic microscopic ultrastructures were evaluated, and blood pressure (BP), 24-hour urine protein and pregnancy outcomes were recorded for pregnant F1 generation mice.

RESULTS: Serum lipids, BP and 24-hour urine protein levels were shown to be significantly higher and parturition and placenta weights were lower in apoE(-/-) and apoE(-/-)iNOS(-/-) groups (p<0.05). NO levels were lower in the apoE(-/-)iNOS(-/-) group.

However, most of the inflammatory/apoptosis parameters in the iNOS(+/-) and the apoE(+/-) groups (p>0.05) showed no differences. In addition, placenta vascular endothelial and trophoblast cell morphological changes were demonstrated in both the apoE(-/-)iNOS(-/-) and apoE(-/-) groups. CONCLUSION: Elevated lipid metabolism and inflammatory/apoptosis parameters suggest a potentially significant role of apoE in preeclampsia pathology, as well as a relationship between iNOS and preeclampsia progression.","['Mao, Luyi', 'Zhou, Qiongjie', 'Zhou, Shufeng', 'Wilbur, Rhonda R', 'Li, Xiaotian']","['Mao L', 'Zhou Q', 'Zhou S', 'Wilbur RR', 'Li X']","['Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Apolipoproteins E)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Lipids)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nos2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apolipoproteins E/*metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Blood Pressure', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Inflammation', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipids/blood', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/*metabolism', 'Placenta/metabolism', 'Pre-Eclampsia/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Pregnancy']",2013/03/09 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/03/09 06:00'],"['2012/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0058168 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-24297 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e58168. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0058168.

A facile surface-mediated nucleic acid delivery by lipoplexes is prepared in a microwell array, which combines the advantages of lipoplexes as an efficient carrier system, surface-mediated delivery, and the control of surface topography. Uniform disc-like lipoplexes containing nucleic acids are formed in the microwell array with a diameter of approximately 818 nm and thickness of approximately 195 nm. The microwell array-mediated delivery of lipoplexes containing FAM-oligodeoxynucleotides is approximately 18.6 and approximately 10.6 times more efficient than the conventional transfection method in an adherent cell line (A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells) and a suspension cell line (KG-1a acute myelogenous leukemia cells), respectively. MicroRNA-29b is then used as a model nucleic acid to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of lipoplexes delivered by the microwell array. Compared to conventional transfection methods, the effective therapeutic dosage of microRNA-29b is reduced from the microgram level to the nanogram level by lipoplexes prepared in the microwell array. The microwell array is also a very flexible platform. Both nucleic acid therapeutics and imaging reagents are incorporated in lipoplexes and successfully delivered to A549 cells, demonstrating its potential applications in theranostic medicine.","['Wu, Yun', 'Terp, Megan Cavanaugh', 'Kwak, Kwang Joo', 'Gallego-Perez, Daniel', 'Nana-Sinkam, Serge P', 'Lee, L James']","['Wu Y', 'Terp MC', 'Kwak KJ', 'Gallego-Perez D', 'Nana-Sinkam SP', 'Lee LJ']","['Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center for Affordable, Nanoengineering, The Ohio State University, 174 W 18th Avenue, Room 1012, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Small,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",101235338,"['0 (Carbocyanines)', '0 (ID1 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (cyanine dye 5)']",IM,"['Carbocyanines/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Transfer Techniques/*instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Lipids/*chemistry', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Nucleic Acids/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Quantum Dots', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Surface Properties']",2013/03/09 06:00,2014/05/20 06:00,['2013/03/09 06:00'],"['2012/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/smll.201202258 [doi]'],ppublish,Small. 2013 Jul 8;9(13):2358-67. doi: 10.1002/smll.201202258.

As a result of two independent RNA interference (RNAi) screens, we identified pathway dependence on a member of the Janus-activated kinase (JAK) tyrosine kinase family, TYK2, and its downstream effector STAT1, in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Gene knockdown experiments consistently showed TYK2 dependence in both T-ALL primary specimens and cell lines, and a small-molecule inhibitor of JAK activity induced T-ALL cell death. Activation of this TYK2-STAT1 pathway in T-ALL cell lines occurs by gain-of-function TYK2 mutations or activation of interleukin (IL)-10 receptor signaling, and this pathway mediates T-ALL cell survival through upregulation of the antiapoptotic protein BCL2. These findings indicate that in many T-ALL cases, the leukemic cells are dependent upon the TYK2-STAT1-BCL2 pathway for continued survival, supporting the development of molecular therapies targeting TYK2 and other components of this pathway. SIGNIFICANCE: In recent years, ""pathway dependence"" has been revealed in specific types of human cancer, which can be important because they pinpoint proteins that are particularly vulnerable to antitumor-targeted inhibition (so-called Achilles' heel proteins). Here, we use RNAi technology to identify a novel oncogenic pathway that involves aberrant activation of the TYK2 tyrosine kinase and its downstream substrate, STAT1, which ultimately promotes T-ALL cell survival through the upregulation of BCL2 expression","['Sanda, Takaomi', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Gutierrez, Alejandro', 'Ngo, Vu N', 'Glover, Jason', 'Chang, Bill H', 'Yost, Arla', 'Ma, Wenxue', 'Fleischman, Angela G', 'Zhou, Wenjun', 'Yang, Yandan', 'Kleppe, Maria', 'Ahn, Yebin', 'Tatarek, Jessica', 'Kelliher, Michelle A', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Moriggl, Richard', 'Muller, Mathias', 'Gray, Nathanael S', 'Jamieson, Catriona H M', 'Weng, Andrew P', 'Staudt, Louis M', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Sanda T', 'Tyner JW', 'Gutierrez A', 'Ngo VN', 'Glover J', 'Chang BH', 'Yost A', 'Ma W', 'Fleischman AG', 'Zhou W', 'Yang Y', 'Kleppe M', 'Ahn Y', 'Tatarek J', 'Kelliher MA', 'Neuberg DS', 'Levine RL', 'Moriggl R', 'Muller M', 'Gray NS', 'Jamieson CH', 'Weng AP', 'Staudt LM', 'Druker BJ', 'Look AT']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '87LA6FU830 (tofacitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TYK2 Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",2013/03/09 06:00,2013/09/28 06:00,['2013/03/09 06:00'],"['2013/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['2159-8290.CD-12-0504 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-12-0504 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2013 May;3(5):564-77. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-12-0504.

Since most adult and some adolescent survivors of childhood cancer will receive their long-term care from a primary care physician, we sought to determine family physicians' comfort with caring for this population. METHODS: A survey was mailed to 2,520 United States (US) and Canadian family physicians to assess their attitudes and knowledge regarding the care of adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood cancer. RESULTS: One thousand one hundred twenty-four family physicians responded (704 US, 420 Canadian). Median age was 53 years; 63 % were men; 81 % had cared for </=2 childhood cancer survivors in the past 5 years. Of those who had cared for a survivor, 48 % had never or almost never received a treatment summary from the referring cancer center; 85 % preferred to care for survivors in consultation with a cancer center-based physician or long-term follow-up program. Only 33, 27, and 23 % of respondents were very comfortable caring for survivors of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia or osteosarcoma, respectively. Only 16, 10, and 74 % of respondents correctly identified the guideline recommended surveillance for secondary breast cancer, cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism in response to a vignette describing a Hodgkin lymphoma survivor. Respondents rated access to clinical care guidelines and receipt of a patient-specific letter from specialists with surveillance recommendations as the modalities most likely to assist them in caring for survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Most family physicians are willing to care for childhood cancer survivors in consultation with a cancer center, and with specific tools to facilitate this care. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Adult and adolescent survivors of childhood cancer who receive their follow-up care from a family physician must be empowered to choose a physician who is comfortable with caring for survivors. Further, the survivor must ensure that their physician has access to a treatment summary as well as to patient-specific recommendations for surveillance for late effects of cancer therapy.","['Nathan, Paul Craig', 'Daugherty, Christopher Keller', 'Wroblewski, Kristen Elizabeth', 'Kigin, Mackenzie Louise', 'Stewart, Tom Vernon', 'Hlubocky, Fay Jarmila', 'Grunfeld, Eva', 'Del Giudice, Marie Elisabeth', 'Ward, Leigh-Anne Evelyn', 'Galliher, James Mahlon', 'Oeffinger, Kevin Charles', 'Henderson, Tara Olive']","['Nathan PC', 'Daugherty CK', 'Wroblewski KE', 'Kigin ML', 'Stewart TV', 'Hlubocky FJ', 'Grunfeld E', 'Del Giudice ME', 'Ward LA', 'Galliher JM', 'Oeffinger KC', 'Henderson TO']","['Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, Canada. paul.nathan@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Adolescent Health Services/statistics & numerical data', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms/epidemiology/psychology/rehabilitation', 'Physicians, Family/*education/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/statistics & numerical data"", '*Survivors/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/09 06:00,2014/04/01 06:00,['2013/03/09 06:00'],"['2012/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-013-0271-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2013 Sep;7(3):275-82. doi: 10.1007/s11764-013-0271-0.

Exposure to arsenic causes renal cancer. Resveratrol is a well-known polyphenolic compound that is reported to reduce As(2)O(3)-induced cardiotoxicity. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of resveratrol on As(2)O(3)-induced nephrotoxicity and arsenic metabolism. Chinese Dragon-Li cats were injected with 1 mg/kg As(2)O(3) on alternate days; resveratrol (3 mg/kg) was administered via the forearm vein 1 h before the As(2)O(3) treatment. On the sixth day, the cats were killed to determine the histological renal damage, renal function, the accumulation of arsenic, and antioxidant activities in the kidney. Urine samples were taken for arsenic speciation. In the resveratrol + As(2)O(3)-treated group, activities of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase, the ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione, the total arsenic concentrations, and the percentage of methylated arsenic in urine were significantly increased. The concentrations of renal malondialdehyde, reactive oxygen species, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and renal arsenic accumulation were significantly decreased and reduced renal morphologic injury was observed compared with the As(2)O(3)-treated group. These results demonstrate that resveratrol could significantly scavenge reactive oxygen species, inhibit As(2)O(3)-induced oxidative damage, and significantly attenuate the accumulation of arsenic in renal tissues by facilitating As(2)O(3) metabolism. These data suggest that use of resveratrol as postremission therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia as well as adjunctive therapy in patients with exposure to arsenic may decrease arsenic nephrotoxicity.","['Yu, Meiling', 'Xue, Jiangdong', 'Li, Yijing', 'Zhang, Weiqian', 'Ma, Dexing', 'Liu, Lian', 'Zhang, Zhigang']","['Yu M', 'Xue J', 'Li Y', 'Zhang W', 'Ma D', 'Liu L', 'Zhang Z']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, Northeast Agricultural University, 59 Mucai Street, Harbin 150030, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/urine', 'Blood Urea Nitrogen', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cats', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Cytoprotection', 'Deoxyguanosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Kidney/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Kidney Diseases/blood/chemically induced/pathology/*prevention & control/urine', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Oxides/*toxicity/urine', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism']",2013/03/09 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/03/09 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00204-013-1026-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2013 Jun;87(6):1025-35. doi: 10.1007/s00204-013-1026-4.

We evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of anti-CD45 RIT using (211)At in a disseminated murine AML model. Biodistribution studies in leukemic SJL/J mice showed excellent localization of (211)At-anti-murine CD45 mAb (30F11) to marrow and spleen within 24 hours (18% and 79% injected dose per gram of tissue [ID/g], respectively), with lower kidney and lung uptake (8.4% and 14% ID/g, respectively). In syngeneic HSCT studies, (211)At-B10-30F11 RIT improved the median survival of leukemic mice in a dose-dependent fashion (123, 101, 61, and 37 days given 24, 20, 12, and 0 microCi, respectively). This approach had minimal toxicity with nadir white blood cell counts >2.7 K/microL 2 weeks after HSCT and recovery by 4 weeks.

Our goal was to establish and validate reference panels to mitigate the interlaboratory imprecision of quantitative BCR-ABL1 measurements and to facilitate global standardization on the international scale (IS). METHODS: Four-level secondary reference panels were manufactured under controlled and validated processes with synthetic Armored RNA Quant molecules (Asuragen) calibrated to reference standards from the WHO and the NIST. Performance was evaluated in IS reference laboratories and with non-IS-standardized RT-qPCR methods. RESULTS: For most methods, percent ratios for BCR-ABL1 e13a2 and e14a2 relative to ABL1 or BCR were robust at 4 different levels and linear over 3 logarithms, from 10% to 0.01% on the IS. The intraassay and interassay imprecision was <2-fold overall. Performance was stable across 3 consecutive lots, in multiple laboratories, and over a period of 18 months to date. International field trials demonstrated the commutability of the reagents and their accurate alignment to the IS within the intra- and interlaboratory imprecision of IS-standardized methods. CONCLUSIONS: The synthetic calibrator panels are robust, reproducibly manufactured, analytically calibrated to the WHO primary standards, and compatible with most BCR-ABL1 RT-qPCR assay designs. The broad availability of secondary reference reagents will further facilitate interlaboratory comparative studies and independent quality assessment programs, which are of paramount importance for worldwide standardization of BCR-ABL1 monitoring results and the optimization of current and new therapeutic approaches for chronic myeloid leukemia.","['White, Helen E', 'Hedges, John', 'Bendit, Israel', 'Branford, Susan', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Hughes, Timothy', 'Kamel-Reid, Suzanne', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Modur, Vijay', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Pagnano, Katia B', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Radich, Jerry', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Labourier, Emmanuel']","['White HE', 'Hedges J', 'Bendit I', 'Branford S', 'Colomer D', 'Hochhaus A', 'Hughes T', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Kim DW', 'Modur V', 'Muller MC', 'Pagnano KB', 'Pane F', 'Radich J', 'Cross NC', 'Labourier E']","['National Genetics Reference Laboratory Wessex, Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,,IM,"['*Genes, abl', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Reference Standards', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*standards', '*Severity of Illness Index']",2013/03/09 06:00,2013/08/06 06:00,['2013/03/09 06:00'],"['2013/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['clinchem.2012.196477 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2012.196477 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2013 Jun;59(6):938-48. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2012.196477.

Another important step in the control of eukaryotic gene expression is the nucleocytoplasmic mRNA transport. Most cellular mRNAs are exported via the TAP/Nxt complex of proteins. However, some mRNAs are transported by a different mechanism involving the nuclear export receptor CRM1. Treatment of DLD-1 cells with the CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) or anti-CRM1 siRNAs reduced cytokine-induced iNOS expression. We could demonstrate that the iNOS mRNA is exported from the nucleus in a CRM1-dependent manner. Since CRM1 itself does not possess any RNA binding affinity, an adapter protein is needed to mediate CRM1-dependent mRNA export. Western blot experiments showed that the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E is retained in the nucleus after LMB treatment. Blockade of eIF4E by ribavirin or overexpression of the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) decreased iNOS expression due to reduced iNOS mRNA export from the nucleus. Transfection experiments provide evidence that the 3'-untranslated region of the iNOS mRNA is involved in eIF4E-mediated iNOS mRNA transport. In summary, CRM1 and eIF4E seem to play an important role in the nucleocytoplasmic export of human iNOS mRNA.","['Bollmann, Franziska', 'Fechir, Katrin', 'Nowag, Sebastian', 'Koch, Kathrin', 'Art, Julia', 'Kleinert, Hartmut', 'Pautz, Andrea']","['Bollmann F', 'Fechir K', 'Nowag S', 'Koch K', 'Art J', 'Kleinert H', 'Pautz A']","['Department of Pharmacology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, D 55101 Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nitric Oxide,Nitric oxide : biology and chemistry,9709307,"['0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/*metabolism', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', '*RNA Transport', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Ribavirin/pharmacology']",2013/03/09 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/03/09 06:00'],"['2012/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S1089-8603(13)00097-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.niox.2013.02.083 [doi]']",ppublish,Nitric Oxide. 2013 Apr 1;30:49-59. doi: 10.1016/j.niox.2013.02.083.

The present study was designed to map the expression of PDE3A/B in the forebrain and define the time course of PDE3 expression in the ischemic boundary zone after ischemia. The number of PDE3A-positive cells (neurons and endothelial cells) remained unchanged, while PDE3B-positive cells gradually increased after ischemia/reperfusion. In the corpus callosum, PDE3B was expressed in oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and astrocytes. PDE3B-expressing astrocytes showed gradual increase after ischemia/reperfusion. In the cortex, the majority of PDE3B-expressing cells before ischemia were neurons, though few were astrocytes. Ischemic insult resulted in gradual increase in PDE3B-expressing astrocytes and neurons, with larger increase in astrocytes. Expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2) was detected in pCREB-positive cells, not in PDE3B-positive cells. Our results demonstrated that ischemic insult increased PDE3B expression, but not PDE3A, and changed the number and type of cells in a time-dependent manner. The variation of PDE3B-expression in the brain might play a crucial pathophysiological role, and regulation of PDE3B production might protect against ischemic brain damage.","['Mitome-Mishima, Yumiko', 'Miyamoto, Nobukazu', 'Tanaka, Ryota', 'Oishi, Hidenori', 'Arai, Hajime', 'Hattori, Nobutaka', 'Urabe, Takao']","['Mitome-Mishima Y', 'Miyamoto N', 'Tanaka R', 'Oishi H', 'Arai H', 'Hattori N', 'Urabe T']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Neurosci Res,Neuroscience research,8500749,"['0 (Aif1 protein, mouse)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3)', 'EC 4.2.1.11 (Phosphopyruvate Hydratase)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Brain/*enzymology/pathology', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'CREB-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Cerebral Cortex/enzymology/pathology', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation/physiology', 'Corpus Callosum/enzymology/pathology', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*physiology', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microfilament Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphopyruvate Hydratase/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Reperfusion']",2013/03/09 06:00,2013/10/01 06:00,['2013/03/09 06:00'],"['2012/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-0102(13)00040-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neures.2013.02.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurosci Res. 2013 Apr;75(4):340-8. doi: 10.1016/j.neures.2013.02.006.

We investigated the mechanism of chaperone-mediated RNA folding by following the time-resolved dimerization of the packaging domain of a retroviral RNA at nucleotide resolution. In the absence of the nucleocapsid (NC) chaperone, dimerization proceeded through multiple, slow-folding intermediates. In the presence of NC, dimerization occurred rapidly through a single structural intermediate. The RNA binding domain of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 protein, a structurally unrelated chaperone, also accelerated dimerization. Both chaperones interacted primarily with guanosine residues. Replacing guanosine with more weakly pairing inosine yielded an RNA that folded rapidly without a facilitating chaperone. These results show that RNA chaperones can simplify RNA folding landscapes by weakening intramolecular interactions involving guanosine and explain many RNA chaperone activities.","['Grohman, Jacob K', 'Gorelick, Robert J', 'Lickwar, Colin R', 'Lieb, Jason D', 'Bower, Brian D', 'Znosko, Brent M', 'Weeks, Kevin M']","['Grohman JK', 'Gorelick RJ', 'Lickwar CR', 'Lieb JD', 'Bower BD', 'Znosko BM', 'Weeks KM']","['Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3290, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nucleocapsid Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '5A614L51CT (Inosine)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Dimerization', 'Guanosine/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B/chemistry/metabolism', 'Inosine/chemistry/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Nucleocapsid Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry/metabolism']",2013/03/09 06:00,2013/04/25 06:00,['2013/03/09 06:00'],"['2013/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['science.1230715 [pii]', '10.1126/science.1230715 [doi]']",ppublish,Science. 2013 Apr 12;340(6129):190-5. doi: 10.1126/science.1230715.

Eosinophil activation and survival are profoundly influenced by interleukin 5 (IL-5) and its receptor, IL-5R. In patients susceptible to allergic disorders, IL-5 receptor alpha (IL5RA) polymorphisms have been reported; however, an association with AERD remains unclear. We hypothesize that IL5RA polymorphisms may contribute to eosinophil activation in AERD patients. We recruited 139 AERD patients, 171 aspirin-tolerant asthma patients and 160 normal controls. IL5RA polymorphisms (-5993G>A, -5567C>G and -5091G>A) were genotyped and functional activity of polymorphism was assessed by luciferase reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). There was no significant difference in the genotype frequency of the three polymorphisms among the three groups. AERD patients carrying the AA genotype at -5993G>A had a significantly higher presence of serum-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to staphylococcal enterotoxin A (P=0.008) than those with the GG/GA genotype. In vitro, the -5993A allele had a higher promoter activity compared with the -5993G allele in human mast cell (HMC-1; P=0.030) and human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60; P=0.013) cells. In EMSA, a -5993A probe produced a specific shifted band than the -5993G had. These findings suggest that a functional polymorphism in IL5RA may contribute to eosinophil and mast cell activation along with specific IgE responses to staphylococcal enterotoxin A in AERD patients.","['Losol, Purevsuren', 'Kim, Seung-Hyun', 'Shin, Yoo Seob', 'Ye, Young Min', 'Park, Hae-Sim']","['Losol P', 'Kim SH', 'Shin YS', 'Ye YM', 'Park HS']","['Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['0 (IL5RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-5 Receptor alpha Subunit)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aspirin/*adverse effects', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-5 Receptor alpha Subunit/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Respiration Disorders/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2013/03/09 06:00,2013/10/26 06:00,['2013/03/09 06:00'],"['2013/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['emm201324 [pii]', '10.1038/emm.2013.24 [doi]']",epublish,Exp Mol Med. 2013 Mar 8;45:e14. doi: 10.1038/emm.2013.24.,20130308,,PMC3641394,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether CPTH6 is able to affect autophagy. By using several human tumor cell lines with different origins we demonstrated that CPTH6 treatment induced, in a dose-dependent manner, a significant increase in autophagic features, as imaged by electron microscopy, immunoblotting analysis of membrane-bound form of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3B-II) levels and by appearance of typical LC3B-II-associated autophagosomal puncta. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of elevated markers of autophagy induced by CPTH6 treatment, we silenced the expression of several proteins acting at different steps of autophagy. We found that the effect of CPTH6 on autophagy developed through a noncanonical mechanism that did not require beclin-1-dependent nucleation, but involved Atg-7-mediated elongation of autophagosomal membranes. Strikingly, a combined treatment of CPTH6 with late-stage autophagy inhibitors, such as chloroquine and bafilomycin A1, demonstrates that under basal condition CPTH6 reduces autophagosome turnover through an impairment of their degradation pathway, rather than enhancing autophagosome formation, as confirmed by immunofluorescence experiments. According to these results, CPTH6-induced enhancement of autophagy substrate p62 and NBR1 protein levels confirms a blockage of autophagic cargo degradation. In addition, CPTH6 inhibited autophagosome maturation and compounds having high structural similarities with CPTH6 produced similar effects on the autophagic pathway. Finally, the evidence that CPTH6 treatment decreased alpha-tubulin acetylation and failed to increase autophagic markers in cells in which acetyltransferase ATAT1 expression was silenced indicates a possible role of alpha-tubulin acetylation in CPTH6-induced alteration in autophagy. Overall, CPTH6 could be a valuable agent for the treatment of cancer and should be further studied as a possible antineoplastic agent.","['Ragazzoni, Y', 'Desideri, M', 'Gabellini, C', 'De Luca, T', 'Carradori, S', 'Secci, D', 'Nescatelli, R', 'Candiloro, A', 'Condello, M', 'Meschini, S', 'Del Bufalo, D', 'Trisciuoglio, D']","['Ragazzoni Y', 'Desideri M', 'Gabellini C', 'De Luca T', 'Carradori S', 'Secci D', 'Nescatelli R', 'Candiloro A', 'Condello M', 'Meschini S', 'Del Bufalo D', 'Trisciuoglio D']","['Experimental Chemotherapy Laboratory, Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"[""0 (3-methylcyclopentylidene-(4-(4'-chlorophenyl)thiazol-2-yl)hydrazone)"", '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (NBR1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SQSTM1 protein, human)', '0 (Sequestosome-1 Protein)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Atg7 protein, human)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Autophagy-Related Protein 7)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 7', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Sequestosome-1 Protein', 'Thiazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes/metabolism']",2013/03/09 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2013/03/09 06:00'],"['2013/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201353 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.53 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Mar 7;4:e524. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.53.,20130307,,PMC3613831,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An impaired DDR leads to tumorigenesis that is accelerated when programmed cell death is prevented. Loss of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated)-mediated DDR in mice results in T-cell leukemia driven by accumulation of DNA damage accrued during normal T-cell development. Pro-apoptotic BH3-only Bid is a substrate of Atm, and Bid phosphorylation is required for proper cell cycle checkpoint control and regulation of hematopoietic function. In this report, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, loss of Bid increases the latency of leukemogenesis in Atm-/- mice. Bid-/-Atm-/- mice display impaired checkpoint control and increased cell death of DN3 thymocytes. Loss of Bid thus inhibits T-cell tumorigenesis by increasing clearance of damaged cells, and preventing propagation of deleterious mutations.","['Biswas, S', 'Shi, Q', 'Wernick, A', 'Aiello, A', 'Zinkel, S S']","['Biswas S', 'Shi Q', 'Wernick A', 'Aiello A', 'Zinkel SS']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Bid protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Trp53bp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/*deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Thymocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1']",2013/03/09 06:00,2013/10/23 06:00,['2013/03/09 06:00'],"['2013/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201316 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2013.16 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2013 Jul;20(7):869-77. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2013.16.

Previous estimates range from 2.5% to 30.5% and are usually based on clinical examination. This may cause an under diagnosis of EMD as not all extramedullary manifestations are easily detectable. Few recent studies have used positron emission tomography (PET) scans for diagnosing EMD in patients AML. METHOD: During a 9-month period, newly diagnosed patients with AML who were candidates for intensive chemotherapy were 18F-Fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) PET-scanned prior to induction treatment. We compared the prevalence of EMD diagnosed by PET scans and by clinical examination. Subsequent PET scans following induction chemotherapy were performed for response evaluation of EMD. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were included in the study. 18-F-FDG PET scans revealed more than twice as many patients with EMD than found by clinical examination (65% vs. 31%).

However, ER stress-inducing agents can also induce autophagy, a survival strategy of cancer cells. Therefore, by inhibiting autophagy we can increase the efficacy of the ER stress-inducing agents. Nelfinavir, a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor with anti-cancer properties, can induce ER stress. Nelfinavir's effects on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are yet to be elucidated. Herein we demonstrate that nelfinavir induces ER morphological changes and stress response, along with an autophagic protective strategy. Our data reveal that chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, significantly increases nelfinavir cytotoxicity. These results identify a novel strategy potentially effective in CLL treatment, by repositioning two well-known drugs as a combinatorial therapy with anti-cancer properties.","['Mahoney, Emilia', 'Maddocks, Kami', 'Flynn, Joseph', 'Jones, Jeffrey', 'Cole, Sara L', 'Zhang, Xiaoli', 'Byrd, John C', 'Johnson, Amy J']","['Mahoney E', 'Maddocks K', 'Flynn J', 'Jones J', 'Cole SL', 'Zhang X', 'Byrd JC', 'Johnson AJ']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University , Columbus, OH , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', 'HO3OGH5D7I (Nelfinavir)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Nelfinavir/pharmacology']",2013/03/09 06:00,2014/06/10 06:00,['2013/03/09 06:00'],"['2013/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.781168 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Dec;54(12):2685-92. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.781168.

Anthracyclines are known to inhibit cancer cell proliferation by several mechanisms, but it is well established that these antibiotics intercalate between the nucleotides of DNA and RNA and interfere with the replication of these nucleic acids. In addition, anthracyclines inhibit the topoisomerase II group of enzymes that have an important role in DNA replication (2). Doxorubicin, another anthracycline antibiotic with a structure and mechanism of action similar to that of daunorubicin, has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of several types of cancers, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, Wilms' tumor, neuroblastoma, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, breast carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, transitional cell bladder carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, Hodgkin's disease, malignant lymphoma, and bronchogenic carcinoma. Several radiochemicals, such as [(99m)Tc]-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile ([(99m)Tc]-MIBI), [(99m)]Tc-tetrofosmin, and [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]-FDG), are often used in the clinic with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT; for noninvasive imaging with [(99m)Tc]-MIBI and [(99m)]Tc-tetrofosmin) and positron emission tomography (for imaging with [(18)F]-FDG) to detect and monitor cancerous tumors. However, these tracers are of limited use for the detection and monitoring of neoplastic lesions because they often generate false-positive results, as detailed elsewhere (3). Transformed cells have a characteristically high proliferation rate and consequently exhibit a higher rate of DNA synthesis compared with the normal cells. Therefore, cells with an elevated rate of DNA synthesis would be expected to intercalate high levels of anthracycline antibiotics within the nucleic acid structure. Based on this assumption, Kumar et al. evaluated the use of (99m)Tc-labeled doxorubicin for the noninvasive detection of tumors in mice, and the investigators showed that the tracer was probably suitable for visualization of the lesions with scintigraphy in the rodents (3). Faheem et al. investigated the biodistribution of (99m)Tc-labeled daunorubicin ([(99m)Tc]-daunorubicin) in normal rats, and scintigraphy was used to study the biodistribution of this radiolabeled compound in a rabbit (1). Results obtained from studies performed with [(99m)Tc]-daunorubicin are presented in this chapter.","['Chopra, Arvind']",['Chopra A'],,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Bethesda (MD),,,,,,,2013/03/08 06:00,2013/03/08 06:00,,,['NBK126077 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,['NLM'],"['[99mTc]Daunorubicin', 'Compound', 'DNA; DNA topoisomerase II alpha and beta', 'Nucleic acids; enzyme', 'Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT); gamma planar imaging', '99mTc']",,,,,,,20130308,['20130228'],['20130201'],['National Center for Biotechnology Information (US)'],['Molecular Imaging and Contrast Agent Database (MICAD)'],['2013/03/08 06:00'],,,,,,

Here, we report that (S)-2, a novel hydroxamate-based HDACi, shown previously to be effective against acute myeloid leukemia cells, was also a potent inducer of apoptosis/differentiation in human prostate LNCaP and PC3 cancer cells. In LNCaP cells (S)-2 was capable of triggering H3/H4 histone acetylation, H2AX phosphorylation as a marker of DNA damage and producing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Consistently, (S)-2 led to enhanced expression of both the protein and mRNA p21 levels in LNCaP cells but, contrary to SAHA, not in normal non-tumorigenic prostate PNT1A cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that (S)-2-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells developed through the cleavage of pro-caspase 9 and 3 and of poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase accompanied by the dose-dependent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Indeed, the addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk greatly reduced drug-mediated apoptosis while the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine was virtually ineffective. Importantly, preliminary data with nude mice xenografted with LNCaP cells showed that (S)-2 prompted a decrease in the tumor volume and an increase in H2AX phosphorylation within the cancer cells. Moreover, the highly metastatic prostate cancer PC3 cells were also sensitive to (S)-2 that: i) induced growth arrest and moderate apoptosis; ii) steered cells towards differentiation and neutral lipid accumulation; iii) reduced cell invasiveness potential by decreasing the amount of MMP-9 activity and up-regulating TIMP-1 expression; and iv) inhibited cell motility and migration through the Matrigel. Overall, (S)-2 has proven to be a powerful HDACi capable of inducing growth arrest, cell death and/or differentiation of LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells and, due to its low toxicity and efficacy in vivo, might also be of clinical interest to support conventional prostate cancer therapy.","['Laurenzana, Anna', 'Balliu, Manjola', 'Cellai, Cristina', 'Romanelli, Maria Novella', 'Paoletti, Francesco']","['Laurenzana A', 'Balliu M', 'Cellai C', 'Romanelli MN', 'Paoletti F']","['Department of Experimental Pathology and Oncology, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histones/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Vorinostat', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2013/03/08 06:00,2013/08/28 06:00,['2013/03/08 06:00'],"['2012/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0058267 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-10573 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e58267. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0058267.

We have previously shown that the transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) is an adaptor protein of the (P)RR. Furthermore, recent publications suggest that major functions of the (P)RR are mediated ligand-independently by its transmembrane and intracellular part, which acts as an accessory protein of V-ATPases. The transcriptome and recruitmentome downstream of the V-ATPase function and PLZF in the context of the (P)RR are currently unknown. Therefore, we performed a set of microarray and chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip experiments using siRNA against the (P)RR, stable overexpression of PLZF, the PLZF translocation inhibitor genistein and the specific V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin to dissect transcriptional pathways downstream of the (P)RR. We were able to identify distinct and overlapping genetic signatures as well as novel real-time PCR-validated target genes of the different molecular functions of the (P)RR.

However, there is wide variability with regards to need for therapy, time to progressive disease, and treatment response. This clinical variability is due, in part, to biological heterogeneity between individual patients' leukemias. While much has been learned about this biological variation using genomic approaches, it is unclear whether such efforts have sufficiently evaluated biological and clinical heterogeneity in CLL. METHODS: To study the extent of genomic variability in CLL and the biological and clinical attributes of genomic classification in CLL, we evaluated 893 unique CLL samples from fifteen publicly available gene expression profiling datasets. We used unsupervised approaches to divide the data into subgroups, evaluated the biological pathways and genetic aberrations that were associated with the subgroups, and compared prognostic and clinical outcome data between the subgroups. RESULTS: Using an unsupervised approach, we determined that approximately 600 CLL samples are needed to define the spectrum of diversity in CLL genomic expression. We identified seven genomically-defined CLL subgroups that have distinct biological properties, are associated with specific chromosomal deletions and amplifications, and have marked differences in molecular prognostic markers and clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that investigations focusing on small numbers of patient samples likely provide a biased outlook on CLL biology. These findings may have important implications in identifying patients who should be treated with specific targeted therapies, which could have efficacy against CLL cells that rely on specific biological pathways.","['Friedman, Daphne R', 'Lucas, Joseph E', 'Weinberg, J Brice']","['Friedman DR', 'Lucas JE', 'Weinberg JB']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA. daphne.friedman@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",2013/03/08 06:00,2013/09/11 06:00,['2013/03/08 06:00'],"['2012/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0057356 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-33928 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e57356. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0057356.

This multicenter, noncomparative, open-label phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous omacetaxine in CML patients with resistance or intolerance to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs); results in patients in chronic phase are reported here. Patients received subcutaneous omacetaxine 1.25 mg/m(2) twice daily days 1-14 every 28 days until hematologic response (up to a maximum of six cycles), then days 1-7 every 28 days as maintenance. Primary endpoints were rates of hematologic response lasting >8 weeks and major cytogenetic response (MCyR). Forty-six patients were enrolled: all had received imatinib, 83% had received dasatinib, and 57% nilotinib. A median 4.5 cycles of omacetaxine were administered (range, 1-36). Hematologic response was achieved or maintained in 31 patients (67%); median response duration was 7.0 months. Ten patients (22%) achieved MCyR, including 2 (4%) complete cytogenetic responses. Median progression-free survival was 7.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.9-8.9 months], and overall survival was 30.1 months (95% CI, 20.3 months-not reached). Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity included thrombocytopenia (54%), neutropenia (48%), and anemia (33%). Nonhematologic adverse events were predominantly grade 1/2 and included diarrhea (44%), nausea (30%), fatigue (24%), pyrexia (20%), headache (20%), and asthenia (20%).

The proportions of leukemic cells in CSF samples were assessed by flow cytometry (FCM). Patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement at diagnosis (FCM+) showed predominantly a T-ALL, and higher percentages of known negative prognostic factors: high risk group, higher white blood cell counts, normal karyotype, and the BCR-ABL fusion gene. No differences in relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were observed between FCM+ versus FCM- at diagnosis. Patients with CNS involvement during therapy showed significantly older age, and higher frequencies of T-cell leukemia. We found a significantly higher RFS in patients with FCM+ during therapy. The detection of subclinical CNS disease by FCM during maintenance was associated with significantly lower 3-years RFS and 3-years OS.

Sixteen patients were treated before June 2002, and 83 patients were treated from June 2002. A modified form of UKALL XII/ECOG E2993 with pulsed dexamethasone in induction phase one (modified UKALL) was the main therapy from June 2002 (71/83). The median age was 28 years. Fifty-eight percent had pre-B ALL where 36 % of them were Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+). Overall, complete remission (CR) rate was 86.7 % which was significantly inferior for patients with white blood cell count 30-100 x 10(9)/l (p = 0.009), therapy before June 2002 (p = 0.02), pregnancy (p = 0.005), CNS leukemia (p = 0.028), and unknown karyotype (p = 0.004). With a median follow-up of 11.8 months (0.49-126 months), the estimated overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) at 3 years were 50.6 and 28.7 %, respectively. OS and EFS were significantly inferior for patients not in CR after induction, age >20 years, Ph+, unknown karyotype and therapy before June 2002. In addition, CR, OS and EFS were significantly superior (p = 0.004, p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively) for therapy with our modified UKALL protocol compared to Tawam protocol (main therapy before June 2002). In conclusion, the outcome of treatment for ALL at our institute is encouraging with significant improvement in the outcome of older adolescents and young adults when using high-intensity chemotherapy. This suggests that such an approach is feasible in developing countries in spite of some limitations including lack of stem cell transplantation service.","['Hassan, Inaam B', 'Kristensen, Jorgen', 'Alizadeh, Hussain', 'Bernsen, Roos']","['Hassan IB', 'Kristensen J', 'Alizadeh H', 'Bernsen R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, PO Box 17666, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates. inaambh@uaeu.ac.ae']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'UKALL X protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Cancer Care Facilities/*trends', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods/*trends', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/*administration & dosage', 'Pulse Therapy, Drug/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United Arab Emirates/epidemiology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/08 06:00,2013/10/25 06:00,['2013/03/08 06:00'],"['2012/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-013-0519-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2013 Jun;30(2):519. doi: 10.1007/s12032-013-0519-6.

In clinical studies, indirubin seldom caused major side-effects. However, the functional effect of indirubin on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of indirubin-3'-monoxime (I3M) on the ALL cell line JM1 and the CML cell line K562 (control). The anti-leukemia effects and mechanisms of I3M were similar on ALL and CML cells. I3M significantly and dose-dependently decreased cell viability. The G2/M cell cycle phase was arrested and the sub-G1 proportion was relatively increased. In addition, caspase-3 activation led to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 cleavage and the progression of apoptosis. Notably, I3M induced autophagy. However, I3M had no effect on necrosis in either cell line. We specifically found that I3M only marginally affected the survival of primary mature lymphocytes, and was not cytotoxic to granulocytes. Since I3M induced apoptosis and autophagy in human lymphocytic leukemia cells and caused few side-effects in healthy lymphocytes and granulocytes, I3M may be useful for clinical anti-ALL therapy.","['Lee, Ming-Yang', 'Liu, Yi-Wen', 'Chen, Ming-Ho', 'Wu, Jin-Yi', 'Ho, Hsing-Ying', 'Wang, Qwa-Fun', 'Chuang, Jing-Jing']","['Lee MY', 'Liu YW', 'Chen MH', 'Wu JY', 'Ho HY', 'Wang QF', 'Chuang JJ']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ditmanson Medical Foundation ChiaYi Christian Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Oximes)', ""0 (indirubin-3'-monoxime)"", 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'G2 Phase/drug effects/genetics', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Necrosis', 'Oximes/*pharmacology', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology']",2013/03/08 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/03/08 06:00'],"['2012/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2013.2334 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2013 May;29(5):2072-8. doi: 10.3892/or.2013.2334.

The prognosis of ATL patients remains poor despite the availability of a number of clinical chemotherapy drugs. In addition, HTLV1infected and ATL cells possess an intrinsic resistance to anticancer drugs. 2'Deoxy2'betafluoro4'azidocytidine (FNC) is a novel pyrimidine analog that is efficiently phosphorylated by cellular kinases and is a substrate for RNA and DNA polymerases. In the present study, the antiviral potential of FNC was investigated in HTLV1infected cell lines. Following FNC treatment, the HTLV1infected cells underwent G1 or S phase cell cycle arrest. FNC was also observed to reduce cell growth of the HTLV1infected cell lines in a dosedependent manner. Notably, FNC was found to efficiently inhibit the expression of the viral proteins, Tax and p19Gag, in a dose and timedependent manner. Treatment with FNC and the protein biosynthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX), accelerated the inhibition of viral protein synthesis in the HTLV1infected cells.

The aim of this study was to assess whether the induction of MAPK-mediated effects contributes to the therapeutic value of combination sorafenib and daunorubicin (DNR) treatment. Herein, we found that DNR increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) in K562 cells. ERK1/2 activity was blocked by either the mitogen-induced extracellular kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 or a multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib. Of note, sorafenib sensitized K562 to DNR by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner which was through blocking the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Moreover, K562 cells transfected with a constitutively active MEK2DD plasmid showed increasing IC50 values following DNR treatment compared with control cells. Combination of DNR with MEK inhibitor U0126 synergistically inhibited K562 cell growth. In conclusion, our results indicated that sorafenib sensitized K562 cells to DNR-induced cytotoxicity by downregulating p-ERK1/2 expression. DNR in combination with sorafenib may represent a new and potential therapeutic strategy in treating acute leukemia with high p-ERK1/2 levels.","['Xiao, Ruo-Zhi', 'He, Cheng-Ming', 'Xiong, Mu-Jun', 'Ruan, Xing-Xing', 'Wang, Li-Lin', 'Chen, Yan', 'Lin, Dong-Jun']","['Xiao RZ', 'He CM', 'Xiong MJ', 'Ruan XX', 'Wang LL', 'Chen Y', 'Lin DJ']","['Department of Hematology, Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510630, PR China. xiaorzh@126.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (U 0126)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Niacinamide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sorafenib', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2013/03/08 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/03/08 06:00'],"['2012/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2013.2331 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2013 May;29(5):1895-901. doi: 10.3892/or.2013.2331.

However, activating c-KIT mutations are reported to be associated with higher risk of relapse and shorter survival. To verify the incidence and prognostic value of c-KIT mutations in CBF AML, we retrospectively analysed bone marrow samples of 23 consecutive adult patients with de novo CBF AML [14 inv(16) and 9 t(8;21)] treated at a single institution from 2000 to 2011. All patients received standard induction chemotherapy with cytarabine, idarubicin and etoposide; 13 underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. c-KIT mutations in exons 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 17 were assessed by PCR amplification in combination with direct sequencing. c-KIT mutations (3 in exon 10 and 4 in exon 17) were detected in 7/23 (30.4%) patients, 3 with t(8;21) and 4 with inv(16). No difference in c-KIT mutation status was observed between cases with inv(16) or t(8;21) alone and cases with additional cytogenetic abnormalities. No association between gender, age, white blood cell and platelet count, peripheral blood and bone marrow blast cells at diagnosis, achievement of complete remission, cytogenetic risk groups and Wilms tumour gene 1 (WT1) levels was found. On the contrary, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values were higher in mutated than in non-mutated patients (p=0.01). Overall survival (OS) rates were longer in CBF compared to the other types of AML and disease-free survival (DFS) was longer in inv(16) than in t(8;21) AML. OS and DFS were similar in mutated and non-mutated CBF AML patients. Our results confirm a better prognosis for CBF AML than all other AML categories, and for inv(16) than t(8;21) AML. However, no prognostic value for c-KIT mutational status was found in our series.

However, its downstream nuclear transcription factors have not been well explored. In the current study, we further investigated whether nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and activator protein (AP-1) were activated and their roles in anti-beta2GPI/beta2GPI complex stimulating TF expression. The results showed that treatment of the cells with anti-beta2GPI (10mug/ml)/beta2GPI (100 mg/ml) complex could markedly increase the levels of phosphorylated NF-kappaB (p-NF-kappaB p65) and c-Jun/AP-1 (p-c-Jun), as well as TF expression. Both NF-kappaB inhibitor PDTC (20 muM) and AP-1 inhibitor curcumin (25 mM) could attenuate TF expression induced by anti-beta2GPI/beta2GPI or APS-IgG/beta2GPI complex. Combination of any two inhibitors of MAPKs (SB203580/U0126 or SB203580/SP600125 or U0126/SP600125) could decrease activation of NF-kappaB. SB203580/SP600125 or U0126/SP600125, but not SB203580/U0126, could reduce the phosphorylation of c-Jun/AP-1. Neither NF-kappaB nor c-Jun/AP-1 activation caused by anti-beta2GPI/beta2GPI complex could be affected by TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242. In conclusion, our results indicate that both NF-kappaB and c-Jun/AP-1 can be activated and play important roles in the process of anti-beta2GPI/beta2GPI-induced TF expression in monocytes, thereby contributing to the pathological processes of antiphospholipid syndrome.","['Xia, Longfei', 'Zhou, Hong', 'Hu, Lichao', 'Xie, Hongxiang', 'Wang, Ting', 'Xu, Ya', 'Liu, Jingjing', 'Zhang, Xiaolei', 'Yan, Jinchuan']","['Xia L', 'Zhou H', 'Hu L', 'Xie H', 'Wang T', 'Xu Y', 'Liu J', 'Zhang X', 'Yan J']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory and Hematology, School of Medical Science and Laboratory Medicine of Jiangsu University, 301 Xuefu Road, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu 212013, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,"['0 (Antibodies, Antiphospholipid)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (beta 2-Glycoprotein I)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Antiphospholipid/*metabolism', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thromboplastin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'beta 2-Glycoprotein I/immunology/*metabolism']",2013/03/08 06:00,2013/11/13 06:00,['2013/03/08 06:00'],"['2012/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['12-09-0655 [pii]', '10.1160/TH12-09-0655 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 2013 Apr;109(4):643-51. doi: 10.1160/TH12-09-0655.

METHODS: MTT method was used to determine the drug resistance of K562/DNR cells and the cellular toxicity of bortezomib. K562/DNR cells were cultured for 12 hours, 24 hours and 36 hours with 100 mug/ml DNR only or plus 4 mug/L bortezomib. The expressions of NF-kappaB, IkappaB and P-gp of K562/DNR were detected with Western blot method, the activity of NF-kappaB was tested by ELISA method and the apoptosis rate was observed in each group respectively. RESULTS: The IC50 of DNR on cells of K562/S and K562/DNR groups were 1.16 mug/ml and 50.43 mug/mL, respectively. The drug-resistant fold was 43.47. The IC10 of PS-341 on Cell strain K562/DNR was 4 mug/L. Therefore, 4 mug/L was selected as the concentration for PS-341 to reverse drug-resistance in this study. DNR induced down-regulation of IkappaB expression, up-regulation of NF-kappaB and P-gp expression. After treatment with PS-341, a proteasome inhibitor, the IkappaB degradation was inhibited, IkappaB expression increased, NF-kappaB and P-gp expression decreased in a time dependent manner. Compared to DNR group, the NF-kappaB p65 activity of DNR+PS-341 group was decreased. Compared to corresponding DNR group, DNR induced apoptosis rate increases after addition of PS-341 in a time dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Proteasome inhibitor bortezomib can convert the leukemia cell drug resistance. The mechanism may be that bortezomib decreases the degradation of IkappaB and the expression of NF-kappaB and P-gp, therefore induces the apoptosis of multi-drug resistant cells.","['Wang, Hui-Han', 'Li, Ying-Chun', 'Liao, Ai-Jun', 'Fu, Bei-Bei', 'Yang, Wei', 'Liu, Zhuo-Gang', 'Wang, Xiao-Bin']","['Wang HH', 'Li YC', 'Liao AJ', 'Fu BB', 'Yang W', 'Liu ZG', 'Wang XB']","['Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin J Cancer Res,Chinese journal of cancer research = Chung-kuo yen cheng yen chiu,9315242,,,,2011/03/01 00:00,2011/03/01 00:01,['2013/03/08 06:00'],"['2010/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11670-011-0069-4 [doi]', 'cjcr-23-01-069 [pii]']",ppublish,Chin J Cancer Res. 2011 Mar;23(1):69-73. doi: 10.1007/s11670-011-0069-4.,,,PMC3587529,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bortezomib', 'K562 cells', 'Multi-drug resistance', 'NF-kappaB', 'P-gp', 'mdr1 gene']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: All data were obtained from Beijing Cancer Registry from 1998-2007 in urban Beijing. Time trends of incidence rate of cancer were assessed by annual percentage change (APC) of age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) of world standard population during this 10-year period. RESULTS: For all 156851 cancer cases combined, the incidence rate rose in both males and females, with an APC of 2.23% and 3.74%, respectively. The incidence rate of upper gastrointestinal cancers declined significantly, with an APC of -2.83% in esophageal cancer and -1.37% in male gastric cancer, while lower gastrointestinal cancer, such as colorectal cancer, increased with an APC of 4.08%. The rates of kidney and bladder cancer increased with an APC of 7.93% and 5.57%, respectively. For women, the APC continued to rise in breast cancer (4.98%), ovary cancer (6.16%), cervix uteri cancer (11.74%), corpus uteri cancer (6.96%) and thyroid gland cancer (13.39%). The rate of prostate cancer among men increased with an APC of 8.58%; the rate of lymphoma and leukemia increased with APC of 5.48% and 5.44%, respectively.

Multiple Rho GEFs have been proposed to link Galpha12/13 GPCRs to Rho activation, including PDZ-RhoGEF (PRG), leukemia-associated Rho GEF (LARG), p115-RhoGEF (p115), lymphoid blast crisis (Lbc), and Dbl. PRG, LARG, and p115 share the presence of a regulator of G protein signaling homology (RGS) domain. There is limited information on the biological roles of this RGS-containing family of RhoGEFs in vivo. p115-deficient mice are viable with some defects in the immune system and gastrointestinal motor dysfunctions, whereas in an initial study we showed that mice deficient for Larg are viable and resistant to salt-induced hypertension. Here, we generated knock-out mice for Prg and observed that these mice do not display any overt phenotype. However, deficiency in Prg and Larg leads to complex developmental defects and early embryonic lethality. Signaling from Galpha11/q-linked GPCRs to Rho was not impaired in mouse embryonic fibroblasts defective in all three RGS-containing RhoGEFs. However, a combined lack of Prg, Larg, and p115 expression abolished signaling through Galpha12/13 to Rho and thrombin-induced cell proliferation, directional migration, and nuclear signaling through JNK and p38. These findings provide evidence of an essential role for the RGS-containing RhoGEF family in signaling to Rho by Galpha12/13-coupled GPCRs, which may likely play a critical role during embryonic development.","['Mikelis, Constantinos M', 'Palmby, Todd R', 'Simaan, May', 'Li, Wenling', 'Szabo, Roman', 'Lyons, Ruth', 'Martin, Daniel', 'Yagi, Hiroshi', 'Fukuhara, Shigetomo', 'Chikumi, Hiroki', 'Galisteo, Rebeca', 'Mukouyama, Yoh-Suke', 'Bugge, Thomas H', 'Gutkind, J Silvio']","['Mikelis CM', 'Palmby TR', 'Simaan M', 'Li W', 'Szabo R', 'Lyons R', 'Martin D', 'Yagi H', 'Fukuhara S', 'Chikumi H', 'Galisteo R', 'Mukouyama YS', 'Bugge TH', 'Gutkind JS']","['Oral and Pharyngeal Cancer Branch, NIDCR, Genetics and Developmental Biology Center, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ARHGEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Arhgef12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Lysophosphatidic Acid)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombin)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Development/*physiology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13/genetics/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/physiology', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptors, Lysophosphatidic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Thrombin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2013/03/08 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2013/03/08 06:00'],"['2013/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)33430-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.428599 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 Apr 26;288(17):12232-43. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.428599.

TCD was performed by 1 of 2 immunomagnetic CD34(+) cell selection methods for peripheral blood grafts or by soybean lectin agglutination followed by sheep red blood cell-rosette depletion for bone marrow grafts. No additional graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was administered. Patients received unmodified grafts at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC, N = 181) after conditioning with busulfan+fludarabine and GVHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus+mini-methotrexate. Patients with unrelated or human leukocyte antigen-mismatched donors received anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) at both centers, with some recipients of matched related donor TCD transplants also receiving ATG, depending upon the preparative regimen. TCD graft recipients were more likely to be older, receive a mismatched transplant, and have peripheral blood used as the graft source. The incidences rates of grades 2 to 4 acute GVHD and chronic GVHD were significantly lower in the TCD graft group (5% versus 18%, and 13% versus 53%). Three-year relapse-free and overall survival rates were 58% and 57%, respectively, in recipients of TCD grafts, and 60% and 66% in recipients of unmodified grafts (P = not significant).

Although eIF4E RNA levels are elevated 3- to 10-fold in M4/M5 AML, the molecular underpinnings of this dysregulation were unknown. Here, we demonstrate that EIF4E is a direct transcriptional target of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) that is dysregulated preferentially in M4 and M5 AML. In primary hematopoietic cells and in cell lines, eIF4E levels are induced by NF-kappaB activating stimuli. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of NF-kappaB represses this activation. The endogenous human EIF4E promoter recruits p65 and cRel to evolutionarily conserved kappaB sites in vitro and in vivo following NF-kappaB activation. Transcriptional activation is demonstrated by recruitment of p300 to the kappaB sites and phosphorylated Pol II to the coding region. In primary AML specimens, generally we observe that substantially more NF-kappaB complexes associate with eIF4E promoter elements in M4 and M5 AML specimens examined than in other subtypes or unstimulated normal primary hematopoietic cells. Consistently, genetic inhibition of NF-kappaB abrogates eIF4E RNA levels in this same population. These findings provide novel insights into the transcriptional control of eIF4E and a novel molecular basis for its dysregulation in at least a subset of M4/M5 AML specimens.","['Hariri, F', 'Arguello, M', 'Volpon, L', 'Culjkovic-Kraljacic, B', 'Nielsen, T H', 'Hiscott, J', 'Mann, K K', 'Borden, K L B']","['Hariri F', 'Arguello M', 'Volpon L', 'Culjkovic-Kraljacic B', 'Nielsen TH', 'Hiscott J', 'Mann KK', 'Borden KL']","['Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2013/03/08 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/03/08 06:00'],"['2013/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201373 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.73 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Oct;27(10):2047-55. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.73.

Major arguments are focused on the critical impact of histopathology, particularly concerning the distinction between essential thrombocythemia (ET) versus early/prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Regarding bone marrow morphology, WHO guidelines strictly require the recognition of characteristic histological patterns based on standardized features and a consensus of clinical and molecular-genetic data. Molecular-genetic findings as JAK2V617F, may aid to exclude reactive thrombocytosis, although in ET and PMF only 50-60% of the cases show these aberrations. Considerable doubts over the existence of early/prefibrotic PMF have been expressed with the consequence to include this entity in the ET category. On the other hand, it has to be argued that some of the critical studies failed to adhere very strictly to the WHO guidelines. Contrasting this situation, recently published retrospective and prospective clinico-pathological studies featuring the WHO criteria provided an important information on disease outcomes supporting the existence of early/prefibrotic PMF as a distinct clinico-pathologic entity in patients presenting clinically with ET. Therefore, this controversy suggests a scientific project, including the community of pathologists and hematologists, for providing sound, objective and reproducible criteria for diagnosing early/prefibrotic PMF.","['Barbui, T', 'Thiele, J', 'Vannucchi, A M', 'Tefferi, A']","['Barbui T', 'Thiele J', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Tefferi A']","['Department of Hematology, Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*diagnosis', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*diagnosis', 'World Health Organization']",2013/03/08 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/03/08 06:00'],"['2013/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201374 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.74 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Oct;27(10):1953-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.74.

Clinical observations indicate that combining glucocorticoids with multi-tyrosine-kinase inhibitors could be a successful therapeutic approach. We and others have shown that the BCR-ABL/SRC kinase inhibitor dasatinib may enhance or suppress T cells in vitro. In this report, we evaluated combination effects of dasatinib and dexamethasone on CD3(+) and virus-specific CD8(+) T cells directly ex vivo and on antigen-specific leukemia-reactive and alloreactive CD8(+) T cell clones. Functional outcomes assessed included cytokine production (IL-2, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha), degranulation (CD107a/b), activation (CD69 upregulation), proliferation, apoptosis and necrosis induction, and signal transduction. Overall, helper CD4(+) T cells were more sensitive to inhibitory effects of the drug combination than cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells and were more naive than memory T cell subsets. Of note, synergistic inhibitory effects occurred in different memory but not in naive T cell subsets. The drug combination inhibited virus-specific CD8(+) T cell proliferation, but left cytokine production and degranulation unaltered, which may be due to the viral memory subset composition. Dasatinib rather hampered IFN-gamma secretion and cytotoxic activity of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-reactive CTLs, whereas effector functions of leukemia-reactive CTLs were maintained or enhanced when applied long term. Our data suggest that dasatinib might modulate GvL- differently than GvHD-promoting CTLs and provide a rationale to explore the drug combination further to treat GvHD while preserving GvL and antiviral CTL responses.","['Nerreter, Thomas', 'Distler, Eva', 'Kochel, Carolin', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Herr, Wolfgang', 'Seggewiss-Bernhardt, Ruth']","['Nerreter T', 'Distler E', 'Kochel C', 'Einsele H', 'Herr W', 'Seggewiss-Bernhardt R']","['Immune Recovery Section, Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Synergism', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*drug effects/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/drug effects/immunology', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology']",2013/03/08 06:00,2013/09/10 06:00,['2013/03/08 06:00'],"['2012/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(13)00061-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2013.02.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2013 Jul;41(7):604-614.e4. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2013.02.013.

We define here the ""codonome value"" as the total number of codons present across all the expressed mRNAs in a given biological condition. We have developed the ""CODONOME"" software, which calculates the codon bias and, following integration with a gene expression profile, estimates the actual frequency of each codon at the transcriptome level (codonome bias) of a given tissue. Systematic analysis across different human tissues and multiple species shows a surprisingly tight correlation between the codon bias and the codonome bias. An aneuploidy and cancer condition such as that of Down Syndrome-related acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (DS-AMKL), does not appear to alter this relationship. The law of correlation between codon bias and codonome emerges as a property of the distribution and range of the number, sequence and expression level of the genes in a genome.","['Piovesan, Allison', 'Vitale, Lorenza', 'Pelleri, Maria Chiara', 'Strippoli, Pierluigi']","['Piovesan A', 'Vitale L', 'Pelleri MC', 'Strippoli P']","['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Activity of Histology, Embryology and Applied Biology, University of Bologna, via Belmeloro 8, 40126 Bologna (BO), Italy. allison.piovesan2@unibo.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['0 (Codon)', 'EC 6.1.1.- (Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases)']",IM,"['Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases/genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/genetics', 'Codon/*genetics', 'Databases, Nucleic Acid', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genome, Bacterial', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics', '*Software', '*Transcriptome', 'Zebrafish/genetics']",2013/03/08 06:00,2013/10/19 06:00,['2013/03/08 06:00'],"['2012/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0888-7543(13)00038-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ygeno.2013.02.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 2013 May;101(5):282-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ygeno.2013.02.009.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A five-month-old infant presented a plaque of angiomatous appearance on the forearm that had increased in volume since birth, as well as pallor and cutaneous haematomas. Kasabach-Merritt syndrome (KMS) was evoked despite hepatomegaly and considerable splenomegaly. Laboratory tests revealed severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia as well as major hyperleukocytosis with 90% blasts. Skin biopsy revealed vast vascular lobules containing cohesive fusiform endothelial cells not expressing Glut1, bound up in a dense infiltrate of B-lymphoblast cells. It was in fact KHE associated with B-ALL confirmed by the myelogram. The child was treated with the INTERFANT 2006 protocol followed by allograft of haematopoietic stem cells, which resulted in complete haematological remission. At the same time, almost total regression of KHE was noted. DISCUSSION: In this infant, KHE had an inflammatory appearance and was associated with thrombocytopenia, evocative of KMS. Analysis of blood and marrow samples resulted in a diagnosis of B-ALL. Histopathological examination of the angioma revealed a typical appearance of KHE associated with dense lymphoblastic proliferation. This appearance could have resulted either from passive contamination by circulating blast cells or from active recruitment of tumor cells at the KHE site. CONCLUSION: HK mimicking KMS may reveal B-ALL.","['Fichel, F', 'Eschard, C', 'Zachar, D', 'Munzer, M', 'Bernard, P', 'Grange, F']","['Fichel F', 'Eschard C', 'Zachar D', 'Munzer M', 'Bernard P', 'Grange F']","['Service de dermatologie, hopital Robert-Debre, CHU de Reims, avenue du General-Koenig, 51092 Reims cedex, France. fanny-fichel@hotmail.fr']",['fre'],['Journal Article'],France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Biopsy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Hemangioendothelioma/complications/congenital/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Hemangioma/congenital/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kasabach-Merritt Syndrome/*etiology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*pathology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology/surgery', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications/congenital/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2013/03/08 06:00,2013/08/27 06:00,['2013/03/08 06:00'],"['2012/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2012/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0151-9638(12)01387-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annder.2012.12.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2013 Mar;140(3):209-14. doi: 10.1016/j.annder.2012.12.009.

HTLV-1 associated bronchiolo-alveolar disorder (HABA) has been proposed as an immune mediated pulmonary reaction seen rarely in HTLV-1 carriers. The reported clinico-pathological patterns of HABA are diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP). We here report three cases of HTLV-1 carriers showing miliary micro-nodules throughout both lungs. Microscopic examination in the video assisted thoracic surgery biopsies demonstrated that all cases had multiple discrete micro-nodules which consisted of marked lymphoid infiltration, granulomas, eosinophils and a few foci of necrosis inside the granuloma. No findings indicating ATLL, other neoplastic conditions, infection or interstitial pneumonia, including DPB and LIP, were present following panels of special staining and immunohistochemical examinations.

To do so, its cells must discriminate self from non-self utilizing receptors that identify molecules synthesized exclusively by microbes. Toll- like receptors have a crucial role in the detection of microbial infection in mammals and insects. In mammals, they have evolved to recognize conserved products unique to microbial metabolism. These include lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipotechoic acids, and peptidoglycans (PGN). We show here that TLRs, including TLR2, are expressed on the THP-1 human leukemia cell line. Activation of TLR2 signaling in THP-1 by PGN induces the synthesis of various soluble factors and proteins including interleukin-1beta, interleukin-8 and TNF-alpha and apoptosis of THP-1 with PGN dose and time dependence. Moreover , in this study we show that PGN induces apoptosis of THP-1 cells in a TNF-alpha-dependent manner. These findings indicate that TLR2 signaling results in a cascade leading to tumor apoptosis and differentiation, which may suggest new clinical prospects using TLR2 agonists as cytotoxic agents in certain cancers.","['Wang, Di', 'Xiao, Pei-Ling', 'Duan, Hua-Xin', 'Zhou, Ming', 'Liu, Jin', 'Li, Wei', 'Luo, Ke-Lin', 'Chen, Jian-Jun', 'Hu, Jin-Yue']","['Wang D', 'Xiao PL', 'Duan HX', 'Zhou M', 'Liu J', 'Li W', 'Luo KL', 'Chen JJ', 'Hu JY']","[""Department of Hematolgy and Oncology, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, Changsha, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Peptidoglycan)', '0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Peptidoglycan/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2012/01/01 00:00,2014/10/10 06:00,['2013/03/08 06:00'],"['2013/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.12.6409 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2012;13(12):6409-13. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.12.6409.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One predicament is that substantial damage to normal tissues is likely to occur in the course of standard treatments. Obviously, it is urgent to explore therapies that can effectively eliminate malignant cells without affecting normal cells. Our previous studies indicated that ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1), a major active pharmacological ingredient of ginseng, could delay normal hematopoietic stem cell senescence. However, whether Rg1 can induce cancer cell senescence is still unclear. METHODS: In the current study, human leukemia K562 cells were subjected to Rg1 exposure. The optimal drug concentration and duration with K562 cells was obtained by MTT colorimetric test. Effects of Rg1 on cell cycle were analyzed using flow cytometry and by SA-beta-Gal staining. Colony-forming ability was measured by colony-assay. Telomere lengths were assessed by Southern blotting and expression of senescence-associated proteins P21, P16 and RB by Western blotting. Ultrastructural morphology changes were observed by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: K562 cells demonstrated a maximum proliferation inhibition rate with an Rg1 concentration of 20 mu molL-1 for 48h, the cells exhibiting dramatic morphological alterations including an enlarged and flat cellular morphology, larger mitochondria and increased number of lysosomes. Senescence associated-beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) activity was increased. K562 cells also had decreased ability for colony formation, and shortened telomere length as well as reduction of proliferating potential and arrestin G2/M phase after Rg1 interaction. The senescence associated proteins P21, P16 and RB were significantly up-regulated. CONCLUSION: Ginsenoside Rg1 can induce a state of senescence in human leukemia K562 cells, which is associated with p21-Rb and p16-Rb pathways.","['Liu, Jun', 'Cai, Shi-Zhong', 'Zhou, Yue', 'Zhang, Xian-Ping', 'Liu, Dian-Feng', 'Jiang, Rong', 'Wang, Ya-Ping']","['Liu J', 'Cai SZ', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhang XP', 'Liu DF', 'Jiang R', 'Wang YP']","['Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Department of Histology and Embryology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. ypwangcq@yahoo.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', '*Cellular Senescence/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Panax']",2012/01/01 00:00,2016/04/24 06:00,['2013/03/08 06:00'],"['2013/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.12.6191 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2012;13(12):6191-6. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.12.6191.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This research was conducted at two hospitals of a university. Data was collected via questionnaires and the Turkish version of the Miller Behavioral Style Scale (MBSS) to assess information-seeking behavior. The sample included 82 patients and 54 relatives. RESULTS: Patients were receiving treatment mostly for breast, gynecologic, lung cancer and leukemia/ lymphoma. All of them indicated that they want to be informed by a doctor about their diagnosis and treatment first. Other information sources were internet, media and nurses. The majority of the patients and half of their relatives agreed that ""cancer is curable and preventable disease"". Only 2.5% of patients agreed with the statement ""I don't want to get information about disease which disturbs me"". According the data obtained from MBSS; the mean patients MBSS score (6.41+/-3.2) was higher than their relatives (5.46+/-3.1). Respondents with higher education and younger age indicated more information-seeking behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and their relatives differ in some of their information-seeking behavior. Patients beliefs and their strategies for coping with their illness can constrain their wish for information and their efforts to obtain it. Healthcare professionals need to assess and be sensitive to the information-seeking behavior of cancer patients and their relatives.","['Kav, Sultan', 'Tokdemir, Gamze', 'Tasdemir, Reyhan', 'Yalili, Ayse', 'Dinc, Didem']","['Kav S', 'Tokdemir G', 'Tasdemir R', 'Yalili A', 'Dinc D']","['Department of Nursing, Faculty of Health Sciences, Baskent University, Ankara, Turkey. skav@baskent.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Humans', '*Information Seeking Behavior', 'Internet', '*Neoplasms', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2012/01/01 00:00,2016/04/24 06:00,['2013/03/08 06:00'],"['2013/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.12.6027 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2012;13(12):6027-32. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.12.6027.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to determine the frequency with which healthcare professionals discuss the impact of cancer on patients' emotions and relationships with others. METHODS: Data regarding healthcare professionals' discussions of the emotional impact of cancer and relevant covariates were obtained from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey. Statistical analyses were performed using sudaan software (Research Triangle Institute, Raleigh, NC, USA). RESULTS: Of the 2074 people with a prior diagnosis of cancer surveyed, 701 (33.8%) claimed that a doctor, nurse, or other healthcare professional had discussed with them 'how cancer could affect their emotions or relationships with others'. Of these, 586 (84.5%) reported that they were 'very satisfied' with how well their emotional and social needs were met; 73.4% of those who had not had this discussion reported being very satisfied. Patients with leukemia/lymphoma, younger patients, African Americans, and those with a lower degree of education were most likely to report having discussions about emotional issues. Gender was not correlated with these discussions (30.6% in men vs. 33.3% in women). On multivariate analysis, age, race, and cancer type remained independent significant predictors of having a discussion regarding the emotional impact of cancer. CONCLUSION: Only a third of cancer patients discussed the emotional impact of a cancer diagnosis with their healthcare professional. Age, race, and type of malignancy affect the likelihood of having these discussions.","['Bonito, Allison', 'Horowitz, Nina', 'McCorkle, Ruth', 'Chagpar, Anees B']","['Bonito A', 'Horowitz N', 'McCorkle R', 'Chagpar AB']","['Department of Surgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', '*Communication', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Health Personnel', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Nurse-Patient Relations', 'Patient Satisfaction/*statistics & numerical data', 'Physician-Patient Relations', ""Practice Patterns, Nurses'/*statistics & numerical data"", ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data"", 'Racial Groups/statistics & numerical data', 'Social Support']",2013/03/07 06:00,2014/04/02 06:00,['2013/03/07 06:00'],"['2012/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.3258 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2013 Sep;22(9):2046-50. doi: 10.1002/pon.3258.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of sorafenib, a general kinase inhibitor, on several EC cell lines (HEC1A, HEC1B, and RL95-2). Sorafenib induced cell death in EC cells with the following order of sensitivity: HEC1A > HEC1B > RL95-2. Sorafenib suppressed several anti-apoptotic proteins in HEC1A cells, including myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1). Ectopic overexpression of Mcl-1 prevented the cell killing effect of sorafenib. Sorafenib suppressed Mcl-1 at the gene transactivation level by inactivating the ERK/Elk-1 pathway. Accordingly, the inhibitory effect of sorafenib on Mcl-1 expression decreased following knockdown of Elk-1 using short-hairpin RNA (shRNA). Elk-1 overexpression rescued both the inhibitory effect of sorafenib on Mcl-1 expression and the cell killing effect of sorafenib. Furthermore, sorafenib reduced the stability of the Mcl-1 protein by enhancing its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome via the AKT/GSK3beta and the ERK pathways. Similar results were detected in other EC cell lines. These results indicate that sorafenib induces apoptosis in EC cells by down-regulating the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 via transcriptional inhibition and protein degradation. Our results thus support the notion that sorafenib may be used in endometrial cancer therapy.","['Sun, Nian-Kang', 'Huang, Shang-Lang', 'Chang, Ting-Chang', 'Chao, Chuck C-K']","['Sun NK', 'Huang SL', 'Chang TC', 'Chao CC']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taoyuan 333, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (ELK1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (ets-Domain Protein Elk-1)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sorafenib', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects/genetics', 'ets-Domain Protein Elk-1/genetics/*metabolism']",2013/03/07 06:00,2013/11/02 06:00,['2013/03/07 06:00'],"['2013/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24530 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2013 Aug;114(8):1819-31. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24530.,,"['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found 116 different mutations in 162 (41%) CN patients and 26 in 51 (55%) CyN patients, 69 of them were novel. CyN-associated mutations were predicted to be more benign than CN-associated mutations, but the mutation severity largely overlapped. The frequency of acquired CSF3R mutations, malignant transformation, and the need for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was significantly higher in CN patients with ELANE mutation than in ELANE mutation negative patients. Cellular elastase activity was reduced in neutrophils from CN/CyN patients, irrespective of the mutation status. In CN, enzymatic activity was significantly lower in patients with ELANE mutations compared with those with wild-type ELANE. Despite differences in the spectrum of mutations in CN or CyN, type or localization of mutation only partially determine the clinical phenotype. Specific ELANE mutations have limited predictive value for leukemogenesis; the risk for leukemia was correlated with disease severity rather than with occurrence of an ELANE mutation.","['Germeshausen, Manuela', 'Deerberg, Sabine', 'Peter, Yvonne', 'Reimer, Christina', 'Kratz, Christian P', 'Ballmaier, Matthias']","['Germeshausen M', 'Deerberg S', 'Peter Y', 'Reimer C', 'Kratz CP', 'Ballmaier M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. germeshausen.manuela@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Mutat,Human mutation,9215429,"['0 (Codon, Initiator)', '0 (RNA Splice Sites)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)', 'Cyclic neutropenia']",IM,"['Codon, Initiator', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Genotype', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Elastase/*genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Neutropenia/complications/*congenital/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA Splice Sites', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism']",2013/03/07 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2013/03/07 06:00'],"['2012/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/humu.22308 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mutat. 2013 Jun;34(6):905-14. doi: 10.1002/humu.22308.

We investigated biomarkers of toxicant exposure with water pipe compared with cigarette smoking. METHODS: We conducted a crossover study to assess daily nicotine and carcinogen exposure with water pipe and cigarette smoking in 13 people who were experienced in using both products. RESULTS: When smoking an average of 3 water pipe sessions compared with smoking 11 cigarettes per day (cpd), water pipe use was associated with a significantly lower intake of nicotine, greater exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), and a different pattern of carcinogen exposure compared with cigarette smoking, with greater exposure to benzene, and high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), but less exposure to tobacco-specific nitrosamines, 1,3-butadiene, acrolein, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, ethylene oxide, and low molecular weight PAHs. CONCLUSIONS: A different pattern of carcinogen exposure might result in a different cancer risk profile between cigarette and water pipe smoking. Of particular concern is the risk of leukemia related to high levels of benzene exposure with water pipe use. IMPACT: Smoking tobacco in water pipes has gained popularity in the United States and around the world. Many believe that water pipe smoking is not addictive and less harmful than cigarette smoking. We provide data on toxicant exposure that will help guide regulation and public education regarding water pipe health risk.","['Jacob, Peyton 3rd', 'Abu Raddaha, Ahmad H', 'Dempsey, Delia', 'Havel, Christopher', 'Peng, Margaret', 'Yu, Lisa', 'Benowitz, Neal L']","['Jacob P 3rd', 'Abu Raddaha AH', 'Dempsey D', 'Havel C', 'Peng M', 'Yu L', 'Benowitz NL']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco General Hospital, Building 100, Room 235, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA. peyton.jacob@ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers/analysis/blood', 'Carcinogens/*administration & dosage/analysis/pharmacokinetics', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nicotine/*administration & dosage/analysis/blood', 'Smoking', 'Tobacco Products/*analysis', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/07 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2013/03/07 06:00'],"['2013/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-12-1422 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-1422 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2013 May;22(5):765-72. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-1422.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to characterize the sources of variability for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in residential dust and provide guidance for investigators who plan to use residential dust to assess exposure to PAHs. METHODS: We collected repeat dust samples from 293 households in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study during two sampling rounds (from 2001 through 2007 and during 2010) using household vacuum cleaners, and measured 12 PAHs using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We used a random- and a mixed-effects model for each PAH to apportion observed variance into four components and to identify sources of variability. RESULTS: Median concentrations for individual PAHs ranged from 10 to 190 ng/g of dust. For each PAH, total variance was apportioned into regional variability (1-9%), intraregional between-household variability (24-48%), within-household variability over time (41-57%), and within-sample analytical variability (2-33%). Regional differences in PAH dust levels were associated with estimated ambient air concentrations of PAH. Intraregional differences between households were associated with the residential construction date and the smoking habits of residents. For some PAHs, a decreasing time trend explained a modest fraction of the within-household variability; however, most of the within-household variability was unaccounted for by our mixed-effects models. Within-household differences between sampling rounds were largest when the interval between dust sample collections was at least 6 years in duration. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that it may be feasible to use residential dust for retrospective assessment of PAH exposures in studies of health effects.","['Whitehead, Todd P', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Petreas, Myrto', 'Does, Monique', 'Buffler, Patricia A', 'Rappaport, Stephen M']","['Whitehead TP', 'Metayer C', 'Petreas M', 'Does M', 'Buffler PA', 'Rappaport SM']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA. toddpwhitehead@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Dust)', '0 (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons)']",IM,"['Dust/*analysis', 'Environmental Monitoring/*methods', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons/*analysis', 'Quality Control', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",2013/03/07 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/03/07 06:00'],"['2012/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.1205821 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2013 May;121(5):543-50. doi: 10.1289/ehp.1205821.

Studies have indicated that young adults benefit from pediatric treatment, although no upper age limit has been defined. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 749 patients aged 1-45 yr treated by the NOPHO ALL-2008 protocol. Minimal residual disease (MRD) on days 29 and 79, immunophenotype, white blood cell count (WBC), and cytogenetics were used to stratify patients to standard-, intermediate-, or high-risk treatment with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: Adults aged 18-45 had significantly lower WBCs at diagnosis compared with children aged 1-9 and 10-17 yr, but significantly more adults were stratified to high-risk chemotherapy (8%, 14%, 17%; P < 0.0001) or high-risk chemotherapy with transplantation (4%, 13%, 19%; P < 0.0001). This age-dependent skewing of risk grouping reflected more T-ALL (11%, 27%, 33%, P < 0.0001), poorer MRD response day 29 (MRD < 0.1%: 75%, 61%, 52%; P < 0.0001), and more MLL gene rearrangements (3%, 3%, 10%; P = 0.005) in older patients.

Tandem PH domain-containing proteins TAPP1 and TAPP2 are adaptor proteins that specifically bind to phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate, or PI(3,4)P2, a product of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K). While PI3K enzymes have a number of functions in cell biology, including cell migration, the functions of PI(3,4)P2 and its binding proteins are not well understood. Previously we found that TAPP2 is highly expressed in primary leukemic B cells that have strong migratory capacity. Here we find that SDF-1-dependent migration of human malignant B cells requires both PI3K signaling and TAPP2. Migration in a transwell assay is significantly impaired by pan-PI3K and isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors, or by TAPP2 shRNA knockdown (KD). Strikingly, TAPP2 KD in combination with PI3K inhibitor treatment nearly abolished the migration response, suggesting that TAPP2 may contribute some functions independent of the PI3K pathway. In microfluidic chamber cell tracking assays, TAPP2 KD cells show reduction in percentage of migrating cells, migration velocity and directionality. TAPP2 KD led to alterations in chemokine-induced rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and failure to form polarized morphology. TAPP2 co-localized with the stable F-actin-binding protein utrophin, with both molecules reciprocally localizing against F-actin accumulated at the leading edge upon SDF-1 stimulation. In TAPP2 KD cells, Rac was over-activated and localized to multiple membrane protrusions, suggesting that TAPP2 may act in concert with utrophin and stable F-actin to spatially restrict Rac activation and reduce formation of multiple membrane protrusions. TAPP2 function in cell migration is also apparent in the more complex context of B cell migration into stromal cell layers - a process that is only partially dependent on PI3K and SDF-1. In summary, this study identified TAPP2 as a novel regulator of malignant B cell migration and a potential therapeutic intervention target.","['Li, Hongzhao', 'Hou, Sen', 'Wu, Xun', 'Nandagopal, Saravanan', 'Lin, Francis', 'Kung, Sam', 'Marshall, Aaron James']","['Li H', 'Hou S', 'Wu X', 'Nandagopal S', 'Lin F', 'Kung S', 'Marshall AJ']","['Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (PLEKHA2 protein, human)', '0 (Utrophin)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Actins/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*pharmacology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Utrophin/metabolism', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",2013/03/06 06:00,2013/09/04 06:00,['2013/03/06 06:00'],"['2012/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0057809 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-27478 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e57809. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0057809.

Whether sirtuins function in tumorigenesis is still controversial, but sirtuins are aberrantly expressed in tumors, which may keep cancerous cells undifferentiated. Therefore, we investigated whether the inhibition of sirtuin family proteins induces cellular differentiation in leukemic cells. The sirtuin inhibitors tenovin-6 and BML-266 induce granulocytic differentiation in the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line NB4. This differentiation is likely caused by an inhibition of SIRT2 deacetylase activity, judging from the accumulation of acetylated alpha-tubulin, a major SIRT2 substrate. Unlike the clinically used differentiation inducer all-trans retinoic acid, tenovin-6 shows limited effects on promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RAR-alpha) stability and promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body formation in NB4 cells, suggesting that tenovin-6 does not directly target PML-RAR-alpha activity. In agreement with this, tenovin-6 induces cellular differentiation in the non-APL cell line HL-60, where PML-RAR-alpha does not exist. Knocking down SIRT2 by shRNA induces granulocytic differentiation in NB4 cells, which demonstrates that the inhibition of SIRT2 activity is sufficient to induce cell differentiation in NB4 cells. The overexpression of SIRT2 in NB4 cells decreases the level of granulocytic differentiation induced by tenovin-6, which indicates that tenovin-6 induces granulocytic differentiation by inhibiting SIRT2 activity. Taken together, our data suggest that targeting SIRT2 is a viable strategy to induce leukemic cell differentiation.","['Sunami, Yoshitaka', 'Araki, Marito', 'Hironaka, Yumi', 'Morishita, Soji', 'Kobayashi, Masaki', 'Liew, Ei Leen', 'Edahiro, Yoko', 'Tsutsui, Miyuki', 'Ohsaka, Akimichi', 'Komatsu, Norio']","['Sunami Y', 'Araki M', 'Hironaka Y', 'Morishita S', 'Kobayashi M', 'Liew EL', 'Edahiro Y', 'Tsutsui M', 'Ohsaka A', 'Komatsu N']","['Department of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '0 (tenovin-6)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/enzymology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'NAD/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Sirtuin 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Sirtuin 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2013/03/06 06:00,2013/09/04 06:00,['2013/03/06 06:00'],"['2012/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0057633 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-27707 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e57633. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0057633.

In melanoma cells, we demonstrate that prodigiosin activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by disrupting MCL-1/BAK complexes.

EcoHIV infected SerpinB2(-/-) mice produced significantly lower anti-gag IgG1 antibody titres than infected SerpinB2(+/+) mice, and showed slightly delayed clearance of EcoHIV. Analyses of published microarray studies showed significantly higher levels of SerpinB2 mRNA in monocytes from HIV-1 infected patients when compared with uninfected controls, as well as a significant negative correlation between SerpinB2 and T-bet mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

In order to measure these properties, five types of assays were carried out: toxicity, genotoxicity, antigenotoxicity, cytotoxicity (using the promyelocytic leukaemia HL60 cell line), and life span (in vivo analysis using the Drosophila model). Results showed that i) Borage seed oil is not toxic to D. melanogaster at physiological concentrations below 125 microl/ml and the studies on GLA indicated non-toxicity at the lowest concentration analyzed ii) Borage seed oil and GLA are DNA safe (non-genotoxic) and antimutagenic compared to hydrogen peroxide, thereby confirming its antioxidant capacity; iii) Borage seed oil and GLA exhibited cytotoxic activity in low doses (IC50 of 1 microl/ml and 0.087 mM, respectively) iv) Low doses of borage seed oil (0.19%) increased the health span of D. melanogaster; and v) GLA significantly decreased the life span of D. melanogaster.Based on the antimutagenic and cytotoxic effects along with the ability to increase the health span, we propose supplementation with borage seed oil rather than GLA, because it protects DNA by modulating oxidative genetic damage in D. melanogaster, increases the health span and exerts cytotoxic activity towards promyelocytic HL60 cells.","['Tasset-Cuevas, Inmaculada', 'Fernandez-Bedmar, Zahira', 'Lozano-Baena, Maria Dolores', 'Campos-Sanchez, Juan', 'de Haro-Bailon, Antonio', 'Munoz-Serrano, Andres', 'Alonso-Moraga, Angeles']","['Tasset-Cuevas I', 'Fernandez-Bedmar Z', 'Lozano-Baena MD', 'Campos-Sanchez J', 'de Haro-Bailon A', 'Munoz-Serrano A', 'Alonso-Moraga A']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Instituto Maimonides de Investigaciones Biomedicas de Cordoba (IMIBIC/Universidad de Cordoba), Cordoba, Espana. b72tacui@uco.es']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Plant Oils)', '0 (Protective Agents)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '78YC2MAX4O (gamma-Linolenic Acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'F8XAG1755S (borage oil)', 'R0ZB2556P8 (Tocopherols)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Borago/*chemistry', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*drug effects/growth & development', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Longevity/drug effects', 'Mutagens/toxicity', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Plant Oils/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Protective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Recombination, Genetic/genetics', 'Seeds/*chemistry', 'Tocopherols/analysis', 'Triglycerides/analysis', 'gamma-Linolenic Acid/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity']",2013/03/06 06:00,2013/09/04 06:00,['2013/03/06 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0056986 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-05607 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e56986. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0056986.

Analysis of in vitro response of CLL cells to BCR triggering allowed the definition of 2 main subsets of patients and lack of signaling capacity was associated with constitutive activation of extracellular-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NF-ATc1), consistent with the idea that at least one group of CLL patients derives from the abnormal expansion of anergic B cells. In the present work, we further investigated the anergic subset of CLL (defined as the one with constitutive ERK1/2 phosphorylation) and found that it is characterized by low levels of surface immunoglobulin M and impairment of calcium mobilization after BCR engagement in vitro. Chronic BCR triggering promoted CLL cell survival selectively in phosphorylated ERK1/2 samples and the use of mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-AT signaling inhibitors specifically induced apoptosis in this group of patients. Apoptosis induction was preceded by an initial phase of anergy reversal consisting in the loss of ERK phosphorylation and NF-AT nuclear translocation and by the restoration of BCR responsiveness, reinforcing the idea that the anergic program favors the survival of leukemic lymphocytes.","['Apollonio, Benedetta', 'Scielzo, Cristina', 'Bertilaccio, Maria Teresa Sabrina', 'Ten Hacken, Elisa', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Ranghetti, Pamela', 'Stevenson, Freda', 'Packham, Graham', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Muzio, Marta', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico']","['Apollonio B', 'Scielzo C', 'Bertilaccio MT', 'Ten Hacken E', 'Scarfo L', 'Ranghetti P', 'Stevenson F', 'Packham G', 'Ghia P', 'Muzio M', 'Caligaris-Cappio F']","['Division of Molecular Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/physiology', 'Clonal Anergy/*immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2013/03/06 06:00,2013/07/23 06:00,['2013/03/06 06:00'],"['2013/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58677-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-12-474718 [doi]']",ppublish,"Blood. 2013 May 9;121(19):3879-88, S1-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-12-474718.

The mechanism consists of CgPDR1-mediated upregulation of ATP-binding cassette transporters. A range of gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in CgPDR1 have been found to lead not only to azole resistance but also to enhanced virulence. This implicates CgPDR1 in the regulation of the interaction of C. glabrata with the host. To identify specific CgPDR1-regulated steps of the host-pathogen interaction, we investigated in this work the interaction of selected CgPDR1 GOF mutants with murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1)-derived macrophages, as well as different epithelial cell lines. GOF mutations in CgPDR1 did not influence survival and replication within macrophages following phagocytosis but led to decreased adherence to and uptake by macrophages. This may allow evasion from the host's innate cellular immune response. The interaction with epithelial cells revealed an opposite trend, suggesting that GOF mutations in CgPDR1 may favor epithelial colonization of the host by C. glabrata through increased adherence to epithelial cell layers. These data reveal that GOF mutations in CgPDR1 modulate the interaction with host cells in ways that may contribute to increased virulence.","['Vale-Silva, Luis', 'Ischer, Francoise', 'Leibundgut-Landmann, Salome', 'Sanglard, Dominique']","['Vale-Silva L', 'Ischer F', 'Leibundgut-Landmann S', 'Sanglard D']","['Institute of Microbiology, University of Lausanne and University Hospital Center, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Adhesion/*genetics', 'Candida glabrata/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Candidiasis/genetics/metabolism/microbiology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phagocytosis/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Virulence']",2013/03/06 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2013/03/06 06:00'],"['2013/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['IAI.00074-13 [pii]', '10.1128/IAI.00074-13 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Immun. 2013 May;81(5):1709-20. doi: 10.1128/IAI.00074-13.

More recently, somatic 17q11 deletions encompassing NF1 have been described in many adult myeloid malignancies. In this context, we aimed to define NF1 involvement in AML. We screened a total of 488 previously untreated de novo AML patients for the NF1 deletion using either array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) or real-time quantitative PCR/fluorescence in situ hybridization approaches. We also applied massively parallel sequencing for in depth mutation analysis of NF1 in 20 patients including five NF1-deleted patients. We defined a small approximately 0.3 Mb minimal deleted region involving NF1 by aCGH and an overall frequency of NF1 deletion of 3.5% (17/485). NF1 deletion is significantly associated with unfavorable cytogenetics and with monosomal karyotype notably. We discovered six NF1 variants of unknown significance in 7/20 patients of which only one out of four disappeared in corresponding complete remission sample. In addition, only one out of five NF1-deleted patients has an acquired coding mutation in the remaining allele. In conclusion, direct NF1 inactivation is infrequent in de novo AML and may be a secondary event probably involved in leukemic progression.","['Boudry-Labis, Elise', 'Roche-Lestienne, Catherine', 'Nibourel, Olivier', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Terre, Christine', 'Perot, Christine', 'Eclache, Virginie', 'Gachard, Nathalie', 'Tigaud, Isabelle', 'Plessis, Ghislaine', 'Cuccuini, Wendy', 'Geffroy, Sandrine', 'Villenet, Celine', 'Figeac, Martin', 'Lepretre, Frederic', 'Renneville, Aline', 'Cheok, Meyling', 'Soulier, Jean', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Preudhomme, Claude']","['Boudry-Labis E', 'Roche-Lestienne C', 'Nibourel O', 'Boissel N', 'Terre C', 'Perot C', 'Eclache V', 'Gachard N', 'Tigaud I', 'Plessis G', 'Cuccuini W', 'Geffroy S', 'Villenet C', 'Figeac M', 'Lepretre F', 'Renneville A', 'Cheok M', 'Soulier J', 'Dombret H', 'Preudhomme C']","['Institute of Medical Genetics, Jeanne de Flandre Hospital, CHRU of Lille, Lille, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['0 (Neurofibromin 1)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Frequency', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation Rate', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/*genetics', 'Neurofibromin 1/deficiency/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2013/03/06 06:00,2013/05/11 06:00,['2013/03/06 06:00'],"['2012/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23403 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Apr;88(4):306-11. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23403.

A retrospective review was conducted of patients receiving tacrolimus for prevention of graft versus host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic SCT who developed PRES from September 2008 to July 2011. Nineteen patients were identified. Altered mental status, seizures, and visual abnormalities were experienced by 78.9%, 52.6%, and 31.5% of the patients, respectively, at time of PRES onset. Compared with baseline, patients with PRES were likely to have an increase in mean arterial pressure (P < 0.0001) and serum creatinine. Elevated tacrolimus levels and hypomagnesemia were not observed with PRES onset. Tacrolimus was managed in three general strategy groups: not held, held then continued, and switched to another agent. Survival was defined as survival to discharge from PRES hospitalization. When tacrolimus was not held, held then continued, or switched to another agent, 40% (2 of 5), 40% (4/10), and 50% (2/4) survived to discharge, respectively. PRES was associated with high blood pressure and adequate blood pressure control should be part of its management.

We compared the observed deaths among workers to expectations based upon US mortality rates. METHODS: The cohort included 22,831 workers hired between January 1, 1943 and December 31, 1984. Vital status and cause of death information were ascertained through December 31, 2008. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed separately for males and females using US and Tennessee mortality rates; SMRs for men were tabulated separately for monthly-, weekly-, and hourly-paid workers. RESULTS: Hourly-paid males had more deaths due to cancer of the pleura (SMR = 12.09, 95% CI: 4.44, 26.32), cancer of the bladder (SMR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.26, 2.71), and leukemia (SMR = 1.33, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.93) than expected based on US mortality rates. Female workers also had more deaths than expected from cancer of the bladder (SMR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.20, 3.69) and leukemia (SMR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.36).

Patients receiving GO for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were eligible. Assessments were requested to be performed weekly for 6 weeks after the start of GO therapy or 4 weeks after the last dose (whichever was later), and after 6 months. The primary outcome variable was the incidence of SOS as judged by a panel of independent experts. A total of 512 patients were enrolled at 54 US centers and 482 were evaluable. The incidence of SOS in this study population was 9.1 % (44/482; 95 % confidence interval 6.9-12.0 %). Of the 44 patients classified as having SOS, 8 were mild, 17 moderate, and 19 severe; 33 died within 6 months (20 of disease progression and 13 of SOS and multiorgan failure). Most (68 %) patients in the study died within 6 months; most of these deaths (73 %) were due to progression of AML. Serious adverse events occurred in 85 % of patients, most (81 %) due to AML, febrile neutropenia, pyrexia, and sepsis. GO administered in routine clinical practice carries an overall 9.1 % risk of SOS and a 2.7 % risk of death from SOS and multiorgan failure. No risk factors were identified for the development of SOS.","['Tallman, Martin S', 'McDonald, George B', 'DeLeve, Laurie D', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Cook, Michael N', 'Graepel, G Jay', 'Kollmer, Carl']","['Tallman MS', 'McDonald GB', 'DeLeve LD', 'Baer MR', 'Cook MN', 'Graepel GJ', 'Kollmer C']","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medical College, 1275 York Ave.,New York, NY 10065, USA. tallmanm@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/*chemically induced/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2013/03/06 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/03/06 06:00'],"['2012/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-013-1275-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2013 Apr;97(4):456-64. doi: 10.1007/s12185-013-1275-2.

Long-term T-cell immune reconstitution largely relies on the generation of new T cells in the recipient thymus, which can be evaluated through signal joint (sj) and beta T-cell-Receptor Excision Circles (TREC) quantification. We studied two groups of 33 and 24 children receiving, respectively, HSC Transplantation (HSCT) from an HLA-haploidentical family donor or an unrelated CB donor, for both malignant (46) and non-malignant disorders (11). Relative and absolute sj and beta-TREC values indicated comparable thymic function reconstitution at 3 and 6 months after the allograft in both groups. Compared to children with non-malignant disorders, those with hematological malignancies had significantly lower pre-transplantation TREC counts. Patients who relapsed after HSCT had a significantly less efficient thymic function both before and 6 months after HSCT with especially low beta-TREC values, this finding suggesting an impact of early intra-thymic T-cell differentiation on the occurrence of leukemia relapse.","['Clave, Emmanuel', 'Lisini, Daniela', 'Douay, Corinne', 'Giorgiani, Giovanna', 'Busson, Marc', 'Zecca, Marco', 'Moretta, Francesca', 'Acquafredda, Gloria', 'Brescia, Letizia P', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Toubert, Antoine']","['Clave E', 'Lisini D', 'Douay C', 'Giorgiani G', 'Busson M', 'Zecca M', 'Moretta F', 'Acquafredda G', 'Brescia LP', 'Locatelli F', 'Toubert A']","[""Departement d'Immunologie, INSERM UMRS-940, AP-HP Paris, France ; Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite Paris, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,2013/03/06 06:00,2013/03/06 06:01,['2013/03/06 06:00'],"['2012/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2013.00054 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2013 Mar 4;4:54. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2013.00054. eCollection 2013.,20130304,,PMC3586933,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HSCT', 'T cells', 'leukemia', 'relapse', 'thymic function']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the mutations are located at exon 11, but some are at exon 9 or at other exons. Mutation types at exon 11 vary, while most mutations at exon 9 are a particular duplication of Ala502Tyr503 (KIT-Dup-Ala502Tyr503). Recently a duplication of Ser501Ala502 (KIT-Dup-Ser501Ala502) at exon 9 has been reported in two cases of pediatric mastocytosis and one case of adult mast cell leukemia. Although KIT-Dup-Ser501Ala502 had not been reported in GISTs, we found two GIST cases possessing the mutation in 45 GIST cases with exon 9 c-kit gene mutations, among a total of approximately 500 GIST cases examined. In this report, we briefly summarize clinicopathological findings of the two cases, and characterize the biology of the mutation. When autophosphorylation of KIT-Dup-Ser501Ala502 was examined by transient transfection of c-kit cDNA with Dup-Ser501Ala502 into CHO-K1 cells, KIT-Dup-Ser501Ala502 was ligand-independently activating. The inhibitory effect of selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib and nilotinib, on KIT-Dup-Ser501Ala502 was examined and compared with that of KIT-Dup-Ala502Tyr503. Imatinib efficiently inhibited constitutive activation of KIT-Dup-Ser501Ala502 at a concentration of 0.1 muM, whereas it inhibited that of KIT-Dup-Ala502Tyr503 at a concentration of 10 muM. Constitutive activation of KIT-Dup-Ser502Ala503 was not inhibited by nilotinib even at a concentration of 10 muM but that of KIT-Dup-Ala501Tyr502 was almost completely inhibited at a concentration of 1 muM. The results suggest that imatinib and nilotinib could be more effective on GISTs with KIT-Dup-Ser501Ala502 than those with KIT-Dup-Ala502Tyr503. In fact, a patient with KIT-Dup-Ser501Ala502 showed long-term stable disease with administration of the usual dose of 400 mg imatinib. Although mutation sites of KIT-Dup-Ser501Ala502 and KIT-Dup-Ala502Tyr503 are closely located, imatinib- and nilotinib-sensitive KIT-Dup-Ser501Ala502 are distinguishable from KIT-Dup-Ala502Tyr503.","['Liu, Ning-Ning', 'Ohkouchi, Mizuka', 'Hashikura, Yuka', 'Kajimoto, Noriko', 'Matsuda, Ikuo', 'Isozaki, Koji', 'Toh, Yasushi', 'Takahashi, Tsuyoshi', 'Nishida, Toshirou', 'Hirota, Seiichi']","['Liu NN', 'Ohkouchi M', 'Hashikura Y', 'Kajimoto N', 'Matsuda I', 'Isozaki K', 'Toh Y', 'Takahashi T', 'Nishida T', 'Hirota S']","['Department of Surgical Pathology, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Exons', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/chemistry/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/chemistry/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2013/03/06 06:00,2013/08/21 06:00,['2013/03/06 06:00'],"['2013/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['labinvest201343 [pii]', '10.1038/labinvest.2013.43 [doi]']",ppublish,Lab Invest. 2013 May;93(5):502-7. doi: 10.1038/labinvest.2013.43.

Crotonaldehyde exposure is known to have adverse effects on respiratory health, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. To examine the interaction between macrophages and airway epithelial cells after exposure to crotonaldehyde, BEAS-2B and A549 cells were treated with conditioned media from a human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) cells stimulated with crotonaldehyde. We demonstrate that conditioned media from THP-1 cells stimulated with crotonaldehyde increased interleukin (IL)-8 production, enhanced nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and AP-1 DNA-binding activity in BEAS-2B and A549 cells. Analysis of these conditioned media revealed marked increases in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-8 levels. Preincubation of conditioned media with either TNF-alpha- or IL-1beta-neutralizing antibodies reduced IL-8 production. Furthermore, BEAS-2B and A549 cells directly treated with crotonaldehyde induced increase in IL-8 production. These data suggest that crotonaldehyde is capable of directly stimulating the production of IL-8 in both macrophages and airway epithelial cells. Crotonaldehyde-stimulated macrophages also amplify the inflammatory response by enhancing IL-8 release from airway epithelial cells mediated by NF-kappaB and AP-1 pathways through a mechanism involving TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. These findings indicate that crotonaldehyde can cause lung inflammatory response via multiple mechanisms, and may contribute to chronic airway inflammation in smokers.","['Yang, Bi-Cheng', 'Yang, Zhi-Hua', 'Pan, Xiu-Jie', 'Xiao, Feng-Jun', 'Liu, Xing-Yu', 'Zhu, Mao-Xiang', 'Xie, Jian-Ping']","['Yang BC', 'Yang ZH', 'Pan XJ', 'Xiao FJ', 'Liu XY', 'Zhu MX', 'Xie JP']","['Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 457 Zhongshan Road, Dalian, Liaoning 116023, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '9G72074TUW (2-butenal)']",IM,"['Aldehydes/*toxicity', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'NF-kappa B/immunology/*metabolism', 'Respiratory Mucosa/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/adverse effects', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/immunology/*metabolism']",2013/03/06 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2013/03/06 06:00'],"['2013/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-4274(13)00087-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.toxlet.2013.02.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2013 May 10;219(1):26-34. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2013.02.018.

Advanced disease is characterized by an increased incidence of BCR-ABL1 mutations. We now describe a highly significant correlation between STAT5 expression and the incidence of BCR-ABL1 mutations in primary CML. Forced expression of STAT5 in murine BCR-ABL1 transformed cells sufficed to enhance the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to trigger DNA damage. STAT5-mediated ROS production is independent of JAK2 but requires concomitant BCR-ABL1 signalling as forced STAT5 expression in untransformed BCR-ABL1 negative cells has no impact on ROS levels. Only within the context of a BCR-ABL1 positive cell does STAT5 transcriptionally regulate a target gene or set of genes that causes the enhanced ROS production. Our study suggests the existence of a feed-forward loop accelerating disease progression, in which BCR-ABL1 enhances its own mutation rate in a STAT5-ROS dependent manner. This model explains the increased occurrence of inhibitor-resistant BCR-ABL1 mutations in advanced disease stages driven and characterized by high STAT5 expression.","['Warsch, Wolfgang', 'Grundschober, Eva', 'Berger, Angelika', 'Gille, Lars', 'Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine', 'Tigan, Anca-Sarmiza', 'Hoelbl-Kovacic, Andrea', 'Valent, Peter', 'Moriggl, Richard', 'Sexl, Veronika']","['Warsch W', 'Grundschober E', 'Berger A', 'Gille L', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Tigan AS', 'Hoelbl-Kovacic A', 'Valent P', 'Moriggl R', 'Sexl V']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Veterinary University Vienna, Veterinaerplatz 1, 1210 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'Disease Progression', 'Feedback, Physiological', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', '*Mutation', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2013/03/06 06:00,2013/08/13 06:00,['2013/03/06 06:00'],"['2013/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['806 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.806 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2012 Dec;3(12):1669-87. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.806.,,,PMC3681503,,['Cell Cycle. 2013 Jun 15;12(12):1813-4.

Consequently, TRAIL-based therapies aim to trigger apoptosis in cancer cells by providing the soluble TRAIL or monoclonal antibodies targeting the death receptors TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2. In this review, we start by highlighting the relevance of the tumor microenvironment in tumor development and elimination. We then address conventional and targeted therapeutic approaches for cancer treatment, highlighting the mechanisms involved or targeted. We describe the extrinsic and intrinsic pro-apoptotic pathways of TRAIL, together with the evidences for its pro-survival signaling, and with the relevance of these pathways in therapy. Possible mechanisms of resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis are highlighted (i.e. c-FLIP, Bcl-2, IAPs, p53, NF-kappa B) and the rationale for the combined administration of TRAIL with drugs targeting these mechanisms is provided. Preclinical data are reported and show encouraging evidences for TRAIL consideration in pediatric malignancies (i.e., leukemia, lymphomas, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, medulloblastoma). Clinical trials of TRAIL-based therapies on the overall population are in phase I or II, and we put particular focus on the pediatric population, on which only few trials have been conducted or are ongoing.

However, low incidence of CD8(+) T cell lymphoma was observed in B6 transgenic mice overexpressing a wild-type Stat5b (B6.Stat5b(Tg)) despite of undetectable Stat5b phosphorylation and the rate of lymphomagenesis was markedly enhanced by immunization or the introduction of TCR transgenes [1]. Here, we report that the wild-type Stat5b transgene leads to the acceleration and high incidence (74%) of CD8(+) T cell lymphoblastic lymphomas in the non-obese-diabetic (NOD) background. In contrast to the B6.Stat5b(Tg) mice, Stat5b in transgenic NOD (NOD.Stat5b(Tg)) mice is selectively and progressively phosphorylated in CD8(+) thymocytes. Stat5 phosphorylation also leads to up-regulation of many genes putatively relevant to tumorigenesis. Treatment of NOD.Stat5b(Tg) mice with cancer chemopreventive agents Apigenin and Xanthohumol efficiently blocked lymphomagenesis through reduction of Stat5 phosphorylation and genes up-regulated in the NOD.Stat5b(Tg) mice. These results suggest that NOD genetic background is critical to the Stat5b-mediated lymphomagenesis through regulation of Stat5 hyperactivation. NOD.Stat5b(Tg) mouse is an excellent model for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying lymphomagenesis and testing novel chemoprevention strategies.","['Chen, Bo', 'Yi, Bing', 'Mao, Rui', 'Liu, Haitao', 'Wang, Jinhua', 'Sharma, Ashok', 'Peiper, Stephen', 'Leonard, Warren J', 'She, Jin-Xiong']","['Chen B', 'Yi B', 'Mao R', 'Liu H', 'Wang J', 'Sharma A', 'Peiper S', 'Leonard WJ', 'She JX']","['Center for Biotechnology and Genomic Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/pharmacology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Thymocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2013/03/05 06:00,2013/08/29 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2012/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0056600 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-26378 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e56600. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0056600.

Despite of its clinical importance, little is known about the mechanism through which EVI1 confers resistance to antileukemic drugs. Here, we show that a human myeloid cell line constitutively overexpressing EVI1 after infection with a retroviral vector (U937_EVI1) was partially resistant to etoposide and daunorubicin as compared to empty vector infected control cells (U937_vec). Similarly, inducible expression of EVI1 in HL-60 cells decreased their sensitivity to daunorubicin. Gene expression microarray analyses of U937_EVI1 and U937_vec cells cultured in the absence or presence of etoposide showed that 77 and 419 genes were regulated by EVI1 and etoposide, respectively. Notably, mRNA levels of 26 of these genes were altered by both stimuli, indicating that EVI1 regulated genes were strongly enriched among etoposide regulated genes and vice versa. One of the genes that were induced by both EVI1 and etoposide was CDKN1A/p21/WAF, which in addition to its function as a cell cycle regulator plays an important role in conferring chemotherapy resistance in various tumor types. Indeed, overexpression of CDKN1A in U937 cells mimicked the phenotype of EVI1 overexpression, similarly conferring partial resistance to antileukemic drugs.","['Rommer, Anna', 'Steinmetz, Birgit', 'Herbst, Friederike', 'Hackl, Hubert', 'Heffeter, Petra', 'Heilos, Daniela', 'Filipits, Martin', 'Steinleitner, Katarina', 'Hemmati, Shayda', 'Herbacek, Irene', 'Schwarzinger, Ilse', 'Hartl, Katharina', 'Rondou, Pieter', 'Glimm, Hanno', 'Karakaya, Kadin', 'Kramer, Alwin', 'Berger, Walter', 'Wieser, Rotraud']","['Rommer A', 'Steinmetz B', 'Herbst F', 'Hackl H', 'Heffeter P', 'Heilos D', 'Filipits M', 'Steinleitner K', 'Hemmati S', 'Herbacek I', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Hartl K', 'Rondou P', 'Glimm H', 'Karakaya K', 'Kramer A', 'Berger W', 'Wieser R']","['Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",2013/03/05 06:00,2013/08/29 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2012/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0056308 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-22575 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e56308. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0056308.

DNA methylation plays a critical role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development, and presents an excellent target for treatment of this disease. However, it remains largely unknown how curcumin, a component of the popular Indian spice turmeric, plays a role in DNA hypomethylation to reactivate silenced tumor suppressor genes and to present a potential treatment option for AML. Here we show that curcumin down-regulates DNMT1 expression in AML cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo, and in primary AML cells ex vivo. Mechanistically, curcumin reduced the expression of positive regulators of DNMT1, p65 and Sp1, which correlated with a reduction in binding of these transcription factors to the DNMT1 promoter in AML cell lines. This curcumin-mediated down-regulation of DNMT1 expression was concomitant with p15(INK4B) tumor suppressor gene reactivation, hypomethylation of the p15(INK4B) promoter, G1 cell cycle arrest, and induction of tumor cell apoptosis in vitro. In mice implanted with the human AML MV4-11 cell line, administration of curcumin resulted in remarkable suppression of AML tumor growth. Collectively, our data indicate that curcumin shows promise as a potential treatment for AML, and our findings provide a basis for future studies to test the clinical efficacy of curcumin - whether used as a single agent or as an adjuvant - for AML treatment.","['Yu, Jianhua', 'Peng, Yong', 'Wu, Lai-Chu', 'Xie, Zhiliang', 'Deng, Youcai', 'Hughes, Tiffany', 'He, Shun', 'Mo, XiaoKui', 'Chiu, Ming', 'Wang, Qi-En', 'He, Xiaoming', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Liu, Zhongfa']","['Yu J', 'Peng Y', 'Wu LC', 'Xie Z', 'Deng Y', 'Hughes T', 'He S', 'Mo X', 'Chiu M', 'Wang QE', 'He X', 'Liu S', 'Grever MR', 'Chan KK', 'Liu Z']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.

Acute organ dysfunctions may impair the patient's ability to receive optimal chemotherapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: To compare 6-month complete remission rates in patients with and without acute kidney injury (AKI), we collected prospective data on 200 patients with newly diagnosed high-grade malignancies (non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 53.5%; acute myeloid leukemia, 29%; acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 11.5%; and Hodgkin disease, 6%). RESULTS: According to RIFLE criteria, 137 (68.5%) patients had AKI. Five causes of AKI accounted for 91.4% of cases: hypoperfusion, tumor lysis syndrome, tubular necrosis, nephrotoxic agents, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Half of the AKI patients received renal replacement therapy and 14.6% received suboptimal chemotherapy. AKI was associated with a lower 6-month complete remission rate (39.4% vs. 68.3%, P<0.01) and a higher mortality rate (47.4% vs. 30.2%, P<0.01) than patients without AKI.

The progress of bone marrow myelofibrosis is evaluated by a trephine examination and may be characterized by the biochemical markers of collagen turnover determination. OBJECTIVES: Investigation of serum prolidase activity and biochemical markers of collagen metabolism in order to establish its role in the development of bone marrow fibrosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The group of 37 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) before treatment, consisted of 16 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 7 with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), 8 with essential thrombocythopenia (ET), and 6 with polycythemia vera (PV). RESULTS: It was found that the plasma activity of prolidase (Pro) was reduced to almost half together with the serum level of osteocalcin (BGL), and hydroxyproline (H-PRO) in the serum and urine of patients with MPN in comparison to the control group. In the MPN group of patients, the levels of N-terminal procollagen III peptide (PIIINP), type I procollagen (PICP) and the C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) were significantly higher. CONCLUSIONS: The alteration of collagen turnover markers in the MPN patient group (the elevation of synthesis and inhibition of collagen catabolism rate) has suggested that a diminished prolidase activity may contribute to such alteration of collagen metabolism and should be consider a biomarker of MPN progress.","['Nowicka, Jadwiga', 'Nahaczewska, Wieslawa', 'Owczarek, Henryk', 'Wozniak, Mieczyslaw']","['Nowicka J', 'Nahaczewska W', 'Owczarek H', 'Wozniak M']","['Department of Medical Laboratory Diagnostics, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland. jnowicka3@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Adv Clin Exp Med,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,101138582,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.4.13.- (Dipeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.13.9 (proline dipeptidase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/*enzymology/physiopathology', 'Bone Remodeling', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Connective Tissue/pathology/physiopathology', 'Dipeptidases/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/05 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Adv Clin Exp Med. 2012 Nov-Dec;21(6):767-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this review is to present the reader with the epidemiological and morphological features of proliferative diseases in fish that have been associated with retroviruses by 1 or more of the following methods: detection of C-type retrovirus-like particles or reverse transcriptase activity in tumor tissues; successful tumor transmission trials using well-characterized, tumor-derived, cell-free inocula; or molecular characterization of the virus from spontaneous and experimentally induced tumors. Two of the diseases included in this review, European smelt spawning papillomatosis and bicolor damselfish neurofibromatosis, at one time were attributed to a retroviral etiology, but both are now believed to involve additional viral agents based on more recent investigations.

However, the impact of ALC relative to that of other prognostic factors on the outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated in recent trials is unknown. METHODS: Outcomes of 399 patients aged </=18 years with newly diagnosed ALL who were enrolled in the Total Therapy XV study at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital were analyzed according to ALC at the end of remission induction therapy. RESULTS: An ALC >/=500 cells/muL was significantly more prevalent among patients with B-lineage ALL, in those with favorable presenting features, and in those who achieved negative minimal residual disease (MRD) status on day 43 of treatment. Both overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were superior among patients with higher ALC, but only the association with OS was statistically significant in a univariate analysis. In multivariable analyses, ALC was not a significant predictor of outcome after controlling for age, leukocyte count, lineage, risk group, and MRD status at the end of induction (P > .1 for all comparisons). However, among MRD-negative patients, those with low ALC had a 5-year OS rate of 84.2% +/- 8.9% versus 97.3% +/- 1.0% for patients with higher ALC (P = .036). CONCLUSIONS: ALC at the end of induction is related to favorable presenting features and good initial treatment response but does not independently predict outcome in the context of contemporary, MRD-guided therapy.","['Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Campbell, Patrick', 'Zhou, Yinmei', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Bhojwani, Deepa', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Campana, Dario', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Rubnitz JE', 'Campbell P', 'Zhou Y', 'Sandlund JT', 'Jeha S', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Inaba H', 'Bhojwani D', 'Relling MV', 'Howard SC', 'Campana D', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. jeffrey.rubnitz@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2013/03/05 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2012/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28026 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2013 Jun 1;119(11):2061-6. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28026.

By contrast, central memory T cells reside within lymphoid tissues and require proliferation and differentiation to become effector cells that migrate to epithelial surfaces. The accumulation of effector memory T cells at the pathogen entry site(s) is essential for protective immunity, but the mechanisms that drive the differentiation of memory cell subsets are poorly understood. We recently showed that CD8alphaalpha, induced selectively on the most highly activated primary CD8alphabeta T cells, together with its ligand, the thymic leukemia (TL) antigen, induced on mucosal antigen-presenting cells and constitutively expressed on intestinal epithelial cells (IEC), serve as key components to mediate the selective accumulation of the fittest effector cells to form mucosal effector memory T cells. Therefore, the generation of mucosal effector memory is controlled by an innate-adaptive crosstalk that provides for host defense at the body's largest interface.","['Cheroutre, Hilde', 'Huang, Yujun']","['Cheroutre H', 'Huang Y']","['Division of Developmental Immunology, La Jolla Institute for Allergy & Immunology, San Diego, CA 92037, USA. hilde@liai.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 antigen, alpha chain)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,"['*Adaptive Immunity', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/cytology/immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', '*Immunity, Mucosal', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Intestinal Mucosa/cytology/immunology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/cytology/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*immunology']",2013/03/05 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4614-6217-0_5 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2013;785:43-7. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4614-6217-0_5.,,,PMC3913074,,,['R01 AI064584/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS549661'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we examined the consequences and mechanisms of TRAIL-induced MAPKs p38 and JNK in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. In apoptosis sensitive H460 cells, these kinases were phosphorylated, but not in resistant A549 cells. Time course experiments in H460 cells showed that induction of p38 phosphorylation preceded that of JNK. To explore the function of these kinases in apoptosis activation by TRAIL, chemical inhibitors or siRNAs were employed to impair JNK or p38 functioning. JNK activation counteracted TRAIL-induced apoptosis whereas activation of p38 stimulated apoptosis. Notably, the serine/threonine kinase RIP1 was cleaved following TRAIL treatment, concomitant with detectable JNK phosphorylation. Further examination of the role of RIP1 by short hairpin (sh)RNA-dependent knockdown or inhibition by necrostatin-1 showed that p38 can be phosphorylated in both RIP1-dependent and -independent manner, whereas JNK phosphorylation occurred independent of RIP1. On the other hand JNK appeared to suppress RIP1 cleavage via an unknown mechanism. In addition, only the activation of JNK by TRAIL was caspase-8-dependent. Finally, we identified Mcl-1, a known substrate for p38 and JNK, as a downstream modulator of JNK or p38 activity. Collectively, our data suggest in a subset of NSCLC cells a model in which TRAIL-induced activation of p38 and JNK have counteracting effects on Mcl-1 expression leading to pro- or anti-apoptotic effects, respectively. Strategies aiming to stimulate p38 and inhibit JNK may have benefit for TRAIL-based therapies in NSCLC.","['Azijli, Kaamar', 'Yuvaraj, Saravanan', 'van Roosmalen, Ingrid', 'Flach, Koen', 'Giovannetti, Elisa', 'Peters, Godefridus J', 'de Jong, Steven', 'Kruyt, Frank A E']","['Azijli K', 'Yuvaraj S', 'van Roosmalen I', 'Flach K', 'Giovannetti E', 'Peters GJ', 'de Jong S', 'Kruyt FA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, Groningen 9713 GZ, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (AGFG1 protein, human)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (necrostatin-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Caspase 8/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteolysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",2013/03/05 06:00,2013/12/24 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-013-0829-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2013 Jul;18(7):851-60. doi: 10.1007/s10495-013-0829-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most primary human tumors are resistant to monotherapy with TRAIL apoptogens, and thus the potential applicability of TRAIL in anti-tumor therapy ultimately depends on its rational combination with drugs targeting these resistances. In our high-throughput screening for novel agents/drugs that could sensitize TRAIL-resistant colorectal cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we found homoharringtonine (HHT), a cephalotaxus alkaloid and tested anti-leukemia drug, to be a very effective, low nanomolar enhancer of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis/growth suppression of these resistant cells. Co-treatment of TRAIL-resistant RKO or HT-29 cells with HHT and TRAIL led to the effective induction of apoptosis and the complete elimination of the treated cells. HHT suppressed the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and cFLIP and enhanced the TRAIL-triggered activation of JNK and p38 kinases. The shRNA-mediated down-regulation of cFLIP or Mcl-1 in HT-29 or RKO cells variably enhanced their TRAIL-induced apoptosis but it did not markedly sensitize them to TRAIL-mediated growth suppression. However, with the notable exception of RKO/sh cFLIP cells, the downregulation of cFLIP or Mcl-1 significantly lowered the effective concentration of HHT in HHT + TRAIL co-treatment. Combined HHT + TRAIL therapy also led to the strong suppression of HT-29 tumors implanted into immunodeficient mice. Thus, HHT represents a very efficient enhancer of TRAIL-induced apoptosis with potential application in TRAIL-based, anti-cancer combination therapy.","['Beranova, Lenka', 'Pombinho, Antonio R', 'Spegarova, Jarmila', 'Koc, Michal', 'Klanova, Magdalena', 'Molinsky, Jan', 'Klener, Pavel', 'Bartunek, Petr', 'Andera, Ladislav']","['Beranova L', 'Pombinho AR', 'Spegarova J', 'Koc M', 'Klanova M', 'Molinsky J', 'Klener P', 'Bartunek P', 'Andera L']","['Department of Cell Signaling & Apoptosis, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Videnska 1083, 14220 Praha 4, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'HT29 Cells', 'Harringtonines/*pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2013/03/05 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-013-0823-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2013 Jun;18(6):739-50. doi: 10.1007/s10495-013-0823-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rationale for this approach is based on similarities of immature normal T cells and developmentally arrested, malignant lymphoblasts in mammalian species.

SSC colonies had limited development after LIF removal alone, exhibiting low expression of meiotic (Scp3, Th2b) but not postmeiotic transcript, and loss of Stra8 and Dazl expression. SSCs co-cultured with Sertoli cells, hormones and vitamins developed spermatid-like cells expressing postmeiotic markers (TP1, TP2, Prm1) at levels over 2-fold higher than Sertoli cells or hormone/vitamins alone.

In this study, we used a series of bioinformatic, in vitro, and in vivo assays to assess the role of Notch signaling in human APL samples, and in a PML-RARA knock-in mouse model of APL (Ctsg-PML-RARA). We identified a Notch expression signature in both human primary APL cells and in Kit+Lin-Sca1+ cells from pre-leukemic Ctsg-PML-RARA mice. Both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of Notch signaling abrogated the enhanced self-renewal seen in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from pre-leukemic Ctsg-PML-RARA mice, but had no influence on cells from age-matched wild-type mice. In addition, six of nine murine APL tumors tested displayed diminished growth in vitro when Notch signaling was inhibited pharmacologically. Finally, we found that genetic inhibition of Notch signaling with a dominant-negative Mastermind-like protein reduced APL growth in vivo in a subset of tumors. These findings expand the role of Notch signaling in hematopoietic diseases, and further define the mechanistic events important for PML-RARA-mediated leukemogenesis.","['Grieselhuber, Nicole R', 'Klco, Jeffery M', 'Verdoni, Angela M', 'Lamprecht, Tamara', 'Sarkaria, Shawn M', 'Wartman, Lukas D', 'Ley, Timothy J']","['Grieselhuber NR', 'Klco JM', 'Verdoni AM', 'Lamprecht T', 'Sarkaria SM', 'Wartman LD', 'Ley TJ']","['Section of Stem Cell Biology, Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Section of Stem Cell Biology, Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Section of Stem Cell Biology, Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Section of Stem Cell Biology, Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Section of Stem Cell Biology, Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Section of Stem Cell Biology, Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (JAG1 protein, human)', '0 (Jag1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Jagged-1 Protein)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Serrate-Jagged Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Cathepsin G)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Ctsg protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cathepsin G/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Jagged-1 Protein', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Serrate-Jagged Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology']",2013/03/05 06:00,2013/09/17 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2013/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/leu.2013.68 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Jul;27(7):1548-1557. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.68.

The inhibition of oncogenic B-RAF with highly targeted compounds has produced remarkable albeit short-lived clinical responses in B-RAF mutant melanoma patients. Reactivation of signaling downstream of B-RAF is frequently associated with acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibitors, and the identification of B-RAF targets may provide new strategies for managing melanoma. Oncogenic B-RAF(V600E) is known to promote the stabilizing phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, implicated in melanoma survival and chemoresistance. We now show that B-RAF(V600E) signaling also induces the transcription of Mcl-1 in melanocytes and melanoma. We demonstrate that activation of STAT3 serine-727 and tyrosine-705 phosphorylations is promoted by B-RAF(V600E) activity and that the Mcl-1 promoter is dependent on a STAT consensus-site for B-RAF-mediated activation. Consequently, suppression of STAT3 activity disrupted B-RAF(V600E)-mediated induction of Mcl-1 and reduced melanoma cell survival. We propose that STAT3 has a central role in the survival and contributes to chemoresistance of B-RAF(V600E) melanoma.","['Becker, T M', 'Boyd, S C', 'Mijatov, B', 'Gowrishankar, K', 'Snoyman, S', 'Pupo, G M', 'Scolyer, R A', 'Mann, G J', 'Kefford, R F', 'Zhang, X D', 'Rizos, H']","['Becker TM', 'Boyd SC', 'Mijatov B', 'Gowrishankar K', 'Snoyman S', 'Pupo GM', 'Scolyer RA', 'Mann GJ', 'Kefford RF', 'Zhang XD', 'Rizos H']","['Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, University of Sydney at Westmead Millennium Institute, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, University of Sydney at Westmead Millennium Institute, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, University of Sydney at Westmead Millennium Institute, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, University of Sydney at Westmead Millennium Institute, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, University of Sydney at Westmead Millennium Institute, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, University of Sydney at Westmead Millennium Institute, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Melanoma Institute Australia, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', '1] Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, University of Sydney at Westmead Millennium Institute, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia [2] Melanoma Institute Australia, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', '1] Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, University of Sydney at Westmead Millennium Institute, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia [2] Melanoma Institute Australia, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Immunology and Oncology Unit, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, University of Sydney at Westmead Millennium Institute, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Melanocytes/metabolism', 'Melanoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics']",2013/03/05 06:00,2014/04/25 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201345 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.45 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2014 Feb 27;33(9):1158-66. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.45.

Although there have been numerous studies dissecting the role of PI3K signaling in different cell types and disease models, the mechanism by which PI3K signaling regulates embryonic stem (ES) cell fate remains unclear. It is believed that in addition to proliferation and tumorigenesis, PI3K activity may also be important for ES cell self-renewal. Paling et al. reported that the inhibition of PI3K led to a reduction in the ability of leukemia inhibitory factor to maintain self-renewal, causing cells to differentiate. Studies in our lab have revealed that ES cells completely lacking glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) remain undifferentiated compared with wild-type ES cells. GSK-3 is negatively regulated by PI3K, suggesting that PI3K may have a vital role in maintaining pluripotency in ES cells through GSK-3. By using a modified Flp recombinase system, we expressed activated alleles of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 and protein kinase B to create stable, isogenic ES cell lines to further study the role of the PI3K signaling pathway in stem cell fate determination. In vitro characterization of the transgenic cell lines revealed a strong tendency toward the maintenance of pluripotency, and this phenotype was found to be independent of canonical Wnt signal transduction. In summary, PI3K signaling is sufficient to maintain the self-renewal and survival of stem cells. As this pathway is frequently mutationally activated in cancers, its effect on suppressing differentiation may contribute to its oncogenicity.","['Ling, L S', 'Voskas, D', 'Woodgett, J R']","['Ling LS', 'Voskas D', 'Woodgett JR']","['1] Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada [2] Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Pdpk1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Teratoma/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",2013/03/05 06:00,2014/02/14 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2012/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201344 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.44 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Nov 21;32(47):5397-408. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.44.

In most cases, this defect can be overcome by treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), leading to complete clinical remission. Cyclic AMP signaling has a key role in retinoid treatment efficacy: it enhances ATRA-induced maturation in ATRA-sensitive APL cells (including NB4 cells) and restores it in some ATRA-resistant cells (including NB4-LR1 cells). We show that the two cell types express identical levels of the Calpha catalytic subunit and comparable global cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) enzyme activity. However, the maturation-resistant NB4-LR1 cells have a PKA isozyme switch: compared with the NB4 cells, they have decreased content of the juxtanuclearly located PKA regulatory subunit IIalpha and PKA regulatory subunit IIbeta, and a compensatory increase of the generally cytoplasmically distributed PKA-RIalpha. Furthermore, the PKA regulatory subunit II exists mainly in the less cAMP-responsive nonautophosphorylated state in the NB4-LR1 cells. By the use of isozyme-specific cAMP analog pairs, we show that both PKA-I and PKA-II must be activated to achieve maturation in NB4-LR1 as well as NB4 cells. Therefore, special attention should be paid to activating not only PKA-I but also PKA-II in attempts to enhance ATRA-induced APL maturation in a clinical setting.","['Nguyen, Eric', 'Gausdal, Gro', 'Varennes, Jacqueline', 'Pendino, Frederic', 'Lanotte, Michel', 'Doskeland, Stein Ove', 'Segal-Bendirdjian, Evelyne']","['Nguyen E', 'Gausdal G', 'Varennes J', 'Pendino F', 'Lanotte M', 'Doskeland SO', 'Segal-Bendirdjian E']","['Institut National de la Sante et de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR)-S 1007, Homeostasis and Cancer, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type I)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type I/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type II/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2013/03/05 06:00,2013/09/12 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.112.081034 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.112.081034 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2013 May;83(5):1057-65. doi: 10.1124/mol.112.081034.

Using quantitative proteomics, we identified p16(INK4a) as the key target mediating the effects of HLX1 in senescence. HLX1 represses p16(INK4a) transcription by recruiting PRCs and HDAC1. This mechanism has broader implications, as HLX1 also regulates a subset of PRC targets besides p16(INK4a). Finally, sampling members of the Homeobox family, we identified multiple genes with ability to repress p16(INK4a). Among them, we found HOXA9 (Homeobox A9), a putative oncogene in leukaemia, which also recruits PRCs and HDAC1 to regulate p16(INK4a). Our results reveal an unexpected and conserved interplay between homeodomain-containing proteins and PRCs with implications in senescence, development and cancer.","['Martin, Nadine', 'Popov, Nikolay', 'Aguilo, Francesca', ""O'Loghlen, Ana"", 'Raguz, Selina', 'Snijders, Ambrosius P', 'Dharmalingam, Gopuraja', 'Li, Side', 'Thymiakou, Efstathia', 'Carroll, Thomas', 'Zeisig, Bernd B', 'So, Chi Wai Eric', 'Peters, Gordon', 'Episkopou, Vasso', 'Walsh, Martin J', 'Gil, Jesus']","['Martin N', 'Popov N', 'Aguilo F', ""O'Loghlen A"", 'Raguz S', 'Snijders AP', 'Dharmalingam G', 'Li S', 'Thymiakou E', 'Carroll T', 'Zeisig BB', 'So CW', 'Peters G', 'Episkopou V', 'Walsh MJ', 'Gil J']","['Cell Proliferation Group, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (HLX protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)']",IM,"['Cellular Senescence/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2013/03/05 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2012/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['emboj201337 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2013.37 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2013 Apr 3;32(7):982-95. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2013.37.

The potential role of cancer chemotherapy and other cancer-directed treatment approaches is discussed in the context of their potential role in helping to eliminate HIV from the infected host. RECENT FINDINGS: Cancer chemotherapy and other cancer-targeted agents have been used successfully in treating a variety of malignancies in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals. Lessons learned from these strategies may be of importance in helping to define more effective ways of controlling and eliminating HIV as well. Application of these anticancer strategies to patients with HIV are beginning to be explored and may help determine their potential usefulness in this disease as well. SUMMARY: Although cytotoxic chemotherapy is a crude and not particularly effective way of removing HIV latently infected cells and tissue reservoirs, several new approaches to targeting and controlling cancer proliferation may be of value in HIV cure research and may one day help to end this disease.","['Mitsuyasu, Ronald']",['Mitsuyasu R'],"['David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, UCLA Center for Clinical AIDS Research and Education (CARE Center), University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90035, USA. rmitsuya@mednet.ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin HIV AIDS,Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,101264945,,IM,"['HIV Infections/surgery/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/surgery/*therapy']",2013/03/05 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/COH.0b013e32835ef0a1 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin HIV AIDS. 2013 May;8(3):224-9. doi: 10.1097/COH.0b013e32835ef0a1.,,,PMC3789644,,,"['UL1TR000124/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1 AI069424/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 28697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI028697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI069424/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 MH087222/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'MH 087222/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 121947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000124/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 069424/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA121947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS518534'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Splenomegaly may constitute the first clinical sign leading to the diagnosis of a hematologic malignancy. Vice versa, the presence, or suspicion of a hematologic malignancy requires investigation of the spleen. In case of splenomegaly of unknown origin, directed history, clinical examination, and laboratory testing including a complete blood count with microscopic investigation of a peripheral blood smear, frequently allow to establish a tentative diagnosis. Whenever possible, further specific testing should be based on a thorough primary evaluation to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures. In light of the current diagnostic options, diagnostic splenectomy can usually be avoided to establish definitive diagnosis. Indolent lymphomas (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, hairy cell leukaemia, splenic marginal zone lymphoma) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (chronic myeloid leukaemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, primary and secondary myelofibrosis) are the most prevalent hematologic malignancies associated with splenomegaly.

The mechanism of LH induced tumour cell apoptosis was investigated. MAIN METHODS: Human promyelocytic leukaemia cells (HL 60) were cultured to observe inhibition in vitro. Two animal models, a solid tumour and a non-entity myeloid leukaemia tumour, were used to determine the effect of LH in vivo. The former, fifty BALB/c nude mice were transplanted with HL 60 cells. The tumours were isolated completely and weighed after treatment. The latter, fifty BALB/c mice were injected intravenously with transplantable erythroblastic leukaemia cells (EL9611 cells). The survival time of mice was recorded and organs were used for histological study. The mechanism about tumour cell apoptosis was evaluated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and transmission electron microscope for morphological assays. KEY FINDINGS: The LH inhibited tumour cell proliferation and the inhibitions were dependent on both the concentration and the dose; the best inhibition rate was up to 70% of the untreated control in vitro. It markedly inhibited the growth of a transplanted tumour with HL 60 cells in an immune-deficient nude mouse model. LH was also able to prolong the survival time of leukaemia mice with transplanted EL9611 cells and prevent the infiltration of leukaemia cells to the main internal organs. SIGNIFICANCE: The LH peptide is an excellent inhibitor of tumour cell growth. These data provide the experimental foundation to use the LH peptide as a candidate for antitumour drugs in the future.","['Li, Hao', 'Zhong, Jinchao', 'Huang, Meijuan', 'Li, Ziran', 'Rao, Pingfan']","['Li H', 'Zhong J', 'Huang M', 'Li Z', 'Rao P']","['College of Biological Science and Technology, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, Fujian 350108, China. lihao777@126.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (prolyl-leucyl-leucyl-glutaminyl-lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Equidae', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Oligopeptides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Serum Albumin/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Survival Rate', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2013/03/05 06:00,2013/06/21 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2012/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0024-3205(13)00118-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2013.02.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2013 May 20;92(17-19):883-9. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2013.02.013.

The extract exerted significant antioxidant activity as verified by DPPH, hydroxyl radical, lipid peroxidation and protective oxidative DNA damage assays. The results were comparable to standard antioxidants like alpha-tocopherol, catechin and BHT used in such experiments. Antioxidant potential of G. kurroo may be attributed to the presence of high phenolic and flavonoid content (73+/-1.02 and 46+/-2.05 mg/g extract respectively). The anti-proliferative property of Gentiana kurroo root extract was determined by sulphorhodamine B (SRB) assay against Human colon cancer cell line (HCT-116), Lung carcinoma cell line (A-549), Pancreatic cancer cell line (MiaPaCa-2), Lung cancer cell line (HOP-62) and acute monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1). G. kurroo root extract inhibited cancer cell growth depending upon the cell line used and in a dose dependent manner. The extract induced potent apoptotic effects in MiaPaCa-2 cells. The population of apoptotic cells increased from 11.4% in case of control to 49.6% at 100 mug/ml of G. kurroo root extract. The extract also induced a remarkable decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) leading to apoptosis of cancer cells used.

The underlying mechanism for this trans-tail signaling pathway is poorly defined in higher eukaryotes. Here, we show the following: (1) ASH2L in the MLL complex is essential for H2Bub-dependent H3 K4 methylation. Deleting or mutating K99 of the N-terminal winged helix (WH) motif in ASH2L abrogates H2Bub-dependent regulation. (2) Crosstalk can occur in trans and does not require ubiquitin to be on nucleosomes or histones to exert regulatory effects. (3) trans-regulation by ubiquitin promotes MLL activity for all three methylation states. (4) MLL3, an MLL homolog, does not respond to H2Bub, highlighting regulatory specificity for MLL family histone methyltransferases. Altogether, our results potentially expand the classic histone crosstalk to nonhistone proteins, which broadens the scope of chromatin regulation by ubiquitylation signaling.","['Wu, Lipeng', 'Lee, Shirley Y', 'Zhou, Bo', 'Nguyen, Uyen T T', 'Muir, Tom W', 'Tan, Song', 'Dou, Yali']","['Wu L', 'Lee SY', 'Zhou B', 'Nguyen UT', 'Muir TW', 'Tan S', 'Dou Y']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,"['0 (ASH2L protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitin C)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (UBE2D3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Gene Expression', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*chemistry', 'Histones/*chemistry/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*chemistry', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Nucleosomes', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics', 'Ubiquitin C/chemistry', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/chemistry', '*Ubiquitination', 'Xenopus', 'Xenopus Proteins/chemistry']",2013/03/05 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2012/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S1097-2765(13)00097-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.molcel.2013.01.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell. 2013 Mar 28;49(6):1108-20. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2013.01.033.

We aimed to compare two dosing regimens of tosedostat. METHODS: In this randomised phase 2 study, patients aged 60 years or older with AML that had relapsed after a first complete remission lasting less than 12 months, or had achieved no previous complete remission, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive as first salvage tosedostat 120 mg once daily for 6 months or 240 mg once daily for 2 months followed by 120 mg for 4 months. Randomisation was by block method via an interactive web response system using a randomisation schedule generated by an external vendor, with no stratification. The study was open label. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who obtained a complete remission or complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery. Analyses included all patients randomly assigned to treatment groups who received at least one oral dose of tosedostat. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00780598. FINDINGS: 38 patients were randomly assigned to receive tosedostat 120 mg and 38 to receive the tosedostat 240 mg to 120 mg regimen. 38 patients in the 120 mg group and 35 in the 240 mg to 120 mg group received tosedostat. Seven patients (10%) had complete remission or complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery: two (5%) in the 120 mg group and five (14%) in the 240 mg to 120 mg group. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were febrile neutropenia (11 [29%] patients in the 120 mg group and ten [29%] of the 240 mg to 120 mg group), thrombocytopenia (eight [21%] and eight [23%] patients), fatigue (seven [18%] and eight [23%] patients), dyspnoea (five [13%] and seven [20%] patients), and pneumonia (four [11%] and six [17%] patients). There were five fatal adverse events deemed to be treatment-related: three in the 120 mg group and two in the 240 mg to 120 mg group. The events were acute hepatitis, respiratory failure, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular dysfunction. INTERPRETATION: Tosedostat, at either dose schedule, has activity in older patients with relapsed or refractory AML. Additional studies of tosedostat including combination with hypomethylating agents and low-dose cytarabine in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and AML are ongoing or planned.

Its prognostic and therapeutic features are poorly documented because most reports deal with single cases or small series. OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the characteristics of patients with scleromyxedema regarding demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, therapeutic interventions, and course. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective and prospective multicenter study. RESULTS: We identified 30 patients with scleromyxedema (17 men and 13 women). The mean age at diagnosis was 59 years. The mean delay between disease onset and diagnosis was 9 months. Monoclonal gammopathy was detected in 27 patients. Extracutaneous manifestations were present in 19 patients including neurologic (30%), rheumatologic (23.3%), and cardiac (20%) manifestations. Two patients developed hematologic malignancies. The most common therapies included oral steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins. Although corticosteroids were ineffective, intravenous immunoglobulins (alone or in combination with other drugs) induced complete remission in 4 and partial remission in 9 patients with a mean treatment duration of 2 years. In all, 21 patients were followed up for a mean period of 33.5 months, at which time 16 patients were alive, 12 with and 4 without skin disease. Five patients died: 2 with dermatoneuro syndrome and 1 each with myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and myocardial insufficiency. LIMITATIONS: This is mainly a retrospective study. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that scleromyxedema is a chronic and unpredictable disease with severe systemic manifestations leading to a guarded prognosis. There is no specific definitive treatment. Our data support the contention that intravenous immunoglobulin is a relatively effective and safe treatment.

The phytochemicals present in the fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants are getting attention day-by-day for their active role in the prevention of several human diseases. Abrus precatorius is a widely distributed tropical medicinal plant with several therapeutic properties. Therefore in the present study, A. precatorius leaf extracts were examined for their antioxidant and cytotoxic properties in vitro in order to discover resources for new lead structures or to improve the traditional medicine. METHODS: In this study, antioxidant and antiproliferative properties of the different leaf extracts (hexane, ethyl acetate, ethanol and water) from A. precatorius were investigated along with the quantification of the polyphenol and flavonoid contents. The ability of deactivating free radicals was extensively investigated with in vitro biochemical methods like DPPH(), ()OH, NO, SO(2-) scavenging assays and inhibition capability of Fe(II)-induced lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, antiproliferative activities using different human cancer cell lines and primary cell line was carried out by MTT method. RESULTS: Total phenolic content and total flavonoid content of the extracts were found in the range of 1.65 +/- 0.22 to 25.48 +/- 0.62 GAE mg/g dw and 6.20 +/- 0.41 to 17.16 +/- 1.04 QE mg/g dw respectively. The experimental results further revealed that A. precatorius extracts showed strong antiradical properties, capable to chelate Fe(2+) and possess good inhibition ability of lipid peroxidation. In addition, as a first step towards the identification of phytoconstituents endowed with potent chemopreventive activities, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of A. precatorius extracts on the proliferation of four different human tumour cell lines such as human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Colo-205), human retinoblastoma cancer cells (Y79), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) and Leukemia cells (SupT1). Ethanol extract (APA) and ethyl acetate extract (APE) of A. precatorius had apparent capabilities of inhibiting the survival of tested human cancer cell lines. Moreover, it was observed that the A. precatorius extracts did not inhibit the growth of mice peritoneal macrophages, thus confirming that plants extracts are selective against the cancer cell lines. CONCLUSION: This work provides a scientific support for the high antioxidant and antiproliferative activity of this plant and thus it may find potential applications in the treatment of the diseases caused by ROS.

These molecules generally share three common structural features: a trimethoxy ""A""-ring, a ""B""-ring containing substituent often at C3' and C4', and an ethene bridge between the two rings, which provides necessary structural rigidity. Members of the combretastatin family possess varying ability to cause vascular disruption in tumors. Combretastatin binds to the colchicine binding site of beta-subunit of tubulin. Despite having a similar name, combretastatin is unrelated to statins, a family of cholesterol-lowering drugs. RESULTS: New combretastatin 2-(1-acetyl-1H-indole-3-yl)-3-(phenyl) propenoic analogues (2a to 2y), bearing indole moiety at the place of ring A of combretastatin (CA4), were synthesized and evaluated for anticancer activity against various cancer cell lines such as THP-1 (leukemia), A-549 (lung), IGROV-1 (ovary), HEP-2 (liver), MCF-7 (breast), and DU-145 (prostate). Compound 2d showed anti-cancer activity against THP-1 and MCF-7 with IC50 0.80 and 0.37 muM, respectively, and 2y showed against MCF-7 with IC50 3.60 muM comparable to paclitaxel. CONCLUSIONS: The target compounds bind to the colchicine binding site which is situated at alpha and beta interface of tubulin and prevent polymerization as it was confirmed by immunofluorescence technique. The molecular docking further confirmed the binding of the potent compound 2d to the colchicine binding site at alpha and beta interface of tubulin.","['Kumar, Sunil', 'Mehndiratta, Samir', 'Nepali, Kunal', 'Gupta, Manish K', 'Koul, Surrinder', 'Sharma, Parduman R', 'Saxena, Ajit K', 'Dhar, Kanaya L']","['Kumar S', 'Mehndiratta S', 'Nepali K', 'Gupta MK', 'Koul S', 'Sharma PR', 'Saxena AK', 'Dhar KL']","['Laboratory for Drug Design and Synthesis, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Indo-Soviet Friendship (ISF) College of Pharmacy, Moga, Punjab 142 001, India. suniliftm1982@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Org Med Chem Lett,Organic and medicinal chemistry letters,101553172,,,,2013/03/05 06:00,2013/03/05 06:01,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2012/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/05 06:01 [medline]']","['2191-2858-3-3 [pii]', '10.1186/2191-2858-3-3 [doi]']",epublish,Org Med Chem Lett. 2013 Mar 3;3(1):3. doi: 10.1186/2191-2858-3-3.,20130303,,PMC3599526,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In rodents, its homologous gene, ADIP, plays an important role in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration, underlying its potential role in promoting metastasis of other cancers. METHODS: To investigate the correlation between the expression level of SSX2IP and the clinicopathologic factors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 53 cases were studied by qPCR and statisted. To directly testing SSX2IP's contribution to HCC in animal models, 45 nude mice were enrolled in peritoneal spreading and liver metastasis models. For the migration and invasion assays, cell culture experiments were performed using QCMTM 24-Well Colorimetric Migration Assay Kit and Cell Invasion Assay Kit (Millipore). Moreover we examined the influence of SSX2IP overexpression on the chemosensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to two most common chemotherapy drugs (5-Fu and CDDP) using Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). The chemotherapeutic drugs sensitivity was evaluated by IC50 parameter. RESULTS: Statistical analysis of clinical cases revealed that the SSX2IP high expression group had inclinations towards larger tumor size, more tumor thrombus and shorter survival period, implying a strong correlation between the expression level of SSX2IP and HCC tumorigenesis. Consistently in abdominal cavity metastasis and liver metastasis models of immune-deficient mice, SSX2IP was able to promote the metastasis of hepatoma cells. At the cytological level, SSX2IP stimulates the wound healing, metastasis and invasion of hepatoma cells, and reduces the sensitivity of hepatoma cells to 5-Fu and CDDP. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that SSX2IP promotes the development and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma and contributes to the drug resistance of hepatoma cells, suggesting that SSX2IP is expected to become a new diagnostic and prognostic marker and a new target of the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.","['Li, Pu', 'Lin, Ying', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Zhu, Zhenggang', 'Huo, Keke']","['Li P', 'Lin Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhu Z', 'Huo K']","[""State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Genetics, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, 220 Handan Rd, Shanghai 200433, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Ssx2ip protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Metastasis']",2013/03/05 06:00,2013/08/10 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2012/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-11-52 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-11-52 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2013 Mar 1;11:52. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-11-52.,20130301,,PMC3599991,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the data quality criteria from NCCR, data from 104 registries covering 85,470,522 people (57,489,009 in urban areas and 27,981,513 in rural areas) were checked and evaluated. The data from 72 registries were qualified and accepted for the cancer registry annual report in 2012. The total cancer incident cases and cancer deaths were 244,366 and 154,310, respectively. The morphologically verified cases accounted for 67.23%, and 3.14% of the incident cases only had information from death certifications. The crude incidence in the Chinese cancer registration areas was 285.91/100,000 (317.97/100,000 in males and 253.09/100,000 in females). The age-standardized rates for incidences based on the Chinese standard population (ASRIC) and the world standard population (ASRIW) were 146.87/100,000 and 191.72/100,000, respectively, with a cumulative incidence of 22.08%. The cancer mortality in the Chinese cancer registration areas was 180.54/100,000 (224.20/100,000 in males and 135.85/100,000 in females). The age-standardized rates for mortalities based on the Chinese standard population(ASRMC) and the world standard population (ASRMW) were 85.06/100,000 and 115.65/100,000, respectively, and the cumulative mortality was 12.94%. Lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, encephaloma, lymphoma, female breast cancer, and cervical cancer were the most common cancers, accounting for 75% of all cancer cases. Lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, encephaloma, leukemia, and lymphoma accounted for 80% of all cancer deaths. The cancer registration's population coverage has been increasing, and its data quality is improving. As the basis of the cancer control program, the cancer registry plays an important role in directing anticancer strategies in the medium and long term. Because cancer burdens are different in urban and rural areas in China, prevention and control efforts should be based on practical situations.","['Chen, Wanqing', 'Zheng, Rongshou', 'Zhang, Siwei', 'Zhao, Ping', 'Li, Guanglin', 'Wu, Lingyou', 'He, Jie']","['Chen W', 'Zheng R', 'Zhang S', 'Zhao P', 'Li G', 'Wu L', 'He J']","[""National Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, National Cancer Center, Beijing, People's Republic of China. chenwq@cicams.ac.cn""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Chin J Cancer,Chinese journal of cancer,101498232,,IM,"['China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*mortality', 'Registries']",2013/03/05 06:00,2013/11/15 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['cjc.013.10018 [pii]', '10.5732/cjc.013.10018 [doi]']",ppublish,Chin J Cancer. 2013 Mar;32(3):106-12. doi: 10.5732/cjc.013.10018.,,,PMC3845591,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to apply reversible intermolecular hybridization to program cell-hydrogel interactions in physiological conditions based on DNA-antibody chimeras and complementary oligonucleotides. The results showed that DNA oligonucleotides could be captured to and released from the immobilizing DNA-functionalized hydrogels with high specificity via DNA hybridization. Accordingly, DNA-antibody chimeras were captured to the hydrogels, successfully inducing specific cell attachment. The cell attachment to the hydrogels reached the plateau at approximately half an hour after the functionalized hydrogels and the cells were incubated together. The attached cells were rapidly released from the bound hydrogels when triggering complementary oligonucleotides were introduced to the system. However, the capability of the triggering complementary oligonucleotides in releasing cells was affected by the length of intermolecular hybridization. The length needed to be at least more than 20 base pairs in the current experimental setting. Notably, because the procedure of intermolecular hybridization did not involve any harsh condition, the released cells maintained the same viability as that of the cultured cells. The functionalized hydrogels also exhibited the potential to catch and release cells repeatedly. Therefore, this study demonstrates that it is promising to regulate cell-material interactions dynamically through the DNA-programmed display of DNA-protein chimeras.","['Zhang, Zhaoyang', 'Li, Shihui', 'Chen, Niancao', 'Yang, Cheng', 'Wang, Yong']","['Zhang Z', 'Li S', 'Chen N', 'Yang C', 'Wang Y']","['Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06269, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Biomacromolecules,Biomacromolecules,100892849,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hydrogels)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antibodies/*chemistry/immunology', 'Aptamers, Nucleotide/chemistry', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA/*chemistry/immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/immunology', 'Humans', 'Hybridization, Genetic', 'Hydrogels/*chemistry', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry']",2013/03/05 06:00,2013/09/27 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bm400096z [doi]'],ppublish,Biomacromolecules. 2013 Apr 8;14(4):1174-80. doi: 10.1021/bm400096z.

Co-treatment with celecoxib and doxorubicin significantly inhibited cell growth and induced cell apoptosis in the acute leukemia cell line HL60 and primary AML cells. The growth inhibition effect was accompanied by down-regulation of the expression of cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), the key regulators of cell cycle progression, which was associated with arrest of cells at G0/G1 phase. The pro-apoptotic effect was accompanied by down-regulation of the expression of survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein, which mediated anti-apoptosis in AML cells.

Our data show that the expression of CD105 and CD117 is critical for the distinction between four phenotypically different developmental stages of nucleated erythroid progenitors: pro-erythroblasts, basophilic erythroblasts, polychromatophilic erythroblasts and orthochromatophilic erythroblasts.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of volume replacement (VR) during therapeutic leukapheresis (TA) procedure on early mortality rate and WBC reduction. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 29 patients who underwent TA from 2007 to 2011. Fifteen of the patients underwent TA procedure with VR and 14 of the patients underwent TA procedure without VR. RESULTS: WBC reduction was significantly higher in patients who underwent TA with VR (p < 0.001). Early mortality rate was significantly lower in leukemia patients who underwent TA with VR than in patients who underwent TA without VR (p < 0.01); early mortality rates were 6.7% for 7-day and 13.8% for 100-day survivals. The mortality rates in the TA without VR group, however, were 42.9 and 71.4% for 7- and 100-day survivals, respectively. CONCLUSION: Decreased early mortality rate in TA with VR group may be associated with prompt reduction of WBCs achieved with TA with VR and may also be associated with removal of the cytokines related to leukostasis. TA with VR would give more time for induction chemotherapy and increased overall survival rate.","['Kurnaz, Fatih', 'Sivgin, Serdar', 'Pala, Cigdem', 'Yildirim, Rahsan', 'Baldane, Suleyman', 'Kaynar, Leylagul', 'Solmaz, Musa', 'Ozturk, Ahmet', 'Eser, Bulent', 'Cetin, Mustafa', 'Unal, Ali']","['Kurnaz F', 'Sivgin S', 'Pala C', 'Yildirim R', 'Baldane S', 'Kaynar L', 'Solmaz M', 'Ozturk A', 'Eser B', 'Cetin M', 'Unal A']","['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Harran University, Sanliurfa, Turkey; Stem Cell Transplantation Hospital, Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey; Department of Internal Medicine, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey; Department of Biostatistics, Faculty of Medicine, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey; Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Ataturk University, Erzurum, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis/*methods', 'Leukemia/blood/therapy', 'Leukocyte Reduction Procedures/*methods', 'Leukocytosis/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",2013/03/05 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/03/05 06:00'],"['2012/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/trf.12141 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2013 Nov;53(11):2629-34. doi: 10.1111/trf.12141.

STAT5 has two isoforms: STAT5A and STAT5B (commonly referred to as STAT5) which, in T cells, play redundant roles transcribing cell cycle and survival genes. As such, inhibition of STAT5 by a variety of mechanisms can rapidly induce apoptosis in certain lymphoid tumor cells, suggesting that it and its target genes represent therapeutic targets to control certain lymphoid diseases. To search for these molecules we aligned IL-2 regulated genes detected by Affymetrix gene expression microarrays with the STAT5 cistrome identified by chip-on-ChIP analysis in an IL-2-dependent human leukemia cell line, Kit225. Select overlapping genes were then validated using qRT(2)PCR medium-throughput arrays in human PHA-activated PBMCs. Of 19 putative genes, one key regulator of T cell receptor signaling, PDE4B, was identified as a novel target, which was readily up-regulated at the protein level (3 h) in IL-2 stimulated, activated human PBMCs. Surprisingly, only purified CD8+ primary T-cells expressed PDE4B, but not CD4+ cells. Moreover, PDE4B was found to be highly expressed in CD4+ lymphoid cancer cells, which suggests that it may represent a physiological role unique to the CD8+ and lymphoid cancer cells and thus might represent a target for pharmaceutical intervention for certain lymphoid diseases.","['Nagy, Zsuzsanna S', 'Ross, Jeremy A', 'Rodriguez, Georgialina', 'Balint, Balint L', 'Szeles, Lajos', 'Nagy, Laszlo', 'Kirken, Robert A']","['Nagy ZS', 'Ross JA', 'Rodriguez G', 'Balint BL', 'Szeles L', 'Nagy L', 'Kirken RA']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas, United States of America. nagyzsu@med.unideb.hu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*physiology', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*genetics']",2013/03/02 06:00,2013/09/28 06:00,['2013/03/02 06:00'],"['2012/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0057326 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-27391 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e57326. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0057326.

However, 30-40% of B-NHL patients are unresponsive to rituximab or resistant after therapy. Human phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 4 (hPEBP4) is a novel member of PEBP family and functions as an anti-apoptotic molecule. In this study, we found hPEBP4 to be expressed in up to 90% of B-cell lymphoma patients, but in only 16.7% of normal lymph nodes. Interestingly, hPEBP4 overexpression inhibited rituximab-mediated complement dependent cytotoxicity (R-CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in B-NHL cells while downregulation of hPEBP4 augmented the therapeutic efficacy of rituximab both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, hPEBP4 silencing sensitized the primary B-acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) cells to R-CDC. During rituximab-mediated complement dependent cytotoxicity, hPEBP4 was recruited to the cell membrane in a PE-binding domain dependent manner and inhibited R-CDC induced calcium flux and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These events contributed to the decrease of cell death induced by R-CDC in B-cell lymphomas. Meanwhile, hPEBP4 knockdown potentiated the chemosensitization of the rituximab in B-cell lymphoma cells by regulating the expression of Bcl-xl, Cycline E, p21(waf/cip1) and p53 and the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Considering that hPEBP4 conferred cellular resistance to rituximab treatment and was preferentially expressed in lymphoma tissue, it could be a potential valuable target for adjuvant therapy for B-cell lymphoma.","['Wang, Kai', 'Jiang, Yu', 'Zheng, Weiyan', 'Liu, Zhiyong', 'Li, Hui', 'Lou, Jianzhou', 'Gu, Meidi', 'Wang, Xiaojian']","['Wang K', 'Jiang Y', 'Zheng W', 'Liu Z', 'Li H', 'Lou J', 'Gu M', 'Wang X']","[""Department of Respiratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (PE-binding protein 4, human)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamine Binding Protein)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Phosphatidylethanolamine Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Rituximab']",2013/03/02 06:00,2013/09/04 06:00,['2013/03/02 06:00'],"['2012/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0056829 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-30731 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e56829. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0056829.

A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) cleaves the proheparin-binding epidermal growth factor like growth factor (proHB-EGF). And soluble HB-EGF activates EGFR. In parallel, the carboxy-terminal fragment of proHB-EGF (HB-EGF-CTF) translocates into the inner nuclear membrane, and subsequently exerts on the regulation of cell proliferation by binding nuclear promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein, a transcriptional repressor, thereby causing its nuclear export. We hypothesized that the inhibition of HB-EGF-CTF nuclear translocation may be a new strategy in preventing cell proliferation. METHODS: 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbor-13-acetate (TPA) was treated to activate ADAM. Nine-thousand chemical compounds were screened for their efficacies in blocking the binding of HB-EGF-CTF to promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) with Alphascreen system. The obtained candidates were then used to block the binding of HB-EGF-CTF to PLZF in colon cancer cells, HT29 and HCT116. Cell proliferation was investigated with a growth curve assay. The intracellular localization, and association between HB-EGF-CTF and PLZF, was assessed with immunofluorescent staining, and immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, respectively. The effects of obtained candidates on EGFR phosphorylation and on nuclear translocation of HB-EGF-CTF and export of PLZF during the angiotensin II type1 receptor (AT1R) knockdown were also investigated. RESULTS: Telmisartan and candesartan were found to be potential candidates. Telmisartan inhibited TPA-induced cell proliferation stronger than candesartan. Telmisartan, but not candesartan blocked the nuclear translocation of HB-EGF-CTF, and binding of HB-EGF-CTF to PLZF, during TPA stimulation. Both telmisartan and candesartan did not inhibit TPA-induced EGFR phosphorylation, and telmisartan, but not candesartan, inhibited TPA-induced nuclear translocation of HB-EGF-CTF after knockdown of AT1R. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of HB-EGF-CTF nuclear translocation with telmisartan may be a novel strategy in preventing cell proliferation.","['Ozeki, Keiji', 'Tanida, Satoshi', 'Morimoto, Chie', 'Inoue, Yoshimasa', 'Mizoshita, Tsutomu', 'Tsukamoto, Hironobu', 'Shimura, Takaya', 'Kataoka, Hiromi', 'Kamiya, Takeshi', 'Nishiwaki, Eiji', 'Ishiguro, Hiroshi', 'Higashiyama, Shigeki', 'Joh, Takashi']","['Ozeki K', 'Tanida S', 'Morimoto C', 'Inoue Y', 'Mizoshita T', 'Tsukamoto H', 'Shimura T', 'Kataoka H', 'Kamiya T', 'Nishiwaki E', 'Ishiguro H', 'Higashiyama S', 'Joh T']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Metabolism, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (HBEGF protein, human)', '0 (Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', 'U5SYW473RQ (Telmisartan)']",IM,"['Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Benzoates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Telmisartan']",2013/03/02 06:00,2013/09/04 06:00,['2013/03/02 06:00'],"['2012/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0056770 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-22960 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e56770. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0056770.

CD41 is expressed throughout all stages of maturation of megakaryocytes and has therefore been described as a specific blast cell marker in AML M7 as well as in transient myeloproliferative disease (TMD) of patients with Down syndrome (DS). However, technical difficulties underlie the need for new markers for these entities. METHODS: We evaluated the expression of human lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (CD11a) in a large cohort of pediatric AML and TMD patients (n = 91) of the Austrian AML-BFM 98 and 2004 studies. RESULTS: We found a consistent deficiency of CD11a as assessed by mean fluorescence intensity in all patients with non-DS AML M7 (n = 8) and M6 (n = 1), all cases of classical DS-AML (n = 12) as well as TMD (n = 15) that was statistically significant in comparison to non-DS AML M0-M5 patients (n = 55; P < 0.001, sensitivity 100%). Only three of 55 Non-DS M0-5 patients were CD11a deficient (specificity 95%).

Our purpose was to describe the incidence, clinical features, and mortality of febrile illness with or without documented infection in children and young adults treated for AML and ALL in two centers in Rabat and Casablanca during 2011. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients <30 years of age who were newly diagnosed with AML and ALL in 2011 in Casablanca and Rabat. Each patient's chart was evaluated for patient demographics, febrile episodes, chemotherapy regimen, and clinical or microbiological evidence of infection, neutropenia, antibiotics, and mortality. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-six evaluable patients had 228 inpatient febrile episodes. The median number of febrile episodes in AML was three per patient, and for ALL, one per patient. Clinically identified infections mainly included pneumonitis and mucositis. Coagulase negative staphylococcus was the most commonly isolated bacterium, followed by gram-negative bacteria. Fifty-three percent of febrile episodes were classified as fever of undetermined origin. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were routinely used, with the addition of antifungals in 62 episodes and vancomycin in 83 episodes. The rate of deaths per febrile illness was 11.3% (16/141) in patients with AML, and 9.2% (8/87) in patients with ALL. CONCLUSION: The higher rate of infectious deaths in leukemia compared to that reported in high-income countries, suggests that improvements in infection care and prevention, including consistent access to rapid hospitalization, diagnostics and antibiotics; and standardizing quality of patient care are necessary to improve as well as survival in patients with leukemia in Morocco.","['Depasse, Jacqueline', 'Caniza, Miguela A', 'Quessar, Asmaa', 'Khattab, Mohammad', 'Hessissen, Laila', 'Ribeiro, Raul', 'Cherkaoui, Siham', 'Benchekroun, Said', 'Matthay, Katherine K']","['Depasse J', 'Caniza MA', 'Quessar A', 'Khattab M', 'Hessissen L', 'Ribeiro R', 'Cherkaoui S', 'Benchekroun S', 'Matthay KK']","[""Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco School of Medicine and UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, CA 94143-0106, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Hospitalized/statistics & numerical data', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infections/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Morocco', 'Poverty', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/02 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2013/03/02 06:00'],"['2012/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24365 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Jun;60(6):916-22. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24365.

Usually, the prognostic implications of IGHV gene analysis can be reliably ascertained but, occasionally, double productive rearrangements have been detected. Clinical presentation and biological features of such cases are unknown. Sixty patients with morphologically and phenotypically monoclonal CLL but double productive IGHV rearrangements were retrospectively identified by mRNA analysis from three Hematology Institutions. Clinical and biological features and survival of these 60 patients were compared with a control group of patients with CLL and single IGHV rearrangement. A prospective registry was used to assess the epidemiology of double productive IGHV among incidental patients with CLL. Using standard criteria to define IGHV-mutated (M) or unmutated (U) cases, 39 of the 60 patients (65%) with double productive IGHV rearrangement had concordant status (23 MM, 16 UU), while 21 (35%) had discordant IGHV status. As compared with M patients, the MM ones had lower CD38 expression, more favorable cytogenetics and more indolent clinical behavior. Cases with UU had similar characteristics of U patients. Discordant cases presented with adverse prognostic features and had an aggressive clinical behavior requiring early treatment, similar to U patients. The prevalence of double IGHV was 3.1%. Patients with CLL with double concordant mutational status (MM or UU) have a clinical course similar to that of the corresponding single IGHV status, while those exhibiting discordant status represent a high risk population. This may help correct stratification within clinical trials.","['Visco, Carlo', 'Moretta, Francesca', 'Falisi, Erika', 'Facco, Monica', 'Maura, Francesco', 'Novella, Elisabetta', 'Nichele, Ilaria', 'Finotto, Silvia', 'Giaretta, Ilaria', 'Ave, Elisa', 'Perbellini, Omar', 'Guercini, Nicola', 'Scupoli, Maria Teresa', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Trimarco, Valentina', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Rodeghiero, Francesco', 'Pizzolo, Giovanni', 'Ambrosetti, Achille']","['Visco C', 'Moretta F', 'Falisi E', 'Facco M', 'Maura F', 'Novella E', 'Nichele I', 'Finotto S', 'Giaretta I', 'Ave E', 'Perbellini O', 'Guercini N', 'Scupoli MT', 'Trentin L', 'Trimarco V', 'Neri A', 'Semenzato G', 'Rodeghiero F', 'Pizzolo G', 'Ambrosetti A']","['Department of Hematology S.

The combination of bendamustine and cytarabine has demonstrated distinct and synergistic mechanisms of action in preclinical studies on cell lines and primary tumor cells of several B-cell lymphomas, including 17p deleted or TP53 mutated CLL. The efficacy of rituximab (375 mg/m(2) , Day 1), plus bendamustine (70 mg/m(2) , days 1-2), and cytarabine (800 mg/m(2) , Day 1-3; R-BAC), every 28 days for up to four courses, was evaluated in a pilot trial enrolling 13 patients with very selected high-risk R/R CLL. All patients (median age 60 years, range 53-74) had symptomatic Binet stage B or C active disease requiring treatment, were characterized by adverse cytogenetics (17p deletion, 11q deletion, or both), unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region, and were heavily pretreated (1-5, median three previous lines). Overall, R-BAC was well tolerated with limited non-hematological toxicity. Major toxicities were transient Grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in 84% and 85% of patients, respectively. Overall response rate (OR) was 84%, including complete and partial response in 38% and 46% of patients, respectively. Patients with 17p deletion had an OR of 78%. After a median follow-up of 17 months, median progression-free survival was 16 months while median overall survival (OS) was not reached (1-year OS: 75 +/- 13%). R-BAC is an active regimen in R/R heavily pretreated high-risk patients with CLL, representing an option for the treatment of patients that are usually refractory to standard therapy.","['Visco, Carlo', 'Finotto, Silvia', 'Pomponi, Fabrizio', 'Sartori, Roberto', 'Laveder, Francesco', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Paolini, Rossella', 'Di Bona, Eros', 'Ruggeri, Marco', 'Rodeghiero, Francesco']","['Visco C', 'Finotto S', 'Pomponi F', 'Sartori R', 'Laveder F', 'Trentin L', 'Paolini R', 'Di Bona E', 'Ruggeri M', 'Rodeghiero F']","['Department of Cell Therapy and Hematology, San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Rituximab', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Survival Analysis']",2013/03/02 06:00,2013/05/11 06:00,['2013/03/02 06:00'],"['2012/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23391 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Apr;88(4):289-93. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23391.

Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry were employed to detect the percentage of SP cells in THP-1 cells. Then, SP and non-SP (NSP) cell subpopulations were collected and identified. THP-1 cells were incubated with different concentrations of Ara-C for 24 h and the proportion of SP cells was detected. Our results demonstrated that the percentage of SP cells was 1.81 +/- 0.99% in THP-1 cells. A majority of the SP cells remained in the G(0)/G(1) phase, and the expression of CD34(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-) and the proliferation ability of the SP cells were higher compared to NSP cells (P<0.05). The mRNA expression of multidrug resistance genes (ABCG2 and ABCB1), apoptosis regulation genes (Bcl-2) and the Bcl-2/Bax value of SP cells were higher than those of NSP cells. SP cells have been shown to be more tumorigenic than NSP cells. Following co-culture with Ara-C, the proportion of SP cells increased significantly and subsequently the Ara-C concentration increased. These fi ndings suggest that the THP-1 cell line contains SP cells and that SP cells possess certain intrinsic stem cell properties and may contain a larger proportion of leukemia stem cells (LSCs). The concentrations of SP cells can be increased with Ara-C by co-culture, and this technique is a useful and important application for the study of LSCs.","['Wang, Yingchao', 'Yin, Chuyun', 'Feng, Lei', 'Ma, Lina', 'Wei, Yongwei', 'Sheng, Guangyao']","['Wang Y', 'Yin C', 'Feng L', 'Ma L', 'Wei Y', 'Sheng G']","['Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450052, PR China. 314039104@qq.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Side-Population Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2013/03/02 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/03/02 06:00'],"['2012/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2013.2316 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2013 May;29(5):1923-31. doi: 10.3892/or.2013.2316.

The studies concerning clinical implications of galectin-3 expression in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are scarce. We investigated the expression of LGALS3, the gene encoding galectin-3, in the bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells from an original cohort comprising 280 adults with primary non-acute promyelocytic leukemia. Higher LGALS3 expression was closely associated with older age, French-American-British M4/M5 subtypes, CD14 expression on leukemic cells, and PTPN11 mutation, but negatively correlated with CEBPA mutation and FLT3-ITD. Compared with patients with lower LGALS3 expression, those with higher expression had lower complete remission rates, higher primary refractory rates, and shorter overall survival. This result was validated in an independent validation cohort. A scoring system incorporating higher LGALS3 expression and 8 other risk factors, including age, white blood cell count, cytogenetics, and gene mutations, into survival analysis proved to be very useful to stratify patients with AML into different prognostic groups (P < .001). In conclusion, BM LGALS3 expression may serve as a new biomarker to predict clinical outcome in patients with AML, and galectin-3 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in those patients with higher expression of this protein.","['Cheng, Chieh-Lung', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Lee, Ming-Cheng', 'Liu, Chieh-Yu', 'Jhuang, Jie-Yang', 'Lai, Yan-Jun', 'Lin, Chung-Wu', 'Chen, Huan-Yuan', 'Liu, Fu-Tong', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Yao, Ming', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Ko, Bor-Sheng', 'Wu, Shang-Ju', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Cheng CL', 'Hou HA', 'Lee MC', 'Liu CY', 'Jhuang JY', 'Lai YJ', 'Lin CW', 'Chen HY', 'Liu FT', 'Chou WC', 'Chen CY', 'Tang JL', 'Yao M', 'Huang SY', 'Ko BS', 'Wu SJ', 'Tsay W', 'Tien HF']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Galectin 3)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Galectin 3/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'RNA/genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/02 06:00,2013/06/20 06:00,['2013/03/02 06:00'],"['2013/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58564-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-07-443762 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Apr 18;121(16):3172-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-07-443762.

This event is negatively regulated by inhibitory killer Ig-like receptors (KIRs) and NKG2A. In this study, we analyzed the role of the HLA-C2-specific activating receptor KIR2DS1 in the process of CCR7 uptake by NK cells interacting with different allogeneic CCR7(+) cells. Co-incubation of KIR2DS1(+) fresh NK cells or NK-cell clones with HLA-C2(+) CCR7(+) lymphoblastoid cell lines resulted in increased CCR7 uptake. Remarkably, KIR2DS1 expression represented a major advantage for acquiring CCR7 from HLA-C2(+) allogeneic dendritic cells (DCs) and T-cell blasts. These findings have important implications in haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in which donor-derived (alloreactive) KIR2DS1(+) NK cells, upon CCR7 acquisition, become capable of migrating toward lymph nodes, where they may kill patient DCs and T cells, preventing graft-versus-host and host-versus-graft reactions.","['Marcenaro, Emanuela', 'Pesce, Silvia', 'Sivori, Simona', 'Carlomagno, Simona', 'Moretta, Lorenzo', 'Moretta, Alessandro']","['Marcenaro E', 'Pesce S', 'Sivori S', 'Carlomagno S', 'Moretta L', 'Moretta A']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale and Centro di Eccellenza per le Ricerche Biomediche, Universita degli Studi di Genova, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (KIR2DS1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/immunology/metabolism', '*Cell Movement', 'Chemotaxis', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-C Antigens/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, CCR7/*metabolism', 'Receptors, KIR/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2013/03/02 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2013/03/02 06:00'],"['2013/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58528-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-09-458752 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Apr 25;121(17):3396-401. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-09-458752.

Short interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery against targets involved in aberrant mechanisms is a promising approach and we hypothesize that simultaneous silencing of multiple targets could prove more advantageous than common approach to silence individual targets. To explore this approach, we targeted anti-apoptotic proteins myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) and survivin along with the efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in drug-resistant breast cancer cells. Polymeric siRNA delivery was employed for this purpose by using small polyethylenimine (PEI) substituted with lipids. While silencing Mcl-1 caused approximately 90% cell death in wild-type cells, this effect was less significant in P-gp over-expressing cells. An additive effect for Mcl-1 and P-gp silencing was evident in the latter cells, where simultaneous silencing of these targets created a significantly higher effect compared with silencing each individual target. Prolonged exposure of wild-type cells to doxorubicin (DOX) resulted in upregulation of P-gp, breast cancer resistance protein, survivin and Mcl-1. Dual silencing of P-gp and Mcl-1 again resulted in an additive effect in resistance-induced cells, which displayed an increased dependency on Mcl-1 for survival. Cytotoxic effect of DOX was also enhanced in resistance-induced cells after silencing Mcl-1. We conclude that polymer-mediated siRNA delivery can silence multiple targets simultaneously and reverse drug resistance.","['Aliabadi, H M', 'Mahdipoor, P', 'Uludag, H']","['Aliabadi HM', 'Mahdipoor P', 'Uludag H']","['Department of Chemical and Material Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*genetics', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*administration & dosage/genetics/metabolism', 'Survivin']",2013/03/02 06:00,2013/08/30 06:00,['2013/03/02 06:00'],"['2013/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['cgt20138 [pii]', '10.1038/cgt.2013.8 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2013 Mar;20(3):169-77. doi: 10.1038/cgt.2013.8.

The cAMP effect was reproduced in NB4 APL cells, and shown to depend on activation of the generally cytoplasmic cAMP-kinase type I (PKA-I) rather than the perinuclear PKA-II. The protection of both NB4 cells and APL blasts was associated with (inactivating) phosphorylation of PKA site Ser118 of pro-apoptotic Bad and (activating) phosphorylation of PKA site Ser133 of the AML oncogene CREB. Either event would be expected to protect broadly against cell death, and we found cAMP elevation to protect also against 2-deoxyglucose, rotenone, proteasome inhibitor and a BH3-only mimetic. The in vitro findings were mirrored by the findings in NSG mice with orthotopic NB4 cell leukemia. The mice showed more rapid disease progression when given cAMP-increasing agents (prostaglandin E2 analog and theophylline), both with and without DNR chemotherapy. The all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced terminal APL cell differentiation is a cornerstone in current APL treatment and is enhanced by cAMP. We show also that ATRA-resistant APL cells, believed to be responsible for treatment failure with current ATRA-based treatment protocols, were protected by cAMP against death. This suggests that the beneficial pro-differentiating and non-beneficial pro-survival APL cell effects of cAMP should be weighed against each other. The results suggest also general awareness toward drugs that can affect bone marrow cAMP levels in leukemia patients.","['Gausdal, G', 'Wergeland, A', 'Skavland, J', 'Nguyen, E', 'Pendino, F', 'Rouhee, N', 'McCormack, E', 'Herfindal, L', 'Kleppe, R', 'Havemann, U', 'Schwede, F', 'Bruserud, O', 'Gjertsen, B T', 'Lanotte, M', 'Segal-Bendirdjian, E', 'Doskeland, S O']","['Gausdal G', 'Wergeland A', 'Skavland J', 'Nguyen E', 'Pendino F', 'Rouhee N', 'McCormack E', 'Herfindal L', 'Kleppe R', 'Havemann U', 'Schwede F', 'Bruserud O', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Lanotte M', 'Segal-Bendirdjian E', 'Doskeland SO']","['Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type I)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type II)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'TBT296U68M (1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP/agonists/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type I/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type II/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dinoprostone/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Theophylline/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism']",2013/03/02 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2013/03/02 06:00'],"['2013/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201339 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.39 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Feb 28;4:e516. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.39.,20130228,,PMC3734820,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the effects of BITC on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human leukemia cell lines, primary leukemia cells, and nude mice Jurkat xenograft. Exposure of Jurkat cells to BITC resulted in dose- and time-dependent increase in apoptosis, caspase activation, cytochrome c release, nuclear apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) accumulation, Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax) translocation, and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) downregulation. Treatment with these cells also resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. The G2/M-arrested cells are more sensitive to undergoing Mcl-1 downregulation and apoptosis mediated by BITC. BITC downregulates Mcl-1 expression through inhibition of translation, rather than through a transcriptional, post-translational, or caspase-dependent mechanism. Dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G could contribute to the inhibition of Mcl-1 translation mediated by BITC. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Mcl-1 substantially attenuates BITC-mediated lethality in these cells, whereas knockdown of Mcl-1 through small interfering RNA significantly enhances BITC-mediated lethality.

Shorter diagnostic intervals (DI) in primary care require better knowledge of the association between presenting symptoms, interpretation of symptoms and the wording of the referral letter. METHODS: A Danish nationwide population-based study. Data on 550 children aged <15 years with an incident cancer diagnosis (January 2007-December 2010) were collected through questionnaires to parents (response rate=69%) and general practitioners (GPs) (response rate=87%). The DI from the first presentation in general practice until diagnosis was categorised as short or long based on quartiles. Associations between variables and long DIs were assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS: The GPs interpreted symptoms as 'vague' in 25.4%, 'serious' in 50.0% and 'alarm' in 19.0% of cases. Symptom interpretation varied by cancer type (P<0.001) and was associated with the DI (P<0.001). Vomiting was associated with a shorter DI for central nervous system (CNS) tumours, and pain with a longer DI for leukaemia. Referral letter wording was associated with DI (P<0.001); the shortest DIs were observed when cancer suspicion was raised in the letter. CONCLUSION: The GPs play an important role in recognising early signs of childhood cancer as their symptom interpretation and referral wording have a profound impact on the diagnostic process.","['Ahrensberg, J M', 'Olesen, F', 'Hansen, R P', 'Schroder, H', 'Vedsted, P']","['Ahrensberg JM', 'Olesen F', 'Hansen RP', 'Schroder H', 'Vedsted P']","['Research Unit for General Practice, Aarhus University, Bartholins Alle 2, 8000 Aarhus, Denmark. jette.ahrensberg@alm.au.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Denmark/epidemiology', '*Early Detection of Cancer', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*General Practice', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/epidemiology', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Prognosis', '*Referral and Consultation', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors']",2013/03/02 06:00,2013/05/29 06:00,['2013/03/02 06:00'],"['2013/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc201388 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2013.88 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2013 Apr 2;108(6):1280-7. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2013.88.

Although there are some data suggesting that angiogenesis may have a role in the pathophysiology of leukemia, its role in patient prognosis is yet to be defined. We analyzed the expression level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an angiogenesis promoter and its possible- prognostic value in bone marrow samples at the time of diagnosis and remission of acute childhood leukemia patients. Besides 46 patients diagnosed as ALL or AML, 16 children were also included as a control group in the study. Our data have demonstrated that VEGF levels of AML patients were found higher than the control group statistically (P = 0.022). However we could not find any significant difference between VEGF levels of diagnosis and remission in both AML and ALL groups by blastic VEGF expression (P > 0.05). In this study the higher levels of VEGF in AML patients is one of the main findings although we were not able to assess any role of VEGF in predicting prognosis in pediatric leukemia patients by evaluating blastic cell VEGF expression. These results have demonstrated that the relationship between angiogenesis or angiogenesis promoters and hematological malignancies is not clear and simple as different methods or different cells beside different angiogenesis promotors are involved to these studies. So that not only tumor cells and their cytokines but also surrounding cells and their cytokines must be taken into consideration with the standardized study methods in the further studies to obtain a promising treatment approach.","['Leblebisatan, Goksel', 'Antmen, Bulent', 'Sasmaz, Ilgen', 'Kilinc, Yurdanur']","['Leblebisatan G', 'Antmen B', 'Sasmaz I', 'Kilinc Y']","['Pediatric Hematology Division, Gaziantep Children Hospital, Gaziantep, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,2013/03/02 06:00,2013/03/02 06:01,['2013/03/02 06:00'],"['2011/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-011-0102-2 [doi]', '102 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2012 Mar;28(1):24-8. doi: 10.1007/s12288-011-0102-2.

In clinical diagnosis of CML, classical banding techniques, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probing for the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) or polymerase chain reaction amplifying the fusion products of the BCR-ABL fusion are state of the art techniques. Nevertheless, the genome of CML patients harbors many more cytogenetic changes. These might be hidden in subpopulations due to clonal events or involved in extremely complex aberrations. To identify these additional changes, several cytogenetic and molecular genetic techniques could be applied. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that identifying these aberrations is time consuming and costly and since they cannot be converted into a benefit for the patients, the necessity to perform these investigations has been questioned. In the times where highly specialized medicine is advancing into several areas of cancer, this attitude needs to be reassessed. Therefore, we looked at the usefulness of a combination of different techniques to unravel the genetic changes in CML patients and to identify new chromosomal aberrations, which potentially can be correlated to different stages of the disease and the strength of therapy resistance. We are convinced that the combination of these techniques could be extremely useful in unraveling even the most complex karyotypes and in dissecting different clones contributing to the disease. We propose that by doing so, this would improve CML diagnostic and prognostic findings, especially with regard to CML resistance mechanisms and new therapeutic strategies.","['Greulich-Bode, Karin M', 'Heinze, Barbara']","['Greulich-Bode KM', 'Heinze B']","['Division Genetics of Skin Carcinogenesis, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United Arab Emirates,Curr Genomics,Current genomics,100960527,,,,2013/03/02 06:00,2013/03/02 06:01,['2013/03/02 06:00'],"['2012/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2174/138920212802510466 [doi]', 'CG-6-471 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Genomics. 2012 Sep;13(6):471-6. doi: 10.2174/138920212802510466.,,,PMC3426781,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Breakpoints', 'CGH translocation', 'CML', 'Clinical impact.', 'Complex aberrations', 'Cytogenetics', 'Fish']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sinus computed tomography showed a localised lesion in the left ethmoid sinus, which rapidly progressed to an extensive intracranial mass within one month. Surgical debridement was performed, and histopathological analysis revealed the coexistence of myeloid sarcoma and acute fulminant invasive fungal sinusitis. The patient responded well to prompt surgical debridement, antifungal medication and radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Coexistence of sinonasal myeloid sarcoma and acute fulminant invasive fungal sinusitis poses an urgent diagnostic and management challenge to clinicians.

I3C was provided either through the maternal diet coincident with carcinogen exposure during pregnancy or directly to offspring postinitiation with DBC. I3C was effective at reducing T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (T-ALL)-related mortality in offspring only if provided via the maternal diet, although a gender difference in the role of ERbeta in mediating this response was evident. In female offspring, chemoprevention of T-ALL by maternal dietary I3C required expression of ERbeta; survival in Esr2 wild-type and heterozygous female offspring was more than 90% compared with 66% in Esr2 null females. Alternatively, ERbeta status did not significantly impact the transplacental chemoprevention by I3C in males. The possible role of ERbeta in mediating lung carcinogenesis or chemoprevention by I3C was similarly complicated. Lung tumor incidence was unaltered by either dietary intervention, whereas lung tumor multiplicity was substantially reduced in Esr2 null females on the control diet and marginally lower in Esr2 null males exposed to I3C via the maternal diet compared with their wild-type and heterozygous counterparts. These findings suggest that I3C may act via ERbeta to prevent or suppress DBC-initiated transplacental carcinogenesis but that the involvement of this receptor seems to differ depending on the cancer type and gender of the offspring.","['Benninghoff, Abby D', 'Williams, David E']","['Benninghoff AD', 'Williams DE']","['Department of Animal, Dairy and Veterinary Sciences, Utah State University, 4815 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322, USA. abby.benninghoff@usu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Prev Res (Phila),"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",101479409,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Benzopyrenes)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor beta)', '0 (Indoles)', 'C11E72455F (indole-3-carbinol)', 'G3X629VE4A (dibenzo(a,l)pyrene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Benzopyrenes', 'Carcinogens', 'Chemoprevention', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Estrogen Receptor beta/genetics/*physiology', 'Female', 'Indoles/*administration & dosage', 'Male', '*Maternal-Fetal Exchange/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/genetics/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/chemically induced/genetics/mortality/prevention & control', 'Pregnancy']",2013/03/01 06:00,2013/10/22 06:00,['2013/03/01 06:00'],"['2013/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1940-6207.CAPR-12-0311 [pii]', '10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-12-0311 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Prev Res (Phila). 2013 Apr;6(4):339-48. doi: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-12-0311.

The extent to which lower scores represent global cognitive decline versus domain-specific impairment remains unclear. This study examined discrepancies between processing speed and estimated IQ (EIQ) scores and identified clinical characteristics associated with score discrepancies in a sample of pediatric cancer survivors. PROCEDURE: Survivors (50 ALL, 50 BT) ages 12-17 years completed cognitive testing. The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence provided an untimed measure of general reasoning ability (EIQ). The age-appropriate Wechsler Intelligence Scale provided a Processing Speed Index (PSI) score. Scores were examined and compared. RESULTS: Survivors' PSI scores were lower than their EIQ scores (BT t(45) =6.3, p<0.001; ALL t(49) =6.9, p<0.001). For BT survivors, lower PSI scores were associated with history of craniospinal irradiation, t(44) =3.3, p<0.01. For ALL survivors, lower PSI scores were associated with male gender, grade retention, and time since diagnosis, F(3, 46) =10.1, p<0.001. Clinically significant EIQ-PSI score discrepancies were identified in 41.3% of BT and 14.0% of ALL survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Many pediatric BT and ALL survivors exhibit slower processing speed than expected for age, whereas general reasoning ability remains largely intact. Risk factors associated with larger EIQ-PSI discrepancies include the following: BT diagnosis, craniospinal irradiation (BT only), male gender, and younger age at diagnosis (ALL only). Grade retention was frequent and associated with lower EIQ scores (both groups) and PSI scores (ALL only). Describing post-treatment cognitive declines using global measures of intellectual ability may underestimate dysfunction or fail to isolate specific underlying deficits contributing to impairment.","['Kahalley, Lisa S', 'Conklin, Heather M', 'Tyc, Vida L', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Wilson, Stephanie J', 'Wu, Shengjie', 'Xiong, Xiaoping', 'Hinds, Pamela S']","['Kahalley LS', 'Conklin HM', 'Tyc VL', 'Hudson MM', 'Wilson SJ', 'Wu S', 'Xiong X', 'Hinds PS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Psychology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.

Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) represents a receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which has been reported to be overexpressed in several malignancies. In our study, we characterized mRNA levels of VEGF receptors including NRP1 in a large cohort of CLL patients (n = 114), additionally we performed a detailed characterization of NRP1 expression on B cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs). The expression of NRP1 was significantly higher on leukemic lymphocytes compared to control B lymphocytes on mRNA and protein levels (22.72% vs. 0.2%, p = 0.0003, respectively), Tregs (42.6% vs. 16.05%, p = 0.0003) and PDCs (100% vs. 98% p < 0.0001). In functional studies, we found higher NRP1 expression on CLL cells after stimulation with VEGF. The correlation between expression of VEGF receptors: FLT1, NRP1 and FOXP3 expression (r(2) = 0.53, p < 0.0001 and r(2) = 0.49, p < 0.0001, respectively) was observed. Earlier we described the specific Treg reduction during the therapy with thalidomide in vivo. Now we observe the reduction of the NRP1 expression on Tregs in vitro, thereby suggesting a possible target of thalidomide action. In conclusion, NRP1 might represent an interesting link between angiogenesis and tolerance mechanisms and represents interesting target for therapy.","['Piechnik, Agnieszka', 'Dmoszynska, Anna', 'Omiotek, Marcin', 'Mlak, Radoslaw', 'Kowal, Malgorzata', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Giannopoulos, Krzysztof']","['Piechnik A', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Omiotek M', 'Mlak R', 'Kowal M', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Bullinger L', 'Giannopoulos K']","['Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '144713-63-3 (Neuropilin-1)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Dendritic Cells/chemistry', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*etiology', 'Neuropilin-1/analysis/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/chemistry', 'Thalidomide/therapeutic use', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/blood/genetics/*physiology']",2013/03/01 06:00,2013/09/13 06:00,['2013/03/01 06:00'],"['2012/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.28135 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2013 Sep 15;133(6):1489-96. doi: 10.1002/ijc.28135.

The potentially beneficial donor T cell-mediated graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect is often mitigated by concurrent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Providing T cells that can selectively target Wilms tumor antigen 1 (WT1), a transcription factor overexpressed in leukemias that contributes to the malignant phenotype, represents an opportunity to promote antileukemic activity without inducing GVHD. HLA-A*0201-restricted WT1-specific donor-derived CD8 cytotoxic T cell (CTL) clones were administered after HCT to 11 relapsed or high-risk leukemia patients without evidence of on-target toxicity. The last four treated patients received CTL clones generated with exposure to interleukin-21 (IL-21) to prolong in vivo CTL survival, because IL-21 can limit terminal differentiation of antigen-specific T cells generated in vitro. Transferred cells exhibited direct evidence of antileukemic activity in two patients: a transient response in one patient with advanced progressive disease and the induction of a prolonged remission in a patient with minimal residual disease (MRD). Additionally, three treated patients at high risk for relapse after HCT survive without leukemia relapse, GVHD, or additional antileukemic treatment. CTLs generated in the presence of IL-21, which were transferred in these latter three patients and the patient with MRD, all remained detectable long-term and maintained or acquired in vivo phenotypic and functional characteristics associated with long-lived memory CD8 T cells.

The Abelson helper integration site 1 (AHI-1) oncoprotein interacts with BCR-ABL and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) to mediate IM response of primitive CML cells, but the effect of the interaction complex on the response to ABL and JAK2 inhibitors is unknown. METHODS: The AHI-1-BCR-ABL-JAK2 interaction complex was analyzed by mutational analysis and coimmunoprecipitation. Roles of the complex in regulation of response or resistance to ABL and JAK2 inhibitors were investigated in BCR-ABL (+) cells and primary CML stem/progenitor cells and in immunodeficient NSG mice. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The WD40-repeat domain of AHI-1 interacts with BCR-ABL, whereas the N-terminal region interacts with JAK2; loss of these interactions statistically significantly increased the IM sensitivity of CML cells. Disrupting this complex with a combination of IM and an orally bioavailable selective JAK2 inhibitor (TG101209 [TG]) statistically significantly induced death of AHI-1-overexpressing and IM-resistant cells in vitro and enhanced survival of leukemic mice, compared with single agents (combination vs TG alone: 63 vs 53 days, ratio = 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6 to 1.1, P = .004; vs IM: 57 days, ratio = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.61 to 1.2, P = .003). Combination treatment also statistically significantly enhanced apoptosis of CD34(+) leukemic stem/progenitor cells and eliminated their long-term leukemia-initiating activity in NSG mice. Importantly, this approach was effective against treatment-naive CML stem cells from patients who subsequently proved to be resistant to IM therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneously targeting BCR-ABL and JAK2 activities in CML stem/progenitor cells may improve outcomes in patients destined to develop IM resistance.","['Chen, Min', 'Gallipoli, Paolo', 'DeGeer, Donna', 'Sloma, Ivan', 'Forrest, Donna L', 'Chan, Matthew', 'Lai, Damian', 'Jorgensen, Heather', 'Ringrose, Ashley', 'Wang, Hui Mi', 'Lambie, Karen', 'Nakamoto, Helen', 'Saw, Kyi Min', 'Turhan, Ali', 'Arlinghaus, Ralph', 'Paul, James', 'Stobo, Jon', 'Barnett, Michael J', 'Eaves, Allen', 'Eaves, Connie J', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan']","['Chen M', 'Gallipoli P', 'DeGeer D', 'Sloma I', 'Forrest DL', 'Chan M', 'Lai D', 'Jorgensen H', 'Ringrose A', 'Wang HM', 'Lambie K', 'Nakamoto H', 'Saw KM', 'Turhan A', 'Arlinghaus R', 'Paul J', 'Stobo J', 'Barnett MJ', 'Eaves A', 'Eaves CJ', 'Holyoake TL', 'Jiang X']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, 675 W 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1L3, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (AHI1 protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (TG101209)', '0 (WDR1 protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Biological Availability', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Janus Kinase 2/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microfilament Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Remission Induction', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2013/03/01 06:00,2013/05/07 06:00,['2013/03/01 06:00'],"['2013/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['djt006 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djt006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2013 Mar 20;105(6):405-23. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djt006.

Here, we demonstrate that donor anti-third-party CD8 T cells with central memory phenotype (Tcm) exhibit marked GVL reactivity through a unique T-cell receptor-independent mechanism. Thus, in a residual disease mouse model, Tcm therapy following autologous BMT led to significant survival prolongation, with 30% to 40% of the treated mice displaying long-term tumor-free survival. A more impressive finding was that infusion of donor Tcm in an allogeneic model rapidly eliminated residual lymphoma cells and led to long-term survival of 100% in the absence of GVH disease. Collectively, the strong GVL reactivity of anti-third-party Tcm, coupled with their demonstrated enhancement of bone marrow allografting, suggests that the use of Tcm therapy in conjunction with allogeneic T-cell-depleted BMT could be of particular benefit in patients with B-cell malignancies who cannot tolerate intensive myeloablative conditioning.","['Lask, Assaf', 'Ophir, Eran', 'Or-Geva, Noga', 'Cohen-Fredarow, Adva', 'Afik, Ran', 'Eidelstein, Yaki', 'Reich-Zeliger, Shlomit', 'Nathansohn, Bar', 'Edinger, Matthias', 'Negrin, Robert S', 'Hagin, David', 'Reisner, Yair']","['Lask A', 'Ophir E', 'Or-Geva N', 'Cohen-Fredarow A', 'Afik R', 'Eidelstein Y', 'Reich-Zeliger S', 'Nathansohn B', 'Edinger M', 'Negrin RS', 'Hagin D', 'Reisner Y']","['Immunology Department, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Immunologic Memory/*immunology', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2013/03/01 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2013/03/01 06:00'],"['2013/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49816-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-06-432443 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Apr 11;121(15):3033-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-06-432443.

Upon activation, calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT family transcription factors, triggering their nuclear entry and activation or repression of target genes. NFATc1 and c2 isoforms are expressed in megakaryocytes. Moreover, human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) encodes several negative regulators of calcineurin-NFAT, candidates in the pathogenesis of Down syndrome (trisomy 21)-associated transient myeloproliferative disorder and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. To investigate the role of calcineurin-NFAT in megakaryopoiesis, we examined wild-type mice treated with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A and transgenic mice expressing a targeted single extra copy of Dscr1, an Hsa21-encoded calcineurin inhibitor. Both murine models exhibited thrombocytosis with increased megakaryocytes and megakaryocyte progenitors. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of calcineurin in mice caused accumulation of megakaryocytes exhibiting enhanced 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine uptake and increased expression of messenger RNAs encoding CDK4 and G1 cyclins, which promote cell division. Additionally, human megakaryocytes with trisomy 21 show increased proliferation and decreased NFAT activation compared with euploid controls. Our data indicate that inhibition of calcineurin-NFAT drives proliferation of megakaryocyte precursors by de-repressing genes that drive cell division, providing insights into mechanisms of normal megakaryopoiesis and megakaryocytic abnormalities that accompany Down syndrome.","['Zaslavsky, Alexander', 'Chou, Stella T', 'Schadler, Keri', 'Lieberman, Allyson', 'Pimkin, Maxim', 'Kim, Yeo Jung', 'Baek, Kwan-Hyuck', 'Aird, William C', 'Weiss, Mitchell J', 'Ryeom, Sandra']","['Zaslavsky A', 'Chou ST', 'Schadler K', 'Lieberman A', 'Pimkin M', 'Kim YJ', 'Baek KH', 'Aird WC', 'Weiss MJ', 'Ryeom S']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DSCR1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Calcineurin/*metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down Syndrome/metabolism', 'Fas Ligand Protein/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Megakaryocyte Progenitor Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Muscle Proteins/genetics', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Platelet Count', 'Signal Transduction', '*Thrombopoiesis']",2013/03/01 06:00,2013/06/20 06:00,['2013/03/01 06:00'],"['2013/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58568-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-04-421172 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Apr 18;121(16):3205-15. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-04-421172.

Our transgenic mouse model over-expressing nuclear factor erythroid-2, which recapitulates many features of myeloproliferative neoplasms including transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, clearly implicates this transcription factor in the pathophysiology of myeloproliferative neoplasms. Because the targets mediating nuclear factor erythroid-2 effects are not well characterized, we conducted microarray analysis of CD34(+) cells lentivirally transduced to over-express nuclear factor erythroid-2 or to silence this transcription factor via shRNA, in order to identify novel target genes. Here, we report that the cytokine interleukin 8 is a novel target gene. Nuclear factor erythroid-2 directly binds the interleukin 8 promoter in vivo, and these binding sites are required for promoter activity. Serum levels of interleukin 8 are known to be elevated in both polycythemia vera and primary myelofibrosis patients. Recently, increased interleukin 8 levels have been shown to be predictive of inferior survival in primary myelofibrosis patients in multivariate analysis. Therefore, one of the mechanisms by which nuclear factor erythroid-2 contributes to myeloproliferative neoplasm pathology may be increased interleukin 8 expression.","['Wehrle, Julius', 'Seeger, Thalia S', 'Schwemmers, Sven', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Bulashevska, Alla', 'Pahl, Heike L']","['Wehrle J', 'Seeger TS', 'Schwemmers S', 'Pfeifer D', 'Bulashevska A', 'Pahl HL']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Center for Clinical Research, University Hospital Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Targeting/methods', 'Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Mice', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit/*physiology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2013/03/01 06:00,2014/07/08 06:00,['2013/03/01 06:00'],"['2013/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.071183 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.071183 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Jul;98(7):1073-80. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.071183.

We analyzed the outcome of 211 children with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first complete remission who were given an allogeneic transplant between 1990 and 2008; the outcome of patients who, despite having an indication for transplantation and a suitable donor, did not receive the allograft for different reasons in the same time period was not analyzed. Sixty-nine patients (33%) were transplanted between 1990 and 1999, 58 (27%) between 2000 and 2005, and 84 (40%) between 2005 and 2008. A matched family donor was employed in 138 patients (65%) and an unrelated donor in 73 (35%). The 10-year probabilities of overall and disease-free survival were 63.4% and 61%, respectively. The 10-year cumulative incidences of transplantation-related mortality and relapse were 15% and 24%, respectively. After 1999, no differences in either disease-free survival or transplant-related mortality were observed in patients transplanted from unrelated or matched family donors. In multivariate analysis, grade IV acute graft-versus-host disease was an independent factor associated with worse disease-free survival. By contrast, grade I acute graft-versus-host disease and age at diagnosis between 1 and 9 years were favorable prognostic variables. Our study, not intended to evaluate whether transplantation is superior to chemotherapy for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first complete remission and high-risk features, shows that the allograft cured more than 60% of these patients; in the most recent period, the outcome of recipients of grafts from matched family and unrelated donors was comparable.","['Fagioli, Franca', 'Quarello, Paola', 'Zecca, Marco', 'Lanino, Edoardo', 'Rognoni, Carla', 'Balduzzi, Adriana', 'Messina, Chiara', 'Favre, Claudio', 'Foa, Roberto', 'Ripaldi, Mimmo', 'Rutella, Sergio', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Prete, Arcangelo', 'Locatelli, Franco']","['Fagioli F', 'Quarello P', 'Zecca M', 'Lanino E', 'Rognoni C', 'Balduzzi A', 'Messina C', 'Favre C', 'Foa R', 'Ripaldi M', 'Rutella S', 'Basso G', 'Prete A', 'Locatelli F']","[""Pediatric Onco-Hematology, Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Division, Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, Torino. franca.fagioli@unito.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*mortality/*surgery', '*Registries', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",2013/03/01 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/03/01 06:00'],"['2013/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.079707 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.079707 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Aug;98(8):1273-81. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.079707.

The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) transcription factor plays an important role in tumor escape and resistance to chemotherapy and this factor regulates several pathways that promote tumor survival including some antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. In this study, we investigated, in U937 human leukemia cells, the effects of PTX and the MG132 proteasome inhibitor, drugs that can disrupt the NF-kappaB pathway. For this, we evaluated viability, apoptosis, cell cycle, caspases-3, -8, -9, cytochrome c release, mitochondrial membrane potential loss, p65 phosphorylation, and the modification in the expression of pro- and antiapoptotic genes, and the Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL antiapoptotic proteins. RESULTS: The two drugs affect the viability of the leukemia cells in a time-dependent manner. The greatest percentage of apoptosis was obtained with a combination of the drugs; likewise, PTX and MG132 induce G1 phase cell cycle arrest and cleavage of caspases -3,-8, -9 and cytochrome c release and mitochondrial membrane potential loss in U937 human leukemia cells. In these cells, PTX and the MG132 proteasome inhibitor decrease p65 (NF-kappaB subunit) phosphorylation and the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. We also observed, with a combination of these drugs overexpression of a group of the proapoptotic genes BAX, DIABLO, and FAS while the genes BCL-XL, MCL-1, survivin, IkappaB, and P65 were downregulated. CONCLUSIONS: The two drugs used induce apoptosis per se, this cytotoxicity was greater with combination of both drugs. These observations are related with the caspases -9, -3 cleavage and G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and a decrease in p65 phosphorylation and Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins. As well as this combination of drugs promotes the upregulation of the proapoptotic genes and downregulation of antiapoptotic genes. These observations strongly confirm antileukemic potential.","['Bravo-Cuellar, Alejandro', 'Hernandez-Flores, Georgina', 'Lerma-Diaz, Jose Manuel', 'Dominguez-Rodriguez, Jorge Ramiro', 'Jave-Suarez, Luis F', 'De Celis-Carrillo, Ruth', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy, Adriana', 'Gomez-Lomeli, Paulina', 'Ortiz-Lazareno, Pablo Cesar']","['Bravo-Cuellar A', 'Hernandez-Flores G', 'Lerma-Diaz JM', 'Dominguez-Rodriguez JR', 'Jave-Suarez LF', 'De Celis-Carrillo R', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy A', 'Gomez-Lomeli P', 'Ortiz-Lazareno PC']","['Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente CIBO, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social IMSS, Sierra Mojada 800, Col, Independencia, Guadalajara, Jalisco 44340, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (HSAJ2425 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)', 'SD6QCT3TSU (Pentoxifylline)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Leupeptins/*pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Pentoxifylline/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-X Protein/biosynthesis/*genetics']",2013/03/01 06:00,2013/09/07 06:00,['2013/03/01 06:00'],"['2012/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1423-0127-20-13 [pii]', '10.1186/1423-0127-20-13 [doi]']",epublish,J Biomed Sci. 2013 Feb 28;20:13. doi: 10.1186/1423-0127-20-13.,20130228,,PMC3618339,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, resveratrol upregulated the NKG2D-Ls MHC class I chain-related proteins MICA and MICB, and UL16-binding proteins ULBP1, ULBP2, and ULBP3 in most of the leukemia cells analyzed. Ligand upregulation induced by resveratrol was impaired by pharmacological and genetic disruption of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase, the main regulator of NKG2D-L expression. Leukemia cells treated with resveratrol were more susceptible to killing by NK cells than untreated cells, and the enhanced cytotoxicity of NK cells was blocked by treatment of NK cells with anti-NKG2D mAbs. Interestingly, resveratrol consistently upregulated the NKG2D receptor expression and enhanced NKG2D-mediated functions in resting NK cells obtained from healthy individuals.

Aberrant overexpression of IL-15 initiates large granular lymphocyte leukemia through chromosomal instability and DNA hypermethylation. Cancer Cell 22(5), 645-655 (2012). There is increasing evidence identifying a link between inflammation and cancer. A potent proinflammatory cytokine, IL-15, stimulates the proliferation and maintenance of both NK and T cells, and it is therefore likely that it may play a prominent role in certain hematologic malignancies. Previous studies have demonstrated that IL-15 overexpression can initiate leukemic transformation in murine models and that both NK- and T-cell malignancies can develop; the mechanism is explored in this article. The authors illustrate that IL-15 can cause chromosomal instability and DNA hypermethylation in large granular lymphocytes. These aberrations led to an aggressive acute large granular lymphocyte leukemia. Through studying the affected pathways, the authors were able to identify potential therapeutic targets and induce remission in a murine model.","['LeBlanc, Francis R', 'Hasanali, Zainul S', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['LeBlanc FR', 'Hasanali ZS', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Experimental Therapeutics - CH74, 500 University Drive, P.O.

It accounts for one fourth of all childhood cancers and approximately 75% of all childhood leukemias. Some prognostic factors determine the outcome of therapy [e.g. age, sex, initial white blood cell count (WBC), etc.]; however, it is believed that other mechanisms such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene mutation, the expression of lung resistance protein (LRP), and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) also plays a role in treatment failure. In this study, GST gene mutations including GSTM1 and GSTT1 were evaluated in patients with leukemia. Thirty newly diagnosed ALL patients younger than 15 years of age participated in the present study. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were evaluated for immune phenotyping and DNA was extracted for GST genotyping. All data plus sex, age, initial WBC count, central nervous system (CNS) or testicular involvement, immune phenotype, and outcome (relapse or not) were analyzed statistically. Genotyping showed that 46% were double null, 50% were M1 null and 93.3% were T1 null for GST mutations. There was no statistically significant relationship between GSTT1 and GSTM1 mutations, or between double null status, prognostic factors and relapse (P > .05).

To elucidate this, we sequenced the entire mtDNA in 56 AML patients and 14 control subjects. When analyzing the biologic impact of the non-synonymous variations in the mtDNA coding genes, we found an inferior disease-free survival for patients exhibiting variations in the two most important catalytic genes of the complex IV of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes (OXPHOS), that is, the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (hazard ratio 2.6, P = 0.03; multivariate analysis). In addition, the most frequent variation was the T16311C in the control region, which was found in 11 (20%) of the 56 patients. This observation was confirmed in another cohort of 173 diagnostic AML samples. In this expanded group, the T16311C variation tended to be associated with chromosomal abnormalities.","['Silkjaer, Trine', 'Norgaard, Jan Maxwell', 'Aggerholm, Anni', 'Ebbesen, Lene Hyldahl', 'Kjeldsen, Eigil', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Nyvold, Charlotte Guldborg']","['Silkjaer T', 'Norgaard JM', 'Aggerholm A', 'Ebbesen LH', 'Kjeldsen E', 'Hokland P', 'Nyvold CG']","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*DNA, Mitochondrial', 'Female', 'Genes, Mitochondrial', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Young Adult']",2013/03/01 06:00,2013/06/13 06:00,['2013/03/01 06:00'],"['2013/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12090 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2013 May;90(5):385-96. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12090.

Therefore, we hypothesize that a MUC1 VNTR TACA-conjugate can be successfully formulated into a liposome-based anticancer vaccine. The immunogenicity of the vaccine should be further augmented by incorporating surface-displayed l-rhamnose (Rha) epitopes onto the liposomes to take advantage of a natural antibody-dependent antigen uptake mechanism. To validate our hypothesis, we synthesized a 20-amino-acid MUC1 glycopeptide containing a GalNAc-O-Thr (Tn) TACA by SPPS and conjugated it to a functionalized Toll-like receptor ligand (TLRL). An l-Rha-cholesterol conjugate was prepared using tetra(ethylene glycol) (TEG) as a linker. The liposome-based anticancer vaccine was formulated by the extrusion method using TLRL-MUC1-Tn conjugate, Rha-TEG-cholesterol, and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) in a total lipid concentration of 30 mM. The stability, homogeneity, and size characterization of the liposomes was evaluated by SEM and DLS measurements. The formulated liposomes demonstrated positive binding with both anti-Rha and mouse anti-human MUC1 antibodies. Groups of female BALB/c mice were immunized and boosted with a rhamnose-Ficoll (Rha-Ficoll) conjugate formulated with alum as adjuvant to generate the appropriate concentration of anti-Rha antibodies in the mice. Anti-Rha antibody titers were >25-fold higher in the groups of mice immunized with the Rha-Ficoll conjugate than the nonimmunized control groups. The mice were then immunized with the TLRL-MUC1-Tn liposomal vaccine formulated either with or without the surface displaying Rha epitopes. Sera collected from the groups of mice initially immunized with Rha-Ficoll and later vaccinated with the Rha-displaying TLRL-MUC1-Tn liposomes showed a >8-fold increase in both anti-MUC1-Tn and anti-Tn antibody titers in comparison to the groups of mice that did not receive Rha-Ficoll. T-cells from BALB/c mice primed with a MUC1-Tn peptide demonstrated increased proliferation to the Rha-liposomal vaccine in the presence of antibodies isolated from Rha-Ficoll immunized mice compared to nonimmune mice, supporting the proposed effect on antigen presentation. The anti-MUC1-Tn antibodies in the vaccinated mice serum recognized MUC1 on human leukemia U266 cells. Because this vaccine uses separate rhamnose and antigenic epitope components, the vaccine can easily be targeted to different antigens or epitopes by changing the peptide without having to change the other components.","['Sarkar, Sourav', 'Salyer, Alex C D', 'Wall, Katherine A', 'Sucheck, Steven J']","['Sarkar S', 'Salyer AC', 'Wall KA', 'Sucheck SJ']","['Department of Chemistry, The University of Toledo, 2801 West Bancroft Street, Toledo, OH 43606, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Glycopeptides)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (MUC1 protein, human)', '0 (Mucin-1)', 'QN34XC755A (Rhamnose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cancer Vaccines/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Female', 'Glycopeptides/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunization/methods', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mucin-1/*chemistry/*immunology', 'Rhamnose/*chemical synthesis/*immunology']",2013/03/01 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/03/01 06:00'],"['2013/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bc300422a [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2013 Mar 20;24(3):363-75. doi: 10.1021/bc300422a.

FA is an autosomal recessive disease with three main features: chromosome instability, hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), cisplatin and so on, and susceptible to a number of cancer types, mainly leukemia and squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck or gynecologic system. DNA crosslinking agents may led to DNA cross-linking lesion, and Fanconi anemia pathway plays a key role in repairing its cross-linking. However, FA pathway is closely linked with carcinogenesis and tumor drug resistance.

DESIGN: Pilot case-control study of childhood leukaemia and exposure to benzene assessed by repeated seasonal weekly measurements in breathing zone air samples and outside the children's dwellings, with concurrent determinations of cotinine, t-t-muconic acid (MA) and sulfo-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) in urine. PARTICIPANTS: 108 cases and 194 controls were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: Full-participation was obtained from 46 cases and 60 controls, with low dropout rates before four repeats (11% and 17%); an additional 23 cases and 80 controls allowed the collection of outdoor air samples only. The average benzene concentration in personal and outdoor air samples was 3 mug/m(3) (SD 1.45) and 2.7 mug/m(3) (SD 1.41), respectively. Personal exposure was strongly influenced by outdoor benzene concentrations, higher in the cold seasons than in warm seasons, and not affected by gender, age, area of residence or caseness. Urinary excretion of S-PMA and personal benzene exposure were well correlated. Outdoor benzene levels were lower among participant controls compared with non-participants, but did not differ between participant and non-participant cases; the direction of the bias was found to depend on the cut-point chosen to distinguish exposed and unexposed. Exposures to benzene and extremely low-frequency magnetic fields were positively correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated individual measurements are needed to account for the seasonal variability in benzene exposure, and they have the additional advantage of increasing the study power. Measurement-based assessment of benzene exposure in studies of childhood leukaemia appears feasible, although it is financially and logistically demanding.","['Lagorio, Susanna', 'Ferrante, Daniela', 'Ranucci, Alessandra', 'Negri, Sara', 'Sacco, Paolo', 'Rondelli, Roberto', 'Cannizzaro, Santina', 'Torregrossa, Maria Valeria', 'Cocco, Pierluigi', 'Forastiere, Francesco', 'Miligi, Lucia', 'Bisanti, Luigi', 'Magnani, Corrado']","['Lagorio S', 'Ferrante D', 'Ranucci A', 'Negri S', 'Sacco P', 'Rondelli R', 'Cannizzaro S', 'Torregrossa MV', 'Cocco P', 'Forastiere F', 'Miligi L', 'Bisanti L', 'Magnani C']","['National Centre for Epidemiology, Surveillance and Health Promotion, National Institute of Health, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMJ Open,BMJ open,101552874,,,,2013/02/28 06:00,2013/02/28 06:01,['2013/02/28 06:00'],"['2013/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/28 06:01 [medline]']","['bmjopen-2012-002275 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjopen-2012-002275 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Open. 2013 Feb 26;3(2). pii: bmjopen-2012-002275. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2012-002275.

The aim of this study was to find out whether HBV or its components [HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HBV core protein (HBc), and HBV X protein (HBx)] could interfere with the host DNA damage response and repair pathway. The full HBV genome or individual HBV open-reading frame (ORF) was introduced into HepG2 cells to examine the effect on host genomic stability, DNA repair efficacy in response to double-strand DNA damage, and DNA damage-induced cell death. Responses to apoptosis induction in the HBV ORF-transfected HepG2 cells were also compared with those in HBV-positive and HBV-negative human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In the absence of HBV replication, accumulation of HBsAg in liver cells without other HBV proteins enhanced DNA repair protein and tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia (PML) degradation, which resulted in resistance to apoptosis induction and deficient double-strand DNA repair. However, HBsAg-positive cells exhibited increased cell death with exposure to the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor that blocks single-strand DNA repair. These results indicate that suppression of PML by HBsAg disrupts cellular mechanisms that respond to double-strand DNA damage for DNA repair or apoptosis induction, which may facilitate hepatocarcinogenesis and open up a synthetic lethality strategy for HBsAg-positive HCC treatment.","['Chung, Yih-Lin']",['Chung YL'],"['Department of Radiation Oncology, Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center, Taipei, Taiwan. ylchung@kfsyscc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/etiology/metabolism/virology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Damage/genetics', '*DNA Repair/genetics', 'Genomic Instability', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Hepatitis B virus/*genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Hepatocytes/*metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/etiology/metabolism/virology', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2013/02/28 06:00,2013/08/03 06:00,['2013/02/28 06:00'],"['2013/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['fj.12-226639 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.12-226639 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2013 Jun;27(6):2316-27. doi: 10.1096/fj.12-226639.

RESULTS: Over the study time period, the median BMI z-score increased from 0.29 to 0.66 (P = 0.001), median fasting insulin levels increased from 2.9 to 3.1 microU/ml (P = 0.023), and the proportion of patients with insulin resistance by HOMA (>3.15) increased from 3% to 24% (P = 0.016). Median leptin increased from 2.5 to 3.5 ng/ml (P = 0.001), with levels correlated with BMI z-score. Median adiponectin level decreased from 18.0 to 14.0 microg/ml (P = 0.009), with levels inversely correlated to BMI z-score. No change in median total cholesterol and LDL levels was observed. Median triglycerides decreased (P < 0.001) and there was a trend to increase in HDL (P = 0.058). Blood pressure did not significantly change, although overall prevalence of systolic and diastolic hypertension was high (23.5% and 26.4%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Following patients over the first year of ALL maintenance therapy demonstrated that components of the MS significantly worsen over time. Preventive interventions limiting increases in BMI and insulin resistance during maintenance therapy should be targeted during this time period to avoid long-term morbidity associated with the MS in long-term survivors.","['Esbenshade, Adam J', 'Simmons, Jill H', 'Koyama, Tatsuki', 'Lindell, Robert B', 'Friedman, Debra L']","['Esbenshade AJ', 'Simmons JH', 'Koyama T', 'Lindell RB', 'Friedman DL']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and the Monroe Carell Jr Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tennessee, USA. adam.esbenshade@vanderbilt.edu""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Triglycerides)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Glucose/metabolism', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fasting/blood', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Insulin/blood', '*Insulin Resistance', 'Leptin/blood', 'Male', '*Obesity/blood/epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Triglycerides/blood']",2013/02/28 06:00,2013/08/28 06:00,['2013/02/28 06:00'],"['2012/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24489 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Aug;60(8):1287-91. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24489.

The authors sought to characterize initial dosing and TDM of IV busulfan, along with factors associated with busulfan clearance, in 729 children who underwent busulfan TDM from December 2005 to December 2008. The initial IV busulfan dose in children weighing </=12 kg ranged 4.8-fold, with only 19% prescribed the package insert dose of 1.1 mg/kg. In those children weighing >12 kg, the initial dose ranged 5.4-fold, and 79% were prescribed the package insert dose. The initial busulfan dose achieved the target exposure in only 24.3% of children. A wide range of busulfan exposures were targeted for children with the same disease (eg, 39 target busulfan exposures for the 264 children diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia). Considerable heterogeneity exists regarding when TDM is conducted and the number of pharmacokinetic samples obtained. Busulfan clearance varied by age and dosing frequency but not by underlying disease. The authors- group is currently evaluating how using population pharmacokinetics to optimize initial busulfan dose and TDM (eg, limited sampling schedule in conjunction with maximum a posteriori Bayesian estimation) may affect clinical outcomes in children.","['McCune, Jeannine S', 'Baker, K Scott', 'Blough, David K', 'Gamis, Alan', 'Bemer, Meagan J', 'Kelton-Rehkopf, Megan C', 'Winter, Laura', 'Barrett, Jeffrey S']","['McCune JS', 'Baker KS', 'Blough DK', 'Gamis A', 'Bemer MJ', 'Kelton-Rehkopf MC', 'Winter L', 'Barrett JS']","['University of Washington School of Pharmacy, Seattle, WA, USA. jmccune@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Administration, Intravenous', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alkylating Agents/*administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Infant', 'Male', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2013/02/28 06:00,2013/08/13 06:00,['2013/02/28 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/0091270012447196 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2013 Mar;53(3):264-75. doi: 10.1177/0091270012447196.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We genotyped four CD33 SNPs: rs35112940 (G>A; Arg304Gly), rs12459419 (C>T; Ala14Val), rs2455069 (A>G; Arg69Gly), and rs1803254 (G>C; 3'UTR) in pediatric patients undergoing induction chemotherapy containing GO (COG-AAML03P1 trial; n = 242) or not containing GO (St. Jude AML02 trial; n = 172). RESULTS: CD33 SNPs were correlated significantly with clinical characteristics and treatment outcome. The coding SNPs, rs35112940 and rs12459419, were significantly associated with clinical endpoints in COG-AAML03P1 but not in the St. Jude AML02 trial. Specifically, among white patients in COG-AAML03P1, the 3-year overall survival (OS) rate from remission was 84% +/- 8% for those homozygous (GG) for rs35112940 versus 68% +/- 15% for the other genotypes (P = 0.018); these patients also had a lower relapse risk and superior disease-free survival. Likewise, patients homozygous for variant allele (TT) for rs12459419 were more likely to have favorable risk disease than CC and CT genotypes (52% vs. 31%, P = 0.034) and significantly lower diagnostic blast CD33 expression than other genotypes (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that genetic variations in CD33 could impact clinical outcome of GO-based therapy in pediatric AMLs.","['Mortland, Leslie', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Walter, Roland B', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Mitra, Amit K', 'Pollard, Jessica A', 'Loken, Michael R', 'Hirsch, Betsy', 'Raimondi, Susana', 'Franklin, Janet', 'Pounds, Stanley', 'Cao, Xueyuan', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Gamis, Alan', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Lamba, Jatinder K']","['Mortland L', 'Alonzo TA', 'Walter RB', 'Gerbing RB', 'Mitra AK', 'Pollard JA', 'Loken MR', 'Hirsch B', 'Raimondi S', 'Franklin J', 'Pounds S', 'Cao X', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Gamis A', 'Meshinchi S', 'Lamba JK']","['Department of Hematology, PUMA-Institute of Personalized Medicine, College of Pharmacy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aminoglycosides/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*administration & dosage', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', '*Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",2013/02/28 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/02/28 06:00'],"['2013/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-3115 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3115 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Mar 15;19(6):1620-7. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3115.

Recently, preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME) has been shown to be a dominant repressor of RAR signaling. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thus, we further investigated ATRA response mechanisms, especially the impact of PRAME expression on ATRA responsiveness. We profiled gene expression in diagnostic samples derived from our AML HD98B trial, in which ATRA was administered in addition to intensive chemotherapy. RESULTS: Our data revealed a PRAME expression-associated gene pattern to be significantly enriched for genes involved in the retinoic acid metabolic process. In leukemia cell line models, we could show that retinoic acid-regulated cell proliferation and differentiation are impacted by PRAME expression. In patients with primary AML, repressor activity of high-PRAME levels might be overcome by the addition of ATRA as indicated by better outcome in 2 independent studies (P = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: PRAME seems to impair differentiation and to increase proliferation likely via blocking RAR signaling, which might be reversed by ATRA. PRAME therefore represents a promising target for both ATRA treatment and possibly future immunotherapeutic approaches in AML.","['Bullinger, Lars', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Gotz, Marlies', 'Botzenhardt, Ursula', 'Hofmann, Susanne', 'Russ, Annika C', 'Babiak, Anna', 'Zhang, Lu', 'Schneider, Vanessa', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Schmitt, Michael', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Greiner, Jochen']","['Bullinger L', 'Schlenk RF', 'Gotz M', 'Botzenhardt U', 'Hofmann S', 'Russ AC', 'Babiak A', 'Zhang L', 'Schneider V', 'Dohner K', 'Schmitt M', 'Dohner H', 'Greiner J']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality', 'Nucleophosmin', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptome', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",2013/02/28 06:00,2013/11/13 06:00,['2013/02/28 06:00'],"['2013/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-2524 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2524 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 May 1;19(9):2562-71. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2524.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using array comparative genomic hybridization, we evaluated the copy number aberrations of genes regulating thymus development. The expression of genes most commonly involved in copy number aberrations was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and correlated with patients' outcome. Correlation between FOXC1 copy number loss and gene expression was determined in a confirmation cohort. Cell lines were used to test the role of FOXC1 in tumors. RESULTS: Among 31 thymus development-related genes, PBX1 copy number gain and FOXC1 copy number loss were presented in 43.0% and 39.5% of the tumors, respectively. Immunohistochemistry on a series of 132 TETs, including those evaluated by comparative genomic hybridization, revealed a correlation between protein expression and copy number status only for FOXC1 but not for PBX1. Patients with FOXC1-negative tumors had a shorter time to progression and a trend for a shorter disease-related survival. The correlation between FOXC1 copy number loss and mRNA expression was confirmed in a separate cohort of 27 TETs. Ectopic FOXC1 expression attenuated anchorage-independent cell growth and cell migration in vitro.

However, a small percentage of acute leukemia cases lack straightforward immunophenotypical lineage commitment. These leukemias of ambiguous lineage represent a heterogeneous category of acute leukemia that cannot be classified as either acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). The lack of clear classification of acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage as either AML or ALL is a hurdle in treatment choice for these patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Here, we compared the microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of 17 cases with acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage and 16 cases of AML, B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (B-ALL), and T-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (T-ALL). RESULTS: We show that leukemias of ambiguous lineage do not segregate as a separate entity but exhibit miRNA expression profiles similar to AML, B-ALL, or T-ALL. We show that by using only 5 of the most lineage-discriminative miRNAs, we are able to define acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage as either AML or ALL. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate the presence of a myeloid or lymphoid lineage-specific genotype, as reflected by miRNA expression, in these acute leukemias despite their ambiguous immunophenotype. miRNA-based classification of acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage might be of additional value in therapeutic decision making.","['de Leeuw, David C', 'van den Ancker, Willemijn', 'Denkers, Fedor', 'de Menezes, Renee X', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'Smit, Linda']","['de Leeuw DC', 'van den Ancker W', 'Denkers F', 'de Menezes RX', 'Westers TM', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Smit L']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (MIRN221 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN223 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN23a microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN27 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (mirn199 microRNA, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/classification/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2013/02/28 06:00,2013/11/12 06:00,['2013/02/28 06:00'],"['2013/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-3657 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3657 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Apr 15;19(8):2187-96. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3657.

The function of ATRX and H3.3 in the maintenance of telomere chromatin integrity is further demonstrated by recent studies that show the strong association of ATRX/H3.3 mutations with alternative lengthening of telomeres in telomerase-negative human cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate that ATRX and H3.3 co-localize with the telomeric DNA and associated proteins within the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies in mouse ES cells. The assembly of these telomere-associated PML bodies is most prominent at S phase. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of PML expression induces the disassembly of these nuclear bodies and a telomere dysfunction phenotype in mouse ES cells. Loss of function of PML bodies in mouse ES cells also disrupts binding of ATRX/H3.3 and proper establishment of histone methylation pattern at the telomere. Our study demonstrates that PML bodies act as epigenetic regulators by serving as platforms for the assembly of the telomeric chromatin to ensure a faithful inheritance of epigenetic information at the telomere.","['Chang, Fiona T M', 'McGhie, James D', 'Chan, F Lyn', 'Tang, Michelle C', 'Anderson, Melissa A', 'Mann, Jeffrey R', 'Andy Choo, K H', 'Wong, Lee H']","['Chang FT', 'McGhie JD', 'Chan FL', 'Tang MC', 'Anderson MA', 'Mann JR', 'Andy Choo KH', 'Wong LH']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Atrx protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (X-linked Nuclear Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'DNA Helicases/analysis', 'DNA Repair', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histones/analysis', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/physiology', 'Phenotype', 'S Phase', 'Telomere/*metabolism', 'X-linked Nuclear Protein']",2013/02/28 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2013/02/28 06:00'],"['2013/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['gkt114 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkt114 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Apr;41(8):4447-58. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkt114.

The present study aimed to define the function of these ""oncogenic"" channels for radioresistance of leukemia cells. Chronic myeloid leukemia cells were irradiated (0-6 Gy X ray), ion channel expression and activity, Ca(2+)- and protein signaling, cell cycle progression, and cell survival were assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, patch-clamp recording, fura-2 Ca(2+)-imaging, immunoblotting, flow cytometry, and clonogenic survival assays, respectively. Ionizing radiation-induced G2/M arrest was preceded by activation of Kv3.4-like voltage-gated potassium channels. Channel activation in turn resulted in enhanced Ca(2+) entry and subsequent activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase-II, and inactivation of the phosphatase cdc25B and the cyclin-dependent kinase cdc2. Accordingly, channel inhibition by tetraethylammonium and blood-depressing substance-1 and substance-2 or downregulation by RNA interference led to release from radiation-induced G2/M arrest, increased apoptosis, and decreased clonogenic survival. Together, these findings indicate the functional significance of voltage-gated K(+) channels for the radioresistance of myeloid leukemia cells.","['Palme, Daniela', 'Misovic, Milan', 'Schmid, Evi', 'Klumpp, Dominik', 'Salih, Helmut R', 'Rudner, Justine', 'Huber, Stephan M']","['Palme D', 'Misovic M', 'Schmid E', 'Klumpp D', 'Salih HR', 'Rudner J', 'Huber SM']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Tubingen, Hoppe-Seyler-Str. 3, 72076, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pflugers Arch,Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,0154720,"['0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (KCNC4 protein, human)', '0 (Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated)', '0 (Shaw Potassium Channels)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDC25B protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin B/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'G2 Phase/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated/genetics/metabolism', 'Radiation Tolerance/genetics', 'Shaw Potassium Channels/*genetics/*metabolism', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/genetics/metabolism']",2013/02/28 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/02/28 06:00'],"['2012/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00424-013-1249-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Pflugers Arch. 2013 Aug;465(8):1209-21. doi: 10.1007/s00424-013-1249-5.

UCN-01 and perifosine are known to inhibit Akt activation. METHODS: The primary objective of this phase I study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of UCN-01 given in combination with perifosine in patients with advanced acute leukemias and myelodysplastic syndrome. Secondary objectives included safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy. Perifosine 150 mg every 6 h was given orally on day 1 followed by 100 mg once a day continuously in 28-day cycles. UCN-01 was given intravenously over 3 h on day 4 at three dose levels (DL1=40 mg/m(2); DL2=65 mg/m(2); DL3=90 mg/m(2)). RESULTS: Thirteen patients were treated (DL1, n=6; DL2, n=4; DL3, n=3) according to a traditional ""3+3"" design. Two patients at the DL3 experienced dose-limiting toxicity including grade 3-4 pericardial effusion, hypotension, hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, constitutional symptoms and grade 5 pneumonitis. Other frequent toxicities were grade 1-2 nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue and hyperglycemia. The MTD was determined to be UCN-01 65 mg/m(2) with perifosine 100 mg a day. No appreciable direct Akt inhibition could be demonstrated in patients' mononuclear cells using Western blot, however, reduced phosphorylation of the downstream target ribosomal protein S6 in leukemic blasts was noted by intracellular flow cytometry. No objective responses were observed on this study. CONCLUSION: UCN-01 and perifosine can be safely administered, but this regimen lacked clinical efficacy. This approach may have failed because of insufficient Akt inhibition in vivo.","['Gojo, Ivana', 'Perl, Alexander', 'Luger, Selina', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Norsworthy, Kelly J', 'Bauer, Kenneth S', 'Tidwell, Michael', 'Fleckinger, Stephanie', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Sausville, Edward A']","['Gojo I', 'Perl A', 'Luger S', 'Baer MR', 'Norsworthy KJ', 'Bauer KS', 'Tidwell M', 'Fleckinger S', 'Carroll M', 'Sausville EA']","['University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA, igojo1@jhmi.edu.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '2GWV496552 (perifosine)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Phosphorylcholine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Staurosporine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2013/02/28 06:00,2014/04/15 06:00,['2013/02/28 06:00'],"['2012/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-013-9937-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2013 Oct;31(5):1217-27. doi: 10.1007/s10637-013-9937-8.

We screened a panel of 94 candidate genes in a cohort of 157 patients with MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). This included 150 cases with samples obtained at MDS diagnosis and 15 cases with samples obtained at sAML transformation (8 were also analyzed at the MDS stage). We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to define the clonal architecture in eight sAML genomes and identified the range of variant allele frequencies (VAFs) for founding clone mutations. At least one mutation or cytogenetic abnormality was detected in 83% of the 150 MDS patients and 17 genes were significantly mutated (false discovery rate </=0.05). Individual genes and patient samples displayed a wide range of VAFs for recurrently mutated genes, indicating that no single gene is exclusively mutated in the founding clone.

The numbers of deaths related to MDS in the population are underestimated in routine US cancer mortality statistics which are based on only the underlying cause (UC) rather than multiple causes (MCs) of death recorded on death certificates. Additional MDS-related deaths, however, may be missed if some MDS patients die with mention of leukemia but not MDS on their death certificate. This requires studies of MCs of death among all MDS patients in population-based tumor registries. This study examined MCs of death among patients diagnosed with MDS in 2001- 2009 and reported to the population-based Connecticut Tumor Registry. MDS was the UC for 199 deaths (25.7% of all 773) and was coded as other than UC for 160 (20.7%). Another 121 (15.7%) death records, however, had leukemia without mention of MDS; the majority were coded to AML and most of the others as unspecified type of acute leukemia. If these 121 deaths are added to the 359 with mention of MDS, the total of MDS-related deaths would be 480 (or 62.1% of all 773 deaths). A total of 178 deaths (23.0% of all 773) were coded to leukemia as the UC, and would be included with leukemia (not MDS) in routine cancer mortality statistics. Leukemia diagnosed since 2010 in MDS patients is reportable to registries as a new primary cancer. This new rule will help central cancer registries to confirm leukemia diagnoses coded on death records, as part of the process of improving surveillance of cancer mortality rates in the population.","['Polednak, Anthony P', 'Phillips, Cathryn']","['Polednak AP', 'Phillips C']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Registry Manag,Journal of registry management,9804163,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cause of Death', '*Death Certificates', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*mortality', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*mortality', 'Population Surveillance', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology']",2013/02/28 06:00,2014/01/29 06:00,['2013/02/28 06:00'],"['2013/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/29 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Registry Manag. 2012 Fall;39(3):115-20.,,,,,,['HHSN261201000024C/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to Gene Ontology classification of biological processes, the highest representation of identified proteins for all three drugs belong to metabolic processes of proteins and nucleic acids and cellular processes, mainly cytoskeleton organisation and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Importantly, we observed significant proportion of changes in proteins involved in the generation of precursor metabolites and energy typical for daunorubicin, transport proteins participating in response to doxorubicin and a group of proteins of immune system characterising response to mitoxantrone. Both a paired comparison and the multivariate evaluation of quantitative data revealed daunorubicin as a distinct member of the group of anthracycline/anthracenedione drugs.

A productive monoclonal IGHV-D-J rearrangement was obtained in 99/123 patients (80%).

Dendritic cells can also induce Th17-type immunity, mediated by IL-17A. However, the controversial role of this cytokine in cancer requires further investigations. We generated dendritic cells from peripheral blood monocytes to investigate lifespan, phenotype and chemoresistance of dendritic cells, treated with IL-17A with or without IFN-gamma. Studying the expression of Bcl-2 family members, we demonstrated that dendritic cells constitutively express one pro-survival Bcl-2 member: MCL1. Immature dendritic cells were CD40(low)HLADR(low) CD1a(+) MCL1(+), did not express CD14, CD68 or BCL2A1, and displayed a short 2-day lifespan. IL-17A-treated DC exhibited a semi-mature (CD40(high) HLADR(low)) pre-M2 (CCL22(+) CD206(+) CD163(+) IL1RN(+) IL-10(-) CXCL10(-) IL-12(-)) mixed (CD1a(+) CD14+ CD68(+)) macrophage-dendritic cell phenotype. They efficiently exerted mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis and did not produce superoxide anions, in the absence of TLR engagement. Interestingly, IL-17A promoted a long-term survival of dendritic cells, beyond 12 days, that correlated to BCL2A1 induction, a pro-survival Bcl-2 family member. BCL2A1 transcription was activated by NF-kappaB, downstream of IL-17A transduction. Thus, immature dendritic cells only express MCL1, whereas IL-17A-treated dendritic cells concomitantly expressed two pro-survival Bcl-2 family members: MCL1 and BCL2A1. These latter developed chemoresistance to 11 of the 17 chemotherapy agents tested. However, high doses of either vinblastine or cytarabine decreased MCL1 expression and induced dendritic cell death. When IL-17A is produced in vivo, administration of anti-IL-17A biotherapy may impair dendritic cell survival by targeting BCL2A1 expression. Consequently, depending on the effector or regulatory role of dendritic cells, blocking IL-17A, may be either dangerous or beneficial for cancer outcomes, thus contributing to the apparent controversy around the role of IL-17A in cancer.","['Olsson Akefeldt, Selma', 'Maisse, Carine', 'Belot, Alexandre', 'Mazzorana, Marlene', 'Salvatore, Giulia', 'Bissay, Nathalie', 'Jurdic, Pierre', 'Arico, Maurizio', 'Rabourdin-Combe, Chantal', 'Henter, Jan-Inge', 'Delprat, Christine']","['Olsson Akefeldt S', 'Maisse C', 'Belot A', 'Mazzorana M', 'Salvatore G', 'Bissay N', 'Jurdic P', 'Arico M', 'Rabourdin-Combe C', 'Henter JI', 'Delprat C']","[""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-17/*pharmacology', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2013/02/27 06:00,2013/08/14 06:00,['2013/02/27 06:00'],"['2012/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0056865 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-32790 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e56865. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0056865.

Current frontline therapy for AML in North America, as reflected in the approach of the Children's Oncology Group (COG) and other pediatric consortia, is adapted from the anthracyline-intensive Medical Research Council (MRC) regimen. The purpose of this study was to describe early post-treatment cardiac function as a potential indicator of acute and long-term risk associated with this approach. PROCEDURE: A multi-center retrospective cohort analysis was conducted of AML survivors diagnosed from 2004 to 2009 and treated with MRC-based regimens. Change in left ventricular shortening fraction (LVSF) on echocardiogram was determined from baseline to latest post-treatment/pre-relapse value; associations with potential predictors were examined. RESULTS: This cohort of pediatric survivors (n = 52) was assessed at a median interval of 13 months from end of treatment. Mean cumulative anthracycline dose was 339 +/- 14 mg/m(2) . Mean baseline and post-treatment LVSF were 39.3 +/- 0.8% and 35.4 +/- 0.9%, respectively; mean percent change for individuals was -8.4 +/- 2.8% (P < 0.001). Cardiac-directed medications were initiated in four patients (7.7%). Decline in LVSF was significantly associated with cumulative anthracycline dose, increasing BMI and Hispanic ethnicity. CONCLUSION: Early, significant decline in LVSF was observed following treatment with these MRC-based regimens. Elevated BMI and Hispanic ethnicity were identified as new independent risk factors. Children and adolescents so treated are at substantial risk for late-onset cardiomyopathy, require monitoring with annual echocardiogram per current COG survivorship guidelines, and are good candidates for appropriate cardioprotection strategies.","['Orgel, Etan', 'Zung, Laura', 'Ji, Lingyun', 'Finklestein, Jerry', 'Feusner, James', 'Freyer, David R']","['Orgel E', 'Zung L', 'Ji L', 'Finklestein J', 'Feusner J', 'Freyer DR']","[""Jonathan Jaques Children's Cancer Center, Miller Children's Hospital, Long Beach, California, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Anthracyclines)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Cardiomyopathies/*chemically induced/mortality/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'United States', 'Ventricular Remodeling/*drug effects']",2013/02/27 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2013/02/27 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24498 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Sep;60(9):1528-33. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24498.

To address this issue, we initially identified the complete catalog of human protein phosphatase genes and used this catalog to study deregulation of protein phosphatases in AML. Using mRNA expression data of AML patients, we show that 11 protein phosphatases are deregulated in AML within 174 protein phosphatases. The GO enrichment study suggests that these genes are involved in multiple biological processes other than protein de-phosphorylation.

In this study, we show that following imatinib treatment, Bcr-Abl is sequestered into vesicular structures that co-localize with the autophagy marker LC3 or GABARAP. This association is inhibited by siRNA mediated knockdown of autophagy regulators (Beclin 1/ATG7). Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy also reduced Bcr-Abl/LC3 co-localization in both K562 and CML patient cells. Bcr-Abl protein expression was reduced with imatinib treatment. Inhibition of both autophagy and proteasome activity in imatinib treated cells was required to restore Bcr-Abl protein levels to those of untreated cells. This ability to down-regulate Bcr-Abl protein levels through the induction of autophagy may be an additional and important feature of the activity of imatinib.","['Elzinga, Baukje M', 'Nyhan, Michelle J', 'Crowley, Lisa C', ""O'Donovan, Tracey R"", 'Cahill, Mary R', 'McKenna, Sharon L']","['Elzinga BM', 'Nyhan MJ', 'Crowley LC', ""O'Donovan TR"", 'Cahill MR', 'McKenna SL']","['Leslie C.

In a prospective, multicenter study, chronic phase patients were eligible for cessation of IM therapy after more than 3 years if they had no detectable BCR-ABL1 transcript for at least 2 years. A total of 48 patients with a median age of 47 years (19-74 years) were enrolled. Twenty patients received IM for post-transplant relapse. After a median follow-up of 15.8 months (1.4-28.2 months) after IM discontinuation, nine of the non-transplant group lost undetectable molecular residual disease (UMRD) and major molecular response (MMR), whereas none of the 20 patients in the transplant group experienced UMRD loss. Probabilities for sustained MMR and UMRD were 64.4% and 66.3% in the non-transplant group, respectively. Of nine patients re-treated with IM, eight patients re-achieved MMR at a median of 1.7 months (0.9-2.8 months). Seven of these patients re-achieved UMRD at a median of 5.6 months (2.8-12.1 months). Previous transplantation, IM duration, and UMRD duration were significantly associated with sustained molecular responses. Our data strongly suggest that immunological control contributes to sustained suppression of residual leukemia cell expansion and that IM can be safely discontinued in patients with post-transplant relapse.","['Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Choi, Soo Young', 'Bang, Ju-Hee', 'Kim, Soo-Hyun', 'Jang, Eun-Jung', 'Byeun, Ji-Young', 'Park, Jin-Eok', 'Jeon, Hye-Rim', 'Oh, Yun Jeong', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Kim, Yeo-Kyeoung', 'Park, Joon Seong', 'Jeong, Seong Hyun', 'Kim, Sung-Hyun', 'Zang, Dae Young', 'Oh, Sukjoong', 'Koo, Dong Hoe', 'Kim, Hawk', 'Do, Young Rok', 'Kwak, Jae-Yong', 'Kim, Jeong-A', 'Kim, Dae-Young', 'Mun, Yeung-Chul', 'Mauro, Michael J', 'Kim, Dong-Wook']","['Lee SE', 'Choi SY', 'Bang JH', 'Kim SH', 'Jang EJ', 'Byeun JY', 'Park JE', 'Jeon HR', 'Oh YJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim YK', 'Park JS', 'Jeong SH', 'Kim SH', 'Zang DY', 'Oh S', 'Koo DH', 'Kim H', 'Do YR', 'Kwak JY', 'Kim JA', 'Kim DY', 'Mun YC', 'Mauro MJ', 'Kim DW']","['Cancer Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Benzamides/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",2013/02/27 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/02/27 06:00'],"['2013/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23427 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Jun;88(6):449-54. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23427.

Patients with SM-AHNMD were older, more frequently had constitutional symptoms and hematological abnormalities, less often had skin lesions, and had an inferior overall survival compared with pure SM patients (48 months vs. not-reached, P < 0.001). Karyotypic abnormalities were detected in 9/28 (32%) patients with SM-AHNMD but not in pure SM patients (P < 0.001). Combined imaging/ fluorescence-in-situ hybridization performed in four SM-AHNMD cases revealed shared abnormal signals in mast cells and myeloid cells in two patients with SM-CMML and one patient with SM-MDS, but not in the mast cells of a case SM-associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia with ATM-deletion. Quantitative mutation analysis showed higher levels of mutant KIT D816V in SM-CMML and SM-MDS than in pure SM (P < 0.001).

Genome-wide genetic and transcriptome analyses were used to investigate the origins and consequences of an early T cell developmental checkpoint breakthrough in Rag1-deficient NOD mice. Quantitative trait locus analysis mapped the presence of checkpoint breakthrough cells to several known NOD diabetes susceptibility regions, particularly insulin-dependent diabetes susceptibility genes (Idd)9/11 on chromosome 4, suggesting common genetic origins for T cell defects affecting this trait and autoimmunity. Genome-wide RNA deep-sequencing of NOD and B6 Rag1-deficient thymocytes revealed the effects of genetic background prior to breakthrough, as well as the cellular consequences of the breakthrough. Transcriptome comparison between the two strains showed enrichment in differentially expressed signal transduction genes, prominently tyrosine kinase and actin-binding genes, in accord with their divergent sensitivities to activating signals. Emerging NOD breakthrough cells aberrantly expressed both stem cell-associated proto-oncogenes, such as Lmo2, Hhex, Lyl1, and Kit, which are normally repressed at the commitment checkpoint, and post-beta-selection checkpoint genes, including Cd2 and Cd5. Coexpression of genes characteristic of multipotent progenitors and more mature T cells persists in the expanding population of thymocytes and in the thymic leukemias that emerge with age in these mice. These results show that Rag1-deficient NOD thymocytes have T cell defects that can collapse regulatory boundaries at two early T cell checkpoints, which may predispose them to both leukemia and autoimmunity.","['Yui, Mary A', 'Feng, Ni', 'Zhang, Jingli A', 'Liaw, Chen Yee', 'Rothenberg, Ellen V', 'Longmate, Jeffrey A']","['Yui MA', 'Feng N', 'Zhang JA', 'Liaw CY', 'Rothenberg EV', 'Longmate JA']","['Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA. yui@caltech.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/immunology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Mammalian', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Precursor Cells, T-Lymphoid/immunology/*metabolism', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Thymocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2013/02/27 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2013/02/27 06:00'],"['2013/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1202970 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1202970 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 Apr 1;190(7):3276-88. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1202970.

The purpose of the present study was to determine ex vivo the effect of the synthetic statin, atorvastatin, a known cholesterol-lowering drug, on peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from CLL patients. Using flow cytometry, we investigated the viability and induction of apoptosis in leukemic cells exposed to statin by the Vybrant apoptosis assay kit #4, compared with untreated control cells. We also examined the expression levels of apoptosis-regulatory proteins (Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bax), as well as products of the expression/proteolysis of lamin B, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase1 (PARP1) and p27Kip1 by western blot analysis. Moreover, the number of sub-G1 cells and DNA fragmentation in atorvastatin-treated leukemic cells were examined by flow cytometry and agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. The obtained results indicated that CLL cells ex vivo were extremely sensitive to atorvastatin. The cytotoxic effect of this statin was caused by the induction of apoptosis in the leukemic cells. The induction of apoptosis in the drug-treated model cells was confirmed by the reduction or proteolysis of apoptotic markers, such as PARP-1, lamin B and p27Kip1, the increase in the number of sub-G1 cells and DNA ladder formation. During atorvastatin-triggered apoptosis, changes in the expression levels of mitochondrial outer membrane permeability regulatory proteins of the Bcl-2 family were also observed. Ex vivo promising data indicate the strong cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic potential of atorvastatin against leukemic cells, but not normal cells. The obtained data suggest that atorvastatin be considered as a therapeutic option for the treatment of CLL.","['Zolnierczyk, Jolanta D', 'Borowiak, Arleta', 'Hikisz, Pawel', 'Cebula-Obrzut, Barbara', 'Blonski, Jerzy Z', 'Smolewski, Piotr', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Kilianska, Zofia M']","['Zolnierczyk JD', 'Borowiak A', 'Hikisz P', 'Cebula-Obrzut B', 'Blonski JZ', 'Smolewski P', 'Robak T', 'Kilianska ZM']","['Department of Cytobiochemistry, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Heptanoic Acids)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (lamin B receptor)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'A0JWA85V8F (Atorvastatin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Atorvastatin', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Heptanoic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2013/02/27 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/02/27 06:00'],"['2012/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2013.2301 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2013 May;29(5):2065-71. doi: 10.3892/or.2013.2301.

Here, we examined the metabolic changes induced by 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a glycolysis inhibitor, in leukemia cells by metabolome analysis. NB4 cells mainly utilized glucose as an energy source by glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, since metabolites in the glycolytic pathway and in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were significantly decreased by 2-DG. In THP-1 cells, metabolites in the TCA cycle were not decreased to the same extent by 2-DG as in NB4 cells, which indicates that THP-1 utilizes energy sources other than glucose. TCA cycle metabolites in THP-1 cells may be derived from acetyl-CoA by fatty acid beta-oxidation, which was supported by abundant detection of carnitine and acetylcarnitine in THP-1 cells. 2-DG treatment increased the levels of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) metabolites and augmented the generation of NADPH by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. An increase in NADPH and upregulation of glutathione synthetase expression resulted in the increase in the reduced form of glutathione by 2-DG in NB4 cells. We demonstrated that a combination of 2-DG and inhibition of PPP by dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) effectively suppressed the growth of NB4 cells. The replenishment of the TCA cycle by fatty acid oxidation by carnitine palmitoyltransferase in THP-1 cells, treated by 2-DG, might be regulated by AMPK, as the combination of 2-DG and inhibition of AMPK by compound C potently suppressed the growth of THP-1 cells. Although 2-DG has been effective in preclinical and clinical studies, this treatment has not been fully explored due to concerns related to potential toxicities such as brain toxicity at high doses. We demonstrated that a combination of 2-DG and DHEA or compound C at a relatively low concentration effectively inhibits the growth of NB4 and THP-1 cells, respectively. These observations may aid in the identification of appropriate combinations of metabolic inhibitors at low concentrations which do not cause toxicities.","['Miwa, Hiroshi', 'Shikami, Masato', 'Goto, Mineaki', 'Mizuno, Shohei', 'Takahashi, Miyuki', 'Tsunekawa-Imai, Norikazu', 'Ishikawa, Takamasa', 'Mizutani, Motonori', 'Horio, Tomohiro', 'Gotou, Mayuko', 'Yamamoto, Hidesuke', 'Wakabayashi, Motohiro', 'Watarai, Masaya', 'Hanamura, Ichiro', 'Imamura, Akira', 'Mihara, Hidetsugu', 'Nitta, Masakazu']","['Miwa H', 'Shikami M', 'Goto M', 'Mizuno S', 'Takahashi M', 'Tsunekawa-Imai N', 'Ishikawa T', 'Mizutani M', 'Horio T', 'Gotou M', 'Yamamoto H', 'Wakabayashi M', 'Watarai M', 'Hanamura I', 'Imamura A', 'Mihara H', 'Nitta M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagakute, Aichi, Japan. hmiwa@aichi-med-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '10K52CIC1Z (dorsomorphin)', '459AG36T1B (Dehydroepiandrosterone)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', '72-89-9 (Acetyl Coenzyme A)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.3.1.21 (Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Acetyl Coenzyme A/metabolism', 'Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Citric Acid Cycle/drug effects', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone/pharmacology', 'Deoxyglucose/*pharmacology', 'Energy Metabolism/*drug effects', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Metabolome/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'NADP/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Pentose Phosphate Pathway/drug effects/physiology', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",2013/02/27 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/02/27 06:00'],"['2012/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2013.2299 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2013 May;29(5):2053-7. doi: 10.3892/or.2013.2299.

PML-RAR, however, is not sufficient to induce disease in mice but requires additional oncogenic lesions during the preleukemic phase. Here, we show that knock-down of Hdac1 and Hdac2 dramatically accelerates leukemogenesis in transgenic preleukemic mice. These events are not restricted to APL because lymphomagenesis driven by deletion of p53 or, to a lesser extent, by c-myc overexpression, was also accelerated by Hdac1 knock-down. In the preleukemic phase of APL, Hdac1 counteracts the activity of PML-RAR in (1) blocking differentiation; (2) impairing genomic stability; and (3) increasing self-renewal in hematopoietic progenitors, as all of these events are affected by the reduction in Hdac1 levels. This led to an expansion of a subpopulation of PML-RAR-expressing cells that is the major source of leukemic stem cells in the full leukemic stage. Remarkably, short-term treatment of preleukemic mice with an HDAC inhibitor accelerated leukemogenesis. In contrast, knock-down of Hdac1 in APL mice led to enhanced survival duration of the leukemic animals. Thus, Hdac1 has a dual role in tumorigenesis: oncosuppressive in the early stages, and oncogenic in established tumor cells.","['Santoro, Fabio', 'Botrugno, Oronza A', 'Dal Zuffo, Roberto', 'Pallavicini, Isabella', 'Matthews, Geoffrey M', 'Cluse, Leonie', 'Barozzi, Iros', 'Senese, Silvia', 'Fornasari, Lorenzo', 'Moretti, Simona', 'Altucci, Lucia', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Chiocca, Susanna', 'Johnstone, Ricky W', 'Minucci, Saverio']","['Santoro F', 'Botrugno OA', 'Dal Zuffo R', 'Pallavicini I', 'Matthews GM', 'Cluse L', 'Barozzi I', 'Senese S', 'Fornasari L', 'Moretti S', 'Altucci L', 'Pelicci PG', 'Chiocca S', 'Johnstone RW', 'Minucci S']","['Department of Experimental Oncology at the IFOM-IEO Campus, European Institute of Oncology, via Adamello 16, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genomic Instability', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*etiology/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology', 'Valproic Acid/pharmacology']",2013/02/27 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2013/02/27 06:00'],"['2013/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58536-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-10-461988 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Apr 25;121(17):3459-68. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-10-461988.

One shortcoming with its use is that Mcl-1, a member of the Bcl-2 family, is poorly inhibited by ABT-737 and thus is a major cause of resistance. We performed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based drop-out screen to identify novel genes and pathways that could reverse resistance to ABT-737 treatment in Emicro-myc/Bcl-2 lymphoma cells engineered to rely on endogenous Mcl-1 for survival. Several drug-sensitive shRNAs were identified that were selectively depleted in the presence of ABT-737. Of these, 2 independent shRNAs targeting the RNA/DNA helicase Dhx9 were found to sensitize lymphomas to ABT-737 to an extent comparable to control Mcl-1 shRNAs. Although Dhx9 suppression sensitized both mouse and human cells to ABT-737 treatment, it did so without altering MCL-1 levels. Rather, loss of Dhx9 appeared to activate a p53-dependent apoptotic program, through aggravation of replicative stress, which was found to be both necessary and sufficient for the ABT-737-shDhx9 synthetic lethal relationship.","['Mills, John R', 'Malina, Abba', 'Lee, Teresa', 'Di Paola, Domenic', 'Larsson, Ola', 'Miething, Cornelius', 'Grosse, Frank', 'Tang, Hengli', 'Zannis-Hadjopoulos, Maria', 'Lowe, Scott W', 'Pelletier, Jerry']","['Mills JR', 'Malina A', 'Lee T', 'Di Paola D', 'Larsson O', 'Miething C', 'Grosse F', 'Tang H', 'Zannis-Hadjopoulos M', 'Lowe SW', 'Pelletier J']","['Department of Biochemistry McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Dhx9 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/physiology', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Genes, Modifier', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', '*RNA Interference', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",2013/02/27 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2013/02/27 06:00'],"['2013/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58529-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-06-434365 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Apr 25;121(17):3402-12. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-06-434365.

Only a truncated isoform of GATA1 that lacks the N-terminal 83 amino acids (GATA1-S) remains. We found through genetic studies of 106 patients with TAM that internally deleted GATA1 proteins (GATA1-IDs) lacking amino acid residues 77-119 or 74-88 (created by splicing mutations) contributed to the genesis of TAM in 6 patients. Analyses of GATA1-deficient embryonic megakaryocytic progenitors revealed that the GATA1 function in growth restriction was disrupted in GATA1-IDs. In contrast, GATA1-S promoted megakaryocyte proliferation more profoundly than that induced by GATA1 deficiency. These results indicate that the internally deleted regions play important roles in megakaryocyte proliferation and that perturbation of this mechanism is involved in the pathogenesis of TAM.","['Toki, Tsutomu', 'Kanezaki, Rika', 'Kobayashi, Eri', 'Kaneko, Hiroshi', 'Suzuki, Mikiko', 'Wang, Runan', 'Terui, Kiminori', 'Kanegane, Hirokazu', 'Maeda, Miho', 'Endo, Mikiya', 'Mizuochi, Tatsuki', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide', 'Yamamoto, Masayuki', 'Shimizu, Ritsuko', 'Ito, Etsuro']","['Toki T', 'Kanezaki R', 'Kobayashi E', 'Kaneko H', 'Suzuki M', 'Wang R', 'Terui K', 'Kanegane H', 'Maeda M', 'Endo M', 'Mizuochi T', 'Adachi S', 'Hayashi Y', 'Yamamoto M', 'Shimizu R', 'Ito E']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki 036-8562, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', 'Myeloproliferative Syndrome, Transient']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Down Syndrome/*blood/*complications/*genetics/pathology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemoid Reaction/*complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism/pathology', '*Sequence Deletion']",2013/02/27 06:00,2013/06/20 06:00,['2013/02/27 06:00'],"['2013/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58565-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-01-405746 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Apr 18;121(16):3181-4. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-01-405746.

We analyzed GBM cell lines, patient-derived tumor cell cultures, and clinical samples from patients in phase 1 clinical trials, and find that the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene mediates resistance to mTOR-targeted therapies. Direct mTOR inhibitors and EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibitors that block downstream mTOR signaling promote nuclear PML expression in GBMs, and genetic overexpression and knockdown approaches demonstrate that PML prevents mTOR and EGFR inhibitor-dependent cell death. Low doses of the PML inhibitor, arsenic trioxide, abrogate PML expression and reverse mTOR kinase inhibitor resistance in vivo, thus markedly inhibiting tumor growth and promoting tumor cell death in mice. These results identify a unique role for PML in mTOR and EGFR inhibitor resistance and provide a strong rationale for a combination therapeutic strategy to overcome it.","['Iwanami, Akio', 'Gini, Beatrice', 'Zanca, Ciro', 'Matsutani, Tomoo', 'Assuncao, Alvaro', 'Nael, Ali', 'Dang, Julie', 'Yang, Huijun', 'Zhu, Shaojun', 'Kohyama, Jun', 'Kitabayashi, Issay', 'Cavenee, Webster K', 'Cloughesy, Timothy F', 'Furnari, Frank B', 'Nakamura, Masaya', 'Toyama, Yoshiaki', 'Okano, Hideyuki', 'Mischel, Paul S']","['Iwanami A', 'Gini B', 'Zanca C', 'Matsutani T', 'Assuncao A', 'Nael A', 'Dang J', 'Yang H', 'Zhu S', 'Kohyama J', 'Kitabayashi I', 'Cavenee WK', 'Cloughesy TF', 'Furnari FB', 'Nakamura M', 'Toyama Y', 'Okano H', 'Mischel PS']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'ErbB Receptors/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Glioblastoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2013/02/27 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2013/02/27 06:00'],"['2013/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1217602110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1217602110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Mar 12;110(11):4339-44. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1217602110.

This evaluation can inform the decision whether to offer a transplant in CR1. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 8,909 patients who entered the Medical Research Council AML10, AML12, and AML15 trials, 1,271 of 3,919 patients age 16 to 49 years who did not receive a transplant in CR1 relapsed. Of these patients, 19% are alive beyond 5 years compared with 7% of patients who relapsed after an allograft in CR1. Overall survival and the contribution of a transplant in CR2 were assessed overall and by cytogenetic risk group by using Mantel-Byar analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of patients who relapsed entered CR2. This percentage varied by risk group as follows: favorable (82%), intermediate (54%), adverse (27%), and unknown (53%), which resulted in 5-year survivals of 32%, 17%, 7%, and 23%, respectively. Sixty-seven percent of remitters received an allotransplant that delivered superior survival compared with patients who did not receive a stem-cell transplant (42% v 16%). A more-stringent assessment of a transplant by using delayed-entry (Mantel-Byar) analysis confirmed the benefit of transplant overall and within intermediate and adverse risk groups but not the favorable subgroup. CONCLUSION: Successful salvage treatment of patients who do not undergo transplantation in CR1 and relapse can be achieved in 19% of patients, which is improved by a transplant except in favorable risk disease. This result suggests that, for intermediate-risk patients in particular, equivalent overall survival can be achieved by delaying transplantation until after relapse, which would require many fewer transplants.","['Burnett, Alan K', 'Goldstone, Anthony', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Milligan, Donald', 'Prentice, Archie', 'Yin, John', 'Wheatley, Keith', 'Hunter, Ann', 'Russell, Nigel']","['Burnett AK', 'Goldstone A', 'Hills RK', 'Milligan D', 'Prentice A', 'Yin J', 'Wheatley K', 'Hunter A', 'Russell N']","['Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK.

Fifty participants (n = 26 male; n = 24 female) were interviewed representing the major hematological diagnostic groups: Multiple Myeloma, Lymphoma, and Leukemia. The interviews and focus group were recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded, and thematically analyzed. The findings presented are from the participants' experiences with end-of-life care. The findings indicated that those fortunate enough to know about the benefits of palliative care are more likely to access palliative care during end-of-life care.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we took into account 3 years from 1st Jan. 2009 to 31st March.2012. Treatment adherence was quantified utilizing ratio between RDD and PDD (Prescribed Daily Dose). Persistence is reckoned taking into account the actual therapy days, comparing posology with supplied dose, drawing the graph using Kaplan-Meir method. RESULTS: Adherence results in values between 0.8 and 1.0 for Nilotinib (Adh = 0.93), Imatinib (Adh = 0.83) and Dasatinib (0.85). Imatinib has better persistence, 90% of patients in treatment exceed one year of treatment versus 83.3% for Nilotinib and 80% for Dasatinib. The cost per single day of treatment (cost per RDD) was euro 39.41 for Imatinib, euro 113.60 for Nilotinib and euro 94.84 for Dasatinib. CONCLUSION: Patients with CML have a loose of adherence both in first line with Imatinib and in second line of therapy with Dasatinib and Nilotinib. Loss of adherence remains a big problem and could be minimized by a patient-oriented project invlolving physicians, nurses, pharmacists and caregiver.","['Santoleri, Fiorenzo', 'Sorice, Paola', 'Lasala, Ruggero', 'Rizzo, Rosa Carmela', 'Costantini, Alberto']","['Santoleri F', 'Sorice P', 'Lasala R', 'Rizzo RC', 'Costantini A']","['Hospital Pharmacist, Hospital Pharmacy, General Hospital of Pescara, Pescara, Italy. fiorenzosantoleri@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides/*administration & dosage', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', '*Medication Adherence', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Thiazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/08/24 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0056813 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-28740 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e56813. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0056813.

In this study, a genome-wide serum miRNA expression analysis was performed using Solexa sequencing for initial screen, followed by validation with real-time PCR assays. The analysis was conducted on training and verification sets of serum samples from 140 newly diagnosed AML patients and 135 normal adult donors. After a two-phase selection and validation process, 6 miRNAs, miR-10a-5p, miR-93-5p, miR-129-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-181b-5p and miR-320d, were found to have significantly different expression levels in AML compared with control serum samples. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering analysis revealed the remarkable ability of the 6-miRNA profile to differentiate between AML patients and normal controls. The areas under the ROC curve for the selected miRNAs ranged from 0.8129 to 0.9531. More importantly, miR-181b-5p levels in serum were significantly associated with overall survival. These data demonstrated that the expression patterns of circulating miRNAs were systematically altered in AML and miR-181b-5p may serve as a predictor for overall survival in AML patients.","['Zhi, Feng', 'Cao, Xiangshan', 'Xie, Xiaobao', 'Wang, Biao', 'Dong, Weimin', 'Gu, Weiying', 'Ling, Yun', 'Wang, Rong', 'Yang, Yilin', 'Liu, Yan']","['Zhi F', 'Cao X', 'Xie X', 'Wang B', 'Dong W', 'Gu W', 'Ling Y', 'Wang R', 'Yang Y', 'Liu Y']","['Modern Medical Research Center, Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/metabolism', 'Prognosis']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/09/11 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0056718 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-32001 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e56718. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0056718.

While most patients respond well to imatinib, approximately 30% never achieve remission or develop resistance within 1-5 years of starting imatinib treatment. Evidence from clinical studies suggests that achieving at least 50% inhibition of a patient's Bcr-Abl kinase activity (relative to their level at diagnosis) is associated with improved patient outcomes, including reduced occurrence of resistance and longer maintenance of remission. Accordingly, sensitive assays for detecting Bcr-Abl kinase activity compatible with small amounts of patient material are desirable as potential companion diagnostics for imatinib. Here we report the detection of Bcr-Abl activity and inhibition by imatinib in the human CML cell line K562 using a cell-penetrating peptide biosensor and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. MRM enabled reproducible, selective detection of the peptide biosensor at fmol levels from aliquots of cell lysate equivalent to ~15,000 cells. This degree of sensitivity will facilitate the miniaturization of the entire assay procedure down to cell numbers approaching 15,000, making it practical for translational applications in patient cells in which the limited amount of available patient material often presents a major challenge.","['Yang, Tzu-Yi', 'Eissler, Christie L', 'Hall, Mark C', 'Parker, Laurie L']","['Yang TY', 'Eissler CL', 'Hall MC', 'Parker LL']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cell-Penetrating Peptides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides/*administration & dosage', '*Biosensing Techniques', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides/chemistry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/09/11 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0056627 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-36291 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e56627. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0056627.

This suggests a protective environment and highlights the demand for a better understanding of stromal:leukemia cell communication. As a strategy to improve clinical efficacy, we searched for novel agents capable of potentiating the stroma-diminished effects of TKI treatment of mutant FLT3-expressing cells. METHODS: We designed a combinatorial high throughput drug screen using well-characterized kinase inhibitor-focused libraries to identify novel kinase inhibitors capable of overriding stromal-mediated resistance to TKIs, such as PKC412 and AC220. Standard liquid culture proliferation assays, cell cycle and apoptosis analysis, and immunoblotting were carried out with cell lines or primary AML to validate putative candidates from the screen and characterize the mechanism(s) underlying observed synergy. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study led to the observation of synergy between selective Akt inhibitors and FLT3 inhibitors against mutant FLT3-positive AML in either the absence or presence of stroma. Our findings are consistent with evidence that Akt activation is characteristic of mutant FLT3-transformed cells, as well as observed residual Akt activity following FLT3 inhibitor treatment. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential importance of Akt as a signaling factor in leukemia survival, and supports the use of the co-culture chemical screen to identify agents able to potentiate TKI anti-leukemia activity in a cytoprotective microenvironment.","['Weisberg, Ellen', 'Liu, Qingsong', 'Zhang, Xin', 'Nelson, Erik', 'Sattler, Martin', 'Liu, Feiyang', 'Nicolais, Maria', 'Zhang, Jianming', 'Mitsiades, Constantine', 'Smith, Robert W', 'Stone, Richard', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Nonami, Atsushi', 'Griffin, James D', 'Gray, Nathanael']","['Weisberg E', 'Liu Q', 'Zhang X', 'Nelson E', 'Sattler M', 'Liu F', 'Nicolais M', 'Zhang J', 'Mitsiades C', 'Smith RW', 'Stone R', 'Galinsky I', 'Nonami A', 'Griffin JD', 'Gray N']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. ellen_weisberg@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzothiazoles/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Staurosporine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/09/11 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0056473 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-35191 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e56473. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0056473.

Biochemical assay results indicate that K145 is a selective SphK2 inhibitor. Molecular modeling studies also support this notion. In vitro studies using human leukemia U937 cells demonstrated that K145 accumulates in U937 cells, suppresses the S1P level, and inhibits SphK2. K145 also exhibited inhibitory effects on the growth of U937 cells as well as apoptotic effects in U937 cells, and that these effects may be through the inhibition of down-stream ERK and Akt signaling pathways. K145 also significantly inhibited the growth of U937 tumors in nude mice by both intraperitoneal and oral administration, thus demonstrating its in vivo efficacy as a potential lead anticancer agent. The antitumor activity of K145 was also confirmed in a syngeneic mouse model by implanting murine breast cancer JC cells in BALB/c mice.

The aim of this study was to identify new markers of drug resistance and clinical response in T-ALL. We measured gene expression and drug sensitivity in 15 pediatric T-ALL cell lines to find signatures predictive of resistance to 10 agents used in therapy. These were used to generate a model for outcome prediction in patient cohorts using microarray data from diagnosis specimens. In three independent T-ALL cohorts, the 10-drug model was able to accurately identify patient outcome, indicating that the in vitro-derived drug-gene profiles were clinically relevant. Importantly, predictions of outcome within each cohort were linked to distinct drugs, suggesting that different mechanisms contribute to relapse. Sulfite oxidase (SUOX) expression and the drug-transporter ABCC1 (MRP1) were linked to thiopurine sensitivity, suggesting novel pathways for targeting resistance. This study advances our understanding of drug resistance in T-ALL and provides new markers for patient stratification. The results suggest potential benefit from the earlier use of 6-mercaptopurine in T-ALL therapy or the development of adjuvants that may sensitize blasts to this drug.

In an effort to discover new potent Pim-1 inhibitors, a previously identified ATP-competitive indolyl-pyrrolone scaffold was expanded to derive structure-activity relationship data. A virtual screening campaign was also performed, which led to the discovery of additional ATP-competitive inhibitors as well as a series of 2-aminothiazole derivatives, which are noncompetitive with respect to both ATP and peptide substrate. This mechanism of action, which resembles allosteric inhibition, has not previously been characterized for Pim-1. Notably, further evaluation of the 2-aminothiazoles indicated a synergistic inhibitory effect in enzymatic assays when tested in combination with ATP-competitive inhibitors.

NPM1 plays a role in several cellular functions, including ribosome biogenesis and export, centrosome duplication, chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and response to stress stimuli. Much of the interest in this protein arises from its relevance in human malignancies. NPM1 is frequently overexpressed in solid tumors and is the target of several chromosomal translocations in hematologic neoplasms. Notably, NPM1 has been characterized as the most frequently mutated gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mutations alter the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of the protein and result in its aberrant nuclear export and stable cytosolic localization. In this review, we focus on the leukemia-associated NPM1 C-terminal domain and describe its structure, function, and the effect exerted by leukemic mutations.

It is a promising drug for patients with relapsed acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), but its clinical efficacy is burdened by the serious cardiac toxicities. AIM: The present study was designed to investigate the toxic mechanism of arsenic in cardiac tissue at its clinically relevant concentrations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental rats were administered with As2O3 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg body weight, orally for a period of 45 days. Cardiac toxicities were recorded by lipid peroxidation, activities of glutathione dependent antioxidant and antiperoxidative enzymes, cardiac arsenic accumulation and histopathological changes. RESULTS: In vivo studies revealed a significant rise in lipid peroxidation, decline in reduced glutathione, glutathione dependent antioxidant enzymes and antiperoxidative enzymes in the cardiac tissue of arsenic treated rats. The extent of free radical production was found increased with periodic rise in the arsenic concentration. The experimental group which received 8 mg/kg body weight of arsenic exhibited the highest deposition of arsenic in cardiac tissue. Light microscopic examination of cardiac tissues in arsenic treated rats has showed increased structural abnormalities like myocardial fibre swelling, capillary congestion and micro-haemorrhages. CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that the mechanism of arsenic induced cardiac toxicity is associated with the accumulation of arsenic in tissue and the extent of free radical production.","['Mathews, V V', 'Paul, M V S', 'Abhilash, M', 'Manju, A', 'Abhilash, S', 'Nair, R H']","['Mathews VV', 'Paul MV', 'Abhilash M', 'Manju A', 'Abhilash S', 'Nair RH']","['School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam, Kerala, India. harinairsbs@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.8.1.7 (Glutathione Reductase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/metabolism', 'Body Burden', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Glutathione Reductase', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxides/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2013/04/26 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2013 Feb;17 Suppl 1:34-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to analyze mortality and causes of death in individuals with DS during the period 1969-2003. All individuals with DS that died between 1969 and 2003 in Sweden, and all individuals born with DS in Sweden between 1974 and 2003 were included. Data were obtained from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, the Swedish Birth Defects Register, and the National Cause of Death Register. Median age at death has increased by 1.8 years per year. The main cause of death was pneumonia. Death from congenital heart defects decreased. Death from atherosclerosis was rare but more frequent than reported previously. Dementia was not reported in any subjects with DS before 40 years of age, but was a main or contributing cause of death in 30% of the older subjects. Except for childhood leukemia, cancer as a cause of death was rare in all age groups. Mortality in DS, particularly infant mortality, has decreased markedly during the past decades. Median age at death is increasing and is now almost 60 years. Death from cancer is rare in DS, but death from dementia is common.","['Englund, Annika', 'Jonsson, Bjorn', 'Zander, Cecilia Soussi', 'Gustafsson, Jan', 'Anneren, Goran']","['Englund A', 'Jonsson B', 'Zander CS', 'Gustafsson J', 'Anneren G']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Med Genet A,American journal of medical genetics.

CLL cells accumulate in the peripheral blood, in the bone marrow and in secondary lymphoid organs. Unlike circulating CLL cells, CLL cells resident in these last two compartments display high chemoresistance and proliferative capacity. Given the importance of the microenvironment in this disease, strategies that aim to develop new therapeutic agents need to consider this critical factor. Various cell culture conditions have been described that attempt to emulate either the different types of microenvironments in which CLL cells are found or an individual component of a particular microenvironment. Here, a methodology that partially mimics the interaction between CLL cells and the CD3+ CD4+ CD154+ T cells is described. Moreover, within this method, two protocols are presented and compared that may partially recapitulate different physiological states. The methodology can be exploited for target validation and drug development in CLL.","['Natoni, Alessandro', ""O'Dwyer, Michael"", 'Santocanale, Corrado']","['Natoni A', ""O'Dwyer M"", 'Santocanale C']","['Centre for Chromosome Biology and National Centre of Biomedical Engineering and Science, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD40 Ligand/metabolism', '*Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cellular Microenvironment/*physiology', 'Cricetinae', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/08/08 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-62703-311-4_14 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2013;986:217-26. doi: 10.1007/978-1-62703-311-4_14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these studies lack the data necessary to evaluate mortality trends over time and differences in resource utilization between induction regimens. Moreover, these trials likely underreport the clinical toxicities experienced by patients. METHODS: The Pediatric Health Information System database was used to identify children treated for presumed de novo AML between 1999 and 2010. Induction mortality, risk factors for induction mortality, and resource utilization by induction regimen were estimated using standard frequentist statistics, logistic regression, and Poisson regression, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 1686 patients were identified with an overall induction case fatality rate of 5.4% that decreased from 9.8% in 2003 to 2.1% in 2009 (P = .0023). The case fatality rate was 9.0% in the intensively timed DCTER (dexamethasone, cytarabine, thioguanine, etoposide, and rubidomycin [daunomycin]/idarubicin) induction and 3.8% for ADE (cytarabine, daunomycin, and etoposide) induction (adjusted odds ratio = 2.2, 95% confidence interval = 1.1-4.5). Patients treated with intensively timed DCTER regimens had significantly greater antibiotic, red cell/platelet transfusion, analgesic, vasopressor, renal replacement therapy, and radiographic resource utilization than patients treated with ADE regimens. Resource utilization was substantially higher than reported in published pediatric AML clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Induction mortality for children with AML decreased significantly as ADE use increased. In addition to higher associated mortality, intensively timed DCTER regimens had a correspondingly higher use of health care resources. Using resource utilization data as a proxy for adverse events, adverse event rates reported on clinical trials substantially underestimated the clinical toxicities of all pediatric AML induction regimens.","['Kavcic, Marko', 'Fisher, Brian T', 'Li, Yimei', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Torp, Kari', 'Walker, Dana M', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung', 'Lee, Grace E', 'Tasian, Sarah K', 'Vujkovic, Marijana', 'Bagatell, Rochelle', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Kavcic M', 'Fisher BT', 'Li Y', 'Seif AE', 'Torp K', 'Walker DM', 'Huang YS', 'Lee GE', 'Tasian SK', 'Vujkovic M', 'Bagatell R', 'Aplenc R']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA. kavcicm@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAV regimen', 'DCTER protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Health Resources/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, Pediatric/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/ethnology/*mortality', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.27957 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2013 May 15;119(10):1916-23. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27957.

In addition to the removal of typical product and process-related impurities, chromatography steps are also used to remove potential adventitious viral contaminants and non-infectious retrovirus-like particles expressed by rodent cell lines used for production. This article evaluates the feasibility of using HTS in a 96-well batch-binding format to study removal of the model retrovirus xenotropic murine leukemia virus (xMuLV) from product streams. Two resins were examined: the anion exchange resin Q Sepharose Fast Flow (QSFF) and Capto adhere, a mixed mode resin. QSFF batch-binding HTS data was generated using two mAbs at various pHs, NaCl concentrations, and levels of impurities. Comparison of HTS data to that generated using the column format showed good agreement with respect to virus retentation at different pHs, NaCl concentrations and impurity levels. Results indicate that NaCl concentration and impurity level, but not pH, are key parameters that can impact xMuLV binding to both resins. Binding of xMuLV to Capto adhere appeared to tolerate higher levels of NaCl and impurity than QSFF, and showed some product-specific impact on binding that was not observed with QSFF. Overall, the results demonstrate that the 96-well batch-binding HTS technique can be an effective tool for rapidly defining conditions for robust virus clearance on chromatographic resins.","['Connell-Crowley, Lisa', 'Larimore, Elizabeth A', 'Gillespie, Ron']","['Connell-Crowley L', 'Larimore EA', 'Gillespie R']","['Drug Substance Development, Amgen Inc., 1201 Amgen Court West, Seattle, WA 98119, USA. connelll@amgen.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,,IM,"['Animals', 'Biotechnology/*methods', 'CHO Cells', 'Chromatography/*methods', 'Cricetulus', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays/*methods', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Salinity', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*isolation & purification']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/10 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bit.24869 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2013 Jul;110(7):1984-94. doi: 10.1002/bit.24869.

We examined clinical and laboratory findings, associated disorders, and survival in an older mastocytosis population. After receiving Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board approval, we identified 42 patients aged 70 years and older at the time of diagnosis of SM. Associated disorders, cytogenetic abnormalities, laboratory findings, and survival were recorded. Only 10 patients had no associated hematologic disorder. Single or multiple chromosomal abnormalities, exclusive of the KIT Asp816Val mutation, were detected in eight patients (19%). KIT Asp816Val mutation was present in 14 patients, negative in three, and not tested in 25. Slight to marked bone marrow hypercellularity was observed in 33 patients (79%). Concurrent hematologic abnormalities included chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n = 7), acute myelocytic leukemia (n = 1), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 7), eosinophilia (n = 7), myelofibrosis (n = 1), myeloproliferative disorder (n = 1), multiple myeloma (n = 1), B-cell lymphoma (n = 1), and thrombocytopenia (n = 4). Eight patients had a hematologic disorder that preceded the diagnosis of SM. Tryptase levels were elevated in 38 of 39 patients tested. Survival from the diagnosis of SM was poor for patients with associated thrombocytopenia, leukemias, and MDS. In conclusion, patients with SM diagnosed at age 70 or older have an increased risk of secondary hematologic disorders and abnormal laboratory findings.

A precise diagnosis is critical, because there is overlap between the clinical and laboratory findings of MDS and other malignant and nonmalignant hematologic disorders. Several prognostic scoring systems (IPSS, WPSS, LR-PSS, and IPSS-R) assess a patient's risk of progression to AML and overall survival. Many patients are elderly, so age and comorbidities are an important consideration. Patients with lower-risk disease are treated with growth factors (erythropoietin stimulating agents and/or G-CSF) and immunomodulatory agents (antithymocyte globulin and/or lenalidomide). Patients with higher-risk disease have a higher risk of progression to AML and are treated with hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine) and allogeneic stem cell transplantation if appropriate. Recent laboratory studies have increased our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. Mutations in genes effecting ribosomes, splicing of RNA and epigenetics have been discovered.

Despite treatment with steroids and immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, mizoribine, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus, the patient relapsed 14 times. At the age of 19 years, she developed chronic myelogenous leukemia, against which imatinib achieved cytogenetic remission. The patient received an allogeneic bone marrow graft transplantation from an unrelated marrow bank donor, with an uncomplicated recovery and molecular genetic remission. Immunosuppressants were withdrawn within 6 months. The patient is now without drug treatment. Complete remission of nephrotic syndrome has also been maintained for over 4 years without any drug administration.

In hematological malignancies, COX-2 expression was found to correlate with poor patient prognosis. However, the exact role of COX-2 expression in these malignancies, and particularly in erythroleukemias, remains unclear. The aim of this work was to describe and understand the relationships between COX-2 expression and apoptosis rate in erythroleukemia cells after apoptosis induction by several anticancer agents. We used three different erythroleukemia cell lines in which COX-2 expression was modulated by transfection with either COX-2 siRNA or COX-2 cDNA. These cellular models were then treated with apoptosis inducers and apoptosis onset and intensity was followed. Cell signalling was evaluated in unstimulated transfected cells or after apoptosis induction. We found that COX-2 inhibition rendered erythroleukemia cells more sensitive to apoptosis induction and that in cells overexpressing COX-2 apoptosis induction was reduced. We demonstrated that COX-2 inhibition decreased the pro-survival Akt signalling and activated the negative regulator of Akt signalling, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN). Conversely, in COX-2 overexpressing cells, Akt signalling was activated and PTEN was inhibited. In these last cells, inhibition of casein kinase 2 or Akt signalling restored sensitivity to apoptotic agents. Our findings highlighted that COX-2 can positively regulate Akt signalling mostly through PTEN inhibition, partly via casein kinase 2 activation, and enhances survival of erythroleukemia cells exposed to anticancer agents.","['Bertrand, Julian', 'Liagre, Bertrand', 'Ghezali, Lamia', 'Beneytout, Jean-Louis', 'Leger, David Yannick']","['Bertrand J', 'Liagre B', 'Ghezali L', 'Beneytout JL', 'Leger DY']","['FR 3503 GEIST, EA 1069 Laboratoire de Chimie des Substances Naturelles, GDR CNRS 3049, Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite de Limoges, 2 rue du Docteur Marcland, 87025 Limoges Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Casein Kinase II/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/12/24 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-013-0825-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2013 Jul;18(7):836-50. doi: 10.1007/s10495-013-0825-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have reported that surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors detect large changes of refractive index (RI) with living cells, such as mast cells, human basophils and lymphocytes. However conventional SPR sensors detect only an average change of RI with thousands of cells at detectable area on a sensor chip. Therefore, we developed an SPR imaging (SPRI) sensor with a CMOS camera and an objective lens in order to visualize RI of individual living cells and their changes upon stimuli. The SPRI sensor we developed could detect reactions of individual rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells and mouse keratinocyte cells in response to specific or nonspecific stimuli. Moreover, the sensor could detect the reactions of individual human basophils isolated from patients in response to antigens (allergens). Thus the technique can visualize the effect of various stimuli, inhibitors and/or conditions on cell reactions as change of intracellular RI distribution at single cell levels. Establishment of the technique to rapidly isolate cells from patient blood should enable us to utilize SPRI system as a high throughput screening system in clinical diagnosis, such as type I hypersensitivity and drug hypersensitivity, and as a tool to reveal novel phenomena in evanescent fields around plasma membranes.","['Yanase, Yuhki', 'Hiragun, Takaaki', 'Yanase, Tetsuji', 'Kawaguchi, Tomoko', 'Ishii, Kaori', 'Hide, Michihiro']","['Yanase Y', 'Hiragun T', 'Yanase T', 'Kawaguchi T', 'Ishii K', 'Hide M']","['Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Allergol Int,Allergology international : official journal of the Japanese Society of Allergology,9616296,['0 (Allergens)'],IM,"['Allergens/immunology', 'Animals', 'Basophils/*cytology/*immunology', 'Biosensing Techniques/instrumentation/*methods', 'Cell Line', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays/methods', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity, Immediate/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance/instrumentation/*methods']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/10/18 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S1323-8930(15)30124-6 [pii]', '10.2332/allergolint.12-RA-0505 [doi]']",ppublish,Allergol Int. 2013 Jun;62(2):163-9. doi: 10.2332/allergolint.12-RA-0505.

Despite progress in the clinical and biological characterization of NPM1-mutated AML, the role of NPM1 mutation in leukemogenesis in vivo has not been fully elucidated. We report a novel mouse model that conditionally expresses the most common human NPM1 mutation (type A) in the hematopoietic compartment. In Npm1-TCTG/WT;Cre(+) mice, the NPM1 mutant localized in the cytoplasm (NPMc(+)) of bone marrow (BM) cells. The mutant mice developed no AML after 1.5-year follow-up. However, NPMc(+) expression determined a significant platelet count reduction and an expansion of the megakaryocytic compartment in the BM and spleen. Serum thrombopoietin levels overlapped in mutant vs control mice, and BM cells from Npm1-TCTG/WT;Cre(+) mice formed more megakaryocytic colonies in vitro. Moreover, we demonstrated the up-regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs; miR-10a, miR-10b, and miR-20a) inhibiting megakaryocytic differentiation along with increased expression of HOXB genes. Notably, these findings mimic those of human NPM1-mutated AML, which also exhibits a similar miRNA profile and expansion of the megakaryocytic compartment. Our mouse model provides evidence that the NPM1 mutant affects megakaryocytic development, further expanding our knowledge of the role of NPM1 mutant in leukemogenesis.","['Sportoletti, Paolo', 'Varasano, Emanuela', 'Rossi, Roberta', 'Bereshchenko, Oxana', 'Cecchini, Debora', 'Gionfriddo, Ilaria', 'Bolli, Niccolo', 'Tiacci, Enrico', 'Intermesoli, Tamara', 'Zanghi, Pamela', 'Masciulli, Arianna', 'Martelli, Maria Paola', 'Falzetti, Franca', 'Martelli, Massimo F', 'Falini, Brunangelo']","['Sportoletti P', 'Varasano E', 'Rossi R', 'Bereshchenko O', 'Cecchini D', 'Gionfriddo I', 'Bolli N', 'Tiacci E', 'Intermesoli T', 'Zanghi P', 'Masciulli A', 'Martelli MP', 'Falzetti F', 'Martelli MF', 'Falini B']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Perugia, Ospedale S.

This review focuses on the role of MEF2C in the hematopoietic system and on aberrant MEF2C expression in human leukemia.","['Cante-Barrett, K', 'Pieters, R', 'Meijerink, J P P']","['Cante-Barrett K', 'Pieters R', 'Meijerink JP']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (MEF2 Transcription Factors)', '0 (MEF2C protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2013/02/26 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201356 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.56 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2014 Jan 23;33(4):403-10. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.56.

The main feature of the disease is accumulation of the malignant cells due to decreased apoptosis. CD84 belongs to the signaling lymphocyte activating molecule family of immunoreceptors, and has an unknown function in CLL cells. Here, we show that the expression of CD84 is significantly elevated from the early stages of the disease, and is regulated by macrophage migration inhibitory factor and its receptor, CD74. Activation of cell surface CD84 initiates a signaling cascade that enhances CLL cell survival. Both downmodulation of CD84 expression and its immune-mediated blockade induce cell death in vitro and in vivo. In addition, analysis of samples derived from an on-going clinical trial, in which human subjects were treated with humanized anti-CD74 (milatuzumab), shows a decrease in CD84 messenger RNA and protein levels in milatuzumab-treated cells. This downregulation was correlated with reduction of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 expression. Thus, our data show that overexpression of CD84 in CLL is an important survival mechanism that appears to be an early event in the pathogenesis of the disease. These findings suggest novel therapeutic strategies based on the blockade of this CD84-dependent survival pathway.","['Binsky-Ehrenreich, I', 'Marom, A', 'Sobotta, M C', 'Shvidel, L', 'Berrebi, A', 'Hazan-Halevy, I', 'Kay, S', 'Aloshin, A', 'Sagi, I', 'Goldenberg, D M', 'Leng, L', 'Bucala, R', 'Herishanu, Y', 'Haran, M', 'Shachar, I']","['Binsky-Ehrenreich I', 'Marom A', 'Sobotta MC', 'Shvidel L', 'Berrebi A', 'Hazan-Halevy I', 'Kay S', 'Aloshin A', 'Sagi I', 'Goldenberg DM', 'Leng L', 'Bucala R', 'Herishanu Y', 'Haran M', 'Shachar I']","['Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Hematology Institute, Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Hematology Institute, Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Biological Regulation, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Biological Regulation, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Garden State Cancer Center, Center for Molecular Medicine and Immunology, Morris Plains, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Institute, Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD84 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family)', '0 (invariant chain)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Survival', 'DNA Primers', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family']",2013/02/26 06:00,2014/04/24 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/02 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201331 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.31 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2014 Feb 20;33(8):1006-16. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.31.

The alveolar subtype is frequently associated with a PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein that is known to contribute to the undifferentiated myogenic phenotype of RMS cells. Histone methylation of lysine residues controls developmental processes in both normal and malignant cell contexts. Here we show that JARID2, which encodes a protein known to recruit various complexes with histone-methylating activity to their target genes, is significantly overexpressed in RMS with PAX3-FOXO1 compared with the fusion gene-negative RMS (t-test; P < 0.0001). Multivariate analyses showed that higher JARID2 levels are also associated with metastases at diagnosis, independent of fusion gene status and RMS subtype (n = 120; P = 0.039). JARID2 levels were altered by silencing or overexpressing PAX3-FOXO1 in RMS cell lines with and without the fusion gene, respectively. Consistent with this, we demonstrated that JARID2 is a direct transcriptional target of the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein. Silencing JARID2 resulted in reduced cell proliferation coupled with myogenic differentiation, including increased expression of Myogenin (MYOG) and Myosin Light Chain (MYL1) in RMS cell lines representative of both the alveolar and embryonal subtypes. Induced myogenic differentiation was associated with a decrease in JARID2 levels and this phenotype could be rescued by overexpressing JARID2. Furthermore, we that showed JARID2 binds to and alters the methylation status of histone H3 lysine 27 in the promoter regions of MYOG and MYL1 and that the interaction of JARID2 at these promoters is dependent on EED, a core component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Therefore, JARID2 is a downstream effector of PAX3-FOXO1 that maintains an undifferentiated myogenic phenotype that is characteristic of RMS. JARID2 and other components of PRC2 may represent novel therapeutic targets for treating RMS patients.","['Walters, Z S', 'Villarejo-Balcells, B', 'Olmos, D', 'Buist, T W S', 'Missiaglia, E', 'Allen, R', 'Al-Lazikani, B', 'Garrett, M D', 'Blagg, J', 'Shipley, J']","['Walters ZS', 'Villarejo-Balcells B', 'Olmos D', 'Buist TW', 'Missiaglia E', 'Allen R', 'Al-Lazikani B', 'Garrett MD', 'Blagg J', 'Shipley J']","['Sarcoma Molecular Pathology Team, Divisions of Molecular Pathology and Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, London, UK.', 'Sarcoma Molecular Pathology Team, Divisions of Molecular Pathology and Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, London, UK.', '1] Sarcoma Molecular Pathology Team, Divisions of Molecular Pathology and Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, London, UK [2] Sarcoma Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital NHS Trust, London, UK.', '1] Sarcoma Molecular Pathology Team, Divisions of Molecular Pathology and Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, London, UK [2] Computational Biology and Chemogenomics, Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, Division of Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, London, UK.', '1] Sarcoma Molecular Pathology Team, Divisions of Molecular Pathology and Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, London, UK [2] Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Bioinformatics Core Facility, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Sarcoma Molecular Pathology Team, Divisions of Molecular Pathology and Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, London, UK.', 'Computational Biology and Chemogenomics, Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, Division of Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, London, UK.', 'Cell Cycle Control Team, Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, Division of Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, London, UK.', 'Medicinal Chemistry, Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, Division of Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, London, UK.', 'Sarcoma Molecular Pathology Team, Divisions of Molecular Pathology and Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (JARID2 protein, human)', '0 (Myogenin)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PAX3-FOXO1A fusion protein, human)', '0 (Paired Box Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Histone Demethylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Muscle Development/*genetics', 'Myogenin/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Paired Box Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2013/02/26 06:00,2014/04/25 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201346 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.46 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2014 Feb 27;33(9):1148-57. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.46.

In addition, aberrant expression of Hoxa9 is strongly associated with both T cell and myeloid leukemia in mice and humans. Despite this strong association, enforced expression of Hoxa9 in murine bone marrow or thymus has only shown a modest ability to transform cells. To investigate this question, we used Vav regulatory elements to generate a transgenic mouse that targets Hoxa9 overexpression to all hematopoietic tissues. High-level expression of the Hoxa9 transgene in the hematopoietic compartment was associated with embryonic lethality, as no pups from founders that expressed high levels of the transgene were born live. However, offspring of an additional founder line, which expressed lower levels of Hoxa9, developed a precursor T cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, accompanied by spontaneous Notch1 mutations. In contrast to most murine models of leukemia associated with Hoxa9 overexpression, the Vav-Hoxa9 mice did not overexpress other Hoxa cluster genes, mir196b (a microRNA that is embedded in the Hoxa locus), Meis1, or Pbx3. The Hoxa9 transgenic mouse reported in this study provides a suitable system for the study of Hoxa9 collaborators that drive myeloid and lymphoid malignant transformation.","['Beachy, Sarah H', 'Onozawa, Masahiro', 'Silverman, Deborah', 'Chung, Yang Jo', 'Rivera, Mariela Martinez', 'Aplan, Peter D']","['Beachy SH', 'Onozawa M', 'Silverman D', 'Chung YJ', 'Rivera MM', 'Aplan PD']","['Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Genes, Lethal', 'Hematopoietic System/metabolism/pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/08/02 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(13)00054-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2013.02.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2013 Jun;41(6):518-529.e5. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2013.02.006.

Although the TK inhibitor imatinib mesylate, which targets the BCR-ABL protein, has been proven to be effective in controlling leukemic growth, imatinib resistance has been observed with disease relapse because of point mutations in the ABL gene that inhibit imatinib efficacy. In this study, we designed oligodeoxyribozymes (DNAzymes) that specifically target and cleave both the junction sequence and the site of the point mutation (T315I), conferring imatinib resistance in BCR-ABL mRNA. DNAzymes significantly induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in wild-type and T315I-mutant BCR-ABL-positive cells. Selective cleavage of T315I-mutant ABL mRNA by DNAzyme (T315I Dz) led to cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, with induction of caspase-3/-7 in imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL-positive cells harboring the T315I mutation. Moreover, cotreatment with the DNAzyme targeting the T315I mutation and imatinib resulted in enhanced inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in T315I leukemic cells as compared with imatinib alone, thereby antagonizing imatinib resistance in CML cells bearing T315I-mutant BCR-ABL.

As well known, methotrexate (MTX) is used widely to treat various neoplastic diseases such as acute lymphoblast leukemia, lymphoma and solid cancers and autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. The commercially available formulations of this drug have disadvantages due to the traditional release process that occurs in the body. Thus, this work is focused on the long-term controlled MTX delivery because this one could eliminate over or underdosing, could maintain drug levels in desired range, could increase patient compliance and prevent the side effects. Therefore, the mesoporous materials are used and efficient MTX-delivery systems, based on above-mentioned mesoporous materials, are successfully prepared by intercalation. The obtained drug carriers were tested in the controlled MTX-drug release process and the influence of the pore morphology and geometry on MTX release profiles was extensively studied comparatively. The prepared MTX delivery systems were characterized by FTIR and UV-vis spectroscopy, N2 sorption measurements. Then, the data obtained from the in vitro release studies have been analyzed, and in order to evaluate the MTX-release mechanism and kinetics, the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation has been applied.","['Alexa, Iuliana Florentina', 'Pastravanu, Cristina Giorgiana', 'Ignat, Maria', 'Popovici, Evelini']","['Alexa IF', 'Pastravanu CG', 'Ignat M', 'Popovici E']","['Alexandru Ioan Cuza University, Faculty of Chemistry, Iasi, Romania.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,"Colloids and surfaces.

We previously identified SMAP1 as an ARF6 GTPase-activating protein that functions in clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Because abnormalities in clathrin-dependent trafficking are often associated with oncogenesis, we targeted Smap1 in mice to examine its physiological and pathological significance. Smap1-deficent mice exhibited healthy growth, but their erythroblasts showed enhanced transferrin endocytosis. In mast cells cultured in SCF, Smap1 deficiency did not affect the internalization of c-KIT but impaired the sorting of internalized c-KIT from multivesicular bodies to lysosomes, resulting in intracellular accumulation of undegraded c-KIT that was accompanied by enhanced activation of ERK and increased cell growth. Interestingly, approximately 50% of aged Smap1-deficient mice developed anemia associated with morphologically dysplastic cells of erythroid-myeloid lineage, which are hematological abnormalities similar to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in humans. Furthermore, some Smap1-deficient mice developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of various subtypes.

The interactions between altered tissue biomechanics and cellular signaling that sustain progressive fibrosis are not well defined. In this study, we used ex vivo and in vivo approaches to define a mechanotransduction pathway involving Rho/Rho kinase (Rho/ROCK), actin cytoskeletal remodeling, and a mechanosensitive transcription factor, megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1), that coordinately regulate myofibroblast differentiation and survival. Both in an experimental mouse model of lung fibrosis and in human subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), we observed activation of the Rho/ROCK pathway, enhanced actin cytoskeletal polymerization, and MKL1 cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling. Pharmacologic disruption of this mechanotransduction pathway with the ROCK inhibitor fasudil induced myofibroblast apoptosis through a mechanism involving downregulation of BCL-2 and activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Treatment with fasudil during the postinflammatory fibrotic phase of lung injury or genetic ablation of Mkl1 protected mice from experimental lung fibrosis. These studies indicate that targeting mechanosensitive signaling in myofibroblasts to trigger the intrinsic apoptosis pathway may be an effective approach for treatment of fibrotic disorders.","['Zhou, Yong', 'Huang, Xiangwei', 'Hecker, Louise', 'Kurundkar, Deepali', 'Kurundkar, Ashish', 'Liu, Hui', 'Jin, Tong-Huan', 'Desai, Leena', 'Bernard, Karen', 'Thannickal, Victor J']","['Zhou Y', 'Huang X', 'Hecker L', 'Kurundkar D', 'Kurundkar A', 'Liu H', 'Jin TH', 'Desai L', 'Bernard K', 'Thannickal VJ']","['Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama 35294-0006, USA. yzhou@uab.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'Q0CH43PGXS (fasudil)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Actin Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Mechanotransduction, Cellular', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myofibroblasts/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/chemically induced/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/physiology', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'rho-Associated Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/05/15 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['66700 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI66700 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2013 Mar;123(3):1096-108. doi: 10.1172/JCI66700.

METHODS: A total of 85 patients with CML were treated according to the Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA) guidelines and at the end of the 18th month a blood sample were collected for genotyping. Genomic DNA was extracted and TP53 codon 72 genotyping was performed by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR), which detects argine or proline alleles. RESULT: Of the 85 CML samples, 27 samples were homozygous for arginine (Arg/Arg), 12 homozygous for proline (Pro/Pro) and 46 samples heterozygous (Arg/Pro). TP53 codon 72 polymorphism was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (chi(2)=1.17, P=0.37). We did not find significant association between codon 72 polymorphism and age at diagnosis and sex (P=0.76 and P=0.33, respectively). High Sokal score are significantly associated with Arg/Arg genotype carriers (Odds ratio, OR=4.09; 95% confidence interval, CI 1.01=15.89; P=0.036). The arginine allele in homozygosis also have an increased risk of failure response to imatinib when compared with both, the heterozygous (Arg/Pro) and proline homozygous patients (P=0.021; OR=2.99, 95% CI=1.16-7.67). Additionally, interaction analysis with age at diagnosis revealed that among patients over 40-yr old, Arg/Arg genotype was significantly associated with non-responder patients (P=0.007; OR=5.13, 95% CI=1.5-17.55). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that in CML patients, TP53 codon 72 polymorphism may contribute to a high Sokal score and failure to imatinib treatment.","['Camelo-Santos, Jeany', 'do Prado Barbosa, Adriana', 'de Paula Silveira-Lacerda, Elisangela', 'Guillo, Lidia Andreu']","['Camelo-Santos J', 'do Prado Barbosa A', 'de Paula Silveira-Lacerda E', 'Guillo LA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biological Sciences Institute, Universidade Federal de Goias, Campus II, Jardim Samambaia, CP 131, 74001-970, Goiania GO, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Arginine/*genetics', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', '*Codon', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Proline/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2013/02/26 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0753-3322(12)00115-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biopha.2012.11.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2013 Mar;67(2):103-7. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2012.11.004.

An amount of 3 muM imatinib resistant cells were generated by our group and named as K562/IMA-3 cells. Changes in macromolecules in parental and resistant cells were studied by FT-IR spectroscopy. Imatinib resistance caused changes, which indicated decreases in the level of glycogen and increases in the membrane order. The amount of unsaturated lipids increased in the imatinib resistant cells indicating lipid peroxidation. Imatinib resistance caused changes in the lipid/protein ratio. The relative protein content increased with respect to nucleic acids indicating higher transcription and protein expression and structural/organizational changes in the nucleus were evident as revealed by frequency changes in the nucleic acid bands. Changes in the amide bands revealed changes in the proteome of the resistant cells. Protein secondary structural changes indicated that the antiparallel beta sheet's structure increased, however the alpha helix structure, beta sheet structure, random coil structure and turns decreased in the resistant cells. These results indicate that the FT-IR technique provides a suitable method for analyzing drug resistance related structural changes in leukemia and other cancer types.","['Baran, Yusuf', 'Ceylan, Cagatay', 'Camgoz, Aylin']","['Baran Y', 'Ceylan C', 'Camgoz A']","['Izmir Institute of Technology, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Urla, 35430 Izmir, Turkey. yusufbaran@iyte.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared/methods']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/12/24 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0753-3322(12)00126-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biopha.2012.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2013 Apr;67(3):221-7. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2012.12.001.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study on 11 children treated between 2005 and 2011, who received oral steroids ranging from 0.6 to 3.3mg/kg/day prednisolone equivalent for a duration of 2 to 15 days during the 2 months prior to diagnosis of ALL. RESULTS: Four children had febrile pancytopenia. Among them, 2 had severe infections and a noncontributive bone marrow aspiration. One of them presented a severe tumoral lysis syndrome and was hospitalized twice in the intensive care unit. Two teenagers had central nervous system involvement at diagnosis of T-ALL, 1 having associated cutaneous locations, the second one showing pulmonary and central nervous system (CNS) leukostasis with renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. One child died of septic shock during the induction phase of steroid-resistant T-ALL. Four children had no complications during the induction phase. Steroid resistance occurred in 5 cases and steroid sensitivity could not be evaluated in 3 cases. Three allogeneic bone marrow transplants were performed: the first one because of early CNS relapse, the 2 others because of initial treatment resistance. CONCLUSION: Steroids can induce a delay in the management of ALL and seem to favor initial complications, and possibly increase diffuse locations as well as steroid resistance. Their prescription needs to be carefully managed, especially for uncharacteristic infectious symptoms. Then a complete blood count should be done.","['Gatineau-Sailliant, S', 'Buchbinder, N', 'Callat, M P', 'Nelken, B', 'Pautard, B', 'Vannier, J-P', 'Schneider, P']","['Gatineau-Sailliant S', 'Buchbinder N', 'Callat MP', 'Nelken B', 'Pautard B', 'Vannier JP', 'Schneider P']","[""Service d'immuno-hematologie pediatrique, CHU de Rouen, 1, rue de Germont, 76000 Rouen, France. sophiegs@orange.fr""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",France,Arch Pediatr,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,9421356,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Prednisolone/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/10/01 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2011/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0929-693X(13)00033-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.arcped.2013.01.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pediatr. 2013 Apr;20(4):341-7. doi: 10.1016/j.arcped.2013.01.016.

Protein methyltransferases constitute one of the protein families that participate in epigenetic control of gene expression, and represent a novel therapeutic target class. Recruitment of the protein lysine methyltransferase DOT1L at aberrant loci is a frequent mechanism driving acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemias, particularly in infants, and pharmacological inhibition of DOT1L extends survival in a mouse model of mixed lineage leukemia. A better understanding of the structural chemistry of DOT1L inhibition would accelerate the development of improved compounds. Here, we report that the addition of a single halogen atom at a critical position in the cofactor product S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH, an inhibitor of SAM-dependent methyltransferases) results in an 8-fold increase in potency against DOT1L, and reduced activities against other protein and non-protein methyltransferases. We solved the crystal structure of DOT1L in complex with Bromo-deaza-SAH and rationalized the observed effects. This discovery reveals a simple strategy to engineer selectivity and potency towards DOT1L into the adenosine scaffold of the cofactor shared by all methyltransferases, and can be exploited towards the development of clinical candidates against mixed lineage leukemia.","['Yu, Wenyu', 'Smil, David', 'Li, Fengling', 'Tempel, Wolfram', 'Fedorov, Oleg', 'Nguyen, Kong T', 'Bolshan, Yuri', 'Al-Awar, Rima', 'Knapp, Stefan', 'Arrowsmith, Cheryl H', 'Vedadi, Masoud', 'Brown, Peter J', 'Schapira, Matthieu']","['Yu W', 'Smil D', 'Li F', 'Tempel W', 'Fedorov O', 'Nguyen KT', 'Bolshan Y', 'Al-Awar R', 'Knapp S', 'Arrowsmith CH', 'Vedadi M', 'Brown PJ', 'Schapira M']","['Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto; 101 College Street, MaRS Centre, South tower, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto; 101 College Street, MaRS Centre, South tower, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto; 101 College Street, MaRS Centre, South tower, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto; 101 College Street, MaRS Centre, South tower, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'University of Oxford, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, Structural Genomics Consortium, Old Road Campus Research Building, Roosevelt Drive, Oxford OX3 7LD, UK.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto; 101 College Street, MaRS Centre, South tower, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto; 101 College Street, MaRS Centre, South tower, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Medicinal Chemistry Platform, Ontario Institute for Cancer Research; 101 College Street, MaRS Centre, South tower, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 0A3, Canada.', 'University of Oxford, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, Structural Genomics Consortium, Old Road Campus Research Building, Roosevelt Drive, Oxford OX3 7LD, UK.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto; 101 College Street, MaRS Centre, South tower, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto; 101 College Street, MaRS Centre, South tower, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto; 101 College Street, MaRS Centre, South tower, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto; 101 College Street, MaRS Centre, South tower, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology; University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['979-92-0 (S-Adenosylhomocysteine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Halogenation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'S-Adenosylhomocysteine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/08/30 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.bmc.2013.01.049 [doi]', 'S0968-0896(13)00088-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2013 Apr 1;21(7):1787-1794. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2013.01.049.

However, a significant proportion of patients do not achieve the optimal response or are resistant to TKI. ABL kinase domain mutations have been extensively implicated in the pathogenesis of TKI resistance. Treatment with second-generation TKI has produced high rates of hematologic and cytogenetic responses in mutated ABL patients. The aim of this study was to determine the type and frequency of ABL mutations in patients who were resistant to imatinib or had lost the response, and to analyze the effect of second-generation TKI on their outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The presence of ABL mutations in 45 CML patients resistant to imatinib was evaluated by direct sequencing and was correlated with the results of the cytogenetic study (performed in 39 cases). The outcome of these patients after therapy with nilotinib or dasatinib was analyzed. RESULTS: ABL mutations were detected in 14 out of 45 resistant patients. Patients with clonal cytogenetic evolution tended to develop mutations more frequently than those without clonal evolution.

Recently, we identified Fat1 cadherin as a unique and independent prognostic factor for relapse-free and overall survival in pediatric pre-B-ALL. Here, we analyzed Fat1 mRNA for its potential as a novel marker of MRD in cases of pre-B- and T-ALL. Analyses of microarray data from 125 matched diagnosis/relapse samples across three independent datasets indicate that Fat1 mRNA is detectable in an average of 31.3% of diagnosed pre-B-ALL, of which 67.5% of cases remained positive at relapse. Furthermore, some 20% of cases with undetectable levels of Fat1 mRNA at diagnosis became positive upon relapse. T-ALL cases were 83.3% positive for Fat1 expression at diagnosis with 77.7% remaining positive at relapse. Towards proof of concept, we developed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay and demonstrate detection of Fat1 mRNA in leukemic cells mixed with normal peripheral blood cells at a sensitivity of 1 in 10 000 to 100 000 cells. Fat1 may therefore provide a new marker of MRD for patients with ALL lacking known genomic aberrations or within a multiplex approach to MRD detection.","['Ardjmand, Alireza', 'de Bock, Charles E', 'Shahrokhi, Somayeh', 'Lincz, Lisa F', 'Boyd, Andrew W', 'Burns, Gordon F', 'Thorne, Rick F']","['Ardjmand A', 'de Bock CE', 'Shahrokhi S', 'Lincz LF', 'Boyd AW', 'Burns GF', 'Thorne RF']","['University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales, Australia; Hunter Medical Research Institute, New Lambton Heights, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (FAT1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cadherins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcriptome']",2013/02/26 06:00,2014/07/06 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['hem114 [pii]', '10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000080 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2013 Nov;18(6):315-22. doi: 10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000080.

PKCtheta is the only T cell-expressed PKC that localizes selectively to the center of the immunological synapse (IS) following conventional T cell antigen stimulation, and this unique localization is essential for PKCtheta-mediated downstream signaling. While playing a minor role in T cell development, early in vitro studies relying, among others, on the use of PKCtheta-deficient (Prkcq(-/-)) T cells revealed that PKCtheta is required for the activation and proliferation of mature T cells, reflecting its importance in activating the transcription factors nuclear factor kappa B, activator protein-1, and nuclear factor of activated T cells, as well as for the survival of activated T cells. Upon subsequent analysis of in vivo immune responses in Prkcq(-/-) mice, it became clear that PKCtheta has a selective role in the immune system: it is required for experimental Th2- and Th17-mediated allergic and autoimmune diseases, respectively, and for alloimmune responses, but is dispensable for protective responses against pathogens and for graft-versus-leukemia responses. Surprisingly, PKCtheta was recently found to be excluded from the IS of regulatory T cells and to negatively regulate their suppressive function. These attributes of PKCtheta make it an attractive target for catalytic or allosteric inhibitors that are expected to selectively suppress harmful inflammatory and alloimmune responses without interfering with beneficial immunity to infections. Early progress in developing such drugs is being made, but additional studies on the role of PKCtheta in the human immune system are urgently needed.","['Zhang, Elizabeth Yan', 'Kong, Kok-Fai', 'Altman, Amnon']","['Zhang EY', 'Kong KF', 'Altman A']","['Division of Cell Biology, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Adv Pharmacol,"Advances in pharmacology (San Diego, Calif.)",9015397,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCQ protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-theta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune System Diseases/drug therapy/*immunology/metabolism', '*Immune Tolerance/drug effects', 'Immunological Synapses/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-theta', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/08/21 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['B978-0-12-404717-4.00006-8 [pii]', '10.1016/B978-0-12-404717-4.00006-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Pharmacol. 2013;66:267-312. doi: 10.1016/B978-0-12-404717-4.00006-8.,,['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Cranial radiotherapy is one of the factors that might be involved in this process. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of cranial radiotherapy on adiposity indexes in survivors of acute lymphocytic leukemia. METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional study of 56 acute lymphocytic leukemia survivors, chronological age between 15 and 24 years, assigned into two groups according to the exposure to cranial radiotherapy (25 irradiated and 31 non-irradiated), assessed according to body fat (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), computed tomography scan-derived abdominal adipose tissue, lipid profile, and insulin resistance. RESULTS: Cranial radiotherapy increased body fat and abdominal adipose tissue and altered lipid panel. Yet, lipids showed no clinical relevance so far. There were significantly more obese patients among those who received cranial radiotherapy (52% irradiated versus 22.6% non-irradiated), based on dual energy X-ray absorptiometry body fat measurements. Nonetheless, no association was observed between cranial radiotherapy and body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio or insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia showed an increase in body fat and an alteration of fat distribution, which were related to cranial radiotherapy. Fat compartment modifications possibly indicate a disease of adipose tissue, and cranial radiotherapy imports in this process.","['Siviero-Miachon, Adriana Aparecida', 'Spinola-Castro, Angela Maria', 'Lee, Maria Lucia de Martino', 'Andreoni, Solange', 'Geloneze, Bruno', 'Lederman, Henrique', 'Guerra-Junior, Gil']","['Siviero-Miachon AA', 'Spinola-Castro AM', 'Lee ML', 'Andreoni S', 'Geloneze B', 'Lederman H', 'Guerra-Junior G']","['UNIFESP/EPM, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Radiat Oncol,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",101265111,,IM,"['Abdomen/pathology', 'Abdominal Fat/*radiation effects', 'Adiposity/*radiation effects', 'Adolescent', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin Resistance/radiation effects', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Survivors/statistics & numerical data', 'Waist Circumference', 'Young Adult']",2013/02/26 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1748-717X-8-39 [pii]', '10.1186/1748-717X-8-39 [doi]']",epublish,Radiat Oncol. 2013 Feb 21;8:39. doi: 10.1186/1748-717X-8-39.,20130221,,PMC3627619,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined cytotoxic, cytostatic, and apoptotic effects of these two important phenolic compounds on 232B4 human CLL cells. Cytotoxic effects of resveratrol and quercetin were determined by MTT cell proliferation assay. Changes in caspase-3 enzyme activity were measured using caspase-3 colorimetric assay. Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining was performed to measure apoptotic cell population. Effects of resveratrol and quercetin on cell cycle profiles of CLL cells were investigated by flow cytometry. Treatment of CLL cells with resveratrol and quercetin caused dose dependent inhibition of cell proliferation and increased apoptotic cell population through induction of caspase-3 activity. Cell cycle analysis displayed cell cycle arrest mainly in G0/G1 for both polyphenols. Our data, in total, showed for the first time that resveratrol and quercetin might block CLL growth through inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.","['Gokbulut, Aysun Adan', 'Apohan, Elif', 'Baran, Yusuf']","['Gokbulut AA', 'Apohan E', 'Baran Y']","['Science Faculty, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Izmir Institute of Technology, Urla, Izmir, Turkey. yusufbaran@iyte.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Cytostatic Agents)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytostatic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology']",2013/02/26 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['hem93 [pii]', '10.1179/1607845412Y.0000000042 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2013 May;18(3):144-50. doi: 10.1179/1607845412Y.0000000042.

Schlecht (family zingiberaceae) is a rhizomatous herb that is distributed from north-eastern India to south-east Asia, especially in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. Previous research has shown that the crude extract of this plant has cytotoxic properties. The current study examines the cytotoxic properties of boesenbergin A isolated from Boesenbergia rotunda. METHODS: MTT assay was used to check the cytotoxicity of boesenbergin A. The morphological assessment of apoptosis was monitored using normal and fluorescence microscopy. The early and late phase of apoptosis was investigated using annexin V and DNA laddering assays, respectively. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Human apoptosis proteome profiler assays were performed to investigate the mechanism of cell death. In addition, the protein levels of Bax, Bcl2 and HSP 70 were also analyzed using western blot. Assays of caspase =-3/7, -8 and =-9 were carried out in order to test for induction during treatment. Lastly, cell cycle progression was analyzed using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Boesenbergin A was found to have the highest toxicity towards CEMss cancer cells (IC50 = 8 mug/ml). The morphology of CEMss cells after treatment showed evidence of apoptosis that included blebbing and chromatin condensation. The annexin V assay revealed that early apoptosis is induced after treatment. The DNA laddering assay confirmed that DNA fragmentation had occurred during late apoptosis. The cell cycle analysis indicated that boesenbergin A was able to induce G2/M phase arrest in CEMss cells. The activity of caspases -3/7, -8 and -9 was increased after treatment which indicates both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are induced during apoptosis. The involvement of mitochondria was established by increased mitochondrial membrane potential and up and down regulation of Bcl2 and Bax proteins as well as HSP70. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the results demonstrated that boesenbergin A induced apoptosis of CEMss cells through Bcl2/Bax signaling pathways with the involvement of caspases and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. The current findings warrant further research on boesenbergin A as a novel chemotherapeutic agent for leukemia intervention including studies in animal models.","['Ng, Kuan-Beng', 'Bustamam, Ahmad', 'Sukari, Mohd Aspollah', 'Abdelwahab, Siddig Ibrahim', 'Mohan, Syam', 'Buckle, Michael James Christopher', 'Kamalidehghan, Behnam', 'Nadzri, Nabilah Muhammad', 'Anasamy, Theebaa', 'A Hadi, A Hamid', 'Rahman, Heshu Sulaiman']","['Ng KB', 'Bustamam A', 'Sukari MA', 'Abdelwahab SI', 'Mohan S', 'Buckle MJ', 'Kamalidehghan B', 'Nadzri NM', 'Anasamy T', 'A Hadi AH', 'Rahman HS']","['UPM-MAKNA Cancer Research Laboratory, Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Complement Altern Med,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,101088661,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (boesenbergin A)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chalcones/isolation & purification/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Rhizome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Zingiberaceae/*chemistry', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6882-13-41 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6882-13-41 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Complement Altern Med. 2013 Feb 22;13:41. doi: 10.1186/1472-6882-13-41.,20130222,,PMC3600682,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the role of histone epigenetic modifications in E-cadherin gene silencing. METHODS: CLL specimens were treated with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) MS-275 and analyzed for E-cadherin expression with western blot and RT-PCR analysis. The downstream effects of HDACi treated leukemic cells were studied by analyzing the effect on wnt-pathway signaling. HDACi induced alterations in E-cadherin splicing were investigated by transcript specific real time PCR analysis. RESULTS: Treatment of CLL specimens with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) treatment resulted in an increase of the E-cadherin RNA transcript (5 to 119 fold increase, n=10) in eight out of ten CLL specimens indicating that this gene is down regulated by histone hypoacetylation in a majority of CLL specimens. The E-cadherin re-expression in CLL specimens was noted by western blot analysis as well. Besides epigenetic silencing another mechanism of E-cadherin inactivation is aberrant exon 11 splicing resulting in an alternatively spliced transcript that lacks exon 11 and is degraded by the non-sense mediated decay (NMD) pathway. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that HDACi increased the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in the E-cadherin promoter region. This also affected the E-cadherin exon 11 splicing pattern as HDACi treated CLL specimens preferentially expressed the correctly spliced transcript and not the exon 11 skipped aberrant transcript. The re-expressed E- cadherin binds to beta-catenin with inhibition of the active wnt-beta-catenin pathway in these cells. This resulted in a down regulation of two wnt target genes, LEF and cyclinD1 and the wnt pathway reporter. CONCLUSION: The E-cadherin gene is epigenetically modified and hypoacetylated in CLL leukemic cells. Treatment of CLL specimens with HDACi MS-275 activates transcription from this silent gene with expression of more correctly spliced E-cadherin transcripts as compared to the aberrant exon11 skipped transcripts that in turn inhibits the wnt signaling pathway. The data highlights the role of epigenetic modifications in altering gene splicing patterns.","['Jordaan, Gwen', 'Liao, Wei', 'Sharma, Sanjai']","['Jordaan G', 'Liao W', 'Sharma S']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Greater Los Angeles VA Healthcare Center, UCLA School of Medicine, 11301 Wilshire Blvd, LA, CA 90073, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cadherins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Epigenomics', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'RNA Splicing/drug effects', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/drug effects']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/08/29 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-13-88 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-13-88 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2013 Feb 25;13:88. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-13-88.,20130225,,PMC3586366,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CAG regimen (cytarabine, aclarubicin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) has shown promise for relapsed/refractory AML. We retrospectively compared the efficacy and toxicity of the CAG regimen (n = 44) with a non-CAG regimen (n = 31) in 75 patients with AML refractory to an initial induction chemotherapy. The complete remission (CR) rate was higher for the CAG than the non-CAG regimen (63.5% vs. 38.7%, p = 0.038), and this was more pronounced in the subgroup of patients with a lower white blood cell (WBC) count before first/second induction, better- and intermediate-risk patients, and non-AML-M4/5 (p = 0.019). Although the CAG group demonstrated a higher disease-free survival than the non-CAG group among the intermediate- and poor-risk patients (p = 0.019), no differences in overall survival were observed. The CAG regimen produced hematological and non-hematological side effects similar to those of the non-CAG regimen. The most frequent CAG regimen side effects were infection (45.5%), fever (50%) and elevated transaminase levels (31.8%). No patients died within 4 weeks after initiating the second induction course in the CAG regimen. Thus, CAG represents a highly effective and safe salvage regimen for patients with AML who are refractory to the first induction chemotherapy. This regimen may be of specific benefit for CR in patients with low WBC count, better- and intermediate-risk, and non-M4/5 disease.","['Zhu, Hong-Hu', 'Jiang, Hao', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Lu, Jin', 'Jiang, Qian', 'Bao, Li', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Qin, Ya-Zhen', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Zhu HH', 'Jiang H', 'Jiang B', 'Lu J', 'Jiang Q', 'Bao L', 'Zhang XH', 'Qin YZ', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology , Beijing , China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', 'CAG protocol']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2013/02/26 06:00,2014/05/09 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.776679 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Nov;54(11):2452-7. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.776679.

Consistent with this, a reduction in CDK1 and CDK2 expression with no change in cyclin A an B1 was observed in this cell line. Activation of caspase-2 was also detected. However, the involvement of the caspase-dependent pathway in the process of cell death induced by either BSC 3g or 3n is discarded since cell death could not be prevented by pretreatment with the pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Moreover, since reduced levels of p21(CIP1) and Chk2 proteins but no change in p53 levels could be detected in MCF-7 cells after BSC 3g or 3n treatment our results suggest that BSC treated cells die from lethal mitosis.","['Lamberto, Iranzu', 'Plano, Daniel', 'Moreno, Esther', 'Font, Maria', 'Palop, Juan Antonio', 'Sanmartin, Carmen', 'Encio, Ignacio']","['Lamberto I', 'Plano D', 'Moreno E', 'Font M', 'Palop JA', 'Sanmartin C', 'Encio I']","['Department of Organic and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Navarra, Irunlarrea, 1, E-31008 Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Organoselenium Compounds)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Carbamates/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'Female', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Organoselenium Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/11/05 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['CMC-EPUB-20130131-4 [pii]', '10.2174/0929867311320120010 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2013;20(12):1609-19. doi: 10.2174/0929867311320120010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we analysed 3530 AML patients treated in three randomized, prospective, controlled clinical trials and compared post-remission therapies using a multivariate Cox regression analysis to determine whether allogeneic HSCT is superior than chemotherapy in overcoming the detrimental impact of patients with abnl(17p) AML. One hundred and forty-three patients (4%) were identified with abnl(17p) AML. All patients had received intensive induction chemotherapy. Forty-seven patients with a median age of 54 years (18-69 years) proceeded to allogeneic HSCT in first or second remission. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate for the entire cohort of patients was 4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 1-7%]. OS and event-free survival at 3 years, calculated from the day of HSCT, was 11% (95% CI, 2-20%) and 6% (95% CI, 0-13%), respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed no benefit of allogeneic HSCT compared to chemotherapy (Hazard Ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.56-1.67, P = 0.9). In conclusion, allogeneic HSCT does not improve survival in patients with abnl(17p) AML as compared to other adverse cytogenetic risk abnormalities.","['Mohr, Brigitte', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Schafer-Eckart, Kerstin', 'Schmitz, Norbert', 'Hanel, Mathias', 'Rosler, Wolf', 'Frickhofen, Norbert', 'Link, Hartmut', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Schuler, Ulrich', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Middeke, Jan M', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Stolzel, Friedrich']","['Mohr B', 'Schetelig J', 'Schafer-Eckart K', 'Schmitz N', 'Hanel M', 'Rosler W', 'Frickhofen N', 'Link H', 'Neubauer A', 'Schuler U', 'Platzbecker U', 'Middeke JM', 'Ehninger G', 'Bornhauser M', 'Schaich M', 'Stolzel F']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['*Abnormal Karyotype', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2013/02/26 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2013/02/26 06:00'],"['2012/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12253 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Apr;161(2):237-44. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12253.
