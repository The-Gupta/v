Total protein-derived oligosaccharides from GM979 cells, labeled metabolically with [3H]glucosamine, [3H]mannose, or [3H]galactose, were prepared by hydrazinolysis after extracting the lipids. The 3H-labeled oligosaccharides were fractionated on Sephadex G-50 revealing 10-25% of each labeled product as a high molecular weight fraction (Mr = 10,000). Digestion of this [3H]glucosamine fraction with endo-beta-galactosidase from Escherichia freundii, specific for the repeating structure of Gal beta (1 leads to 4)GlcNAc beta (1 leads to 3), resulted in the following four products upon Bio-Gel P-2 Gel filtration: 1) a disaccharide with the structure GlcNAc beta (1 leads to 3)Gal, 2) a trisaccharide with the structure Gal beta (1 leads to 4)GlcNAc beta (1 leads to 3) beta Gal, 3) a tetrasaccharide with the sequence Fuc alpha (1 leads to 2)Gal beta (1 leads to 4)GlcNAc beta (1 leads to 3)Gal, and 4) a large complex fragment which contained mannose, glucosamine, galactose, and fucose (presumably the protein linkage region). Methylation linkage analysis of the large complex fraction shows mainly the presence of 4-substituted and terminal N-acetylglucosamine; 3,6-substituted, 6-substituted, 2-substituted, and 2,3-substituted galactose. The GM979 cell erythroglycan is only 30% susceptible to endo-beta-galactosidase degradation probably because of the branched galactose residues, whereas the linear form of erythroglycan from human K562 cells is 60% susceptible. The branched residues in GM979 cell saccharides indicate that this mouse cell line bears an arborized erythroglycan-like glycopeptide similar to those found on human adult erythrocytes, and thus may be a source for the enzyme which transfers an N-acetylglucosamine residue to a 3-linked galactose to form a 3,6-disubstituted galactose.","['Kaizu, T', 'Turco, S J', 'Rush, J S', 'Laine, R A']","['Kaizu T', 'Turco SJ', 'Rush JS', 'Laine RA']",['eng'],"['AM25101/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM23902/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (erythroglycan)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Methylation', 'Mice']",1982/07/25 00:00,1982/07/25 00:01,['1982/07/25 00:00'],"['1982/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)34327-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1982 Jul 25;257(14):8272-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumors were found in the kidney, liver, lung, skin, hematopoietic system (leukemia or lymphoma) and occasionally in some other organs. The dose-related induction of renal cell tumors in the male mice fed phenacetin was clearly demonstrated in this experiment. Urinary bladder lesions that developed in the mice of either sex fed 1.25% phenacetin were also considered to be due to the tumorigenicity of phenacetin.

NK activity did not vary with donor blood group, Rh type or (in a small sample) HLA type. There was a slight but significant increase in NK activity from birth to adulthood, and between males an females. The male/female difference was present at birth and persisted through adulthood. The relative NK activity of individual donors tested repeatedly over many years was remarkably consistent in spite of variability in the absolute cytotoxicity observed. The expression of NK data in terms of relative NK was found to be superior to other methods, and the values obtained were found to be independent of the NK-sensitive target cell used. Although age and sex differences in NK activity are slight, their existence should be considered when studies of NK activity in patients are analysed.","['Pross, H F', 'Baines, M G']","['Pross HF', 'Baines MG']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Blood Group Antigens)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Blood Group Antigens/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/immunology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/immunology', 'Sex Factors']",1982/04/15 00:00,1982/04/15 00:01,['1982/04/15 00:00'],"['1982/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910290404 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1982 Apr 15;29(4):383-90. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910290404.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we have shown that (i) the levels of basal natural killer (NK), ADCC and R-ADCC cytotoxic activities in mouse spleen cells are strongly correlated with each other, (b) simultaneous induction of ADCC and R-ADCC reactions does not result in an additive cytotoxic response, and (iii) YAC cells which do not bear Fc receptors and are highly sensitive to lysis by NK cells, can specifically and competitively inhibit the ADCC and R-ADCC reactions. These results suggest that the R-ADCC reaction may be mediated by the same effector cell population as mediates NK and ADCC reactions against tumour target cells.","['Saxena, R K', 'Saxena, Q B', 'Adler, W H']","['Saxena RK', 'Saxena QB', 'Adler WH']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,,IM,"['Animals', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Spleen/immunology']",1982/06/01 00:00,1982/06/01 00:01,['1982/06/01 00:00'],"['1982/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1982 Jun;46(2):459-64.,PMC1555395,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth inhibition was more profound when exposure time was extended up to 7 days. Inhibition of DNA synthesis varied with sensitivity to ara-C. Plateau levels of intracellular 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP) were 35.5, 13.4, and 3.6 nmol/10(9) cells exposed to 0.1 microM ara-C in MOLT-4F, Raji, and Daudi cells, respectively, corresponding to the sensitivity to ara-C. The nucleotide levels at the plateau, however, did not correspond to the initial levels of the ara-CTP or to the calculated rate of ara-CTP synthesis, which decreased from Raji to MOLT-4F to Daudi cells. ara-C deamination had negligible effect on the differential accumulation of ara-CTP. ara-CTP degradation due to dephosphorylation was marked in Raji and Daudi cells but slight in MOLT-4F cells. The half-life of intracellular ara-CTP was 204, 26.4, 31.1 min in MOLT-4F, Raji, and Daudi cells, respectively. The ara-CTP level was considered to be maintained bimodally by synthesis and degradation of the nucleotide. This conclusion was supported by the fact that, in Raji and Daudi cells exposed to 0.1 microM ara-C in the presence of 1 mM hydroxyurea, the plateau levels of ara-CTP increased 3-fold through inhibition of the nucleotide degradation. Thus, not only ara-C phosphorylation but also subsequent ara-CTP dephosphorylation was important in the accumulation and maintenance of ara-CTP and in the sensitivity to ara-C.","['Abe, I', 'Saito, S', 'Hori, K', 'Suzuki, M', 'Sato, H']","['Abe I', 'Saito S', 'Hori K', 'Suzuki M', 'Sato H']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Arabinonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Thymidine/pharmacology']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Jul;42(7):2846-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of Cl 216,942 on L1210 mouse leukemia cells were studied with the nucleoid sedimentation and alkaline elution assays. Evidence for Cl 216,942 intercalation into cellular DNA was obtained in exponentially growing cells by comparing the L1210 nucleoid sedimentation behavior in neutral sucrose gradients of ethidium bromide with nucleoids from Cl 216,942-treated cells. A 1-hr treatment of exponentially growing L1210 cells with Cl 216,942 induced both protein-associated DNA single-strand breaks and DNA-protein crosslinks as detected by the alkaline elution assay. The DNA strand break and DNA-protein cross-link frequencies were found to be within a factor of 2 of each other over a range of Cl 216,942 concentrations. The dose response for the induction of DNA damage showed a linear decrease up to 10 micrograms/ml, but this was followed by a decrease in damage at dose levels greater than 10 micrograms/ml. The biphasic dose response could not be explained by changes in the cellular uptake of Cl 216,942. The kinetics of Cl 216,942 induction of DNA damage after a 1-hr treatment showed that at the dose which gave maximum damage the degree of damage (10 micrograms/ml) decreased with further incubation, but at a higher dose (20 micrograms/ml) DNA damage increased with postincubation at 37 degrees. The cytotoxicity produced by Cl 216,942 at a given frequency of protein-associated strand breaks was low. Cl 216,942 thus appeared to belong to a low-toxicity group of DNA intercalators.","['Bowden, G T', 'Garcia, D', 'Peng, Y M', 'Alberts, D S']","['Bowden GT', 'Garcia D', 'Peng YM', 'Alberts DS']",['eng'],"['CA17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA17343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '39C34M111K (bisantrene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracenes/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Mice']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Jul;42(7):2660-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A single dose (234 mg/kg) of F-ara-A in solution decreased the number of P388 leukemia cells by greater than 10(3), whereas a multiple-dose regimen (41 mg/kg every day for 5 days) of equal toxicity to the host was ineffective at reducing the tumor burden. No antitumor activity was seen when an equal dose of the relatively insoluble F-ara-A was injected as a suspension. The 5'-triphosphate of F-ara-A accumulated in P388 cells in levels proportional to the dose of the nucleoside and disappeared from these cells at an exponential rate with a half-life of 2.9 hr, which was independent of the cellular concentration of the nucleotide. The extent and duration of the inhibition of DNA synthesis of P388 cells was dependent on the dose of F-ara-A, but the rates of recovery were similar and in proportion to the cellular concentration of the analog triphosphate. The extent of the inhibition of DNA synthesis in host bone marrow and intestinal mucosa was also related to the dose of F-ara-A, but the recovery of these tissues proceeded to similar, incomplete levels (less than 60% of initial) 24 hr after F-ara-A injection of either 41 or 234 mg/kg. These results suggest that the equal toxicity of the two regimens of F-ara-A may be attributed to the similar extent of inhibition of host-tissue DNA synthesis evoked by each. In contrast, the greater extent and longer duration of inhibition of P388 cell DNA synthesis caused by the single dose of F-ara-A was responsible for its superior therapeutic activity. Measurements of F-ara-A triphosphate concentrations and the DNA-synthetic capacity of tumor and host tissues are determinants of the action of F-ara-A and may be used to predict optimal therapeutic dose schedules.","['Avramis, V I', 'Plunkett, W']","['Avramis VI', 'Plunkett W']",['eng'],"['CA-14528/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Female', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/therapeutic use/toxicity']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Jul;42(7):2587-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 76% of patients with chronic lymphocytic, chronic myeloid, or undifferentiated leukemia, the peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocyte count at the time of bacteremia was less than 100 cells/mm-3. In contrast to patients with leukemia, those with solid tumors, as a group, were at no greater risk of bloodstream infection than those without malignancy. In preparation for prophylactic trials of antibiotics or immunotherapy this study has more clearly defined the risk of bloodstream infection in cancer patients.","['Mayo, J W', 'Wenzel, R P']","['Mayo JW', 'Wenzel RP']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Cross Infection/complications/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Neoplasms/*complications/therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sepsis/complications/*epidemiology']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19820701)50:1<187::aid-cncr2820500134>3.0.co;2-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1982 Jul 1;50(1):187-90. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19820701)50:1<187::aid-cncr2820500134>3.0.co;2-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extent of extraction did not depend on whether the cells were in monolayer culture of in suspension or whether choleragen was found at 0 or 37 degrees C. A similar resistance to extraction was also observed in membranes isolated from toxin-treated cells. Using more drastic conditions and other non-ionic detergents, 90% of the bound choleragen was solubilized from cells and membranes. When rat glioma C6 cells, which bind only small amounts of choleragen, were incubated with the ganglioside GM1, toxin binding was increased and the bound toxin was also resistant to extraction. When these cells were incubated with [3H]GM1, up to 70% of the cell-associated GM1 was extracted under the mild conditions.

The latter was selected from the parental L1210/0 cell line by its ability to grow at high concentrations of 5-bromo-dUrd and could also be considered as TK-. There was a close correlation between the inhibitory effects of the deoxyuridine analogs on Namalva, Raji and L1210 cells: the correlation coefficient (r) for log ID50 (median inhibitory dose) for L1210 cell growth, on the one hand, and log ID50 for Namalva or Raji cell growth, on the other hand, was 0.902 and 0.929, respectively. There was also a strong correlation (r = 0.936) between the log ID50 values for the two human lymphoblast cell lines. However, there was no significant correlation (r less than 0.40) either between the log ID50 for the TK- Raji cells and the parental TK+ Raji cells, or between the log ID50 for the TK- L1210/BdUrd cells and the parental TK+ L1210/0 cells.

The major methylated nonpolar lipid product in the RBL cells themselves was ubiquinone-9, which accounted for about 90% of the nonpolar lipid and 20-30% of the total radioactive lipid formed. There was a modest increase in the methylation of nonpolar lipids upon stimulation of the RBL cells with IgE and anti-IgE, but the significance of this change is uncertain. In contrast to whole cells, RBL membrane fractions (incubated with [3H-methyl]-S-adenosylmethionine) incorporated radioactivity primarily into fatty acid methyl esters and not ubiquinone. A third product, 2-(methylthio)-benzothiazole, was formed by RBL cells, retina and minced parotid upon incubation in enriched media.

Although almost any type of neoplasm can occur, radiation-induced malignancies are most likely to affect the myelopoietic tissues and the thyroid gland. The former tissues are also most frequently involved by chemotherapy. The combination of intensive radiotherapy and intensive chemotherapy is particularly leukemogenic. Acute myeloid leukemia has occurred with increased frequency following treatment of Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer, polycythemia vera, carcinoma of the thyroid gland, and carcinoma of the breast. Radiation-induced malignancies usually occur in the field of irradiation. For example, radiotherapy for carcinoma of the cervix may be followed by the development of carcinomas of the endometrium, vagina, urinary bladder, colon , rectum, and anus, as well as mesotheliomas of the peritoneum and osteosarcomas of the pelvis. Tumors developing in an irradiated field include a substantial number of soft tissue sarcomas or osteosarcomas. There is a 20-fold increase of second cancers following treatment of childhood malignancies, mostly sarcomas of bone and soft tissues, but including leukemia, and carcinomas of the thyroid gland, skin, and breast. The latent period between radiotherapy and the appearance of a second cancer ranges from 2 years to several decades, often being 10-15 years. With chemotherapy the mean latent period is shorter, approximately 4 years. The mechanism of oncogenesis by radiotherapy or chemotherapy is poorly understood and probably involves a complex interplay of somatic mutation, co-oncogenic effects, depression of host immunity, stimulation of cellular proliferation, and genetic susceptibility. The danger of developing second malignancies following radiotherapy or chemotherapy emphasizes the need for lifelong follow-up of patients given these forms of treatment; particularly in those with a long life expectancy as are those treated for childhood neoplasms.","['Penn, I']",['Penn I'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,,IM,"['*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Time Factors']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 1982 Feb;5(1):83-96.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Macrophages obtained from BALB/c or BAF1 mice infected in vivo with M. arthritidis were functionally defective beginning from day 7. The infection of BALB/c mice with RLV also suppressed the spreading of macrophages, while the infection of RLV-resistant BAF1 mice with the virus did not reduce the spreading and phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages on days 1-105. The mixed infection of BALB/c or BAF1 mice with M. arthritidis and RLV markedly reduced the spreading and phagocytic activity of macrophages beginning from day 7.

No response was obtained in patients with bone marrow aplasia, either primary or associated with acute leukaemia. In 20 patients with chronic primary neutropenia, the degree of response was proportional to the percentage of medullary polymorphonuclears. A comparison between the kinetics of the glucagon-induced granulocyte response and that of the response induced by other neutrophil mobilizing agents suggested that glucagon acts by releasing granulocytes from the bone marrow reserve compartment. The finding that an infusion of dibutyryl cyclic AMP results in granulocyte mobilization suggests that the effects of glucagon are mediated by cAMP at cell level. Since the glucagon response test is harmless and gives rapid and pronounced results, it may be useful in investigation of patients with neutropenia.

Although signs of systemic disease coexisted, the animals survived through the development of the neurologic symptoms, and treatment with cytotoxic agents was not required. Pathologic study of the spinal cord and brain revealed tumoral infiltration of the meninges, confined to the extradural spaces, more markedly at spinal than cerebral levels. Equally severe infiltrates occurred in the paravertebral musculature. No leptomeningeal or parenchymal involvement was present, irrespective of the severity of the extradural infiltration. Marked bone marrow and visceral infiltration coexisted with central nervous system involvement. The topography of the extradural and muscular tumor cells collections related to the proximity of the involved bone marrow and areas of direct communication between these spaces were repeatedly identified. On the other hand, line 13 cells injected directly into the brain substance produced diffuse leptomeningeal tumoral infiltration without extradural involvement. These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of this model of spinal T cell tumor proliferation involves a first stage of bone marrow infiltration, followed by extradural involvement. This occurs by direct migration of bone marrow tumor cells through gaps in the vertebral bone. This model offers the opportunity for the study of malignancies that produce bone destruction as a mechanism for tumoral spread.","['Kase, C S', 'Wilborn, W H', 'Varakis, J N', 'Cheshire, L B', 'Peterson, R D']","['Kase CS', 'Wilborn WH', 'Varakis JN', 'Cheshire LB', 'Peterson RD']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,,IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Paresis/etiology', 'Spinal Cord Neoplasms/*pathology/ultrastructure']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1982 May;46(5):535-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To define the defect of the transforming function, the RNA of td Mo-MSV was compared with those of Mo-MSV 3 and of another transforming variant termed Mo-MSV 124 and with helper Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV). The RNA monomers of td Mo-MSV and Mo-MSV 3 comigrated on polyacrylamide gels and were estimated to be 4.8 kilobases (kb) in length. In agreement with previous analyses, the RNA of Mo-MSV 124 measured 5.5 kb and that of Mo-MuLV measured 8.5 kb. The interrelationships among the viral RNAs were studied by fingerprinting and mapping of RNase T(1)-resistant oligonucleotides (T(1)-oligonucleotides) and by identification of T(1)-oligonucleotides present in hybrids formed by a given viral RNA with cDNA's made from another virus. The nontransforming td Mo-MSV RNA lacked most of the Mo-MSV-specific sequence, i.e., the four 3'-proximal T(1)-oligonucleotides of the six T(1)-oligonucleotides that are shared by the Mo-MSV-specific sequences of Mo-MSV 3 and Mo-MSV 124. The remaining two Mo-MSV-specific oligonucleotides identified td Mo-MSV as a deletion mutant of MSV rather than a deletion mutant of Mo-MuLV. td Mo-MSV and Mo-MSV 124 exhibited similar deletions of gag, pol, and env sequences which were less extensive than those of Mo-MSV 3. Hence, td Mo-MSV is not simply a deletion mutant of Mo-MSV 3. In addition to their MSV-specific sequences, all three MSV variants, including td Mo-MSV, shared the terminal sequences probably encoding the proviral long terminal repeat, which differed from their counterpart in Mo-MuLV. This may indirectly contribute to the oncogenic potential of MSV. A comparison of td Mo-MSV sequences with either Mo-MSV 124 or Mo-MSV 3 indicated directly, in a fashion similar to the deletion analyses which defined the src gene of avian sarcoma viruses, that Mo-MuLV-unrelated sequences of Mo-MSV are necessary for transformation. A definition of transformation-specific sequences of Mo-MSV by deletion analysis confirmed and extended previous analyses which have identified Mo-MuLV-unrelated sequences in Mo-MSV RNA and other studies which have described transformation of mouse 3T3 fibroblasts upon transfection with DNAs containing the Mo-MSV-specific sequence.","['Evans, L H', 'Duesberg, P H']","['Evans LH', 'Duesberg PH']",['eng'],['CA 11426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Defective Viruses/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Mutation', 'Oligoribonucleotides/analysis', 'RNA, Viral/genetics']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.41.2.735-743.1982 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1982 Feb;41(2):735-43. doi: 10.1128/JVI.41.2.735-743.1982.,PMC256806,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the qualitative composition of the major proteins synthesized by control and differentiating cells remains very similar until at least 96 h after the induction of differentiation. Proteins characteristic of the mature erythrocyte membrane are an exception to the reduction in synthesis in line with the proliferation rate, for they continue to be synthesized at similar rates to those found in control cells. Only two major proteins (an as yet unidentified cytoplasmic protein and globin) are reproducibly induced, while the synthesis of a few proteins is almost completely abolished. In contrast to the similarity of the synthesis of the major proteins in the control and differentiating cells, the synthesis of glycoproteins that bind to Concanavalin A is markedly changed.

These antibodies bind strongly to the lipophilic dinitrophenyl group in some membranes. Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dipentadecanoylphosphatidylcholine containing 2 mol % dinitrophenyl lipid hapten bind anti-dinitrophenyl antibodies below the chain-melting transition temperatures of these lipids (22 and 35 degrees C, respectively) but not above these temperatures. Evidently, the lipophilic dinitrophenyl group is partially or completely buried in the hydrophobic region of these bilayers at temperatures above the chain-melting transition temperatures. The inclusion of increasing concentrations of cholesterol in such membranes (e.g. in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine at 37 degrees C) results in a marked enhancement of antibody binding. It was found that a third lipid hapten containing the dinitrophenyl group does not show this strong dependence of antibody binding on the physical state of the lipid membrane. The weak immunologic degranulation of rat basophil leukemia cells by dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine membrane targets at 37 degrees C can be attributed to a weak binding of anti-dinitrophenyl IgE to these membranes (Balakrishnan, K., Hsu, F. J., Cooper, A. D., and McConnell, H. M. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 6427-6433). However, if the antibody is first allowed to bind to this membrane below the lipid chain-melting transition temperature, these IgE-coated membrane targets are very effective in releasing serotonin from the rat basophil leukemia cells when the temperature is raised to 37 degrees C.","['Balakrishnan, K', 'Mehdi, S Q', 'McConnell, H M']","['Balakrishnan K', 'Mehdi SQ', 'McConnell HM']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Lipid Bilayers)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Dinitrophenols', '*Haptens', '*Immunoglobulin E', '*Lipid Bilayers', 'Membrane Fluidity', 'Mice', '*Phosphatidylcholines', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1982/06/10 00:00,1982/06/10 00:01,['1982/06/10 00:00'],"['1982/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1982/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(20)65160-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1982 Jun 10;257(11):6434-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment decisions were based on the evaluation of the extent of disease by clinical methods. A marked improvement in relapse-free survival and overall survival was observed for 1973-1977 as compared to 1968-1972. This improvement did not result from differences in the distribution of important prognostic attributes (clinical stage, pathology, and age) between the two periods, and there was no improvement in our ability to rescue relapsed patients. Improved relapse-free and overall survival during the second period was observed for all stages in patients less than 50 years of age, but not in the older group. The improved survival of patients treated between 1973 and 1977 is attributed to more effective initial therapy, which reduced the fraction of patients who relapsed. These observations provide indirect evidence that relapse has a negative effect on prognosis, and that the initial treatment of patients with Hodgkin's disease should be designed to reduce the risk of relapse to a minimum without causing an unacceptable increase in late complications. The observed/expected incidence of acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the PMH series was increased to 41.9 and 13.9 respectively. The question of whether a policy of doing routine staging laparotomies improves the results of treatment of patients with Hodgkin's disease is considered only in general terms by comparing the total PMH series with the total Stanford Medical Center series of patients treated between 1968 and 1977.

Treatment of cells in vitro with either ara-C (10(-6) M) or asparaginase (0.5 IU/ml) for 8 hr resulted in 45 and 24% viability, respectively; simultaneous exposure to both drugs resulted in 25% viability, a subadditive effect. Sequential 8-hr in vitro treatments with asparaginase preceding ara-C or ara-C preceding asparaginase resulted in 43 and 8% viability, respectively, indicating strong schedule dependency. Recovery from drug-induced inhibition of cell growth in vivo suggested an optimal interval of 120 hr. Treatment of leukemic mice with asparaginase, ara-C, or both drugs simultaneously 3 days after inoculation of 10(6) cells resulted in mean survival times of 16, 21, and 18 days, respectively (control mean survival time, 10 days). With a 120-hr interval between the two drugs, treatment with ara-C followed by asparaginase resulted in 20 of 24 sixty-day survivors. In contrast, when asparaginase preceded ara-C, there was a mean survival time of only 23 days with no 60-day survivors. Maximal weight loss with either combination was only 10%. Mechanisms for the pharmacological antagonism include asparaginase-induced decreased cellular uptake and incorporation of ara-C into macromolecules. The apparent synergy is related to the timing of asparaginase treatment, the ""optimal therapeutic effect"" occurring when sequential asparaginase is administered before the cells recover from the ara-C effect. Since both drugs are probable components of antileukemic combinations, understanding of such drug-drug interactions would optimize clinical therapy.","['Schwartz, S A', 'Morgenstern, B', 'Capizzi, R L']","['Schwartz SA', 'Morgenstern B', 'Capizzi RL']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L5178/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mitotic Index/drug effects']",1982/06/01 00:00,1982/06/01 00:01,['1982/06/01 00:00'],"['1982/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Jun;42(6):2191-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, disease-related factors predispose to these granulomatous infections. Granulocytopenia and monocytopenia were present; the latter was not often corrected by splenectomy. There was impaired granuloma formation, with all infectious lesions appearing histologically as focal microabscesses containing few macrophages.

The risk of iatrogenic leukemia in women who survived for three years or more after melphalan treatment was calculated to be 950 times greater than the leukemia risk in the total female population. The cytogenetic changes were studied with three methods focused on sister chromatid exchange, chromosome aberrations, and DNA damage. The sister chromatid exchange frequency showed a marked increase, but it was corrected within a few months. Chromosome aberrations expressed by chromosome rearrangements were increased in the peripheral lymphocytes and may persist for several years. The frequency of DNA stand breaks was decreased indicating the presence of DNA cross-links.

The syndrome is characterized by partial deletion of the long arms of a chromosome No. 5 in bone marrow cells. The chromosomal anomaly is acquired and originates most probably from a pluripotent hematologic stem cell. Hematologic changes are (1) macrocytic, refractory anemia, (2) low to normal leukocyte counts, (3) normal to increased platelet number with marked anisocytosis and a high proportion of megathrombocytes, (4) normal to hypoplastic erythropoiesis and generally small megakaryocytes with nonlobulated nuclei in the bone marrow.

In only 2 out of 19 cases did acute leukemia develop. In the presence of additional chromosomal abnormalities, all the cases developed acute leukemia and especially acute myelogenous leukemia.

The granulomas were small without caseous necrosis and giant cells were infrequent.

The present study concerns 69 such patients: 29 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), and 40 with acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL). All were treated in single rooms in the same hospital and in similar conditions. The overall incidence of septicaemia was 62%; it was 60% in patients with recently diagnosed ALL and 68% during relapses. More than 34% of ALL patients and 82.5% of ANLL patients had one or several episodes of septicaemia. Among the 74 pathogens isolated 50% were Gram-positive organisms, 45% Gram-negative organisms and 5% Candida spp.. The first episodes of septicaemias were predominantly caused by Gram-positive spp. (61%) and the subsequent ones by Gram-negative spp. (60%). The primary infection could only be diagnosed in 19% of the cases and was most frequently located in the digestive tract or perineal region. The most common focal complications were lung infections (18 cases), skin infections (12 cases) and septic shock (15 cases). Seventy-four p. cent of the patients survived with prompt and potent antibiotic therapy. Death occurred in 26% and was clearly related to the following factors: chemotherapy of relapsed leukaemia and/or blastic aplasia and/or successive episodes of septicaemia. The incidence and severity of septicaemias in leukaemic patients will only be reduced by improved prophylactic measures against infection and by less pronounced and shorter chemotherapy-induced granulocytopenia.","['Gastaut, J A', 'Maraninchi, D', 'Bagarry Liegey, D', 'Lejeune, C', 'Novakovitch, G', 'Sebahoun, G', 'Meyer, G', 'Carcassonne, Y']","['Gastaut JA', 'Maraninchi D', 'Bagarry Liegey D', 'Lejeune C', 'Novakovitch G', 'Sebahoun G', 'Meyer G', 'Carcassonne Y']",['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Nouv Presse Med,La Nouvelle presse medicale,0312552,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Agranulocytosis/chemically induced/complications', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Sepsis/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control']",1982/02/20 00:00,1982/02/20 00:01,['1982/02/20 00:00'],"['1982/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Presse Med. 1982 Feb 20;11(8):579-82.,,"Incidence, pronostic et prevention des septicemies chez les malades traites pour leucemies aigues.",,,,,,,,,,,

Plotting the cumulative amount of N6-(delta 2-isopentenyl)adenosine released per unit area of the device versus the square root of time revealed a linear relationship. However, the higher loading dose tended to rapidly release any drug deposited on the polymer surface. The optimum loading dose of the device for the most effective antileukemic activity in 24 hr was calculated based on a plot of the release rate versus the square root of an initial loading dose. The silicone polymer--I delivery system enabled a sustained and controllable release of additional agent. It was thus possible to achieve virtually total inhibition of leukemia cell replication using the polymeric delivery system. Increased concentrations of I, without the use of the polymeric system, resulted in maximum 24 hr inhibition of only approximately 81%, followed by a decline in overall antileukemic activity. It is possible to achieve a more predictable release rate of N6-(delta 2-isopentenyl)adenosine and corresponding antileukemic activity using a polymeric delivery system against L-1210 mouse leukemic cells in vitro.

Inhibition of a syngeneic lymphoma outgrowth in H-2 and non-H-2 alloimmune BALB/c mice.,323-32,"To test whether alloimmunization with H-2 or/and non-H-2 different normal tissues may increase the immunity to syngeneic tumors, groups of BALB/c (H-2d) mice were immunized with a series of allogeneic lymphoid cells and then challenged i.p. with syngeneic lymphoma cells. The outgrowth of otherwise lethal doses of the Moloney virus-induced lymphoma YC8 and of its clones was inhibited in BALB/c mice immune to DBA/2 (H-2d), C3Hf (H-2k), C3H.SW (H-2b), C3H.OH (H-2o2) and to B10 background tissues but not in mice immunized to A/He, BALB.K (H-2k) or BALB.B (H-2b) normal tissues. Anti-YC8 effect was also induced by immunizing BALB/c recipients with a pool of five different allogeneic cell lines which included C3Hf, C57BL/6J (H-2b), N:NIH (H-2q), B10.M (H-2f), and DBA/2 lymphoid cells. No growth inhibition of other BALB/c lymphomas induced by Moloney virus (LSTRA), X-rays (RL male I) or urethane (UR-1) was evident in alloimmune mice. In vivo transfer of growth inhibition of YC8 was obtained with BALB/c anti-B10.D2 peritoneal exudate cells in a Winn assay. The ability of these alloimmune lymphoid cells to delay significantly the survival time of BALB/c mice injected with the mixture of immune cell and YC8 cells was abrogated by anti-Thy 1.2 plus C' treatment. In addition, nu/nu BALB/c mice were unable to develop resistance to YC8 outgrowth after alloimmunization. The results of this study show that: (1) syngeneic growth of a lymphoma can be prevented by alloimmunization with normal cells; (2) this cross-reaction involved non-H-2 antigens; (3) the phenomenon appeared to be mediated by T cells.","['Parmiani, G', 'Sensi, M L', 'Carbone, G', 'Colombo, M', 'Pierotti, M', 'Ballinari, D', 'Hilgers, J', 'Hilkens, J']","['Parmiani G', 'Sensi ML', 'Carbone G', 'Colombo M', 'Pierotti M', 'Ballinari D', 'Hilgers J', 'Hilkens J']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cross Reactions', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft Rejection', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",1982/03/15 00:00,1982/03/15 00:01,['1982/03/15 00:00'],"['1982/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910290316 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1982 Mar 15;29(3):323-32. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910290316.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphocytes preferentially utilized cysteine, compared to cystine, at a ratio of about 30 to 1, which was not related to differences in the extent of amino acid uptake. Only HeLa cells displayed a slight utilization of methionine via the cystathionine pathway for cysteine and GSH biosynthesis. HeLa and L1210 cells readily utilized either cystine or cysteine for GSH synthesis. The three cell types accumulated detectable levels of intracellular cysteine glutathione mixed disulfide when incubated in a medium containing a high concentration of cystine. Various enzyme activities were measured including gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, GSH S-transferase and gamma-cystathionase. These results support the concept of a dynamic interorgan relationship of GSH to plasma cyst(e)ine that may have importance for growth of various cell types in vivo.","['Brodie, A E', 'Potter, J', 'Reed, D J']","['Brodie AE', 'Potter J', 'Reed DJ']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Amino Acids, Sulfur)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Amino Acids, Sulfur/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cysteine/metabolism', 'Glutathione/*biosynthesis', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Spleen/*metabolism']",1982/03/01 00:00,1982/03/01 00:01,['1982/03/01 00:00'],"['1982/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1982.tb06512.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1982 Mar;123(1):159-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1982.tb06512.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The differentiation program expressed by this clone is very similar to that observed in the 5-86 parent, that, however, is arrested in its growth. The expression of the differentiated state in this clone depends on the continuous presence of an inducer; if the inducer is removed from a culture containing a high percentage of B+ (benzidine-positive) cells, the cells rapidly (5-7 days) revert to an undifferentiated state and appear to lose their differentiated character consecutively rather than simultaneously. The clone described in this paper is unstable; when grown for more than two months in the presence of an inducer it shifts toward a population containing a low percentage of heme-synthesizing cells.

The effect of a single dose of MPC disappeared within 40 hr due to the rapid degradation of this compound in mice. When MPC was encapsulated in liposomes before injection, its activity at 19 hr after inoculation was similar to that of free MPC. The inhibitory effect of this liposome-MPC complex, however, persisted for at least 40 hr, indicating that the MPC was protected from hydrolysis by the nucleases present in blood. Drug-free liposomes increased the number of clonogenic progenitor cells, whereas a mixture of plain liposomes and MPC decreased the number of clonogenic cells to a greater extent than did MPC alone or MPC within liposomes. A possible explantation for these observations is that the liposomes per se altered the clearance function of the reticuloendothelial system and completed with MPC for uptake by the reticuloendothelial system cells, thereby resulting in increased plasma levels of MPC which in turn resulted in greater killing of the target cells.","['Ho, Y K', 'Mayhew, E', 'Preisler, H D', 'Bardos, T J']","['Ho YK', 'Mayhew E', 'Preisler HD', 'Bardos TJ']",['eng'],"['CA 28494-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-5834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Polyribonucleotides)', '30811-80-4 (Poly C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Liposomes/*administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Poly C/*pharmacology', 'Polyribonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 May;42(5):1740-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results suggest that hematoporphyrin may be unable to cross the cell membrane readily in either direction and that long-persisting fluorescence resulting from exposure of tumor tissues to HPD results from transformation of a membrane-permeable HPD component to hematoporphyrin.","['Kessel, D']",['Kessel D'],['eng'],['CA 23378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Hematoporphyrins)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Hematoporphyrins/administration & dosage/analysis/*metabolism', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Photochemotherapy', 'Protoporphyrins/analysis', 'Sarcoma 180/*metabolism']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 May;42(5):1703-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viability was determined by cloning in soft agar. While there was a linear relationship between dose and MTX cytotoxicity for exposure duration of 3 and 6 hr (r = -0.66), there was a pronounced flattening of this curve at exposure durations of 18 to 42 hr (r = -0.48). Furthermore, there was an excellent correlation (r = -0.85) between MTX cytotoxicity and durations of exposure for 6 to 42 hr (dose range, 1 to 100 microM). Using the linear least-squares method, a best-fit equation for the kinetics of MTX cytotoxicity was determined to be: log viability = 2.25 = 1.76 (log duration) - 0.31 (log dose). In practice, this equation predicts that a 1-log increase in duration of exposure results in almost a 2-log increase in cytotoxicity, whereas a 1-log increase in dose results in only a 0.3-log increase in cytotoxicity. The clinical utility of these data suggest that protracted infusions of lower doses of MTX would be equally as useful as or more useful than short-term high-dose infusions.","['Keefe, D A', 'Capizzi, R L', 'Rudnick, S A']","['Keefe DA', 'Capizzi RL', 'Rudnick SA']",['eng'],['5-P30-CA16086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia L5178/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Time Factors']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 May;42(5):1641-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A single injection of 3'-CTNU (40 mg/kg) was minimally toxic to mice bearing the L1210 leukemia and produced 60-day survivors. The coadministration of thymidine did not prevent the initial loss of weight caused by 3'-CTNU but did prevent the lethality otherwise produced in non-tumor-bearing mice. A single dose of thymidine (2 g/kg) administered to L1210-bearing mice had no anticancer activity and when coadministered with 3'-CTNU had no detrimental effect on the potent antitumor effects of 3'-CTNU. Similar results were obtained against P388 leukemia. The hematopoietic toxicity produced by the administration of 3'-CTNU to non-tumor-bearing mice, as evidenced by changes in the white blood cells, neutrophil, and agar diffusion chamber precursor cell concentrations in the hematocrit and in bone marrow cellularity, could not be prevented by thymidine. Therefore, the lethality produced by 3'-CTNU is probably not related to hematopoietic toxicity since the coadministration of thymidine completely prevented any lethality.","['Lin, T S', 'Fischer, P H', 'Marsh, J C', 'Prusoff, W H']","['Lin TS', 'Fischer PH', 'Marsh JC', 'Prusoff WH']",['eng'],['CA-08341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dideoxynucleosides)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', ""65174-26-7 (3'-(3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea)-3'-deoxythymidine)"", 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Body Weight', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', '*Dideoxynucleosides', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Hematocrit', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic System/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Thymidine/*pharmacology']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 May;42(5):1624-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under steady-state conditions, when compared to corresponding plasma values, MTX levels were 2- to 4-fold lower in the testicular interstitial fluid and 18- to 50-fold lower in the seminiferous tubule.

In contrast, cobalamin-replete cells contained only 5.3% 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, along with 30% each of the other three reduced folate compounds. These results provide direct experimental proof of the ""methyl trap"" hypothesis, which predicted that 5-methyltetrahydrofolate should accumulate in cobalamin-deficient cells.","['Fujii, K', 'Nagasaki, T', 'Huennekens, F M']","['Fujii K', 'Nagasaki T', 'Huennekens FM']",['eng'],"['AM7097/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16600/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA6522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'TYK22LML8F (5-methyltetrahydrofolate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Folic Acid/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*metabolism', 'Vitamin B 12 Deficiency/*metabolism']",1982/03/10 00:00,1982/03/10 00:01,['1982/03/10 00:00'],"['1982/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)34896-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1982 Mar 10;257(5):2144-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, metabolic and ultrastructural aspects of the cortisol-induced killing process of CLL cells are recorded. In vitro lysis was found to be temperature dependent and was detected only after 6 to 8 hr incubation with cortisol by means of the trypan blue exclusion test. However, 30 min of incubation with cortisol at either 37 degrees or 4 degrees followed by the removal of the hormone was still sufficient to induce the lytic process. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated sequential changes in the cytoplasm, including swelling of mitochondria and cytoplasmic decompartmentalization, followed by loss of surface microvilli with the appearance of ""holes"" in the cell membrane, and subsequent condensation of nuclear chromatin. The large holes in the membrane appearing after 6 hr of incubation with the hormone may be the cause for the penetration of the viable stain into the dead cells, as seen by light microscopy. Addition of metabolic inhibitors including actinomycin D, puromycin, and cycloheximide following administration of cortisol resulted in inhibition of the cell lysis. An excess of an antagonist such as cortexolone was found to inhibit the cortisol-induced cytolysis of the CLL cells. It is suggested that the glucocorticoid-induced lysis of human CLL cells is similar to the phenomenon observed in rat or murine lymphocytes and is mediated by interaction of the steroid molecule with the cytoplasmic receptor. The resulting complex appears to activate specific gene(s) the products of which eventually cause cytolysis.","['Galili, U', 'Leizerowitz, R', 'Moreb, J', 'Gamliel, H', 'Gurfel, D', 'Polliack, A']","['Galili U', 'Leizerowitz R', 'Moreb J', 'Gamliel H', 'Gurfel D', 'Polliack A']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', 'Temperature']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Apr;42(4):1433-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Q10 for drug efflux varied from 1.2 to 1.8, values intermediate between those expected for simple diffusion and a carrier-mediated process. Furthermore, drug efflux was sodium independent and was not inhibited by the presence of amino acids on the same side of the membrane, findings which support the concept that efflux was by simple diffusion. The presence of a wide variety of amino acids in the extracellular medium was found to stimulate melphalan efflux.

M5076 cells were markedly deficient in mediated entry of methotrexate. This was in contrast to the L1210 leukemia, a tumor highly responsive to methotrexate but poorly responsive to metoprine. Two L1210 leukemia sublines, with acquired resistance to methotrexate by virtue of a deficiency in mediated entry of drug similar to that seen for M5076 cells, were found to be collaterally sensitive to metoprine. The insensitivity to methotrexate of the M5076 tumor and the two L1210 sublines is associated with low saturability (high Km) and reduced capacity (low Vmax) for mediated influx of drug. 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate, the major circulating folate in blood but not metoprine, shares this mediated route for entry. Therefore, a relatively low level of accumulation of this natural folate in these methotrexate-resistant tumors, in the face of a metoprine-induced blockade at the level of dihydrofolate reductase, probably accounts for the high sensitivity of these tumors to this lipophilic agent. Evidence for this notion was derived during transport and growth experiments in vitro using 5-formyltetrahydrofolate as a model folate coenzyme. The value for influx Vmax of this folate compound in a transport-deficient methotrexate-resistant subline compared to the parental L1210 was reduced to the same extent as that shown for methotrexate. Growth of this resistant L1210 subline showed a greater requirement for this model compound than did the parental line. Also, the concentration necessary for 50% inhibition by metoprine in the presence of this reduced folate was lower in the resistant subline. Inhibition of each cell line by metoprine, on the other hand, was the same when folic acid was used as the folate source. The implications of these findings for the use of lipophilic antifolates as alternative therapy for some methotrexate-resistant tumors are discussed.","['Sirotnak, F M', 'Moccio, D M', 'Goutas, L J', 'Kelleher, L E', 'Montgomery, J A']","['Sirotnak FM', 'Moccio DM', 'Goutas LJ', 'Kelleher LE', 'Montgomery JA']",['eng'],"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-22764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Formyltetrahydrofolates)', '2L9RKX796Q (metoprine)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'Z3614QOX8W (Pyrimethamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance', 'Formyltetrahydrofolates/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Pyrimethamine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism']",1982/03/01 00:00,1982/03/01 00:01,['1982/03/01 00:00'],"['1982/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Mar;42(3):924-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The emission spectrum of R123 taken up by cells undergoes a 12-nm red shift, suggesting formation of a complex. Cells accumulate R123 rapidly; near maximum binding is reached after 5 to 10 min, regardless of the temperature (0-37 degrees) of incubation. There is a dose-dependent relationship between R123 concentration in the medium and the dye accumulation in the cell that covers the range of 0.1 to 10.0 and 0.1 to 5.0 microgram of R123 per ml under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions, respectively. Some leakage of the dye from cells occurs, following their transfer into dye-free medium. Despite the leakage, the intracellular dye can be detected after at least two cell divisions, thus indicating that: (a) the R123-labeled cells divide; (b) during division, labeled mitochondria are distributed into the daughter cells; and (c) R123 may be used as a cell tracer. Cell death often is accompanied by a transient increase in R123 fluorescence. Dead cells exhibit either uniform, strong fluorescence or show a patchy labeling pattern suggesting swollen mitochondria. With time (4 to 8 hr), dead cells lose ability to retain R123 and lyse. Uptake of R123 by living cells is increased during the transition from quiescence into the cycle, and a decrease is seen when Friend leukemia cells undergo erythroid differentiation; in all cases, changes in R123 uptake are correlated with changes in cellular RNA content. Simultaneous cell staining with R123 and ethidium or propidium provides a rapid assay of the viability of the cells and their metabolic state, i.e., as related to proliferation or motility. Pulse-labeling of cells with up to 10 microgram of R123 per ml has no significant effect on their immediate growth and cloning efficiency. In the continuous presence of R123, however, cells become specifically arrested in the G1A compartment, i.e., in early G1 phase. Detailed analysis of the cell cycle kinetics reveals that cell progression through all phases is slowed 4 hr after addition of R123. Cell exit from G1A, however, is affected as early as 2 hr following addition of R123, and with time the cells are unable to leave this compartment at all. Uncharged rhodamine dyes (rhodamine 110 and rhodamine B) do not accumulate in mitochondria and are without effect on the cell cycle. The cytostatic effect of R123 is discussed in light of the dye specificity for mitochondrial membranes and the disruption of cell energy metabolism, resulting in the inability of the cells to attain a critical content of essential components (i.e., ribosomal RNA), necessary for cell entrance into the prereplicative (G1B) compartment of G1 phase.","['Darzynkiewicz, Z', 'Traganos, F', 'Staiano-Coico, L', 'Kapuscinski, J', 'Melamed, M R']","['Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Traganos F', 'Staiano-Coico L', 'Kapuscinski J', 'Melamed MR']",['eng'],"['CA 23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/*pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Xanthenes/*pharmacology']",1982/03/01 00:00,1982/03/01 00:01,['1982/03/01 00:00'],"['1982/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Mar;42(3):799-806.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a cellular medium devoid of adenosine deaminase, inhibitors of this enzyme did not affect the inactivation process in rat hepatocytes and only slightly enhanced this process in the cultured cells (at low concentrations of ara-A).

Saturation of transferrin with iron was necessary for optimal uptake. Following the incubation of cells with the radiolabeled complex a biphasic pattern of uptake was observed. The initial phase was rapid and relatively temperature-independent and was not altered by ethylamine, an inhibitor of transglutaminase activity which is necessary for receptor-mediated endocytosis. This phase was considered to result from receptor-ligand interaction which could be reversed to a great degree by replacement with unlabeled transferrin. A plateau was then reached, indicating a saturation of receptors. After 30 min a second phase of uptake was indicated by the second rise in the curve. This phase was slow, relatively temperature-dependent and could be abolished by ethylamine. It was interpreted as evidence of internalization of the ligand. Analysis of the data from competition studies with unlabeled transferrin indicated that the first phase might itself comprise a reversible and an irreversible step with a ratio of 5 to 1.4 for bound transferrin. Thus, the cellular uptake of iron-transferrin complex may consist of a reversible ligand-receptor interaction. Conformational changes may render this interaction irreversible and the internalization of the ligand may then follow.","['Takahashi, K', 'Tavassoli, M']","['Takahashi K', 'Tavassoli M']",['eng'],['AM-30142/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Biological Transport', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Reticulocytes/*metabolism', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1982/02/08 00:00,1982/02/08 00:01,['1982/02/08 00:00'],"['1982/02/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/08 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(82)90027-X [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(82)90027-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1982 Feb 8;685(1):6-12. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(82)90027-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median survival increased by 5.5 days (P less than 0.05), 10 days (P less than 0.05) and 13 days (P less than 0.05) respectively. The addition of CMT had the effect of roughly doubling the CTX dose, without increasing the lethality. CMT produced the only long-term survival seen in the study (1-2/10) CMT alone had no apparent antitumour activity. CMT significantly prolonged mean pentobarbital sleep to 28.6-60 min vs only 10 min for phenobarbital treated mice. Both CMT regimens increased the plasma concentration time products for CTX-induced metabolites (NBP) by about 1.3 fold (in contrast to a 33% reduction with phenobarbital). On average the single-dose CMT regimen produced the greatest effect on survival, on pentobarbital sleep duration and on total NBP reactive species. Probable mechanisms for the CMT-CTX interaction include competitive microsomal enzyme inhibition and/or acutely depressed hepatic blood flow. Caution should be used in combining CMT with full doses of CTX and any other highly metabolized antineoplastic agents in man.","['Dorr, R T', 'Alberts, D S']","['Dorr RT', 'Alberts DS']",['eng'],"['CA-17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Guanidines)', '80061L1WGD (Cimetidine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'YQE403BP4D (Phenobarbital)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cimetidine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Guanidines/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Phenobarbital/pharmacology', 'Sleep/drug effects']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1982.5 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1982 Jan;45(1):35-43. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1982.5.,PMC2010952,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coupling of 2 and 6 at the open carboxyl grouping with amino compounds was affected by the mixed anhydride method (using isobutyl chloroformate); carboxyl groupings of amino acids coupled with 2 and 6 were protected as benzyl esters. N-[4-[[(Benzyloxy)carbonyl]methylamino]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid gamma-methyl ester (5), a precursor to MTX gamma-methyl ester, was prepared from L-glutamic acid gamma-methyl ester and 4-[[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]methylamino]benzoyl chloride (1) in a manner similar to that used to prepare 2 and 6.

Ara-C 5'-(n-butyl phosphate) (1b), N4-palmitoyl-ara-C 5'-(n-butyl phosphate) (1h), and 2,2'-anhydro-3'-O-palmitoyl-ara-C 5'-(n-butyl phosphate) (2h) were tested against L1210/ara-C leukemia in mice in the hope that this kinase-deficient tumor would respond to treatment with these ""prephosphorylated"" derivatives, but no activity was observed. Of the simple 5'-(alkyl phosphate) esters tested in culture against l1210 leukemic cells, only ara-C 5'-(glyceryl phosphate) (1g) showed toxicity comparable to ara-CMP (ID50 = 0.35 and 0.65 microM, respectively), suggesting that beta-hydroxyalkyl phosphate esters may be worthwhile to examine further as prodrugs of ara-CMP.","['Rosowsky, A', 'Kim, S H', 'Ross, J', 'Wick, M M']","['Rosowsky A', 'Kim SH', 'Ross J', 'Wick MM']",['eng'],"['CA 22738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Esters)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Cytarabine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Esters', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00344a016 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1982 Feb;25(2):171-8. doi: 10.1021/jm00344a016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results show that very potent triazine inhibitors of resistant tumor cell growth can easily be made by making the triazines strongly hydrophobic. The optimum pi value for inhibition of MTX-sensitive cell culture is 0.8, while pi 0 for the resistant cell culture is about 6.0.

The data indicated that B chain bound to the cell surface was capable of causing the transport of A chain. The quantities of ricin and of B chain (in the presence of a saturating amount of A chain) required to inhibit protein synthesis by 50% are nearly identical, indicating that there is little difference in the toxicity to cultured cells between ricin and the A chain-B chain heterodimer formed from purified subunits. However, if the addition of A chain to B chain-treated cells was delayed sufficiently long (90 to 120 min), B chain was no longer able to cause A chain transport and the consequent inhibition of protein synthesis.

In contrast, less than 15% of the hormone remains with the nuclei when cells are labeled at 4 C. In rat thymocytes, quantitatively similar results were obtained using this new method and a conventional method of isolating nuclei (homogenization of cells in a hypotonic buffer). For both methods, preincubation of the labeled cells with the sulfhydryl blocking reagents was essential to prevent release of the nuclear hormone (or hormone-receptor complex) by a sulfhydryl-dependent labilizing activity apparently located in the cytoplasm.

Concentrations of PALA equivalents in plasma, urine, and feces were determined radiochemically, and urine was analyzed chromatographically for PALA. The disposition of PALA equivalents in mouse tissues was determined radioautographically. After i.v. administration, PALA was rapidly (half-time, approximately 1 hr) and extensively (up to 80% of the dose) excreted in the urine of all species. Less than 5% was excreted in the feces. Only PALA was found in the urine of all four species, indicating that the metabolism of PALA, if it occurs at all, is insignificant. PALA equivalents were poorly taken up by mouse tumors and tissues, except kidney, bone, and to a lesser extent, skin and lung, and were rapidly and extensively cleared from all except bone. No differences were apparent in the uptake of PALA equivalents by Lewis lung carcinoma (sensitive to PALA treatment) and L1210 lymphocytic leukemia (insensitive). The pharmacokinetics of PALA in the plasma of rat, dog, and monkey, as well as mouse, were inconsistent with deposition of PALA in tissues and more consistent with the probable distribution of PALA into extracellular water. PALA equivalents were eliminate from all species at a rate (half-time, 1 to 1.5 hr) reflecting the rate of urinary excretion of the drug and at a secondary slower rate probably reflecting the rate of release of bound PALA from sites such as aspartate transcarbamylase. PALA was poorly absorbed into the systemic circulation when administered p.o., in that mouse, rat, and monkey excreted less than 5% of the dose in the urine after p.o. administration. These data on the physiological disposition of PALA explain why high doses of the drug have to be administered to achieve therapeutic and toxic effects, despite the inhibitory potency of the drug on aspartate transcarbamylase. They indicate that PALA will be ineffective administered p.o. and might be contraindicated in patients with impaired renal function and that the kinetics of aspartate transcarbamylase-bound drug is probably more important in determining dose scheduling than the kinetics of free PALA.","['Chadwick, M', 'Silveira, D M', 'MacGregor, J A', 'Branfman, A R', 'Liss, R H', 'Yesair, D W']","['Chadwick M', 'Silveira DM', 'MacGregor JA', 'Branfman AR', 'Liss RH', 'Yesair DW']",['eng'],"['N01-CM-53849/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-87163/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '78QVZ7RG8L (sparfosic acid)', 'EC 2.1.3.2 (Aspartate Carbamoyltransferase)', 'N919E46723 (Phosphonoacetic Acid)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Aspartate Carbamoyltransferase/metabolism', 'Aspartic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/blood/metabolism/urine', 'Autoradiography', 'Biological Availability', 'Dogs', 'Feces/analysis', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Kinetics', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*metabolism', 'Phosphonoacetic Acid/analogs & derivatives/blood/*metabolism/urine', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Tissue Distribution']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Feb;42(2):627-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The kinetics of the generation of cytotoxic cells within the sponge was studied over a 22-day period in a short-term 51Cr release assay. Cytotoxic activity peaked on Day 16 and then declined to negligible levels by Day 22. No cytotoxicity was detectable when nontransformed BALB/c blast cells, Moloney leukemia virus-induced tumor (LSTRA) cells, or unrelated chemically induced tumor (EL4) cells were used as targets. When the cellular composition of implanted tumor sponges was examined on Day 16, it was found to be 30 to 40% myeloperoxidase-positive cells, 15 to 25% surface immunoglobulin-positive cells, and 40 to 50% theta-positive cells. Treatment with anti-Thy 1.2 plus complement eliminated the cytotoxic response on Day 16. The ratio of T-cells to tumor cells within the sponge was determined by immunofluorescence. Kinetic studies showed that the number of theta-positive cells increased well before cytolytic activity was detected, possibly reflecting increasing numbers of amplifier T-cells or cytotoxic cell precursors. A later decline in theta-positive cells correlated directly with decreased cytotoxicity. Furthermore, onset of cytotoxic activity also correlated with a decline in the percentage of Moloney murine sarcoma virus tumor cells within the sponge. Sponge cells isolated on Day 16 (peak cytotoxicity), mixed with lethal dosages of moloney murine sarcoma virus tumor cells, successfully neutralized the lethal challenge demonstrating the in vivo antitumor efficacy of these effector cells. Sponges were also implanted in mice which had been immunized with single injection of Moloney murine sarcoma virus cells. Inoculation of the sponge with tumor cells resulted in a second set response in which cytotoxic cells appeared much earlier than in unsensitized animals. Cells from spleen, lymph node, or peritoneal cavity of normal or presensitized animals with tumor sponge implants were not cytotoxic, suggesting a highly localized response.","['Vallera, D A', 'Mentzer, S J', 'Maizel, S E']","['Vallera DA', 'Mentzer SJ', 'Maizel SE']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/methods', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Tampons, Surgical', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Feb;42(2):397-404.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The method requires a correction for admixed peripheral blood in bone marrow aspirates to measure the fraction of remaining pure marrow. While cell kinetic differences between blood, aspirates, and biopsies identify the proportion of contaminating blood cells, the ratio of red cell hematocrits in blood and aspirate gives the volume of trapped blood. By combining both procedures, bone marrow cell counts per unit volume pure marrow result (BMC/cu mm BM), which were found highly reproducible. Blast cell counts (BMBC/cu mm BM) were obtained by additional morphological differentiation. BMC and BMBC/cu mm BM were monitored in 16 patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia treated with daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, and 6-thioguanine in combination and in 4 patients with end-stage acute leukemias and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas during high-dose thymidine therapy. Total and daily therapy-induced cytoreduction rates were significantly greater (P less than 0.01) in responders than nonresponders to either regimen.

The mechanism responsible for the decrease in sialic acid content was examined by measuring the synthesis of sialic acid from N-acetylmannosamine and its catabolic removal from sialoconjugates during the maturation process. A decrease in the incorporation of N-[3H]acetylmannosamine into sialoglycoconjugates occurred as early as 12 h after exposure to dimethylsulfoxide. Radioactivity incorporated into sialoglycoconjugates was relatively stable in untreated and dimethyl-sulfoxide-treated cells, implying that catabolic removal of sialic acid residues was not a factor in the decreased surface sialic acid content of differentiated erythroleukemia cells. In addition, no difference existed between control and treated cells in sialyltransferase activity. Significant decreases occurred, however, in the incorporation of radioactivity from N-[3H]acetylmannosamine into N-acetylneuraminic acid, CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid and a material tentatively identified as N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate, 48 h after the addition of dimethylsulfoxide. The decrease in sialic acid biosynthesis in differentiated erythroleukemia cells was reflected by an 83% decrease in the amount of radioactively-labeled sialic acid released by neuraminidase treatment of cells exposed to dimethylsulfoxide. These findings are consistent with a cellular aging phenomenon triggered by the polar solvent-induced differentiation of the leukemic cells into more mature forms.","['Brown, A E', 'Schwartz, E L', 'Dreyer, R N', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Brown AE', 'Schwartz EL', 'Dreyer RN', 'Sartorelli AC']",['eng'],"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-05349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Hexosamines)', '0 (N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Sugar Phosphates)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'X80PR7P73R (N-acetylmannosamine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hexosamines/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Sialic Acids/biosynthesis', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Sialyltransferases/metabolism', 'Sugar Phosphates/metabolism']",1982/02/02 00:00,1982/02/02 00:01,['1982/02/02 00:00'],"['1982/02/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/02 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-4165(82)90327-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-4165(82)90327-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1982 Feb 2;714(2):217-25. doi: 10.1016/0304-4165(82)90327-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that amiloride prevents dimethyl sulfoxide-induced MEL cell differentiation via inhibition of an essential Ca2+ influx (levenson, R., Housman, D., and Cantley, L. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 5948-5952). Here we show that external Na+ inhibits Ca2+ influx and stimulates Ca2+ efflux from uninduced MEL cells. Increasing the internal Na+ concentration by a brief incubation of cells with ouabain stimulates the rate of 45Ca2+ influx. Amiloride (40 microM) completely blocks the external Na+-stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux and external Na+-inhibitable 45Ca2+ influx. The same concentration of amiloride had no significant effect on net Na+ uptake. These results suggest that a significant fraction of Ca2+ flux across the MEL cell plasma membrane occurs via a Na+/Ca2+ antiport system and that amiloride prevents differentiation by blocking Ca2+ influx through this system. The importance of a Na+/Ca2+ antiport system for MEL cell differentiation is supported by the following observation: increasing the cellular Na+ level by a brief treatment with ouabain plus monensin accelerates MEL cell commitment as effectively as adding the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. We suggest that dimethyl sulfoxide induces MEL cell differentiation by inhibiting the Na+ pump and consequently allowing Ca2+ influx through the Na+/Ca2+ antiport.","['Smith, R L', 'Macara, I G', 'Levenson, R', 'Housman, D', 'Cantley, L']","['Smith RL', 'Macara IG', 'Levenson R', 'Housman D', 'Cantley L']",['eng'],"['CA26717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM28538/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Calcium Exchanger)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'MLT4718TJW (Rubidium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amiloride/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Rubidium', 'Sodium/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Sodium-Calcium Exchanger']",1982/01/25 00:00,1982/01/25 00:01,['1982/01/25 00:00'],"['1982/01/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/25 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)68263-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1982 Jan 25;257(2):773-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells of all but two of the patients showed monoclonal surface Ig with respect to light chains. In about one-third of the cases, only gamma heavy chain determinants were present on the cells; the majority carried multiple heavy chain determinants as documented by the application of different fluorochromes. Two patients each showed two different clones of cells, both of the same light chain type. In one of these two patients, two paraproteins were present in the serum. Intracytoplasmic Ig was found in only 4 of 39 cases, in all instances being IgM. All cases studied concerned cells with FclgG receptors; however, the density of this receptor varied. FcIgM receptors also showed a spectrum of density, with some cases showing very few FcIgM-positive cells. Receptors C3 were not observed on the hairy cells. Serum immunoglobulin levels were normal or increased. Paraproteins were found in the sera of 4 of 38 patients. These data suggest that HCL is a neoplasm of B lymphocytes.

The common Xq13 chromosome breakpoint and clinical presentation (IASA) among these three patients and the occurrence of an X-linked type of sideroblastic anemia may suggest that an association exists between X chromosome abnormalities and IASA. Perhaps alteration of a gene or chromosome structure in or near band Xq13 predisposes to development of IASA. The fact that two of these patients had preleukemia and the third had overt acute leukemia may imply that patients with IASA and X chromosome abnormalities have a poor prognosis.

Also, cell-free supernatant from ""sarcoma""-cell cultures produced tumours, indicating that the successful transplantation of the ""sarcoma"" cells was probably due to production of infective virus. Cells cytotoxic in vitro against the ""sarcoma"" cells were present within both spleen and tumour of the tumour donors, but not in the spleens of normal mice. The cytotoxicity was specific against virus-infected cells, since in a mixture of virus-positive (gp 70) and virus-negative cells, positive cells were removed while negative cells were not affected, as measured by a visual cytotoxicity assay using immunostaining. Although T cells could be isolated from the MSV-induced tumours, these cells did not appear to mediate the cytotoxicity detected against the MSV ""sarcoma"" cells.

Damage to the enterocytes resulted in both coagulative necrosis and ""apoptosis"" (the development of membrane-bound cell fragments--""apoptotic bodies""). Epithelial injury and lymphocytic infiltration predominated in the bases of the crypts in mild GVHD and extended to the surface epithelium in severe GVHD. Chemoradiotherapy-induced injury, present early post-transplant, was diffuse and severe but transient. In GVHD, damage to the enterocytes, necrosis, and intercellular edema extended beyond the time of resolution of chemoradiotherapy-induced injuries.

TdT was tested in peripheral blood and bone marrow with both the biochemical and immunofluorescence (IF) methods, and ADA was determined biochemically only in peripheral blood cells. By using conventional cytochemistry, cell surface markers determinations, TdT and ADA analysis, three distinct groups are recognized in ALL at presentation: T-ALL with TdT+ and very high ADA values; non-T, non-B ALL with TdT+ and intermediate levels of ADA; B-ALL with TdT absence and low levels of ADA. Clinical presentation and responses to therapy in adult and children ALL were correlated to TdT determinations. The median survivals in adults, calculated for TdT+ and TdT- groups, were 14.2 and 5.6 months, respectively. TdT and ADA were determined in ALL during remission. The wide fluctuation observed for TdT IF and ADA values prevented a reliable monitoring of remissions. At relapse, TdT and ADA values were similar to those found for ALL at presentation; TdT IF determinations were diagnostic in cases showing CNS involvement as the only localization. Forty per cent of AUL and 11% of AML cases were positive for TdT; the medians of ADA values of the TdT+ cases in both AML and AUL were several times higher than those obtained in the TdT- group. While TdT positivity and high ADA had a favorable prognostic value in AUL, similar conclusions can not be drawn at the moment for AML. In chronic phase of CML, TdT was strictly negative and ADA values were increased over the control line only in cases showing initial signs of transformation. In acute phase, the cases positive for TdT (32%) presented a significantly higher ADA activity than the TdT negative ones. The actuarial survival curves for the TdT+ and TdT- groups differ significantly, presenting median survivals from onset of phase of 11 and 4.8 months respectively. The three cases of Ph' positive ALL were all TdT+, presented high ADA values and entered chronic phase of CML after therapy.","['Brusamolino, E', 'Bertazzoni, U', 'Isernia, P', 'Ginelli, E', 'Scovassi, A I', 'Zurlo, M G', 'Plevani, P', 'Sacchi, N', 'Bernasconi, C']","['Brusamolino E', 'Bertazzoni U', 'Isernia P', 'Ginelli E', 'Scovassi AI', 'Zurlo MG', 'Plevani P', 'Sacchi N', 'Bernasconi C']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenosine Deaminase/*blood/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Child', 'Clinical Enzyme Tests', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*blood/metabolism', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*blood', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*blood', 'Reference Values']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4684-8929-3_24 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1982;145:279-303. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4684-8929-3_24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This view can be justified on two grounds. First, understanding of the biology of the disease is increasing, resulting for example in the demonstration of the prognostic significance of the behavior of the leukemic blast cells in culture and their chromosomal pattern. It seems most likely that individualization of treatment will follow from such observations, with obvious benefit to the patients. Second it has been shown that a modest proportion of patients is cured with the manipulations of chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy and bone marrow transplantation practised in the mid-1970s. Selected results reflecting a personal bias have been presented allowing speculation that very intensive chemotherapy, possibly of short duration may be able to increase this proportion. At the same time, advances in the techniques of preparation of both patient and bone marrow for transplantation are being made and may increase the potential pool of patients who may benefit from the procedure. Even within the limitations of the treatment available now, it is possible that a flexible attitude to the precise manipulation of cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy and transplantation may result in cure for the majority, rather than the minority, of patients.","['Lister, T A', 'Rohatiner, A Z']","['Lister TA', 'Rohatiner AZ']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Naphthacenes/therapeutic use', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Thioguanine/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0037-1963(82)90013-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1982 Jul;19(3):172-92.,,,137,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of the association of microenvironment-dependent leukemia cells with thymic epithelial reticular cells (TER) was analyzed in vitro by scanning electron microscopy, microcinematography, and a quantitative assessment of PEMP. PEMP was a consequence of active locomotion of the leukemia cells, with TER passively accepting the leukemia cells ""crawling"" under their cytoplasm. The integrity of the cytoskeletal system of both cells was essentially required for PEMP, since cytochalasins and colchicine were highly inhibitory to PEMP. The mechanism of action of these compounds was probably dual: inhibition of the locomotive movements of the leukemia cells.

During this time he received induction therapy, underwent bone marrow transplantation, and relapsed. The leukemia cells expressed three membrane phenotypes during different stages of disease: T-cell at diagnosis; T-cell, B-cell, and monocyte during the induction period; T-cell in the first relapse after bone marrow transplantation; and T-cell and B-cell during the terminal stage. Some cells expressed markers of two cell types, indicating a common origin of these cells. Cytogenetic studies during post-transplantation relapse showed abnormal marker chromosomes that indicated two major sublines. However, there was enough sharing of other aberrant chromosomes to suggest that these two populations presented sublines within the same neoplastic clone. We suggest that these leukemia cells were derived from a pluripotential cell prior to differentiation into cells of the lymphoid and monocytic series.

A substantial proportion of patients, perhaps 40%-50%, are apparently cured with currently available therapy. However, optimal therapy has not yet been devised because of substantial therapeutic failures in the form of relapse and unacceptable side effects. Remission induction therapy is the most settled aspect of therapy. The addition of asparaginase or an anthracycline to prednisone and vincristine is highly effective. Preventive central nervous system therapy is under revision and study, with a variety of approaches likely to prove equally effective. Continuation (maintenance) therapy is in the most need of revision because a majority of therapeutic failures are due to bone marrow relapse--the failure of systemic therapy to prevent emergence of resistant leukemia cells. The optimal duration of therapy has not been established, the relapse after cessation of therapy lasting 2-3 years currently being 20%-25%.

This early report was followed by a study by Halazun et al, colleagues who carried out a randomized controlled trial of vincristine plus prednisone versus vincristine plus prednisone plus daunorubicin. They reported a 0% incidence of congestive heart failure in the two-drug regimen and a 9.99% incidence in the three-drug regimen containing daunorubicin. Since that report there have been a large number of reports in the literature documenting that congestive heart failure can occur with administration of daunorubicin. Unfortunately, even though the drug-induced cardiotoxicity is a well-documented phenomenon, there has been very little information available as regards its incidence or risk factors for its development. This is in contrast to Adriamycin, where both the incidence of and risk factors for the development of cardiotoxicity are better studied. Because of this paucity of information we began a large retrospective study in 1976 to determine the incidence of and risk factors for the development of daunorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. The incidence data have been reported previously.

Prolongation of remission duration was accomplished more effectively and at lower toxic cost by administration of asparaginase after the vincristine and prednisone treatment had been completed.

The protein synthesis inhibitor asparaginase shares this potential. In murine leukemia L5178Y which is sensitive to both asparaginase and methotrexate (MTX), the prior use of asparaginase or the simultaneous administration of both drugs results in subadditive effects. In tumor-bearing mice, multiple courses of sequential MTX followed by asparaginase cured 55% of the leukemic mice whereas the converse sequence cured none. Partial explanation for this pharmacologic antagonism includes asparaginase-induced decrease in cellular uptake of MTX and delay in cell cycle traverse. It is of importance to recognize such pharmacologic antagonism for the proper design of clinical trials. Studies with human leukemic lymphoblasts suggest that the optimal time interval between asparaginase and a subsequent dose of MTX was 9-10 days. A 24-hour interval between methotrexate and a subsequent dose of asparaginase permits at least an additive therapeutic effect. The repeated use of this 2-day tandem schedule (MTX AsNase) permits the host to tolerate increasingly larger doses of MTX. These larger doses of MTX may have therapeutic benefit for the following reasons: 1) the steep dose-response relationship for MTX, 2) larger doses may overcome ""transport-resistant"" populations, and 3) larger doses may penetrate pharmacologic sanctuaries such as the blood-brain barrier. Trials of this combination in adults and children with advanced lymphoblastic leukemia, many of whom were previously treated with asparaginase and were refractory to conventional doses of MTX, resulted in complete remissions of 64% and 50%, respectively.","['Capizzi, R L']",['Capizzi RL'],['eng'],['CA-16086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L5178/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Time Factors']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1981;65 Suppl 4:115-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A short review of the numerator of this index, ie, the clinical activities of DDP given as a single agent or in combination therapy is presented. Toxicity of DDP, the denominator of the index, is given more attention, particularly nephrotoxicity, whose cumulative character and molecular mechanism are still in question and which can most often be prevented by following certain safety rules that are detailed in this paper. Pharmacokinetics data of free and filterable platinum are reviewed and discussed according to the different modalities of administration of DDP, and to what is known about its toxicity and its mechanism of cell kill. The rationale for using DDP in combination treatment is presented and the question of possible long-term toxicities is raised. cis-platinum analogs are sought for the purpose of enlarging the spectrum of activity, increasing selectivity and diminishing toxicity. Malonato-platinum has been shown not to be cross-resistant with DDP and to be clinically effective in adult acute leukemia. In a phase I study, malonato-platinum, which is poorly soluble, was administered in 6-24-hour infusions to 49 patients in doses ranging from 3 to 32 mg/kg. GI toxicity was universal. Hematological toxicity appeared to be mild and not clearly dose-related (the 3-32 mg/kg patients were not yet evaluable). Platinum pharmacokinetics in urine and plasma were performed using flameless absorption spectrophotometry. Preliminary results have suggested that malonato-platinum presented several pharmacokinetic features in common with DDP. Minor responses were seen in four solid tumor patients, three of whom were refractory to DDP.

Furthermore, thymidine was found to be an effective modulator of the intracellular pools of dCTP and ara-CTP in rats, bone marrow, small intestine, and colon tumor cells. The mechanism of this effect is unclear, but initial evidence indicates that specific scheduling of the sequential administration of the metabolite and the antimetabolites may be important in determining increased selectivity of antitumor effects. In vivo studies with fluorinated pyrimidines have focused on quantitating 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) pools and their retention, and on the incorporation of fluorouridine (FUR) into RNA of sensitive and resistant L1210 cells. The results suggest that the retention of intracellular FdUMP pools above a threshold may be a more critical determinant in selectivity than the initial FdUMP levels achieved in target cells. Thymidine has been demonstrated to alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of 5-FU in man and in mice, but a selective modification of the antitumor activity of 5-FU has not yet been unequivocally demonstrated.","['Rustum, Y M', 'Danhauser, L', 'Luccioni, C', 'Au, J L']","['Rustum YM', 'Danhauser L', 'Luccioni C', 'Au JL']",['eng'],"['CA-18420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21071/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-5837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '134-46-3 (Fluorodeoxyuridylate)', '4K0M952561 (5-fluorouridine)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Fluorodeoxyuridylate/metabolism', 'Fluorouracil/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Uridine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1981;65 Suppl 3:73-82.,,,27,,,,,,,,,,

Several of its derivatives share these properties and nine hydroxylated compounds are even more potent. 2-Methyl-9-hydorxyellipticinium (NSC 264-137) has thus recently been shown to display some therapeutic effectiveness in human breast cancers. The biochemical mechanism of this action is discussed in this paper. DNA has been implied as the target of ellipticine and some derivatives; however, these drugs do not break DNA in cultured L1210 cells. Moreover, several other biochemical constituents are able to bind these compounds in vitro as efficiently as DNA. In this paper the interactions between ellipticine and some of those derivatives and (a) ascitic phospholipids monolayers and (b) cytochrome P450 microsomal proteins are studied and discussed. Finally, the hypothesis that the nonhydroxylated ellipticine derivatives might be better cytotoxic agents because they can be oxidized and generate free radical species through a monovalent electron transfer process is presented. This hypothesis is supported by experiments carried out on the oxidation of 9-hydroxyellipticine and 2-methyl-9-hydroxyellipticine by peroxidases.","['Paoletti, C', 'Auclair, C', 'Lesca, P', 'Tocanne, J F', 'Malvy, C', 'Pinto, M']","['Paoletti C', 'Auclair C', 'Lesca P', 'Tocanne JF', 'Malvy C', 'Pinto M']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Membranes, Artificial)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '117VLW7484 (ellipticine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', '9G4A3ET6XG (9-hydroxyellipticine)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Ellipticines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Membrane Lipids/metabolism', 'Membranes, Artificial', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phospholipids/metabolism']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1981;65 Suppl 3:107-18.,,,46,,,,,,,,,,

Each of the melanoma cell lines examined showed tremendous heterogeneity with regard to antigen expression. A detailed study of the heterogeneity of the four antigens listed revealed that variation in cell size could, in part, account for the large differences in antigen expression observed. Cell surface density of HLA-A,B antigens, Ia-like antigens, and the 280K and 94K MAAs remained relatively constant over a wide range of cell sizes that were examined, with the exception that small melanoma cells showed a slightly lower mean surface density of MAA expression than did large cells. A novel method was used to detect the expression of the two MAAs as a function of the Colo 38 cell cycle using dual-laser beam flow cytometry. The results of these experiments show that both the 280K MAA and the 94K MAA are differentially expressed during various stages of the cell cycle, with each antigen being maximally detected during G2 + M.","['Burchiel, S W', 'Martin, J C', 'Imai, K', 'Ferrone, S', 'Warner, N L']","['Burchiel SW', 'Martin JC', 'Imai K', 'Ferrone S', 'Warner NL']",['eng'],"['AI 19189/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32609/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32619/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Melanoma-Specific Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HLA Antigens/*analysis', 'HLA-A Antigens', 'HLA-B Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Melanoma/*immunology', 'Melanoma-Specific Antigens', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis']",1982/10/01 00:00,1982/10/01 00:01,['1982/10/01 00:00'],"['1982/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Oct;42(10):4110-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These leukemogenic doses of radiation were associated with suppression of natural killer (NK) cell activity as assessed in vitro by cytotoxic activity of spleen cells or in vivo by the ability of irradiated mice to eliminate iv inoculated radiolabeled YAC-1 lymphoma cells. This suppressive effect of irradiation was profound and prolonged, being detectable for at least 7 weeks after the last dose of radiation. NK reactivity of irradiated C57BL/6 +/+ or C57BL/6 beige mice could be reconstituted by iv transfer of 10 X 10(6) bone marrow cells or 50 x 10(6) spleen cells from normal C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, transfer of bone marrow or spleen cells from beige donors did not change the NK reactivity of irradiated C57BL/6 +/+ or C57BL/6 bg/bg recipients. It was also shown that the irradiation protocol did not eliminate potentially reactive NK cells, because following interferon incubation (10(3) U/ml), the NK activity of spleen cells of irradiated mice was substantially increased. This study supports the hypothesis of an important role for NK cells in radiation-induced leukemogenesis and forms the basis for exploration of the needed, more direct data on the effects of reconstitution of NK activity on subsequent development of tumors.","['Gorelik, E', 'Herberman, R B']","['Gorelik E', 'Herberman RB']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*radiation effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Immunity, Cellular/radiation effects', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Species Specificity', 'Spleen/*transplantation', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1982 Jul;69(1):89-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study describes three monoclonal murine antibodies with variable specificity for hairy cells. Antibody 1 was highly specific for hairy cells and was not found to react with normal or leukemic cells in this limited study. It did not react with the cells of all patients. It also did not react with all of the hairy cells of some of the positive cases. Antibodies 2 and 3 reacted with virtually all hairy cells but not with normal peripheral blood cells. However, reactions were obtained with certain leukemic myelomonoblasts and some activated B cells. The most obvious use for these three antibodies is for diagnostic purposes. They should also be helpful reagents to investigate the origin of the leukemic hairy cell.

The activity was proportional to the amount of added extract and was sensitive to heat ant to proteinase K exposure. The initial velocity was hyperbolic with increasing amounts of substrate, and the Km for methyl groups was estimated to be between 1 and 1.5 microM. These results show that DNA demethylation catalyzed by extracts from cell nuclei can occur in vitro where no DNA synthesis is occurring and suggest that such a process might occur in vivo to alter DNA methylation during differentiation.","['Gjerset, R A', 'Martin, D W Jr']","['Gjerset RA', 'Martin DW Jr']",['eng'],"['AI17435/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AM20428/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.64 (Endopeptidase K)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytosine/metabolism', 'DNA, Bacterial/*metabolism', 'Endopeptidase K', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hot Temperature', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Micrococcus', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1982/08/10 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1982/08/10 00:00'],"['1982/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1982/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)34161-9 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1982 Aug 10;257(15):8581-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SAGA reduced the peripheral blast count in two patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and two with blastic CML; however, no patient achieved either complete or partial remission. Marked central nervous system toxic effects (encephalopathy and coma) were observed, limiting treatment in patients whose disease appeared responsive; this effect finally prompted early discontinuance of the trial. Other toxic effects observed included nausea, hyperglycemia, and respiratory alkalosis. Hypersensitivity reactions to the enzyme were not seen. Pharmacologic analyses showed that prolonged blood glutamine depletion was achieved only by daily enzyme administration; however, we noted the importance of performing amino acid analysis on blood which was deproteinized immediately following phlebotomy. Our results demonstrate excessive central nervous system toxicity when glutaminase-asparaginase is administered on a daily schedule. Because of this effect, we propose that future trials of similar enzymes be limited to short courses of enzyme therapy, possibly with the addition of antimetabolites or amino acid analogs, which could enhance the antitumor effect without increasing toxicity.","['Warrell, R P Jr', 'Arlin, Z A', 'Gee, T S', 'Chou, T C', 'Roberts, J', 'Young, C W']","['Warrell RP Jr', 'Arlin ZA', 'Gee TS', 'Chou TC', 'Roberts J', 'Young CW']",['eng'],"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-15860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (succinylated glutaminase-asparaginase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 3.5.1.2 (Glutaminase)']",IM,"['Acinetobacter/enzymology', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glutaminase/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy']",1982/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1982 Jul;66(7):1479-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The enzymatic and antigenic phenotypes expressed by these cells often correspond to the gene products of their normal precursors. We have used various immunocytochemical and enzymatic techniques to identify membrane, nuclear, and cytoplasmic markers associated with the prolactin-dependent Nb2 lymphoma cell line. The Nb2 cells, whether stationary or in log-phase growth, did not express any surface immunoglobulin. However, 100% of the Nb2 cells bound both a monoclonal antibody raised to rat thymocyte W3/25-HLK, which specifically binds an antigenic determinant on rat T-helper cells, and second monoclonal antibody OX8-HL, which identifies rat nonhelper T-cells. Transmission electron microscopy showed no evidence of phagocytic vacuoles, and activity of the lysosomal enzyme muramidase was also absent. There was no evidence of the DNA polymerase enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. alpha-Naphthyl acetate esterase activity was indicated in about 50% of the Nb2 cells by a faint particulate cytoplasmic staining similar to that found in thymocytes. Rosette formation with guinea pig erythrocytes, a property of mature rat thymocytes, was not observed with Nb2 cells. The data suggest that the Nb2 tumor may have arisen from a thymocyte at an intermediate stage of differentiation. The presence of Thy-like alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase pattern and the binding of both W3/25-HLK and OX8-HL support the thymic origin and relative immaturity of these lymphoid cells. It is becoming increasingly apparent that a significant proportion of lymphomas and leukemias also originate in undifferentiated thymic cels.","['Fleming, W H', 'Pettigrew, N M', 'Matusik, R J', 'Friesen, H G']","['Fleming WH', 'Pettigrew NM', 'Matusik RJ', 'Friesen HG']",['eng'],['HDO7843-09/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Hydrolases/analysis', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*physiopathology/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/physiopathology/ultrastructure', 'Rats', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology']",1982/08/01 00:00,1982/08/01 00:01,['1982/08/01 00:00'],"['1982/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Aug;42(8):3138-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the most helpful are a low platelet count, positive plasma protamine test, and fibrinogen and fibrin degradation product levels viewed in the context of the patient's underlying disease. The cornerstone of therapy is prompt treatment of the underlying disease and elimination of the trigger mechanism. Additional treatment must be individualized, and generalizations are difficult to make. However, if the patient has low hemostatic factors and is actively bleeding or requires an invasive procedure, then replacement with the appropriate hemostatic factors should be tried. Heparin is indicated in patients with purpura fulminans and venous thromboembolism, but there is little evidence that heparin reverses organ dysfunction associated with DIC. In addition, heparin is also probably indicated in patients with retained dead fetus and hypofibrinogenemia prior to induction of labor, excessive bleeding associated with a giant hemangioma, and neoplastic disease, particularly promyelocytic leukemia. Although the use of heparin in acute forms of DIC remains controversial, the majority of studies suggest that it is not helpful.

Despite a high fractional volume of leukocytes, bulk viscosity of blood is usually not increased because a decrement in the fractional volume of erythrocytes accompanies the increase in leukocytes. Nevertheless, the excessive numbers of leukocytes present two major problems: first, they can seriously affect flow in the circulation of the lung, brain, and less often, other organs by obstructing microchannels or by forming aggregates and white thrombi in small veins. Moreover, leukemic blasts may compete for oxygen in the microcirculation and they may be invasive, damaging vessel walls.

Two-year survival rates of 50% can be achieved in patients undergoing transplant during remission, in contrast to a 2-year survival of 15% in those undergoing transplant while still in marrow relapse. Recurrence of bone marrow leukemia relapse is a significant cause of marrow transplant failure. Overt or occult testicular relapse occurs in 10-15% of males with acute lymphocytic leukemia receiving or having completed standard therapy regimens for control of their disease and frequently leads to a subsequent bone marrow relapse. This paper describes a child with acute lymphocytic leukemia who received a successful marrow transplant following bone marrow relapse and developed testicular leukemia relapse approximately 20 months after transplant. The experience with this child suggests that bilateral testicular biopsies should be a mandatory part of the routine evaluation to screen for residual leukemia before bone marrow transplantation.","['Cairo, M', 'Weetman, R M', 'Baehner, R L']","['Cairo M', 'Weetman RM', 'Baehner RL']",['eng'],['R01 A1 10892-07/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,,IM,"['Biopsy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Testicular Neoplasms/pathology/*secondary']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1982 Spring;4(1):41-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The short chain fatty acids, butyric acid (BA), propionic acid (PA), valeric acid, and the polar organic solvents, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, and dimethylacetamide, all mediated significant inhibition of alloantigen-induced proliferation and generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in human primary and secondary mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) reactions. Hexamethylenebisacetemide, another potent inducer of differentiation in FL cells, also mediated significant suppression. Inhibition of MLC with polar organic compounds was accomplished at concentrations known to induce differentiation in FL cells and that are not cytotoxic to peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In distinct contrast, agents that are structurally related to BA, but that do not induce differentiation in FL cells, such as caproic acid, beta-OHBA, gamma-amino BA, and isobutyric acid, did not exhibit immunosuppressive properties. Pokeweed mitogen-driven polyclonal B cell activation was also suppressed by agents that induce erythroid differentiation in FL cells. In addition to potent in vitro immunosuppressive properties, supplementation of drinking water with BA or PA resulted in prolongation of full-thickness skin grafts in DBA/2 (H-2d) to C57BL/6 (H-2b) donor-recipient combinations.

When assayed for focus formation by DNA transfection on NIH/3T3 cells, this clone was biologically inactive, presumably due to the absence of a long terminal repeat sequence. Therefore, a long terminal repeat was inserted into the clone by in vitro recombination, after which the most gene was able to transform NIH/3T3 cells efficiently. The nucleotide sequence encompassing the transforming region of this clone was determined. A single long open reading frame was observed, which potentially encodes a polypeptide of 41,000 daltons. This open reading frame initiates with the first five amino acids of the murine leukemia virus env gene, after which it enters the mos sequence, where it terminates. The nucleotide sequence described in this paper was compared with other sequences of mos in an effort to resolve discrepancies in the position of the long open reading frame. Although Moloney murine sarcoma virus retains the 3' splicing site of the murine leukemia virus env gene, a mos-specific mRNA which corresponds structurally to the murine leukemia virus env mRNA was not identified. The sequence described here revealed a single nucleotide change in the proposed env gene 3' splicing site which was retained in Moloney murine sarcoma virus. This deviation from the consensus 3' splicing sequence may underlie the observed absence of mos expression via the env gene splicing pathway.","['Donoghue, D J']",['Donoghue DJ'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/microbiology']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.42.2.538-546.1982 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1982 May;42(2):538-46. doi: 10.1128/JVI.42.2.538-546.1982.,PMC256880,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/J02265'],,,

The efficiency of these crude, unconcentrated supernatants was documented in studies in which 70 human long-term (greater than 100 days) IL-2-dependent T cell lines were established from 50 different donors. These included lines initiated from the peripheral blood of healthy subjects (N = 54), blood of children with active acute lymphoblastic leukemia (N = 6) and the thymus of children undergoing surgery to correct congenital heart defects (N = 10). The underlying concept used in constructing this method emphasizes the requirement of the monocyte-derived macrophage and its Interleukin-1 (IL-1) product to mediate IL-2 production by activated T cells. The most salient feature of this technique is the utilization of buffy coat leukocytes that had been pooled from several blood donors and sustained in spinner cultures for several days prior to polyclonal activation with phytohemagglutinin and pooled B cells of established human lymphoblastoid lines.","['Pauly, J L', 'Russell, C W', 'Planinsek, J A', 'Minowada, J']","['Pauly JL', 'Russell CW', 'Planinsek JA', 'Minowada J']",['eng'],"['CA-07918/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-14413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29635/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoplasma/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(82)90223-X [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(82)90223-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1982;50(2):173-86. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(82)90223-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In most cases of ALL ( greater than 95%) the blast cells express terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), a nuclear enzyme. We have therefore standardized the immuno-fluorescence and -peroxidase techniques (using anti-Tdt antibodies) for identifying TdT cells in the normal thymus, as well as in samples of testis with heavy leukaemic infiltrates (positive controls). TdT cells can be identified in formalin (but not in Bouin's or Carnoy's) fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, and the preservation of morphological details is excellent. The method is nevertheless difficult to standardize and also requires the use of deoxyribonuclease (DNase) for the digestion of sections. However, in frozen tissue sections, stronger staining of TdT cells was found, even without DNase treatment. Good morphology was preserved when cut sections were fixed immediately in the cryostat. In the second part of the study 15 samples from treated boys were analysed to see whether the technique is suitable to identify residual minimal leukaemic infiltrates. In 5 patients scanty disseminated TdT cells were detected, and in 2 patients small clumps of TdT cells were seen. The results indicate that the immunohistological identification of TdT ALL blasts may be the method of choice.","['Thomas, J A', 'Janossy, G', 'Eden, O B', 'Bollum, F J']","['Thomas JA', 'Janossy G', 'Eden OB', 'Bollum FJ']",['eng'],['CA 23262/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*metabolism', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*enzymology/pathology', 'Testis/pathology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1982.112 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1982 May;45(5):709-17. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1982.112.,PMC2011022,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied liver status before and after bone marrow transplantation in 43 consecutive patients and have related this to survival and factors that are recognised to cause liver injury. Minor abnormalities of liver tests occurred in 21% of patients before grafting but this did not influence survival or the development of liver disease after transplantation. During the first 50 days after grafting, 83% of patients had abnormal liver tests which were more severe in patients who subsequently died. Alanine transaminase was significantly higher in non-survivors and appeared to predict survival early after transplantation. Only non-survivors developed clinical signs of liver disease. Severe liver disease was always associated with graft versus host disease and atypia of the small bile ducts was the most useful histological marker of hepatic involvement with this disease. Two of the patients with hepatic graft versus host disease also has hepatic veno-occlusive disease and three fatalities had opportunistic infection of the liver, although, in the latter, death was not due primarily to liver dysfunction. Previous hepatitis and androgen therapy could not be implicated as important causes of hepatic damage but chemotherapy for acute leukaemia and conditioning regimens for bone marrow transplantation appear to be the most important factors in the development of hepatic veno-occlusive disease.","['Farthing, M J', 'Clark, M L', 'Sloane, J P', 'Powles, R L', 'McElwain, T J']","['Farthing MJ', 'Clark ML', 'Sloane JP', 'Powles RL', 'McElwain TJ']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Gut,Gut,2985108R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Humans', 'Liver/pathology/physiopathology', 'Liver Diseases/*etiology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications/etiology', 'Prognosis']",1982/06/01 00:00,1982/06/01 00:01,['1982/06/01 00:00'],"['1982/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/gut.23.6.465 [doi]'],ppublish,Gut. 1982 Jun;23(6):465-74. doi: 10.1136/gut.23.6.465.,PMC1419702,,,,,,,,,,,,

In two phase III trials of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B, 385 previously untreated patients with stage III or IV Hodgkin's disease received multidrug chemotherapy. All patients received a combination of either mechlorethamine or a nitrosourea, as well as a vinca alkaloid, procarbazine, and prednisone. Two hundred and five patients were less than 40 years of age, 107 were 40-59 years, and 73 were greater than or equal to 60 years. The overall response rates in these three age groups were 70%, 66%, and 40%, respectively. Age at the time of diagnosis was the predominant factor affecting response, and the response rate was not significantly higher in those older patients who received full doses of chemotherapy. Age was also associated with an increased frequency of serious leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The group of patients greater than or equal to 60 years of age experienced the shortest median time to recurrence, 33 months. The intermediate age group also had a shorter time to recurrence (median, 44 months) than patients less than 40 years (median not yet reached). The low complete response rate and the short duration of response in the patients greater than or equal to 60 years of age resulted in a median survival time of 18 months.

To determine if these two nucleosides have similar modes of action, comparisons were made of their effects and those of their triphosphates on enzymes known to be inhibited by ara-A or 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine 5'-triphosphate. 9-beta-D-Arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine 5'-triphosphate was more effective than 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine 5'-triphosphate in inhibiting the reduction of adenosine 5'-diphosphate and cytidine 5'-diphosphate by ribonucleotide reductase from HEp-2 cells or L1210 cells.

Four of five patients with no detectable FTS activity developed chronic GVHD, while one of four with some FTS activity did. Further patient numbers are needed to confirm or reject this hypothesis. We further postulated that chronic GVHD, whatever its cause, involves thymic epithelium as a target organ. When tested 11 mo or more posttransplant, patients with chronic GVHD had lower absolute FTS levels (p less than 0.02) and lower age-corrected levels (p = 0.05) than patients without chronic GHVD. Low values in chronic GVHD were associated with the disease itself and not its therapy.

There is only indirect evidence indicating that the increased deposition of collagen in bone marrow matrix is a secondary phenomenon. A liquid culture system for cloning and growing bone marrow fibroblasts has permitted us to approach more directly the understanding of the pathogenesis of myelofibrosis by comparing the biophysical, growth, and functional characteristics of fibroblasts from normals, MPD patients without MF, and those with MF. In patients with MF, marrow fibroblast colony (CFU-F) formation could not be studied; fibroblasts were grown from marrow explants. CFU-E from normals and MPD patients exhibited similar cell density distribution and similar cell sedimentation rates. These similarities contrasted sharply with the differences seen when the erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors were studied by the same methods. There was a marked light density shift and a rapidly sedimenting shift of MPD hematopoietic colony-forming cells. Marrow fibroblasts from MPD patients with and without MF displayed the same in vitro growth characteristics as fibroblasts from normals. Both types of fibroblasts exhibited anchorage and serum dependence, and contact inhibition of growth. Marrow fibroblasts were also characterized for the presence and distribution of fibronectin and collagen types by immunofluorescent staining using monospecific antibodies. Extracellular matrix, membrane-, and cytoplasm-associated fibronectin, type I, type III, and type V collagen showed a similar staining pattern in both normal and myelofibrotic marrow fibroblasts. Plasminogen-dependent fibrinolytic activity elicited from normal and myelofibrotic marrow fibroblasts were equivalent. Chromosomal analysis of hematopoietic cells and marrow fibroblasts from Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelocytic leukemia patients with and without MF showed that the Philadelphia chromosome was present only in hematopoietic cells. The results of these studies taken together demonstrate that bone marrow collagen-producing cells from MPD patients with and without MF behave in vitro as do those from normals. These findings support the hypothesis that that the marrow fibrosis observed in patients with MPD results from a reactive process rather than from a primary disorder affecting the marrow collagen-producing cells.","['Castro-Malaspina, H', 'Gay, R E', 'Jhanwar, S C', 'Hamilton, J A', 'Chiarieri, D R', 'Meyers, P A', 'Gay, S', 'Moore, M A']","['Castro-Malaspina H', 'Gay RE', 'Jhanwar SC', 'Hamilton JA', 'Chiarieri DR', 'Meyers PA', 'Gay S', 'Moore MA']",['eng'],"['CA-17353/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F05-TW-02524/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*physiopathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Collagen/metabolism', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*physiopathology', 'Plasminogen Activators/metabolism']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74364-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1982 May;59(5):1046-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether BA-1 also reacts with hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC), we studied the effect of removal of BA-1+ cells from human bone marrow on the proliferation in vitro of the trilineage precursor cell CFU-GEMM, and on the committed progenitor cells of granulopoiesis (CFU-C) and erythropoiesis (BFU-E/CFU-E). Complement-mediated cytotoxicity using BA-1 at concentrations far beyond those required to lyse BA-1+ bone marrow cells and ALL cells did not result in inhibition of colony formation in any of the assays. A rosette separation method, using ox red blood cells coated with BA-1, resulted in enrichment of HPC in the BA-1-depleted interface, whereas very few HPC were found in the BA-1-enriched pellet. Both methods indicate that BA-1 does not bind to HPC, although binding of the antibody to the lymphohematopoietic stem cell cannot be excluded yet. The high cytotoxic capacity of the IgM antibody BA-1, and the lack of reactivity with HPC, make the antibody particularly suitable for use in autologous bone marrow transplantation for patients with ALL.","['Jansen, J', 'Ash, R C', 'Zanjani, E D', 'LeBien, T W', 'Kersey, J H']","['Jansen J', 'Ash RC', 'Zanjani ED', 'LeBien TW', 'Kersey JH']",['eng'],"['P01CA21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CB84261/CB/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA25097/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*metabolism', '*Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Rosette Formation']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74362-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1982 May;59(5):1029-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood cells were grown in plasma clot for 13 d. MKs were subsequently identified by immunofluorescent techniques using two monoclonal antiplatelet antibodies (AN51 and J15). The maturation process was studied by ultrastructural methods. A marked increase in the number of circulating CFU-MK was observed in all the 10 cases studied prior to chemotherapy (70-fold increase per ml of blood). No significant modification in the regulation of MK colony formation as compared to that of normal subjects was observed. The predominant abnormality in maturation in culture was the occurrence of many hypoploid MKs (microMKs). However, the cytoplasmic maturation of the MKs was identical to that of normal subjects with occasional platelet shedding. Since microMKs predominated in some patients, scoring of MK colonies in CML necessitated immunofluorescent labelling to permit identification of MKs. During the blast crisis, MK colony formation occurred in four out of five patients with an extremely high plating efficiency in the case of promegakaryoblastic transformation. In contrast, MK colonies could not be grown from blood samples of patients with acute leukaemia, including two cases of promegakaryoblastic leukaemia. Maturation of MKs in blast crisis was identical to that of the chronic phase. Furthermore, after short periods of culture in liquid medium, circulating promegakaryoblasts from patients in blast crisis matured with the consequent production of alpha-granules and demarcation membranes. These results confirm the contention that CML represents a pluripotent stem-cell disease, involving the MK lineage, and suggest that the block in maturation during the acute phase can be overcome in vitro.","['Vainchenker, W', 'Guichard, J', 'Deschamps, J F', 'Bouguet, J', 'Titeux, M', 'Chapman, J', 'McMichael, A J', 'Breton-Gorius, J']","['Vainchenker W', 'Guichard J', 'Deschamps JF', 'Bouguet J', 'Titeux M', 'Chapman J', 'McMichael AJ', 'Breton-Gorius J']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/ultrastructure', 'Megakaryocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1982.tb07298.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1982 May;51(1):131-46. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1982.tb07298.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marked susceptibility of CNL cells to cytotoxic activity of cold agglutinins, SLE sera, and CSFs was observed and may signify qualitative and/or quantitative differences in the membrane structure of CNL neutrophils, as compared to normal cells.","['Dotten, D A', 'Pruzanski, W', 'Wong, D']","['Dotten DA', 'Pruzanski W', 'Wong D']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Blood Bactericidal Activity', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Glucuronidase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Phagocytosis', 'Skin Window Technique']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830120208 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1982 Apr;12(2):157-65. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830120208.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison of immunofluorescence and enzymatic assays.,420-3,"Terminal transferase (TdT) activity and antigen have been measured in 267 specimens of human bone marrow and peripheral blood by using a biochemical assay for enzymatic activity and an immunofluorescence test for antigen. Oligo p(dA)50 and dGTP were used as reagents in the biochemical assay and either rabbit anti-calf TdT or rabbit anti-human TdT was used as the primary antibody for immunofluorescence. Because both false-positive and false-negative detection of TdT antigen occurs, the biochemical assay of TdT activity is considered the standard against which immunofluorescence assays must be measured. If specimens of cells contained TdT activity, then the immunofluorescence detected antigen in 91% of cases (rabbit anti-calf TdT) and 95% of cases (rabbit anti-human TdT). When no TdT activity was detected, the immunofluorescence test was positive in 7.8% of cases (rabbit anti-calf TdT) and 5.2% of cases (rabbit anti-human TdT). When air-dried slices were shipped by air mail to a distant location before being stained for immunofluorescence, TdT antigen was detected in only 33% of matched pair cases which contained TdT activity. From this study, the authors conclude that with current methodology, immunofluorescence tests for TdT antigen must be carried out on slides prepared in the testing laboratory and that such tests are reliable in more than 90% of cases. However, because a small percentage of results are false positives and false negatives, the authors suggest that if a patient's clinical response is not consistent with the immunofluorescence TdT result, an enzymatic assay for TdT activity be carried out.","['Cibull, M L', 'Coleman, M S', 'Nelson, O', 'Hutton, J J', 'Gordon, D', 'Bollum, F J']","['Cibull ML', 'Coleman MS', 'Nelson O', 'Hutton JJ', 'Gordon D', 'Bollum FJ']",['eng'],"['CA 26391/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CM67038/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD12799/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Deoxyguanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (oligodeoxyadenylic acid)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '8C2O37Y44Q (deoxyguanosine triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Antigens/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*analysis/blood/immunology', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*analysis', 'Deoxyguanine Nucleotides', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Specimen Handling', 'Tritium']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/77.4.420 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1982 Apr;77(4):420-3. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/77.4.420.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell wall fraction (CWF) and the protoplast membrane fraction (PMF) were slightly effective in retarding the growth of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma in outbred ddY mice when either fraction was used in combination with 5-FU. The cytoplasmic particle fraction (CPF) and the cytoplasmic soluble fraction (CSF), however, were not effective. In the B6D2F1 mice-L 1210 leukemia system, none of the subcellular fractions were beneficial even when combined with 5-FU. Further, the antitumor effect of OK-432 was completely abolished by disruption of the preparation, indicating that antitumor activity of OK-432 may depend on the structural integrity of the cocci in the preparation. Despite the general lack of anti-tumor activity in the mouse systems, the subcellular fractions, including those of OK-432, inhibited the growth of Yoshida sarcoma cells in culture and the uptake of [2H]-UR and [3H]-TdR by L 1210 cells in vitro. The immunopotentiating activities of these fractions, however, were demonstrated to be markedly diminished as compared with those of OK-432 and heated Su-cocci (60 degrees C, 30 min). The present study, therefore, shows that the decreased antitumor activity of the subcellular fractions closely correlate to the decrease of their immunopotentiating activities.","['Ryoyama, K', 'Natsuume-Sakai, S', 'Hirota, H', 'Koshimura, S']","['Ryoyama K', 'Natsuume-Sakai S', 'Hirota H', 'Koshimura S']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Exp Med,The Japanese journal of experimental medicine,9800765,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '39325-01-4 (Picibanil)']",IM,"['*Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Products/*pharmacology', 'Complement C3/analysis', 'Female', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Immunotherapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/therapy', 'Picibanil/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Streptococcus pyogenes/*immunology', 'Subcellular Fractions/immunology']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Exp Med. 1981 Dec;51(6):335-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Part II. Diseases of the red pulp.,681-94,"The diseases which chiefly pertain to the differential diagnosis of splenic lymphomas and leukemias primarily involving the red pulp have been separated into five histologic categories. These include the various forms of congestion, infections, benign and malignant histiocytic proliferations, leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders, and the rare nonhematopoietic tumors of the spleen. Many diseases with major involvement of the red pulp present as hypersplenism of unknown etiology. Accurate diagnosis is particularly dependent on an awareness of the specific histologic manifestations of malignant histiocytosis and the different leukemias in contrast to benign disorders, such as infectious mononucleosis which may simulate malignancy in the splenic red pulp. For each histologic category, therefore, the relevant morphologic features are reviewed, pathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical manifestations correlated, and criteria for differential diagnosis emphasized.","['Burke, J S']",['Burke JS'],['eng'],['CA-05838-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,,IM,"['Bacterial Infections/pathology', 'Cysts/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hamartoma/pathology', 'Hemangioma/pathology', 'Hemangiosarcoma/pathology', 'Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/pathology', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Splenomegaly/pathology']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1981 Oct;5(7):681-94.,,,44,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-one of 78 patients (40 per cent) were infected with one or more of the following enteric pathogens during the study: adenovirus (12 infections), rotavirus (nine), coxsackievirus (four), or Clostridium difficile (12). Several patients were infected with more than one pathogen. Infection correlated with the occurrence of diarrhea and abdominal cramps. The mortality rate among the infected patients was 55 per cent--significantly higher than the rate (13 per cent) among the noninfected patients (P less than 0.001). This study indicates that enteric pathogens that often cause mild diarrhea in normal populations can cause serious infections in marrow-transplant recipients. Measures aimed at preventing or treating such infections might reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with marrow transplantation.","['Yolken, R H', 'Bishop, C A', 'Townsend, T R', 'Bolyard, E A', 'Bartlett, J', 'Santos, G W', 'Saral, R']","['Yolken RH', 'Bishop CA', 'Townsend TR', 'Bolyard EA', 'Bartlett J', 'Santos GW', 'Saral R']",['eng'],"['CA 06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15396-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 AI92616/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clostridium Infections/etiology', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Female', 'Gastroenteritis/*etiology/microbiology', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Humans', 'Infections/*etiology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sepsis/etiology', 'Virus Diseases/etiology']",1982/04/29 00:00,1982/04/29 00:01,['1982/04/29 00:00'],"['1982/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1982 Apr 29;306(17):1010-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Structure--activity relationships for 9-anilinoacridines.,411-23,"A series of 9-anilinoacridine derivatives has been compared in terms of DNA binding, ability to inhibit the growth of L1210 murine leukaemia cells in vitro, and ability to induce the formation of respiration-deficient (petite) mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The acridine ring in the derivatives was either unsubstituted, or substituted with amino groups at the 3 and/or 6 positions. The 9-anilino group was para-substituted with a variety of substituents. 3-Aminoacridine, 3,6-diaminoacridine (proflavine) and ethidium were included for comparison. The results show that: (i) at least one acridinyl amino group is necessary for conferring petite inducing activity in the yeast system; (ii) for 3-amino-9-anilinoacridine congeners, small anilino substituents provide compounds which resemble proflavine in their ability to produce petite mutants, whereas large substituents abolish activity; (iii) the 3,6-diamino-substituted anilinoacridines resemble ethidium rather than proflavine in being highly efficient inducers of petites; (iv) the requirements for optimal activity in L1210 leukaemia cell cultures are different to those for petite formation in yeast. It is concluded that the size of the anilino substituent, as well as its contribution to DNA binding, is critical in conferring biological activity in each system.","['Ferguson, L R', 'Baguley, B C']","['Ferguson LR', 'Baguley BC']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mutagens)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '3340-22-5 (9-anilinoacridine)']",IM,"['Aminoacridines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Amsacrine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', '*Mutagens', '*Mutation', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/drug effects/*genetics', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-1218(81)90063-X [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1218(81)90063-x [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1981 Dec;90(4):411-23. doi: 10.1016/0165-1218(81)90063-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies of complex formation were carried out by comparison of difference spectra of the compounds in the presence of native double-stranded DNA and separated-strand DNA. Base specificity of the interaction between DNA and the compounds was demonstrated for both series, particularly for the anthraquinones, for the guanine-cytosine base pair. Comparison of the difference spectra of the compounds in the presence of DNA with varied base-pair ratios showed a strong preference of the anthraquinones for the guanine-cytosine base pair, but the quinolinium compounds showed no preference. The linear-binding isotherm for the quinolinium compounds indicated one type of binding site, while two types of binding sites were apparent for the anthraquinones. Since only one anthraquinone was active in leukemia tests, factors other than DNA binding must account for the activity of the antileukemic derivative.","['Foye, W O', 'Vajragupta, O', 'Sengupta, S K']","['Foye WO', 'Vajragupta O', 'Sengupta SK']",['eng'],['CA 26281/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharm Sci,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2985195R,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Quinolinium Compounds)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthraquinones/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dialysis', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Quinolinium Compounds/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Temperature', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3549(15)44039-0 [pii]', '10.1002/jps.2600710228 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharm Sci. 1982 Feb;71(2):253-7. doi: 10.1002/jps.2600710228.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adriamycin has been used in conjunction with bone marrow transplantation, and has also been shown to interact with radiation. This experiment was designed to study the effects of pre-administration of adriamycin on the radiation tolerance of the lung and esophagus. Since total body radiation is usually administered at low dose rates in order to spare the gastrointestinal tract preferentially as compared to the bone marrow, we investigated whether such a dose rate effect was present for the lung and if so, whether this pulmonary and esophageal dose rate effect would be ameliorated by pre-treatment with adriamycin. Mice were irradiated at 5 rad; 15 rad or 70 rad per minute to the upper body, 24 hours or 7 days after adriamycin. Oral esophageal death occurred within one month; thus deaths within 30 days were ascribed to this mechanism. In comparison, deaths because of pulmonary toxicity occurred later. Those between 30 and 160 days were ascribed to this mechanism. In the absence of adriamycin, a dose rate effect was found for the lung and confirmed for the upper gastrointestinal tract. The dose of radiation necessary to give pulmonary and gastrointestinal toxicity was markedly reduced when adriamycin was administered 24 hours before radiation. If seven days were allowed between adriamycin and radiation there was still an effect seen only at the high dose rate for the esophagus while for the lung at the high dose rate and for both systems at low dose rate no significant drug effects were noted. The dose rate effect is still seen after the drug, but it is reduced. These studies indicate that adriamycin given shortly before can significantly increase the oral esophageal and pulmonary toxicity of radiation and can practically abrogate the sparing effect of dose rate. This must be considered when clinically using total body radiation and adriamycin in preparation for bone marrow transplantation.","['Sherman, D M', 'Carabell, S C', 'Belli, J A', 'Hellman, S']","['Sherman DM', 'Carabell SC', 'Belli JA', 'Hellman S']",['eng'],['GA 12662/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Esophagus/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Lung/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(82)90383-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(82)90383-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1982 Jan;8(1):45-51. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(82)90383-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different subtypes of T cells were shown to be involved in different types of lymphoma. Thymomas were TdT-positive and grew as subcutaneous solid tumors at the site of inoculation. Spleen cells from mice with generalized lymphoma were of two types. In the majority of cases the lymphomas consisted of 20 alpha SDH-positive cells that homed to spleen and lymph nodes upon transplantation. In a few cases the cells of enlarged spleens were TdT-positive and, like the TdT-positive thymomas, could be transplanted as subcutaneous tumors.

Since frequent marrow involvement in neuroblastoma restricts the exploitation of stored autologous bone marrow for rescue postchemotherapy, the potential for tumor-specific in vitro specificity of 6-OHDA was studied. The cytotoxic effect of 6-OHDA on 12 human neuroblastoma cell lines was compared to the effect on nonneuroblastoma cell lines. Most neuroblastoma cell lines were very sensitive to 6-OHDA (average concentration killing 50% of cells, 22 microgram/ml; range, 2.8 to 65.4). Cells derived from catecholamine-producing tumors were more sensitive to 6-OHDA than were those from non-catecholamine producers. By contrast, human fibroblasts, lymphoblastoid cell lines, and normal marrow were relatively insensitive to 6-OHDA; the concentration needed to kill 50% of cells for most of these cells exceeded 100 microgram/ml. Leukemia cell lines and a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line were intermediate in sensitivity. Ascorbate and 6-OHDA were synergistic in toxicity for human neuroblastoma cells. Thus, in vitro addition of 6-OHDA and ascorbate was rapidly lethal for human neuroblastoma cells at concentrations which were minimally toxic for hematopoietic cells. This differential toxicity provides a possible means for selective destruction of neuroblastoma cells in bone marrow harvested for autologous transplantation.","['Reynolds, C P', 'Reynolds, D A', 'Frenkel, E P', 'Smith, R G']","['Reynolds CP', 'Reynolds DA', 'Frenkel EP', 'Smith RG']",['eng'],"['CA18132/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Catecholamines)', '0 (Hydroxydopamines)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Catecholamines/urine', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Hydroxydopamines/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Apr;42(4):1331-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hemoglobin accumulation is enhanced by exposure of the cells to 0.05 mM hemin. We have examined K562 cells before and after exposure to hemin to determine whether expression of these erythroid proteins was shared by all cells or confined to specific subpopulations. Globin gene expression was examined by quantitation of globin mRNA sequences, using a 3H-globin cDNA molecular hybridization probe. Constitutive cells produced globin mRNA, the content of which was increased 3-4-fold by hemin. Cell-to-cell distribution of globin mRNA was determined by in situ hybridization of 3H-globin cDNA to constitutive and hemin-treated K562 cells. Virtually all cells in the culture exhibited grain counts above background, indicating globin gene expression by all cells, rather than a confined subpopulation. Virtually all hemin-treated cells had 3-5-fold higher grain counts, indicating uniformly increased globin gene expression. The glycophorin content of K562 cells was estimated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of cells labeled with fluorescein-labeled antiglycophorin antiserum. The vast majority of constitutive cells contained glycophorin, but exhibited to apparent increase in glycophorin accumulation after hemin exposure. Thus, glycophorin and globin genes exhibited differential responses to hemin. These differences could reflect normal differences in the patterns of specialized gene expression in stem cells. Alternatively, different aberrations of gene expression could be occurring in response to the determinants of the neoplastic properties of K562.","['Tonkonow, B L', 'Hoffman, R', 'Burger, D', 'Elder, J T', 'Mazur, E M', 'Murnane, M J', 'Benz, E J Jr']","['Tonkonow BL', 'Hoffman R', 'Burger D', 'Elder JT', 'Mazur EM', 'Murnane MJ', 'Benz EJ Jr']",['eng'],"['AM00638/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22697/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL24385/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Glycophorins/*genetics/immunology', 'Heme/*analogs & derivatives', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/analysis/blood/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Messenger/blood/genetics', 'Rabbits', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*genetics']",1982/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74411-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1982 Apr;59(4):738-46.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The theory of alien-driven diversity suggests that the ability to effectively recognize pathogens in the form of ""altered-self"" derives from prior exposure to antigens cross-reactive with ""altered-self"" during development. Furthermore, these cross-reactive antigens are alloantigens that are expressed on autologous cells during somatic development. These somatically generated alloantigens could be the result of the same genetic alterations that produced the polymorphism of these antigens within the species. Second, the theory of alien-selected escape suggests that a tumorigenic pathogen selects a cell bearing an alien H* antigen so that the alien-infected cell is recognized as self rather than altered-self by the tumor host. We than summarized data from mouse and man consistent with these theories and with the concept that clinically evident tumors have escaped the host's immune system. Finally, we have discussed potential directions for devising immunotherapy with allogeneic cells that might circumvent the apparent unresponsiveness of the patient's immune system to his own tumor.","['Sondel, P M', 'Hank, J A']","['Sondel PM', 'Hank JA']",['eng'],['NCI P30-CA-14520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplant Proc,Transplantation proceedings,0243532,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cross Reactions', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'HLA Antigens/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/prevention & control', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Transplant Proc. 1981 Dec;13(4):1915-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a historical control series of 18 patients in whom BMT was performed after all chemotherapeutic resources had been exhausted, there is only 1 long-term survivor (5.5%), 8 patients died from GvH reaction, 6 from interstitial pneumonia and 3 from recurrent leukemia. Since 1979 an attempt has been made to transplant patients under optimal conditions (1st complete remission) and cyclosporin-A (CyA) has been used for prophylaxis of GvH reaction instead of MTX. 11 patients were transplanted according to our original proposal (AML and ALL in first remission, CML in chronic phase): 10 have survived without evidence of leukemia (91%), 1 AML died in relapse. 10 patients were grafted in second or later remissions or early relapse: 5 have leukemia-free survival (50%), 1 is living with a relapse. In this group 3 deaths were due to recurrent leukemia and 1 to CMV-infection. In our experience BMT under optimal circumstances does not involve a risk of early mortality and the chances of recurrent leukemia are reduced. Severe or chronic GvH reaction is not seen under CyA. BMT is the treatment of choice for patients with histocompatible sibling donors.","['Speck, B', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Nissen, C', 'Osterwalder, B', 'Muller, M', 'Luthy, A', 'Signer, E', 'Burri, H P', 'Jeannet, M']","['Speck B', 'Gratwohl A', 'Nissen C', 'Osterwalder B', 'Muller M', 'Luthy A', 'Signer E', 'Burri HP', 'Jeannet M']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,0404401,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclosporins/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/surgery', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis']",1981/12/12 00:00,1981/12/12 00:01,['1981/12/12 00:00'],"['1981/12/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/12 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/12 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Schweiz Med Wochenschr. 1981 Dec 12;111(50):1975-7.,,Neue Entwicklung in der klinischen Knochenmarktransplantation bei Leukamie.,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, IT seems to immunize against allogeneic ANLL cells, but there is no cross-immunity to autologous ones. Moreover, patients immunized against their ANLL cells have no better prognosis than patients not having lymphocytes reacting to their ANLL cells. It has also been suggested that IT causes nonspecific immunostimulation, but IT patient's lymphocytes actually react less than those of patients not given IT. The current hypothesis is macrophage activation: Lymphocyte suppression in IT could be explained by suppressor macrophages. Colony-stimulating activity, produced by bone marrow macrophages, decreases during remission in patients not given IT, but not in IT patients. Numerically, blood cells from patients given IT form more colonies than those from patients not given IT. Three of eight patients given IT had more colonies than the upper normal limit.","['Reizenstein, P', 'Andersson, B', 'Beran, M']","['Reizenstein P', 'Andersson B', 'Beran M']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Recent Results Cancer Res,Recent results in cancer research.

The techniques include the preparation of peripheral blood for study as both buffy coat and cell suspension specimens and the preparation of bone marrow spicules. Ultrastructural methods for the demonstration of glycogen and peroxidase are detailed. The study of such material includes light microscopic study of plastic-embedded, alkaline-Giemsa-stained one micron sections as well as ultrastructural studies. All hematological cases submitted for ultrastructural analysis in a two-year period were reviewed and are presented here. The identification of individual mature cells was relatively simple using light microscopy. Populations of blasts could also easily be recognized. Further differentiation of blasts, primarily lymphoblasts or myeloblasts, was done using ultrastructural cytochemistry where needed. These techniques can easily be done in electron microscopy units concerned with diagnostic work. We submit that pathologists and hematologists should have access to the diagnostic tools described here in order to manage patients with acute leukemia.","['Dvorak, A M', 'Monahan, R A', 'Dickersin, G R']","['Dvorak AM', 'Monahan RA', 'Dickersin GR']",['eng'],['CA-19141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pathol Annu,Pathology annual,0050610,['EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)'],IM,"['Cytological Techniques', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/diagnosis/*ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/diagnosis/*ultrastructure', 'Leukocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', '*Peroxidases']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pathol Annu. 1981;16 Pt 1:101-37.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Important observations regarding red cell shape and deformities are referred to and contributions in the definition and classification erythrocyte disorders are stressed. In this field there is no doubt that SEM has contributed much to the three-dimensional visualization of RBC disorders. As far as leucocyte pathology is concerned the situation is less clear. SEM has contributed much to current knowledge and understanding of the surface properties of white blood cells. Normal leucocytes have different surface features and can be distinguished under the SEM. However, some overlap does occur, making individual distinction on the basis of surface architecture alone extremely difficult. The difficulties in this regard are discussed in this review and factors influencing the variability of surface microprojections are reviewed briefly. Leukaemic cells of different origins may also be distinguished under the SEM. However, while ""hairy' cells have typical surface features and non-lymphoid leukaemic cells, in particular monocytes, are readily distinguished from lymphoid leukaemic cells, there is much overlap of surface topography. Undifferentiated cells and early myeloblasts and lymphoblasts have similar surface features and cannot be distinguished under the SEM. While SEM adds a valuable third dimension to morphology and ultrastructure, it cannot be used alone in the definition of difficult cases of acute leukaemia.","['Polliack, A']",['Polliack A'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Microsc,Journal of microscopy,0204522,,IM,"['Blood Platelets/ultrastructure', 'Erythrocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Hematologic Diseases/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Leukocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Macrophages/ultrastructure', '*Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Monocytes/ultrastructure']",1981/08/01 00:00,1981/08/01 00:01,['1981/08/01 00:00'],"['1981/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2818.1981.tb01293.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Microsc. 1981 Aug;123(Pt 2):177-87. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2818.1981.tb01293.x.,,,66,,,,,,,,,,

TPA-treated cells also underwent a concomitant decrease in the expression of TdT when analyzed enzymatically or by immunofluorescence. Analysis of TPA-treated cells with monoclonal antibodies BA-1 (detecting a B cell-associated antigen), 7.2 (detecting a monomorphic HLA-DR antigen), or OKT11 (detecting a structure closely associated with the E receptor) showed no change compared to controls. In addition there was no detectable cytoplasmic immunoglobulin in control or TPA-treated cells. These results show clearly that TPA is capable of inducing phenotypic changes in REH cells.

The present study, in which Smlg and Cylg determinations were performed simultaneously using leukemia B cells from 20 patients with CLL, demonstrates that Cylg staining was detectable in each CLL cell population examined and that the intensity of cytoplasmic immunofluorescent staining in each instance was moderate to strong. Both Smlg and Cylg light chain determinations indicated monoclonality in all 20 cases. The heavy chain class of Smlg and Cylg in each CLL cell population was not uniformly comparable, however. The majority (15 cases) of CLL B cells contained mu heavy chain Cylg and mu and delta heavy chain Cylg was demonstrated in the remaining 6 cases. In contrast, the Smlg phenotypes appeared heterogeneous with both gamma and alpha chain determinants found associated with mu or mu and delta chains on the same leukemia cell populations. This apparent polyclonal Smlg staining pattern was most likely due to nonspecific adsorption of the patient's own serum Ig by Fc receptors on CLL B cells.

Part I. Diseases of the white pulp.,551-63,"In order to facilitate diagnostic accuracy in the pathologic examination of the spleen, the differential diagnosis of the various splenic lymphomas and leukemias are divided into those diseases which primarily affect the white or red pulp. Enlargement of the splenic white pulp is due to either lymphoid hyperplasia, with or without the formation of germinal centers, or lymphomas and other lymphoproliferative disorders including chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Differentiation depends on recognition of germinal centers and the polymorphous nature of the lymphoid proliferation in reactive conditions, in comparison to the general monomorphous type of white pulp expansion found in the majority of lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disorders. Many of the reactive conditions are associated with a clinical hypersplenic state, while splenic lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disorders are frequently asymptomatic and discovered only at laparotomy. Macroscopic and microscopic evidence of enlargement of the white pulp may be absent in spleens of normal weight that are involved by lymphoma. In that situation, diagnosis requires meticulous examination of the white pulp for the demonstration of cytologic atypia.","['Burke, J S']",['Burke JS'],['eng'],['CA-05838-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/pathology', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Splenic Diseases/pathology', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*pathology']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1981 Sep;5(6):551-63.,,,59,,,,,,,,,,

We have found that the glycosphingolipid content of these cells differs considerably from that of mature erythrocytes. Globotetraosylceramide, the most abundant glycolipid of mature red cells, was not detected in K562 cells, and neither was globotriaosylceramide. The predominant neutral glycolipids of K562 cells are monohexaosylceramides, which are a mixture of glucosyl- and galactosylceramides, and lactotriaosyl- and lactoneotetraosylceramides were also detected. Secondly, gangliosides which contain N-acetylgalactosamine were much more abundant than those containing N-acetylglucosamine in K562 cells, in contrast to erythrocytes. The most abundant ganglioside of K562 cells, GM2, is present in trace quantities in erythrocytes. A third major difference between these two cells lies in their relative proportions of neutral glycolipids and gangliosides. The molar ratio of neutral glycolipids/gangliosides is approximately 15:1 in erythrocytes and 1:1 in K562 cells. These striking differences between K562 cells and mature erythrocytes indicate that glycolipids may be useful cell surface markers of normal erythrocyte differentiation, and of erythroleukemias.","['Suzuki, A', 'Karol, R A', 'Kundu, S K', 'Marcus, D M']","['Suzuki A', 'Karol RA', 'Kundu SK', 'Marcus DM']",['eng'],"['1F32 CA 06469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 17712/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Erythrocytes/*analysis', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gangliosides/analysis', 'Glycolipids/analysis', 'Glycosphingolipids/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*analysis', 'Pregnancy', 'Trypsin/metabolism']",1981/09/15 00:00,1981/09/15 00:01,['1981/09/15 00:00'],"['1981/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910280304 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1981 Sep 15;28(3):271-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910280304.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These could be further extended by immunization of the donors to Rauscher virus (RLV) and Rauscher leukemia cells. This suggests that spleen cells exert a greater graft-vs-leukemia effect than marrow. Nevertheless, with syngeneic cells all recipients eventually died of leukemia relapse. In contrast, the use of RLV-resistant C57BL/10J allogeneic marrow cells resulted in a substantial number of long-term survivors and a low incidence of GvH disease, while the use of pure allogeneic spleen cells resulted in early and fatal GvH response in all recipients. To determine if allogeneic spleen cells might have any demonstrably beneficial effect on survival of leukemic mice various small quantities of C57BL/10J spleen cells were mixed with marrow from the same donors and engrafted into normal and leukemic SJL/J recipients. Among the normal mice MST decreased as a function of spleen cell concentration. However, with the leukemics the use of 2.5 or 5% spleen cells resulted in later deaths than that found when leukemic mice were given only marrow. Also, for all allogeneic spleen/marrow mixtures tested, survival of leukemic recipients exceeded that of normal recipients given the same cell mixtures. These data suggest a possible beneficial effect of small amounts of allogeneic spleen cells in transplantation therapy for leukemia, and a possible competitive interaction of anti-host and anti-leukemic activities of the transplanted cells leading to a moderation of the GvH response.","['Okunewick, J P', 'Meredith, R F', 'Raikow, R B', 'Brozovich, B J', 'Magliere, K']","['Okunewick JP', 'Meredith RF', 'Raikow RB', 'Brozovich BJ', 'Magliere K']",['eng'],['1RO1-CA22512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Rauscher Virus/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Spleen/*transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1981/08/01 00:00,1981/08/01 00:01,['1981/08/01 00:00'],"['1981/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1981 Aug;9(7):754-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 36,000 X g soluble fraction of the cells degraded [14C]globin with maximal activity at pH 3.6, while the insoluble fraction failed to degrade [14C]globin within a pH range of 2.5-9.0. The acid protease activity in the soluble fraction of the undifferentiated murine erythroleukemic cells increased during the first 2 days in culture and remained constant during the following 4 days. We suggest that this activity resides in the lysosomes since it migrates together with the lysosomal marker alpha-mannosidase on colloidal silica gradients, shows maximum activity at acid pH and is sensitive towards inhibition by pepstatin. Induced differentiation of the cells by dimethyl sulfoxide, butyric acid or hexamethylene bisacetamide was concomitantly associated with a marked reduction in protease activity and the accumulation of hemoglobin within the cells. In contrast, in a non-inducible variant of 745 cell line DMSO failed to affect proteolysis. It is suggested that in murine erythroleukemic cells changes in acid protease activity are associated with the cellular triggered by chemical inducers.","['Kidron, M', 'Fibach, E', 'Klemes, Y', 'Mayer, M']","['Kidron M', 'Fibach E', 'Klemes Y', 'Mayer M']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Ireland,Cell Differ,Cell differentiation,0342640,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Globins/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*metabolism']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0045-6039(81)90022-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0045-6039(81)90022-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Differ. 1981 Dec;10(6):309-15. doi: 10.1016/0045-6039(81)90022-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the optimal target effector ratio of 3:1, ADCC to both CRBC and HRBC was significantly higher than normal in 27 lung cancer, 18 malignant melanoma, and seven colon cancer patients, but not in 20 breast cancer patients. Chemotherapy (single-agent or combination) in 12 patients did not effect ADCC in vitro but significantly suppressed ADCC to both targets after only four or five days of therapy in vivo (ADCC to CRBC, 47.4 to 24.1% lysis: ADCC to HRBC, 48.1 to 16.3% lysis). Immunotherapy with intravenous (IV) corynebacterium parvum or IV methanol extraction residue of BCG (MER) boosted ADCC to both targets within four to seven days of the first dose. It was found that ADCC to HRBC but not to CRBC was completely absent in three cases of active hairy cell leukemia but was present in two cases in remission. The ADCC to HRBC showed an age-dependent increase in both the 51 normal subject and the cancer patients. This was not observed for ADCC to CRBC. The ADCC to CRBC was mediated mainly by an Fc-receptor-positive, nonadherent, small lymphocyte, and ADCC to HRBC was mediated entirely by an adherent monocyte. The ADCC did not correlate significantly with the H3 thymidine incorporation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, cultured without stimulation for either one or seven days. It also did not correlate with the number of residual granulocytes in the mononuclear cell suspensions. Measurement of ADCC is a useful method of characterizing host defense in malignant disease and its modification by therapy.","['Hersh, E V', 'Murphy, S G', 'Gutterman, J U', 'Morgan, J', 'Quesada, J', 'Zander, A', 'Stewart, D']","['Hersh EV', 'Murphy SG', 'Gutterman JU', 'Morgan J', 'Quesada J', 'Zander A', 'Stewart D']",['eng'],"['CA-05831/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-14528/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Bacterial Vaccines)'],IM,"['Age Factors', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bacterial Vaccines/administration & dosage', 'Breast Neoplasms/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colonic Neoplasms/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/immunology', 'Melanoma/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycobacterium bovis', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/therapy', 'Propionibacterium acnes/immunology']",1982/01/15 00:00,1982/01/15 00:01,['1982/01/15 00:00'],"['1982/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19820115)49:2<251::aid-cncr2820490210>3.0.co;2-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1982 Jan 15;49(2):251-60. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19820115)49:2<251::aid-cncr2820490210>3.0.co;2-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several of these studies have demonstrated that infusion of monoclonal antibody can cause the rapid and specific clearance of leukemic cells from the peripheral blood. Intravenously administered antibody also rapidly binds to bone marrow lymphoblasts, and in one instance, has resulted in the partial regression of tumor cell infiltrates in lymph nodes and skin. Unfortunately, clinically significant responses have not in general been achieved, but these clinical studies have identified specific factors that result in the development of resistance to antibody-mediated lysis in vivo. These factors include the presence of circulating antigen, antigenic modulation, reactivity of monoclonal antibody with normal cells, immune response to murine antibody, and the inefficiency of natural immune effector mechanisms. Current research is now being directed towards developing methods to circumvent each of these obstacles. Future clinical studies utilizing antibodies in vitro or with different specificity may demonstrate greater therapeutic efficacy.

A mass screening for tumors in the population and most probably the early tumor diagnosis by immunological means is impossible due to biological variables among the tumor bearers and to technical difficulties. Immunotherapy of tumors is still at an experimental stage. Although immunization is possible to animal tumors convincing data on similar effects in the human tumor system do not exist as yet. This conclusion is based on immunization experiments with adjuvants as well as with tumor preparations, transfer factor, thymosin, or immune RNA.

Splenectomy performed either prior to BCL1 transplantation or prior to the leukemic phase of transplanted BCL1 results in a markedly altered clinical syndrome: the onset of leukemia is delayed by about 2 months; the leukemia is low-grade; and the lymph nodes, which are not prominently involved in leukemic animals with intact spleens, are massively infiltrated in the splenectomized transplant recipient. The immunologic phenotype of the BCL1 cell is not altered by splenectomy and thus does not appear to account for the altered tissue distribution of BCL1 in the splenectomized host.

On fixed, non-drug-treated cells, p30 antigen was distributed homogeneously and diffusely over the cell membrane. When cells were incubated with 10 microM vinblastine for 1 hr before fixation, the distribution of p30 antigen was greatly changed, fluorescence now being collected into poles (cap-like formation). In contrast to this distribution pattern for p30 antigen, gp70 antigen was distributed in a micropunctate pattern on the cell surface, with or without vinblastine pretreatment. These observations indicate that the distribution patterns of p30 and gp70 membrane antigens are completely different and that they are differently controlled by cytoplasmic microtubules. In addition, because the p30 membrane antigen visualized in these studies most likely represents viral Pr65gag precursor molecules which are localized directly under and associated with the plasma membrane, these results suggest that, under special conditions of fixation, it is possible to obtain a cap-like phenomenon for cytoplasmic (internal) membrane-oriented proteins.","['Satake, M', 'McMillan, P N', 'Luftig, R B']","['Satake M', 'McMillan PN', 'Luftig RB']",['eng'],['CA-28077/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/drug effects/*immunology', 'Vinblastine/*pharmacology']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.78.10.6266 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Oct;78(10):6266-70. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.10.6266.,PMC349019,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coupling of an IgG2 alpha monoclonal anti-beta 2-microglobulin antibody, which reacts with human cells, was examined in detail. Liposomes were composed of dipalmitoyl lecithin and cholesterol, and variable quantities of phosphatidylethanolamine substituted with the heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent N-hydroxysuccinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP). They were reacted with antibody derivatized with the same reagent at a 5- to 20-fold molar excess, and activated by mild reduction. This degree of SPDP modification had no effect on the capacity of the antibody to bind to its target antigen. More than 40% of antibody could be reproducibly bound to liposomes, resulting in the coupling of from 1 to 10 antibody molecules per liposome (mean diameter:580 A). The coupling reaction did not lead to loss of carboxyfluorescein encapsulated within liposomes. At least 80% of liposomes carried nondenatured antibody, as confirmed by precipitation of liposomes and encapsulated carboxyfluorescein by Staphylococcus aureus, strain Cowan I. The liposome-coupled antibody retained its immunological specificity: only cells expressing human beta 2-microglobulin bound liposomes in vitro, and the binding was inhibited by the free antibody in solution.

Fluorescein labeled normal human T cells or a T cell line were fractionated on plastic culture dishes precoated with affinity chromatography purified anti-fluorescein antibodies. Cell binding was specific for fluorescein, and was both time and temperature dependent. Bound cells were eluted at 37 degrees C with fluorescein-L-lysine. The eluted cells were enriched with highly viable and functional human T cell subsets. Thus Leu3 monoclonal antibody selected cells were shown to provide helper activity in the pokeweed mitogen induced IgM and IgG immunoglobulin secretory response of autologous B cells. The Leu2 antibody selected T cells suppressed both IgM and IgG secretory responses. In addition, studies with the monoclonal antibody 1G11, which binds to an antigen expressed on acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) cells and the T-ALL derived cell line RPMI-8402, demonstrated that this solid-phase technique can be used to select for cells which are present at low frequencies in a mixed population.

In this assay, cells with appropriate markers for mutagenesis, such as the Chinese hamster V79 cells, are co-cultivated with cells capable of metabolizing chemical carcinogens. Use of this assay made it possible to demonstrate a relationship between the degree of carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of a series of polycyclic hydrocarbons, nitrosamines and aflatoxins, and to establish means to study organ specificity of some chemical carcinogens. However, most shortterm in vitro assays are designed to detect mutagenic activity and therefore do not detect tumor promoting agents which are devoid of this activity. By analyzing various markers of terminal differentiation in cultured human melanoma and myeloid leukemia cells, we have established a relationship between the activity of a series of tumor promoting phorbol diesters in the mouse skin and their ability to induce terminal differentiation. We suggest that measuring alterations in the differentiation. We suggest that measuring alterations in the differentiation characteristics of some cultured cells may represent an approach by which environmental tumor promoting agents can be studied and detected.","['Huberman, E']",['Huberman E'],['eng'],['40-636-77/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Dev Toxicol Environ Sci,Developments in toxicology and environmental science,7706742,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Carcinogens/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mutagenicity Tests', '*Mutagens/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Rats']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Dev Toxicol Environ Sci. 1980;8:121-32.,,,63,,,,,,,,,,

At monthly intervals, they received 5 days of cytosine-arabinoside alternately combined with adriamycin or thioguanine or cyclophosphamide or CCNU. Two weeks later, 2 x 10(9) unirradiated allogenic blasts mixed with 5-50 units neuraminidase/ml were injected intradermally. Half the patients who had had many unfavourable prognostic factors at the time of diagnosis relapsed within 15 months (average duration of 1st remission 8 months). This result is comparable with the (past) results of chemotherapy alone. Seven of the patients still in first remission have at present reached an average remission duration of 17 months. Regular variations in the blood cell counts, which depended on chemo- as well as immunotherapy, were observed during the course of remission but not shortly before relapse. The extent to which peripheral lymphocytes could be stimulated varied noticeably from one patient to another and mostly increased with the progress of remission; however, to date no correlation to the clinical course was evident.","['Lutz, D']",['Lutz D'],['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",1981/08/01 00:00,1981/08/01 00:01,['1981/08/01 00:00'],"['1981/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000214911 [doi]'],ppublish,Onkologie. 1981 Aug;4(4):202-12. doi: 10.1159/000214911.,,Klinik und Immunologie bei akuten myeloischen Leukamien unter einer Chemo-Immunotherapie.,,,,,,,,,,,

The Intergroup Study was designed to determine if the addition of adriamycin (ADR) or bilateral pulmonary radiotherapy (RT) to vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC therapy) would improve survival and reduce local recurrences and metastases. All patients received RT to the primary lesion, and the survival rate after 3 years was 65%. The most effective treatment regimen was VAC plus ADR; 74% of the patients were free of disease at 2 years. The lengths of disease-free status and survival of patients treated with VAC plus ADR or VAC plus RT did not differ. However, both regimens were significantly superior to treatment with VAC alone. The addition of ADR or bilateral pulmonary RT to VAC was highly advantageous to patients with nonpelvic primaries. Bone and lung were the major sites of distant relapse, but the addition of bilateral pulmonary RT showed no advantage over that of ADR in reducing the occurrence of lung metastases. These recent results should eliminate some of the pessimism that has accompanied a diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma, although distant metastases continued to be a major reason for failure in the control of this tumor. Survival of these patients can be improved through well-controlled clinical trials designed to determine optimal adjuvant chemotherapy and treatment of the primary lesion.","['Nesbit, M E Jr', 'Perez, C A', 'Tefft, M', 'Burgert, E O Jr', 'Vietti, T J', 'Kissane, J', 'Pritchard, D J', 'Gehan, E A']","['Nesbit ME Jr', 'Perez CA', 'Tefft M', 'Burgert EO Jr', 'Vietti TJ', 'Kissane J', 'Pritchard DJ', 'Gehan EA']",['eng'],['CA07306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,National Cancer Institute monograph,0216026,"['1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Neoplasms/mortality/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dactinomycin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Prognosis', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/mortality/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1981/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1981/04/01 00:00'],"['1981/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1981/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 1981 Apr;(56):255-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This Philadelphia chromosome has been shown to be a product of a translocation between chromosomes 9 an 22 in the majority of cases. It is present in the bone marrow and unstimulated blood cultures. Visual examination of this chromosome gave the impression that small differences in length might exist between patients. Therefore, DNA measurements were undertaken on six patients with t(9;22) and chronic myeloid leukemia. Metaphases obtained from unstimulated peripheral blood cultures were Q-banded for photography and identification of chromosomes 9 and 22. Feulgen staining was performed, and the preidentified cells were photographed again. Cytophotometry of the photographic negatives was done using a Hidacsys-Arrayscan computer program. Relative DNA contents were calculated for the normal chromosomes 9 and 22 and both chromosomes involved in the translocation. Between 7 and 17 cells were measured per patient. The results indicated that no differences existed between the patients regarding the amount of material translocated from chromosome 22 to 9. In all patients from the sum of the DNA contents of the normal chromosomes 9 and 22 was less than that of the translocation chromosomes.

Three hours after treatment, hepatic nuclei were isolated and damage to DNA assessed by the alkaline elution technique. The method for isolation of the nuclei preserved the integrity of the DNA and in addition it was found that the purified nuclei could be frozen for at least 1 week with no detectable damage to the DNA. EDB administration (25-75 mg/kg) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in DNA single-strand breaks. More DNA single-strand breaks were detected when lysed nuclei were preincubated in the alkaline eluting solution prior to analysis. The presence of these alkali-labile sites suggests that the DNA strand breaks result, in part, from the lability of DNA sites alkylated by EDB. There was no evidence of EDB induced DNA-DNA cross-links or DNA-protein cross-links.

A prospective trial to evaluate blast cell TdT as a predictor of responsiveness to vincristine and prednisone in 30 Philadelphia chromosome-positive patients with blastic chronic myelogenous leukemia was undertaken. Eleven of 16 TdT-positive patients responded, whereas only one of 14 TdT-negative patients showed improvement. Among TdT-positive patients under the age of 50 years, the response rate was 78%. Enzyme-negative patients under the age of 50 had an 11% response rate. Blast cell morphology (i.e., lymphoblastic versus myeloblastic) had no significant correlation with either responsiveness or TdT activity.

These different types of ALL appear to reflect sequential stages of early lymphocyte ontogeny. There is a strong association between cell phenotype and first remission duration in ALL (p trend less than 0.0001) and an equally strong correlation between remission duration and white blood cell count at presentation. If common ALL and thymic ALL (T-ALL) are compared after adjustment of white blood cell counts, then the prognostic differences between these two major subclasses almost disappear (p = 0.38). It is suggested, therefore, that an immunological (and enzymatic) phenotype of ALL subclasses may not be an independent correlate of prognosis but nevertheless is linked to other differentiation-linked features, especially growth rate and sites of clonal expansion (e.g., marrow versus thymus), which critically influence the size of the clonogenic leukemic population and its associated evolutionary status with respect to drug resistant mutants at the time of diagnosis and introduction of therapy. An extensive library of monoclonal antibodies has been used to further define the phenotypic heterogeneity of T-and non-T All. Several of the antigenic structures identified by these monoclonal antibodies have been isolated and characterized.

This analysis reveals that consistent, composite phenotypes of different subclasses of lymphoid malignancies closely mimic those of corresponding normal cells at equivalent levels of maturation. It is suggested that three major target cell populations are available for lymphoid malignancy: the pluripotential stem cell (e.g. ""lymphoid' blast crisis of CGL), lymphoid progenitors or stem cells in the bone marrow (non-T ALL) or thymus (T-ALL, T-NHL) and long lived, mature and immunocompetent T and B cells (T-CLL, PLL, Sezary and B-CLL, lymphoma respectively). The major phenotypes documented in different leukaemias represent the level of ""maturation arrest' imposed on the dominant subclone; this is determined by, but not necessarily synonymous with, the ""target cell' and associated clonogenic cell population in the leukaemia. No consistent major abnormalities of gene expression are revealed by this investigation and although they may exist (e.g. loss or acquisition of antigens with malignant progression) we suggest that they are irrelevant to the central issue of what alterations are essential and sufficient for the evolution of clonogenic leukaemic cells.

In other diseases, an HSC of more restricted potentiality may be the primary cell producing the disease but, alternatively, all could arise from the totipotential cell. Cells in the clone are often identifiable by the presence of morphologic or chromosomal abnormalities, but in a given clone all cells may not express the abnormalities. In some but not in all patients who have been studied, residual normal HSC have been detected that are not part of the clone. Our current therapeutic attempts designed to cure at least some of these diseases are based on the concept of ""total cell kill.' In order to achieve this goal, the clone of tumor cells must be eradicated. To monitor this attempt and carry out therapy in a more scientific fashion, better means of identifying all cells in the clone are needed.

On the question of cancer induction by small X-ray doses.,647-66,"There is no proven body of fact that establishes an increase in human cancer after low doses of x or gamma radiation such as those received environmentally, occupationally, or from medical diagnostic procedures; that is, radiation levels below about 10 rad (0.1 Gy). This paper reviews the principal low dose epidemiologic studies that have investigated possible cancer increases. The results of these studies are negative, equivocal, or, when positive, invalidated by methodologic defects or by inconsistency with the feasible carcinogenic effect of background radiation. Despite the lack of direct evidence however, it will never be possible to exclude a very small cancer risk from even the lowest radiation levels, primarily because of statistical limitations in the design of epidemiologic studies. Estimates of cancer risk from low levels of x or gamma ray exposure are therefore based on assumptions regarding the relation between cancer increases and radiation dose. The statistical uncertainties of the meager human data at low doses do not permit unique relations to be established. Nevertheless recent radiobiologic investigations of dose/effect relations for neoplasms in animal populations, for chromosomal damage in human cells, and for malignant transformation in cultured mammalian cell lines suggest that a linear-quadratic relation, when fitted to the human data, provides a reasonable and conservative basis for risk estimation.","['Webster, E W']",['Webster EW'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

The 1-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl] derivatives of these heterocycles were synthesized by reacting the silylated bases with 2-(chloromethoxy)ethyl benzoate, followed by removal of the protecting groups with methanolic ammonia. The hydroxy groups of a number of these derivatives was subsequently replaced by an azido, amino, or carbamoyloxy moiety. The 1-(2-oxo-3-butyl) and 1-(2-oxo-3-nonyl) derivatives of cytosine were also prepared, their synthesis being accomplished by condensation of the silylated heterocycle with the appropriate alpha-halo ketone. At 10(-4) M concentrations, the newly prepared compounds were inactive against leukemia L-1210 cells in culture. However, a number of the agents inhibited the in vitro growth of Escherichia coli K-12, the most potent among these, 1-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]-5-fluorouracil being active at an IC50 of 1.2 micro M. This compound was equally active in preventing the growth of a 5-fluorouracil resistant strain of E. coli. Some of the analogues were also found to selectively interfere with herpes simplex virus replication in vitro.

Efforts toward curative treatment are chiefly concentrated in three places: the basic science laboratories, the clinical laboratories, and the bedside. It remains an open question from which quarter the decisive findings for the prevention or cure of AML will come. For the time being, only clinical trials offer substantial help to AML sufferers. A small number of patients achieve many years of remission and are perhaps even cured, but it is impossible to predict what patients can expect longterm remissions.

Mammary adenocarcinomas were only observed in young MNU-treated rats. Cervicovaginal malignant tumors were only observed in old MNU-treated rats. The incidence of hematopoietic system tumors was the same in animals of both age groups. Rats treated with MNU showed acceleration of benign spontaneous tumor development. The effect of aging on the initial stage of MNU-induced carcinogenesis is believed to be determined by age-associated changes in the proliferative activity of target tissues. The effect of aging on the further development of carcinogenesis may be caused by age-associated hormonal, metabolic, and immunological shifts.","['Anisimov, V N']",['Anisimov VN'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Exp Pathol,Experimental pathology,8108218,"['0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['*Aging', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Kidney Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Lung Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/chemically induced', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/chemically induced', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Methylnitrosourea/*adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/*adverse effects', 'Rats', 'Thymoma/chemically induced', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Vaginal Neoplasms/chemically induced']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Pathol. 1981;19(2):81-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure to inorganic arsenic compounds occurs in some occupational groups, e.g., among smelter workers and workers engaged in the production and use of arsenic containing pesticides. Substantial exposure can also result from drinking water in certain areas and the use of some drugs. Tobacco and wine have had high As concentrations due to the use of arsenic containing pesticides. Inorganic arsenic compounds interfere with DNA repair mechanisms and an increased frequency of chromosomal aberrations have been observed among exposed workers and patients. Epidemiological data show that inorganic arsenic exposure can cause cancer of the lung and skin. The evidence of an etiologic role of arsenic for angiosarcoma of the liver is highly suggestive; however, the association between arsenic and cancer of other sites needs further investigation. No epidemiological data are available on exposure to organic arsenic compounds and cancer. Animal carcinogenicity studies involving exposure to various inorganic and organic arsenic compounds by different routes have been negative, with the possible exception of some preliminary data regarding lung cancer and leukemia. Some studies have indicated an increased mortality from lung cancer in populations living near point emission sources of arsenic into the air. The role of arsenic cannot be evaluated due to lack of exposure data.

By measurements with high resolution, the demonstration of abnormal cellular DNA content in several types of tumors can be of definite diagnostic value when combined with conventional diagnostic procedures. The prognostic significance of different types of DNA aberrations is so far not established. Attempts to monitor cancer treatment by studying altered cell cycle distribution have not been successful, although some applications are of potential value. The main reasons for this are the complexity of tumor tissue as well as difficulties with interpretation of altered cell cycle distribution caused by drug combinations.

Thus, biologically active protein molecules in urine were detected at concentrations of less than 1 mg/L and over a wide range of dilutions. Activities were detected and quantitated by culturing human lymphocytes with human urinary proteins in the presence of [35S]methionine and subsequently analyzing the labeled lymphocyte proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Thus, protein analysis by two-dimensional gels was used to indirectly detect changes produced in cultured lymphocytes after exposure to regulatory molecules. Proteins or sets of lymphocyte proteins appeared or disappeared after exposure to normal or pathological human urinary proteins.

In eight patients the tumors were multiple. Most common sites of involvement were bone, periosteum, soft tissue, lymph node and skin. Twenty-two tumors occurred in 15 patients with no known disease, 26 occurred in 24 patients with a known myeloproliferative disorder, and 13 occurred in 11 patients with proven acute myeloid leukemia. Thirteen of the 15 patients with no known disease developed acute leukemia in from one to 49 months after the biopsy of their tumors (mean 10 months). Most tumors occurring in patients with a known myeloproliferative disorder were associated with blast crisis. The authors' cases displayed a morphologic range from well-differentiated to those tumors that displayed virtually no evidence of differentiation by conventional microscopy. It was therefore not surprising that most tumors were originally diagnosed as lymphoma. Chloro-acetate esterase (CAE) stains were performed on 56 tumors and 47 were studied with antilysozyme immunoperoxidase technique.

The clinical, histologic, and immunologic findings in 25 cases (11 women, 14 men) of RS are presented. The initial diagnosis was CLL in 19 cases, diffuse well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma in 2 cases, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia in 4 cases. The interval between the initial diagnosis and that of RS ranged from 0 (two cases) to 120 months (median 49 months). At the time of diagnosis of RS, the initial lymphoproliferative disorder was in apparent complete remission in only two cases. The lymphoma was disseminated in at least 18 cases. The overall median survival was four months, but complete remission was achieved in six cases and has been maintained for 15 to 77 months. In four of these six cases, the RS was localized. The histologic diagnosis of HD was made in only two cases. In the other 23 cases, the diagnosis was HL, but in five of these cases, the proliferation was heterogeneous and was considered as an early aspect of HL. Immunologic studies of lymph node cell suspensions were performed in seven cases. In all cases, the B-lymphocytic origin of the lymphoma cells could be ascertained. Detailed studies in four cases showed that lymphoma cells carried SIg of the same isotype and light chain type as that of SIg detected on CLL cells or of monoclonal serum Ig. In these cases, the lymphoma was actually related to the initial B-cell chronic lymphoid disease.","['Harousseau, J L', 'Flandrin, G', 'Tricot, G', 'Brouet, J C', 'Seligmann, M', 'Bernard, J']","['Harousseau JL', 'Flandrin G', 'Tricot G', 'Brouet JC', 'Seligmann M', 'Bernard J']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Biopsy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/pathology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', '*Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Time Factors']",1981/09/15 00:00,1981/09/15 00:01,['1981/09/15 00:00'],"['1981/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19810915)48:6<1302::aid-cncr2820480609>3.0.co;2-q [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1981 Sep 15;48(6):1302-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19810915)48:6<1302::aid-cncr2820480609>3.0.co;2-q.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients undergoing transplantation as therapy for either hematologic malignancies or aplastic anemia were given methotrexate as postgrafting immunosuppression. Patients who nevertheless developed acute GVHD of moderate severity were randomized to receive either corticosteroid therapy or ATG therapy. Thirty-seven patients were randomized: 20 patients received corticosteroids, and 17 received ATG. Both ATG and corticosteroids were in general well tolerated, although all patients receiving ATG developed fever and chills. Both treatment modalities were associated with a mild decrease in severity of GVHD after therapy. There was, however, no significant difference between treatment groups, whether assessed by improvement in specific organ involvement, improvement in the overall grade of GVHD, need for additional therapy for acute GVHD, or the proportion of patients who developed chronic GVHD. Infectious complications and survival were also not different between treatment groups. Thus, corticosteroids were as effective as ATG for the treatment of acute GVHD in recipients of HLA-identical marrow transplants and, therefore, appear to be a reasonable choice as primary therapy for acute GVHD.","['Doney, K C', 'Weiden, P L', 'Storb, R', 'Thomas, E D']","['Doney KC', 'Weiden PL', 'Storb R', 'Thomas ED']",['eng'],"['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Animals', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy', 'Horses/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Prednisolone/*therapeutic use', 'Rabbits/immunology', 'Random Allocation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830110102 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1981;11(1):1-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830110102.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coordinated efforts within the Study Group led to improved therapeutic results. The median survival of patients diagnosed in 1971 was 12 months. For a comparison, out of the 57 patients diagnosed in 1978, 34 are still in their first remission. Experimental work designed to approach the pathomechanism of the disease provided the following main points of interest. 1. Children diagnosed to have L1 type ALL according to the FAB categories fare better than those with L2. 2. ADA activity was essentially normal in patients being in remission and their parents. 3. Steroid receptor determinations can be of value in the planning of therapy. 4. Very low as well as very high initial WBC count indicates a bad prognosis. 5. Children who possess the DR 5 histocompatibility antigen have a better outlook for long complete remissions and cure. 6. Growth hormone secretion and, accordingly, growth rate was normal in the long surviving patients. 7. There was a slight impairment in the performance IQ of children who were under 6 years of age at the time of diagnosis. 8. Emotional disturbances were universal in all patients, but could be much alleviated by regular psychological care and play activity. 9. So far we observed one patient with a second malignancy: his AML manifested 4 years after the successful removal and chemo-radiotherapy of his brain tumour. 10. Children in long, continuous remission-thought to be cured of their disease-possess normal remission lymphocytes with a significantly shorter cell cycle than controls.","['Schuler, D']",['Schuler D'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Hungary,Acta Paediatr Acad Sci Hung,Acta paediatrica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae,0372634,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hungary', '*Leukemia/diagnosis/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mood Disorders/etiology', 'Prognosis']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Paediatr Acad Sci Hung. 1981;22(1-2):99-108.,,,36,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term follow-ups have brought to light some interesting points concerning the prognosis. Dissemination of the disease and large-cell histological pattern were, as already known, unfavourable factors. Neither age nor sex, nor bone-marrow involvement seemed to have any influence. Obtaining complete remissions improved the prognosis, but intensifying the initial and maintenance treatments proved disappointing: the survival rate remained the same, and the incidence of drug induced leukaemias was high. Indeed, relapses appeared to be less responsive to treatment when the patient had initially received multiple chemotherapy. However, in view of the high death rate of the disease (one-third of the patients in this series died within the first 5 years), trying new therapeutic regimens in the hope of obtaining better results, as has been done in Hodgkin's disease, would be fully justified.","['Dumont, J', 'Asselain, B', 'Weil, M', 'Jacquillat, C', 'Dana, M', 'Chelloul, N', 'Ripault, J']","['Dumont J', 'Asselain B', 'Weil M', 'Jacquillat C', 'Dana M', 'Chelloul N', 'Ripault J']",['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Nouv Presse Med,La Nouvelle presse medicale,0312552,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies']",1981/06/20 00:00,1981/06/20 00:01,['1981/06/20 00:00'],"['1981/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Presse Med. 1981 Jun 20;10(27):2261-5.,,Evoluton lointaine des lymphomes noduaires.

In 48 patients without candidiasis (group 1), sera from 27% reacted in ID and 13% in LA tests; titers of antibody by ELISA occurred in all patients. In 34 patients without disseminated candidiasis (groups 2 and 3), Candida species were isolated; sera from 35% and 32% were positive in the ID and the LA test, respectively. In nine of 10 patients with disseminated candidiasis (group 4), LA and ID tests were negative. Seven patients in groups 1-3 without disseminated candidiasis were antigenemic (false-positive rate, 9%). Antigenemia was detected in seven of 10 patients with disseminated candidiasis; in the remaining three patients sera were drawn too early to be of diagnostic value.

The distributions of polarization, which before mitogen exposure show essentially a single peak, after exposure develop a second peak at a lower value of polarization. Simultaneously, the intensity distributions show a shift to higher levels of intensity. These shifts can be modeled on the basis of a subpopulation of lymphocytes responding to mitogen. Interpretation of the results is complicated by many factors that may influence the shape of the polarization distributions. In particular we show that the measurements are sensitive to the concentrations of phytohemagglutinin, Concanavalin A, Ca++, K+, fluorescein diacetate, the incubation time and the specific donor.

We describe here two serum-free media (a minimal synthetic medium and a high-density synthetic medium) that support the growth and differentiation of human K562(S) and mouse clones 745, 707, and 3TCl 12 erythroleukemia cell lines in long-term culture. The doubling times of the erythroleukemic cell populations are longer in minimal synthetic medium that in serum-containing medium. Cell saturation density in minimal growth medium is one-half that obtained in serum-containing medium for clone 745, whereas for K562(S) it is approximately the same. Cell saturation density in high-density medium (containing albumin) is greater than that achieved in serum-containing medium for K562(S), whereas for clone 745 cell saturation density increases for cells in midlogarithmic growth, although not to the density of cells grown in serum-containing medium. The differences in saturation density are due to a decreased doubling time as well as to better survival of the cells 3 or 4 days after plating. The cells can grow in the synthetic media and be passaged for as many generations as desired without impairment of growth capabilities. In the minimal synthetic medium, spontaneous differentiation of erythroleukemia cells continues to occur, indicating that spontaneously differentiating cells are the result of intracellular mechanisms controlling the expression of a genetic program of some of the cells at any given time. Hemoglobin synthesis can be induced in cells growing in synthetic medium by using lower concentrations of the same inducers that are effective in serum-containing medium, indicating that these chemicals do not depend on serum factors to initiate the process of differentiation. The percentage of benzidine-positive cells and the concentration of hemoglobin per cell, however, are less in the synthetic medium than in serum-containing medium, suggesting that serum factors do play a role in modulating the extent of hemoglobin synthesis. The types of hemoglobins synthesized by cells in synthetic medium are identical to those reported in serum-containing medium.","['Pessano, S', 'McNab, A', 'Rovera, G']","['Pessano S', 'McNab A', 'Rovera G']",['eng'],"['CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24273/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Hemoglobins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', '*Cytological Techniques', 'Hemoglobins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Sep;41(9 Pt 1):3592-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, radioactive standard sources are processed with the labelled cells smeared to slides. Carbon-14 is a favourable isotope with regard to minimal loss of beta-disintegrations due to self-absorption, and to limited cross-fire effects complicating the attribution of silver grains to individual cells. Silver grain densities can be counted by automated microphotometry allowing on-line data processing by an interfaced computer. Rate measurements of 14C-thymidine incorporation into individual cells yield values of the DNA synthesis rate provided that the endogenous pathway of thymidine-phosphate formation has been previously blocked. From the rate values of individual cells the DNA synthesis time of a cell compartment is derived. This is an essential time parameter for the evaluation of kinetic events in proliferating cell populations. This method is applicable to human cells without radiation hazard to man, and provides an optimal source of detailed information on the kinetics of normal and diseased human haematopoiesis. Examples of application consist of thalassaemia, malaria infection, iron deficiency anaemia and acute myelogenous leukaemia.","['Dormer, P']",['Dormer P'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Histochem J,The Histochemical journal,0163161,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoradiography/*methods', '*Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA/biosynthesis/blood', 'Erythroblasts/metabolism', 'Histocytochemistry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood', 'Mesocricetus', 'Mice', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01006877 [doi]'],ppublish,Histochem J. 1981 Mar;13(2):161-71. doi: 10.1007/BF01006877.,,,17,,,,,,,,,,

The values ranged from less than 1 to 1502 units/10(8) blasts with a median of 90 units contrasted with less than 1 to 219 units (median, 2.6 units) in studies of children without leukemia. Results of an immunofluorescence assay were in good agreement with enzymatic detection of the polymerase. Among 115 patients with adequate marrow smears, 105 had TDT-positive blasts. By contrast, in most children with acute myelogenous leukemia, TDT activity was either undetectable or less than 10 units/10(8) blasts. Although the highest levels of TDT were found in blasts with the common ALL phenotype, quantitative determinations were not significantly related to the major immunological subtypes of ALL or to morphological features or periodic acid-Schiff reactivity of the lymphoblasts. The probability that a newly diagnosed case of leukemia would be ALL was 90% if TDT levels were greater than 20 units/10(8) blasts. We conclude that absolute concentrations of TDT, as determined in this study, are of little value in identifying subclasses of ALL.

Murine erythroleukemia cell lines (MEL) have been isolated previously from the leukemic tissues of mice infected with such stocks of Friend virus complex. Since our laboratory has shown that either F-MuLV or SFFV can induce a lethal erythroproliferative disease, it has been unclear which of the properties of conventional MEL cells were causally related to the infection of these cells by F-MuLV and which properties were related to the infection of these cells by SFFV. In this article, we have focused on the helper-independent component of the Friend virus complex, F-MuLV clone 57, which has recently been purified by molecular cloning. We report a method for the reproducible isolation of a new type of murine erythroleukemia cell that can be isolate from mice infected with F-MuLV clone 57. We have designated these cells as 57 TP-1, indicating their origin from mice infected with F-MuLV clone 57 and their characteristics as transplantable erythroleukemia cells. Upon subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or intravenous inoculation of these cells, 57 TP-1 cells grow in the hematopoietic organs of the recipient mice. No subcutaneous or intraperitoneal nodules occur. Both F-MuLV and a Friend MCF virus can be detected in these cells, but no evidence to SFFV can be found.","['Oliff, A', 'Ruscetti, S', 'Douglass, E C', 'Scolnick, E']","['Oliff A', 'Ruscetti S', 'Douglass EC', 'Scolnick E']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Separation', 'Erythroblasts/transplantation', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Goats', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*complications/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*complications', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Spleen/transplantation']",1981/08/01 00:00,1981/08/01 00:01,['1981/08/01 00:00'],"['1981/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63014-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1981 Aug;58(2):244-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Erythropoiesis proceeds at a rate consistent with the demand for oxygen-carrying capacity, and the major regulator of erythrocyte production is erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is produced primarily by the kidney under control of a tissue oxygenation sensor. The recently developed erythropoietin radioimmunoassay should provide a clinically useful tool. Erythrocytosis is a pathologic state characterized by an elevated erythrocyte mass, which may result from increased proliferation of erythroid progenitors due to an intrinsic cellular defect or in response to extrinsic signals. Secondary erythrocytosis results from either physiologically appropriate compensation for inadequate tissue oxygenation or from inappropriate stimulation of erythropoiesis. Erythrocytosis increases oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, but at high hematocrit levels increased blood viscosity may result in decreased tissue oxygen delivery. Polycythemia vera is a hematopoietic stem cell disease of clonal origin. Initial results from the Polycythemia Rubra Study Group suggest that therapy with chlorambucil is associated with an unacceptably high risk for development of acute leukemia, and 32P is preferred for situations in which phlebotomy alone is insufficient.","['Golde, D W', 'Hocking, W G', 'Koeffler, H P', 'Adamson, J W']","['Golde DW', 'Hocking WG', 'Koeffler HP', 'Adamson JW']",['eng'],"['CA 15619/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 00865/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Blood Gas Analysis', 'Bone Marrow/physiopathology', 'Erythropoietin/analysis/biosynthesis/metabolism/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Polycythemia/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Polycythemia Vera/physiopathology/therapy']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-95-1-71 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1981 Jul;95(1):71-87. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-95-1-71.,,,159,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with cancer are less susceptible to rejection than those without. Patients with malignancy survive significantly better in the early post transplant years than do those without cancer, but fare much worse later on because of deaths caused by cancer and because of the need to withdraw immune suppressive therapy in those patients with proliferating cancer. Almost 40% of long survivors have cancer, an incidence which continues to increase. Cancer has become a major cause of mortality in long survivors.

Usefulness of histochemical methods.,481-93,"The usefulness of optimized and newly elaborated histochemical methods for proteinases is illustrated on two selected substances. DAP IV (Gly-Pro-MNA,FBB,pH 7.2) was discovered in 39% and DAP II (Lys-Ala-MNA,FBB,pH 5.5) in 60% of the lymphocytes of human peripheral blood (ly). The reaction product of such ly differs in quality and quantity. On the ultrastructural level, the reaction product of DAP IV (Gly-Pro-MNA,HNF) was found in cell membranes and lysosomes. Enzyme activity in other areas was probably suppressed during the preparation procedure. Although the number of ly revealed with Lys-Pro-MNA and Phe-Pro-MNA at pH 5.5 and with Lys-Pro-MNA at pH 7.2 is high, these substrates do not distinctly discriminate DAP IV and DAP II. DAP IV occurs exclusively in T lymphocytes. The number of DAP IV-positive ly was not decreased in patients with myelofibrosis, plasmacytoma, chronic granulocytic leukemia, or tricholeukemia. It was, however, greatly reduced in chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL). In patients with malignant lymphomas other than CLL, ly presence is related to the stage of the disease. Decreased values indicate a more severe stage or a relapse. In the majority of patients with gastric cancer DAP IV-positive ly were decreased. They were normal or increased in patients with peptic ulcer. The assessment of the number of DAP IV-positive ly is a simple method that provides information regarding the condition of patients with malignant lymphomas and gastric carcinoma. Neutrophilic leukocytes and their precursors, and to a lesser extent monocytes, are revealed when N-acetyl-Met-I-naphthyl ester (Ac-Met-N) is used as substrate. Membrane-bound lysosomal and cytosol proteinases were investigated together with disaccharidases in jejunal biopsies of patients with malabsorption syndrome. Activities of all enzymes were affected in patients with celiac disease. According to their impairment enzymes could be arranged: Lactase(L). trehalase (T), brush border endopeptidase (BBEP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), DAP IV, enzyme(s) cleaving Ac-Mer-N, aminopeptidase A, cytosol peptidases and aminopeptidase M. In the propria, DAP IV is decreased or absent, while GGT and, particularly, DAP II are increased. After a gluten-free diet, activities are restored in a reverse order. BBEP and GGT are useful as auxiliary parameters in the assessment of the damage or differentiation degree of enterocytes. DAP IV is a sensitive indicator of the involvement of the propria.","['Lojda, Z']",['Lojda Z'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,['EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)'],IM,"['Cytosol/enzymology', 'Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/enzymology', 'Jejunum/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Lysosomes/enzymology', 'Malabsorption Syndromes/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Pathology, Clinical', 'Substrate Specificity']",1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/29.3.481 [doi]'],ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 1981 Mar;29(3A Suppl):481-93. doi: 10.1177/29.3.481.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Purified alpha 1-AT inhibited in a dose-dependent manner phagocytosis of C3-carrying yeast particles. Inhibition was selective, concerned only C3-receptor-mediated phagocytosis, neither Fc-receptor-mediated phagocytosis nor uptake of untreated yeast particles was blocked by alpha 1-AT.

Allelic differences at the Ah locus are reflected in the large differences in inducibility of cytochrome P1-450 and benzo[a]pyrene metabolism in numerous tissues when the mice receive the chemical daily in their diet. This experimental model system offers to the hematologist and clinical pharmacologist a means to study genetic differences in toxic chemical depression of the bone marrow, as well as a potential model to study aplastic anemia and leukemia explainable on a single-gene basis. The genetically ""responsive"" individual who is at increased risk for cancer caused by subcutaneous or topical or intratracheal polycyclic hydrocarbons is at decreased risk for toxicity of the bone marrow and leukemia caused by oral benzo[a]pyrene (when compared with the genetically ""nonresponsive"" individual receiving the same dose of the same xenobiotic). In other words, tissue sites in direct contact with the carcinogen develop cancer in responsive animals because of induced P1-450; tissues in distant sites of the body may develop malignancy in nonresponsive animals because more carcinogen reaches that tissue due to decreased P1-450 induction all over the body and therefore decreased detoxication. Not only the dct with the carcinogen develop cancer in responsive animals because of induced P1-450; tissues in distant sites of the body may develop malignancy in nonresponsive animals because more carcinogen reaches that tissue due to decreased P1-450 induction all over the body and therefore decreased detoxication. Not only the dct with the carcinogen develop cancer in responsive animals because of induced P1-450; tissues in distant sites of the body may develop malignancy in nonresponsive animals because more carcinogen reaches that tissue due to decreased P1-450 induction all over the body and therefore decreased detoxication. Not only the dose but the route of administration and the tissue in which the malignancy or toxicity develops are therefore very important in the interpretation of data from tumorigenesis or toxicity experiments involving P1-450 inducers such as polycyclic hydrocarbons. There exists sufficient evidence that heritable variation of the Ah locus occurs in man. Growing evidence indicates that persons with higher aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase inducibility in their cultured mitogen-activated lymphocytes may have a statistically significantly increased risk for certain types of cancer and drug toxicity. It remains to be determined at the present time, however, whether this genotype can be used as a biochemical marker in the individual patient for predicting increased susceptibility to certain types of environmentally caused cancers or toxicity in man.","['Nebert, D W']",['Nebert DW'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Benzopyrenes)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzopyrenes/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*chemically induced/enzymology/genetics', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced/enzymology/genetics', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/metabolism']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.813911 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1981 Jun;39:11-22. doi: 10.1289/ehp.813911.,PMC1568727,,67,,,,,,,,,,

Eight patients with DHL after histologic conversion were treated with doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone with or without cyclophosphamide, but none achieved complete remission. Two other patients did achieve a complete response with therapy (one with radiotherapy and one with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone), but they had brief remissions, and no patient in this study achieved long-term, disease-free survival. This was reflected in the short (12-month) median survival after histologic transformation to DHL.

The DTIC-treated leukemia (L1210D line) or the control line treated with MLP alone (L1210N line) showed comparable growth kinetics in vitro. However, progressive increase of immunogenicity occurred in leukemic cells in the course of in vitro treatments with DTIC plus MIP, but not with MLP alone, as evidenced by comparative studies on transplantation immunity elicited in BALB/c x DBA/2 F1 mice by graded inocula of L1210D or L1210N leukemia cells. In vitro experiments confirmed that metabolic transformation of DTIC is required for increasing tumor immunogenicity. In fact, L1210Ha cells became highly immunogenic when treated with DTIC in intact mice but not in animals metabolically depressed by CCl4. Immunochemotherapy experiments based on the antigenic cross-reactivity between the L1210D line and the original L1210Ha leukemia showed that i.p. administration of L1210D cells followed by 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea treatment afforded marked protection in mice inoculated intracerebrally with the parental lymphoma.

All patients received food p.o. ad libitum and glucose-electrolyte solutions i.v.; four patients received an i.v. amino acid supplement (1.5 g/kg/day). Although all patients were in negative energy balance, there was a significant linear regression between nitrogen balance and nitrogen intake during Days 1 to 7 and Days 8 to 14 of the study. The slope of the regression line, reflecting exogenous nitrogen utilization, was not significantly different from that found in healthy young men ingesting adequate or subadequate energy intakes. The Y-intercept (-210 mg/kg/day) indicated an obligatory nitrogen loss that was much greater than normal. Most of the nitrogen loss was due to urinary excretion. Ammonia and urea accounted for 77 to 91% of the urine nitrogen. Urinary glutamate accounted for 4 to 10% of this loss. Urine protein excretion was abnormally high in each of the patients, ranging from 987 to 3440 mg/day. Urine excretion of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and beta 2-microglobulin was also abnormally high, despite normal blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, suggesting that these children had renal tubular dysfunction.

They were divided into four subgroups: common (c) ALL, T (thymic) ALL, 'null' (or 'unclassified') ALL and a rare lymphoma/leukaemia type B-ALL. A T-cell phenotype was found more frequently in boys and was usually but not invariably associated with a high white cell count at presentation. A mediastinal thymic mass was present in 53% of T-ALL patients but was not observed in any unequivocal not-T ALL. Clinical prognosis differed substantially between the three major phenotypic classes, remission induction rate and remission duration being lowest in T-ALL, better in 'null' ALL, and highest in cALL (P trend less than 0 . 0001; P = 0 . 0002 for comparison of cALL versus T-ALL). There was a much higher incidence of CNS involvement in the T-ALL group than in the cALL group or 'null' All group and although this was strongly correlated with WBC count it was also significantly associated with T-ALL independent of WBC count. Overall in this series and also within the major cALL subclass there is a strong correlation between high WBC count and poor clinical response (remission induction and duration). When the three major immunological subclasses are adjusted for WBC count the prognostic correlation of antigenic phenotype is reduced and statistically insignificant. It is suggested that immunological (and enzymatic) phenotype of ALL subclasses may not be an independent correlate of prognosis but nevertheless is linked to other cell differentiation features, especially growth rate and sites of clonal expansion (e.g. marrow versus thymus), which critically influence the size of the clonogenic leukaemic population and its associated evolutionary status with the respect to drug resistant mutants at the time of diagnosis and introduction of therapy.","['Greaves, M F', 'Janossy, G', 'Peto, J', 'Kay, H']","['Greaves MF', 'Janossy G', 'Peto J', 'Kay H']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Time Factors']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1981 Jun;48(2):179-97.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All four patients had B-cell markers with a high density of IgM, kappa type, and Ia-like antigen. Less intense staining for surface IgD was also observed. In each patient studied, chromosomal modes were in the hypodiploid or near-diploid range. Despite the karyotypic abnormalities, the cellular DNA content, as determined by flow microfluorometry, was within the normal limits in all cases. This suggests that the variability in chromosome numbers seen in these patients may reflect an abnormality in DNA package rather than differences in total DNA content. The modal electronic cell size of the prolymphocytes, determined by light scatter, was readily distinguishable from that of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes and the lymphocytes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Fewer than 4% of the peripheral prolymphocytes had S-phase DNA content, a finding consistent with the chronic nature of this leukemia.","['Diamond, L W', 'Bearman, R M', 'Berry, P K', 'Mills, B J', 'Nathwani, B N', 'Weisenburger, D D', 'Winberg, C D', 'Teplitz, R L', 'Rappaport, H']","['Diamond LW', 'Bearman RM', 'Berry PK', 'Mills BJ', 'Nathwani BN', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Winberg CD', 'Teplitz RL', 'Rappaport H']",['eng'],"['1 T32 CA 09308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 26422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16434/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Human/ultrastructure', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'Rosette Formation']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830090311 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1980;9(3):319-30. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830090311.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study antisera elicited in rabbits by immunization with Peer cells and absorbed with B cells were found to react with a distinct T-lymphocyte antigen. Absorbed anti-Peer serum was highly cytotoxic for human thymus cells and exerted a preferential activity on peripheral T lymphocytes. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) surviving exposure to anti-Peer serum and complement were depleted of most of the cells forming E rosettes, whereas the proportion forming EAC' rosettes was increased. Similarly, the depletion of cells forming E rosettes resulted in a concomitant reduction of the sensitivity of PBL to the cytotoxic effect of anti-Peer serum, while the enrichment of E-rosette forming cells had the opposite effect. Anti-Peer serum did not inhibit the formation of E rosettes by PBL in the absence of complement. Absorbed anti-Peer serum failed to exert any cytotoxic effect not only on normal B lymphocytes but also on the CBL and IMB B-cell lines, yet maintained a cytotoxic activity on the Raji and Daudi cell lines. A possible interpretation of these results is that immunization with Peer cells, a line of immature T lymphocytes, leads to the production of antibodies to a distinct antigen expressed on thymus and peripheral T cells. The antigen seems to be absent from normal peripheral B lymphocytes, but may be expressed on a line of pre-B cells, such as the Raji and Daudi lines.","['Schlesinger, M', 'Rabinowitz, R', 'Kertes, T', 'Ravid, Z', 'Goldblum, N']","['Schlesinger M', 'Rabinowitz R', 'Kertes T', 'Ravid Z', 'Goldblum N']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Thymus,Thymus,8009032,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Absorption', 'Animals', '*Antibodies', 'Cell Line', 'Complement System Proteins', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/*pharmacology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Rabbits', 'Rosette Formation', 'Sheep', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Thymus. 1981 Feb;2(4-5):235-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Examination of frozen tissue sections by the immunoperoxidase method revealed that the cells expressing this antigen were found predominantly in the medulla of thymus and in T-cell zones of lymph node and spleen. The antigen recognized by L17F12 was associated with a cell-surface glycoprotein of 67,000 daltons. L17F12 was used to isolate this molecule from human thymocytes, normal peripheral T cells, leukemic T cells, and T-cell lines. Expression of this antigen on normal T cells was not diminished by prolonged exposure in vitro to various T-cell stimuli. In the absence of complement, L17F12 bound to T cells without altering proliferative functions, thus enabling rapid purification of functionally intact T cells. In the presence of complement, L17F12 was cytolytic for T cells, providing the basis for depletion of T cells from heterogeneous populations. These data suggest that the monoclonal antibody L17F12 recognizes a specific T-cell differentiation protein.

The level of GvL activity of the donor marrow also appeared to be independent of sensitivity of the donors to the leukemia inducing Rauscher virus (RLV), as a high level of leukemia recurrence was found using marrow from RLV-resistant RF/J donors, while a lesser degree of recurrence occurred with the use of RLV-sensitive DBA-2J marrow. Analysis of the possible influence of major (MHC) and Minor (MiHL) histocompatibility loci suggested that GvL activity may be independent of the H-2 locus, and that the ""a"" alleles of the H-4 and H-13 loci may not be contributing to GvL effect.

The possibly that GvL activity may be independent of th MHC, but governed by MiHL possibility different from those regulating GvH response might explain why in this and previous studies GvL activity could only be demonstrated following allogeneic marrow transplantation but did not appear to correlate with severity of GvH response.","['Meredith, R F', 'Okunewick, J P', 'Raikow, R B', 'Brozovich, B J', 'Seeman, P R', 'Magliere, K C']","['Meredith RF', 'Okunewick JP', 'Raikow RB', 'Brozovich BJ', 'Seeman PR', 'Magliere KC']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],France,Biomedicine,Biomedicine / [publiee pour l'A.A.I.C.I.G.],0361342,['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)'],IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Rauscher Virus', 'Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biomedicine. 1981 Feb;34(1):11-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One activity, MGI-1, induced the formation of macrophage and granulocyte colonies from normal myeloid precursors. The second activity, MGI-2, induced macrophage and granulocyte differentiation in myeloid leukemic cells that no longer required MGI-1 for colony formation. The medium contained one species of MGI-1 and two species of MGI-2. One species of MGI-2, MGI-2A, copurified through five stages of purification with MGI-1, but separated from the other MGI-2 species, MGI-2B, at an early stage in purification. MGI-1, MGI-2A and MGI-2B were purified 1490, 1140 and 678-fold, respectively. When bands with biological activity gel from non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, MGI-1 and MGI-2A activities were associated with similar Mr and each activity showed two bands, one of 23 000 and the other 25 000. MGI-2B activity showed one band with a Mr of 45 000. Secretion did not appear to involve glycosylation, none of the species bound to concanavalin A, soybean agglutinin, or wheat germ agglutinin agarose columns and they did not appear to contain carbohydrates. The assays for MGI-1 and MGI-2 activities were not affected by adding protease inhibitors. But MGI-2 was more readily destroyed by treatment with proteases and was more labile at high temperature and low pH than MGI-1. It is suggested that the level of cellular proteases may play a role in regulating the relative amounts of MGI-1 and MGI-2 that are present in vivo.","['Lipton, J H', 'Sachs, L']","['Lipton JH', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'X8D5EPO80M (Emetine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Carbohydrates/analysis', 'Carcinoma, Krebs 2/*physiopathology', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Drug Stability', 'Emetine/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/physiopathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology']",1981/04/03 00:00,1981/04/03 00:01,['1981/04/03 00:00'],"['1981/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1981/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0304-4165(81)90486-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1981 Apr 3;673(4):552-69. doi: 10.1016/0304-4165(81)90486-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A substantial proportion of patients, perhaps 40--50%, are apparently cured with currently available therapy. However, optimal therapy has not yet been devised because of substantial therapeutic failures in the form of relapse and unacceptable side-effects. Remission induction therapy is the most settled aspect of therapy. The addition of asparaginase or an anthracycline to prednisone and vincristine is highly effective. Preventive central nervous system therapy is under revision and study. It is likely that a variety of approaches will be equally effective. Continuation (maintenance) therapy is in the most need of revision because of a majority of therapeutic failures are due to bone marrow relapse--the failure of systemic therapy to prevent emergence of resistant leukemia cells. The optimal duration of therapy has not been established, the relapse rate after cessation of therapy lasting 2-3 years currently being 20-25%. Bone marrow transplantation during remission shows promise as a therapeutic modality, particularly if autologous techniques are successful. The most promising development, however, is our increasing understanding of biological subpopulations of leukemia cells.

This had an apparent molecular weight of 37000 and contained an incompleted N-glycosidic oligosaccharide and unfinished O-glycosidic oligosaccharides. After chase for 10 min, the completed glycophorin A with an apparent molecular weight of 39000 was seen and it appeared at the cell surface in about 30 min. Using tunicamycin N-glycosylation was inhibited but not O-glycosylation. The absence of the N-glycosidic oligosaccharide did not affect the migration of the protein to the cell surface but the yield of glycophorin A was diminished. Translation of glycophorin A messenger-RNA was achieved in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system. This yielded a non-glycosylated protein with an apparent molecular weight of 19500, which exceeded that of the glycophorin A apoprotein with about 5000. This indicates the presence of a ""signal sequence"" in the preprotein.

The L1210 ELIA requires only five microliters of serum and reproducibly quantitates as little as 55 nanograms of an artificial immune complex standard (heat aggregated IgG). The validity of using aggregated IgG as a standard was demonstrated by the fact that it produced a dose dependent inhibition of binding of a known immune complex (peroxidase-anti-peroxidase) to the L1210 cells whereas monomeric IgG showed no inhibition. Results of the L1210 ELIA are similar to those of the L1210 radioimmune assay (RIA) which we have previously reported. There was no significant difference in mean immune complex levels between the ELIA and the RIA when serums from normal healthy blood donors were tested.

This loss of FV-P resistance was further analyzed and spleen weight and the number of erythropoietin-(Ep)-independent CFU-E in bone marrow and spleen were measured as the result of successful FV-P infection. C57B1/6 marrow was infected shortly before and in intervals after either isogeneic transplantation or transplantation into lethally irradiated DBA/2 hosts. After isogeneic transplantation there was some susceptibility for FV-P and this seemed to correlate with the regenerative activity of BFU-E at the time of infection. However, there was no difference in the BFU-E kinetics between normal DBA/2 and C57B1/6 mice.

After hydroxyurea treatment there was an increased proportion of BFU-E in S-phase, but only endotoxin, which did not alter the BFU-E kinetics after 48 h, made C47B1/6 mice susceptible to FV-P infection. These results suggest that the proliferative activity of BFU-E might be important for successful FV-P infection and induction of Ep-independent erythropoiesis but also other conditions regulate the resistance or susceptibility of a mouse strain.","['Seidel, H J', 'Kreja, L']","['Seidel HJ', 'Kreja L']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,"['0 (Endotoxins)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division', 'Endotoxins', 'Female', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Hydroxyurea', 'Mice', '*Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Polycythemia/etiology/*pathology', 'Radiation']",1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01026387 [doi]'],ppublish,Blut. 1981 Mar;42(3):173-82. doi: 10.1007/BF01026387.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(a) Bloom's syndrome: the distribution suggests that many of the cancers that occur with regularity in the general population just occur more commonly and at an earlier age. (b) Ataxia telangiectasia: cancers of many types are increased in frequency, but lymphoreticular cancers are exceptionally common, the case also in several other genetically determined immunodeficiency disorders. Both Bloom's syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia share defective immunity as a major clinical feature, but the respective roles, if any, of it and of chromosome instability in producing the cancer predispositions are unknown. (c) Fanconi's anemia: cancer apparently has become common only recently. The types and distribution which occur are unusual. Fanconi's anemia cells have been shown to be hypertransformable by oncogenic virus and to be defective in handling certain types of DNA damage (as well as to manifest chromosome instability) so that the recent increase in cancer incidence is both surprising and unexplained. The degree of cancer proneness of Fanconi's anemia per se, untreated by modern methods, must at present be considered unknown. (d) Xeroderma pigmentosum: the cancer predisposition apparently extends only to cells which receive solar damage, i.e., to skin and eye. This would not have been predicted in view of the fact that the cellular mechanism is defective for repairing DNA damage produced not just by sunlight but also by certain classes of chemical carcinogens.","['German, J']",['German J'],['eng'],"['HD 04134/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 09011/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Basic Life Sci,Basic life sciences,0360077,,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*genetics', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/complications/*genetics', 'Carcinoma/etiology', 'Chromosomes/pathology', 'Fanconi Anemia/complications/*genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Lymphoma/etiology', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum/complications/*genetics']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4684-3842-0_30 [doi]'],ppublish,Basic Life Sci. 1980;15:429-39. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4684-3842-0_30.,,,35,,,,,,,,,,

The capability of detecting platelet-bound IgG as a diagnostic and therapeutic modality is critical for appropriate care and management of patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), as well as other immune thrombocytopenias. We have modified our previous assay (Br J Haematol 37:265, 1977) by employing protein A and PAP as a labeled antibody. Surface bound platelet IgG was quantitated by phase contrast microscopy after incubation with PAP, graded per 100 platelets and expressed as a reactive index (RI). Controls (n=13) had RIs ranging from 0.49 to 0.72 (mean 0.63 +/- 0.02 SE). The nonimmune thrombocytopenic group (n=7) had an RI ranging from 0.58 to 0.72 (mean 0.64 +/- 0.01 SE). In contrast, the immune thrombocytopenic group (n=28) had RIs ranging from 1.04 to 1.75 (mean 1.43 +/- ;0.03 SE). Platelet-associated IgG was evaluated further by absorbing representative sera samples from each group against washed granulocytes, red cells and platelets. Only when sera from the immune thrombocytopenic group were absorbed against platelets did the reactive indices of pre- and postabsorption samples change significantly. These findings suggest that our assay is clinically applicable in detecting platelet-associated IgG in immune thrombocytopenia and has the advantage of being rapid, reproducible and easy to perform in a clinical laboratory.","['Tate, D Y', 'Carlton, G T', 'Nesbit, M E', 'White, J G', 'Krivit, W', 'Sorenson, R L']","['Tate DY', 'Carlton GT', 'Nesbit ME', 'White JG', 'Krivit W', 'Sorenson RL']",['eng'],"['5T32-HL07145/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 07306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 20695/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/diagnosis', 'Blood Platelets/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune System Diseases/*diagnosis', '*Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoglobulin G/*analysis', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Peroxidases', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic/diagnosis', 'Staphylococcal Protein A', 'Thrombocytopenia/*diagnosis', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome/diagnosis']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830090402 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1980;9(4):349-61. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830090402.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a complement-dependent microcytotoxicity assay about 60% of normal peripheral blood T-cells were found to be sensitive to lysis, while 40% were resistant. When the T-cell suspensions were depleted of TG-cells using EA (Ripley) rosette sedimentation, the remaining cells demonstrated an increased percentage of lysis-sensitive cells, while the T-cells enriched in EA-RFC demonstrated a decreased percentage of cells sensitive to lysis, indicating that the antiserum was primarily directed against the non TG-cells, i.e. probably the TM helper cell population. This was further supported by functional studies. In order to quantitate T-cells, cytocentrifuge preparations were made from cell suspensions with known T-cell percentages and the T-cells determined with both the immune adherence technique using AET-treated sheep erythrocytes, as well as the indirect immunofluorescence technique using anti-T antiserum.

The radiation protocol resulted in severe depression of spontaneous NK cell activity; this activity was not fully restored after treatment with the interferon inducer poly I:C. In vitro mixing studies provided no evidence for active suppression in vivo as a mechanism for this decrease in activity. In addition, spontaneous activity was restored towards control levels after bone marrow transfusion from nonirradiated mice. Despite the low NK cell activity, there was no difference between control and irradiated mice in the numbers of target-binding cells (TBC). The results are most compatible with the radiation-induced loss of a cell with normal NK activity from spleen and bone marrow after the split-dose radiation protocol. In addition, a population of cells able to competitively block normal NK cell lysis of YAC-1 tumor cells is found in the bone marrow, spleen, and thymus of the irradiated mice lacking NK cell activity.

Spectrin-containing cells are more numerous in bone marrow (18.9%) than in spleen (3.7%). In marrow, spectrin-containing cells exceed benzidine positive cells by about 6.2% whereas in spleen, numbers are almost equivalent. This suggests that normal proerythroblasts and perhaps more primitive erythroid cells contain spectrin, which is consistent with cytological characteristics of some spectrin-positive cells. Proerythroblast cells from spleens of Rauscher virus induced erythroleukemic mice contain spectrin although markers for hemoglobin synthesis are absent. Changes in CFUE number are closely correlated with those of spectrin-positive erythroid cells when erythropoiesis is perturbed. In red cell transfused, erythropoietically suppressed mice undergoing hemopoietic regeneration the administration of erythropoietin results in appearance of CFUE and spectrin-positive cells within 24-72 h. Due to different methods of assaying for CFUE and presence of spectrin, numerical data cannot be compared quantitatively because of uncertainty in the level of detection. Although it is not possible to demonstrate the presence or absence of spectrin in CFUE, changes in spectrin-containing cells and CFUE are closely correlated in time. Spectrin provides a convenient marker for both normal and leukemic nucleated erythroid cells and particular provides a functional marker for proerythroblasts which have previously been identified only by morphology.","['Hasthorpe, S']",['Hasthorpe S'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '12634-43-4 (Spectrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C/metabolism', 'Rauscher Virus', 'Spectrin/immunology/*metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism']",1980/09/01 00:00,1980/09/01 00:01,['1980/09/01 00:00'],"['1980/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1980 Sep;8(8):1001-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A multidisciplinary approach to non-hodgkin's lymphomas.,218-35,"Epidemiologic studies show that non-Hodgkin's lymphomas tend to develop after prolonged antigenic stimulation, after loss of normal regulation of lymphoid proliferation, or especially after both processes. Study of these tumors in vitro has greatly increased understanding of their pathophysiology and has provided a conceptual framework for their morphologic diversity. Lymphomas are now understood to be expanded clones of their normal counterparts. The anatomic location, phenotypic characteristics, proliferative capacity, and functional capabilities of the neoplasm often reflect those of the equivalent normal cells. If neoplastic transformation can occur at any stage of lymphoid differentiation, then it is theoretically possible that neoplastic lymphocytes may respond, or could be induced, to normal regulatory influences. Further study of selective cytotoxicity may reveal exploitable differences among lymphocytic subpopulations and permit more rational choices of therapy.

Descriptive clinical or epidemiologic studies that utilize the ""organism oriented"" approach are now abundant. Generalizations about risk factors are difficult to make, however, because of the wide range of host defects that are usually compounded by therapeutic intervention. Comparative data are lacking on whether certain procedures or treatments are associated with a higher incidence of infection in immunocompromised hosts versus normal hosts. Aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to nosocomial infection in immunocompromised patients are usually advocated, but there have been few prospective studies of their effectiveness and the possible increased hazard of nosocomial infection. The paramount questions that must be addressed are, ""What infections are preventable and how?"" Two derivative issues relate to (1) the cost to benefit aspects of preventive measures, and (2) the impact of such measures on survival from underlying disease. Rigorously controlled studies of specific preventative measures are clearly required because the appearance of improvement may be related to concurrent improvements in the treatment of underlying disease or its complications. The ultimate value of infection control programs in immunocompromised patients with depend on the demonstration that intervention not only reduces infection rates but also has a favorable impact on the treatment of the underlying disease.","['Young, L S']",['Young LS'],['eng'],"['AI-11271/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-16252/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-15688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Cross Infection/complications/*epidemiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunity', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia/complications/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/complications/*immunology', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(81)90779-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(81)90779-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1981 Feb;70(2):398-404. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(81)90779-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using single-cell immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase assays, we found that thymocytes and lymphoid cells of peripheral blood (PBL) and tonsils were heterogeneous with respect to ADA expression. About 70% of thymocytes were strongly stained for the enzyme whereas weak staining was seen in 20% of cells. About 10% of thymocytes were ADA negative. Twenty percent of PBL and tonsil cells were strongly positive for ADA, 10% of cells were negative for the enzyme, and weak staining was seen in the remainder.

One hundred percent of lymphoblasts of 3 T cells leukemia lines were strongly stained for the enzyme whereas weak staining was seen in a pre-B cell leukemia line, 4 B cell lymphoma/normal lines, 2 non-T, non-B cell leukemia lines and 2 myeloid cell leukemia lines.

This paper reports 17 cases of childhood ALL whose lymphoblasts were studied for surface membrane immunoglobulin, sheep erythrocyte receptors, and the presence of four antigens detected by well-characterized heteroantisera. Every non-B, non-T lymphoblast was positively identified by the Ia-like antiserum and/or the ALL antiserum. One T lymphoblast was identified by E receptors and the T antiserum, whereas two did not have E receptors but did react to the T antiserum. None of these three T lymphoblasts reacted with the Ia-like antiserum.","['Foon, K A', 'Herzog, P', 'Billing, R J', 'Terasaki, P I', 'Feig, S A']","['Foon KA', 'Herzog P', 'Billing RJ', 'Terasaki PI', 'Feig SA']",['eng'],"['CA-15619/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-15688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24358/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*classification', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1981/01/15 00:00,1981/01/15 00:01,['1981/01/15 00:00'],"['1981/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19810115)47:2<280::aid-cncr2820470212>3.0.co;2-e [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1981 Jan 15;47(2):280-4. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19810115)47:2<280::aid-cncr2820470212>3.0.co;2-e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five of 13 patients treated with LAA had a significant antibody response to LAA after immunotherapy. Antibody response correlated with an increased remission duration (159+ vs. 75+ weeks) and an increased survival (164+ vs. 98+ weeks). Two of eight patients treated with cells responded to LAA, and three patients had initially high anti-LAA antibody levels. In the total study, eight of 11 patients surviving longer than 2 1/2 years and six of seven patients maintaining a complete remission longer than 2 years were antibody responders. Neither protocol induced significant antibody to a normal spleen extract, BCG-CWS, or a measles recall antigen. However, five of seven patients with initially high levels of antibody to BCG (following weekly BCG scarification) were long-term survivors. These data suggest that the humoral immune response to immunotherapeutic agents may be a useful parameter for monitoring immunotherapy of AML patients.","['Granatek, C H', 'Ezaki, K', 'Hersh, E M', 'Keating, M J', 'Rasmussen, S']","['Granatek CH', 'Ezaki K', 'Hersh EM', 'Keating MJ', 'Rasmussen S']",['eng'],['1-CB-74122/CB/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (BCG Vaccine)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*administration & dosage', 'BCG Vaccine/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Retrospective Studies']",1981/01/15 00:00,1981/01/15 00:01,['1981/01/15 00:00'],"['1981/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19810115)47:2<272::aid-cncr2820470211>3.0.co;2-c [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1981 Jan 15;47(2):272-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19810115)47:2<272::aid-cncr2820470211>3.0.co;2-c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
