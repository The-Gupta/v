Among the 32-myeloid associated genes studied, SF3B1 (p </= .001) was significantly mutated in higher proportion of patients with MDS, compared to other categories. NPM1 (p < .001), FLT3 ITD (p = .08), and NRAS (p = .02) mutations showed trend toward significance for AML w/o MRC, compared to other categories. In pAML-MRC, TP53 (p < .001) was significantly mutated in higher proportion of patients. Similarly, SETBP1 (p = .001), RUNX1 (p = .004), and SRSF2 (p = .04) mutations were more commonly seen in sAML-MRC. While these signatures may not be diagnostically discriminatory, they may help in disease categorization when other data are absent or in challenging cases.","['Badar, Talha', 'Szabo, Aniko', 'Sallman, David', 'Komrojki, Rami', 'Lancet, Jefferey', 'Padron, Eric', 'Song, Jinming', 'Hussaini, Mohammad Omar']","['Badar T', 'Szabo A', 'Sallman D', 'Komrojki R', 'Lancet J', 'Padron E', 'Song J', 'Hussaini MO']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1548-918X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5642-1451']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin and Froedtert Hospital, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin and Froedtert Hospital, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology and Laboratory Medicine, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology and Laboratory Medicine, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200204,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Jun;61(6):1269-1271.

However, the emergence of resistance to imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors leads researchers to characterize new therapeutic targets. Several studies have highlighted the role of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) in various pathologies, including cancer. This protein effectively intervenes in cellular activities by its primarily cytoplasmic localization. In this review, we will discuss the molecular characteristics of the HDAC6 protein, as well as its overexpression in CML leukemic stem cells, which make it a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of CML.","['Losson, Helene', 'Schnekenburger, Michael', 'Dicato, Mario', 'Diederich, Marc']","['Losson H', 'Schnekenburger M', 'Dicato M', 'Diederich M']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0550-9538'],"['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg 9, rue Edward Steichen, L2540 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg 9, rue Edward Steichen, L2540 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg 9, rue Edward Steichen, L2540 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 08826, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200129,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['heat shock protein 90', 'histone deacetylase 6 inhibitor', 'imatinib resistance', 'leukemia stem cells', 'personalized treatment', 'targeted therapy']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:01,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2020/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12020318 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12020318 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jan 29;12(2). pii: cancers12020318. doi: 10.3390/cancers12020318.,PMC7072136,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study is intended to investigate whether an olive leaf extract enriched in Ole (OLEO) may counteract the aerobic glycolysis exploited by tumor cells. We found that OLEO decreased melanoma cell proliferation and motility. OLEO was also able to reduce the rate of glycolysis of human melanoma cells without affecting oxidative phosphorylation. This reduction was associated with a significant decrease of glucose transporter-1, protein kinase isoform M2 and monocarboxylate transporter-4 expression, possible drivers of such glycolysis inhibition. Extending the study to other tumor histotypes, we observed that the metabolic effects of OLEO are not confined to melanoma, but also confirmed in colon carcinoma, breast cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia. In conclusion, OLEO represents a natural product effective in reducing the glycolytic metabolism of different tumor types, revealing an extended metabolic inhibitory activity that may be well suited in a complementary anti-cancer therapy.","['Ruzzolini, Jessica', 'Peppicelli, Silvia', 'Bianchini, Francesca', 'Andreucci, Elena', 'Urciuoli, Silvia', 'Romani, Annalisa', 'Tortora, Katia', 'Caderni, Giovanna', 'Nediani, Chiara', 'Calorini, Lido']","['Ruzzolini J', 'Peppicelli S', 'Bianchini F', 'Andreucci E', 'Urciuoli S', 'Romani A', 'Tortora K', 'Caderni G', 'Nediani C', 'Calorini L']",,"['Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, 50134 Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, 50134 Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, 50134 Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, 50134 Florence, Italy.', 'PHYTOLAB (Pharmaceutical, Cosmetic, Food Supplement Technology and Analysis)-DiSIA, Scientific and Technological Pole, University of Florence, 50019 Sesto Fiorentino (Florence), Italy.', 'PHYTOLAB (Pharmaceutical, Cosmetic, Food Supplement Technology and Analysis)-DiSIA, Scientific and Technological Pole, University of Florence, 50019 Sesto Fiorentino (Florence), Italy.', 'NEUROFARBA Department, Pharmacology and Toxicology Section, University of Florence, 50139 Florence, Italy.', 'NEUROFARBA Department, Pharmacology and Toxicology Section, University of Florence, 50139 Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, 50134 Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, 50134 Florence, Italy.', 'Center of Excellence for Research, Transfer and High Education DenoTHE University of Florence, 50134 Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200129,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Seahorse analysis', 'cancer metabolism', 'glycolytic markers', 'oleuropein', 'olive leaf extract']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:01,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12020317 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12020317 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jan 29;12(2). pii: cancers12020317. doi: 10.3390/cancers12020317.,PMC7072393,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],"['itt2013/Istituto Toscano Tumori', 'ECRF/Ente Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The treatment methods so far are very often associated with mutilation and impairment in the quality of life. Except for p16 expression, there are no reliable prognostic markers in HNSCC so far. Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 (EVI1) is a well-described prognostic marker in leukemia and different types of solid cancers. In these, a high EVI1 expression is associated with a poor prognosis. In HNSCC, it is not known so far if EVI1 has any prognostic relevance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used our representative tissue cohort of 389 primary HNSCCs, of which 57.2% had one or more lymph node metastases. Here EVI1 expression was analyzed via immunohistochemistry and correlated with the clinical characteristics of these patients. RESULTS: Although in HNSCC EVI1 expression does not predict poor survival, a high EVI1 expression in the primary tumor correlates with a lymph node metastatic disease. CONCLUSION: Consequently, EVI1 may serve as a biomarker to predict an occult lymph node metastasis in a clinical nodal negative (cN0) HNSCC.","['Idel, Christian', 'Ribbat-Idel, Julika', 'Kuppler, Patrick', 'Krupar, Rosemarie', 'Offermann, Anne', 'Vogel, Wenzel', 'Rades, Dirk', 'Kirfel, Jutta', 'Wollenberg, Barbara', 'Perner, Sven']","['Idel C', 'Ribbat-Idel J', 'Kuppler P', 'Krupar R', 'Offermann A', 'Vogel W', 'Rades D', 'Kirfel J', 'Wollenberg B', 'Perner S']",,"['Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University of Luebeck, Ratzeburger Allee 160, 23538 Luebeck, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Luebeck, Ratzeburger Allee 160, 23538 Luebeck, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Luebeck, Ratzeburger Allee 160, 23538 Luebeck, Germany.', 'Pathology, Research Center Borstel, Leibniz Lung Center, Parkallee 1-40, 23845 Borstel, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Luebeck, Ratzeburger Allee 160, 23538 Luebeck, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Luebeck, Ratzeburger Allee 160, 23538 Luebeck, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Luebeck, Ratzeburger Allee 160, 23538 Lubeck, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Luebeck, Ratzeburger Allee 160, 23538 Luebeck, Germany.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University of Luebeck, Ratzeburger Allee 160, 23538 Luebeck, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Luebeck, Ratzeburger Allee 160, 23538 Luebeck, Germany.', 'Pathology, Research Center Borstel, Leibniz Lung Center, Parkallee 1-40, 23845 Borstel, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200128,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/*pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['EVI1', 'HNSCC', 'biomarker', 'lymph node metastasis', 'prognosis']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/11/05 06:00,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21030854 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21030854 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jan 28;21(3). pii: ijms21030854. doi: 10.3390/ijms21030854.,PMC7038015,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],"['PE1179/11-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'J26-2018/Medinizische Fakultat der Universitat zu Lubeck']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The action of retinoic acids in inhibiting the cell proliferation was found in several cell pathways and compartments: from membrane and cytoplasmic signaling, to metabolic enzymes, to gene expression. However, in parallel in the most aggressive phenotypes several escape routes have evolved conferring retinoic acids-resistance. The comparison between different solid cancer types pointed out that for some cancer types several information are still lacking. Moreover, even though some pathways and escape routes are the same between the cancer types, sometimes they can differently respond to retinoic acid therapy, so that generalization cannot be made. Further studies on molecular pathways are needed to perform combinatorial trials that allow overcoming retinoic acids resistance.","['Costantini, Lara', 'Molinari, Romina', 'Farinon, Barbara', 'Merendino, Nicolo']","['Costantini L', 'Molinari R', 'Farinon B', 'Merendino N']",,"[""Department of Ecological and Biological Sciences (DEB), Tuscia University, Largo dell'Universita snc, 01100 Viterbo, Italy."", ""Department of Ecological and Biological Sciences (DEB), Tuscia University, Largo dell'Universita snc, 01100 Viterbo, Italy."", ""Department of Ecological and Biological Sciences (DEB), Tuscia University, Largo dell'Universita snc, 01100 Viterbo, Italy."", ""Department of Ecological and Biological Sciences (DEB), Tuscia University, Largo dell'Universita snc, 01100 Viterbo, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200128,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['13-cis retinoic acid', '9-cis retinoic acid', 'all-trans retinoic acid', 'breast cancer', 'colon cancer', 'gastric cancer', 'liver cancer', 'lung cancer', 'retinoic acid', 'solid cancer']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:01,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2020/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9020360 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9020360 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Jan 28;9(2). pii: jcm9020360. doi: 10.3390/jcm9020360.,PMC7073976,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD22 is expressed by most blasts from the majority (60-90%) of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Current therapies in adults with newly diagnosed B-ALL are associated with complete remission (CR) rates of 50-90%. However, 30-60% of these patients relapse, and only 25-40% achieve disease-free survival of three years or more. Chemotherapy regimens for patients with refractory/relapsed B-ALL are associated with CR rates ranging from 31% to 44%. Novel immune-targeted therapies, such as blinatumomab and inotuzumab (a humanized anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody conjugated to the cytotoxic antibiotic agent calicheamicin), provide potential means of circumventing chemo-refractory B-ALL cells through novel mechanisms of action. Eighty percent of inotuzumab-treated B-ALL patients may achieve a CR state. This review is focused on the biological and clinical activities of CD22 antibodies in B-ALL, and provides evidence about the potential role played by qualitative and quantitative analysis of the CD22 molecule on individual B-ALL blasts in predicting the depletion of leukemic cells, and, ultimately, leading to better clinical response rates.","['Lanza, Francesco', 'Maffini, Enrico', 'Rondoni, Michela', 'Massari, Evita', 'Faini, Angelo Corso', 'Malavasi, Fabio']","['Lanza F', 'Maffini E', 'Rondoni M', 'Massari E', 'Faini AC', 'Malavasi F']",,"['Hematology Unit & Romagna Transplant Network, Ravenna Hospital, 48121 Ravenna, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit & Romagna Transplant Network, Ravenna Hospital, 48121 Ravenna, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit & Romagna Transplant Network, Ravenna Hospital, 48121 Ravenna, Italy.', 'Clinical Pathology Unit, Hub Laboratory, Romagna Transplant Network, 47522 Cesena (FC), Italy.', 'Department of Medical Science, University of Torino and Fondazione Ricerca Molinette, 10126 Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Science, University of Torino and Fondazione Ricerca Molinette, 10126 Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200128,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-ALL', 'CD22', 'antigen modulation', 'inotuzumab']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:01,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12020303 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12020303 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jan 28;12(2). pii: cancers12020303. doi: 10.3390/cancers12020303.,PMC7072635,"['F.L.: Served on advisory boards for Abbvie, Alexion, Pfizer.

Current therapies are mostly limited to surgical intervention after lesion, yet these interventions have limited success in restoring functionality. Current activity-based therapies after axonal injuries are based on trial-error approaches in which the details of the underlying cellular and molecular processes are largely unknown. Here we show the effects of the modulation of both neuronal and muscular activity with optogenetic approaches to assess the regenerative capacity of cultured motor neuron (MN) after lesion in a compartmentalized microfluidic-assisted axotomy device. With increased neuronal activity, we observed an increase in the ratio of regrowing axons after injury in our peripheral-injury model. Moreover, increasing muscular activity induces the liberation of leukemia inhibitory factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor in a paracrine fashion that in turn triggers axonal regrowth of lesioned MN in our 3D hydrogel cultures. The relevance of our findings as well as the novel approaches used in this study could be useful not only after axotomy events but also in diseases affecting MN survival.","['Sala-Jarque, Julia', 'Mesquida-Veny, Francina', 'Badiola-Mateos, Maider', 'Samitier, Josep', 'Hervera, Arnau', 'Del Rio, Jose Antonio']","['Sala-Jarque J', 'Mesquida-Veny F', 'Badiola-Mateos M', 'Samitier J', 'Hervera A', 'Del Rio JA']",,"['Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED), 28031 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Physiology and Immunology, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Neuroscience, University of Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED), 28031 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Physiology and Immunology, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Neuroscience, University of Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red en Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBERBBN), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Electronics and Biomedical Engineering, Universitat de Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red en Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBERBBN), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Electronics and Biomedical Engineering, Universitat de Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED), 28031 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Physiology and Immunology, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Neuroscience, University of Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED), 28031 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Physiology and Immunology, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Neuroscience, University of Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200127,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,,"['Animals', 'Axons/*pathology', 'Axotomy', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Channelrhodopsins/metabolism', 'Female', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism', '*Lab-On-A-Chip Devices', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Light', 'Mice', 'Motor Neurons/pathology', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/cytology', 'Myoblasts/cytology', 'Neuromuscular Junction/*pathology', 'Optogenetics', '*Paracrine Communication', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Spinal Cord/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*axotomy', '*microfluidics', '*neuromuscular junction', '*paracrine signaling']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/02/11 06:00,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9020302 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9020302 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Jan 27;9(2). pii: cells9020302. doi: 10.3390/cells9020302.,PMC7072511,,,"['0 (Channelrhodopsins)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These broad uses increase human exposure, and thus the potential risk related to their short- and long-term toxicity for both consumers and workers. These potential risks have to be investigated, in a global context of multi-exposure, as encountered in human populations. However, most of the in vitro research on the effects of amorphous silica has been carried out in an acute exposure mode, which is not the most relevant when trying to assess the effects of occupational exposure. As a first step, the effects of repeated exposure of macrophages to silica nanomaterials have been investigated. The experiments have been conducted on in vitro macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (cell line from an Abelson murine leukemia virus-induced tumor), as this cell type is an important target cell in toxicology of particulate materials. The bioaccumulation of nanomaterials and the persistence of their effects have been studied. The experiments carried out include the viability assay and functional tests (phagocytosis, NO and reactive oxygen species dosages, and production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines) using flow cytometry, microscopy and spectrophotometry. Accumulation of silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NP) was observed in both exposure scenarii. However, differences in the biological effects between the exposure scenarii have also been observed. For phagocytosis, NO production and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) release, repeated exposure tended to induce fewer effects than acute exposure. Nevertheless, repeated exposure still induces alterations in the macrophage responses and thus represents a scenario to be tested in detail.","['Torres, Anaelle', 'Dalzon, Bastien', 'Collin-Faure, Veronique', 'Rabilloud, Thierry']","['Torres A', 'Dalzon B', 'Collin-Faure V', 'Rabilloud T']",,"['Laboratory of Chemistry and Biology of Metals, University Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, CEA IRIG-LCBM, 38000 Grenoble, France.', 'Laboratory of Chemistry and Biology of Metals, University Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, CEA IRIG-LCBM, 38000 Grenoble, France.', 'Laboratory of Chemistry and Biology of Metals, University Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, CEA IRIG-LCBM, 38000 Grenoble, France.', 'Laboratory of Chemistry and Biology of Metals, University Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, CEA IRIG-LCBM, 38000 Grenoble, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200127,Switzerland,Nanomaterials (Basel),"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",101610216,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['bioaccumulation', 'macrophage', 'nanoparticles']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:01,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['nano10020215 [pii]', '10.3390/nano10020215 [doi]']",epublish,Nanomaterials (Basel). 2020 Jan 27;10(2). pii: nano10020215. doi: 10.3390/nano10020215.,PMC7074975,"['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

Most of these infected individuals live in the southwest region of Japan, including Okinawa prefecture; however, currently no prophylactic vaccine against HTLV-1 infection is available. For preventing the HTLV-1 spread, we previously generated a humanized monoclonal antibody (hu-LAT-27) that mediates both neutralization and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The neutralization epitope of LAT-27 is a linear amino acid sequence from residue 191 to 196 (Leu-Pro-His-Ser-Asn-Leu) of the HTLV-1 envelope gp46 protein. Here, we found that the LAT-27 epitope is well conserved among HTLV-1 clinical isolates prevalent in Okinawa. The hu-LAT-27 treatment inhibited syncytium formation by these clinical HTLV-1 isolates. Although an amino acid substitution at residue 192 in the LAT-27 epitope from proline to serine was found in a few HTLV-1 isolates, hu-LAT-27 could still react with a synthetic peptide carrying this amino acid substitution. These findings demonstrate the wide spectrum of hu-LAT-27 reactivity, suggesting that hu-LAT-27 may be a candidate drug for prophylactic passive immunization against HTLV-1 infection.","['Mizuguchi, Mariko', 'Takahashi, Yoshiaki', 'Tanaka, Reiko', 'Fukushima, Takuya', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu']","['Mizuguchi M', 'Takahashi Y', 'Tanaka R', 'Fukushima T', 'Tanaka Y']",,"['Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara-cho, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara-cho, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara-cho, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematoimmunology, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara-cho, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara-cho, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200127,Switzerland,Pathogens,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",101596317,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV-1 envelope gp46', 'adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL)', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)', 'neutralization epitope']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:01,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['pathogens9020082 [pii]', '10.3390/pathogens9020082 [doi]']",epublish,Pathogens. 2020 Jan 27;9(2). pii: pathogens9020082. doi: 10.3390/pathogens9020082.,PMC7168584,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],"['JP19fk0108060/AMED', 'JP17K14988/JSPS KAKENHI']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is a well-established characteristic of CLL, and the robust nature of miRNAs makes them eminently suitable liquid biopsy biomarkers. Using a nested case-control study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), the predictive values of five promising human miRNAs (hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-29a-3p, hsa-miR-150-5p, hsa-miR-155-5p and hsa-miR-223-3p), identified in a pilot study, were examined in serum of 224 CLL cases (diagnosed 3 months to 18 years after enrollment) and 224 matched controls using Taqman based assays. Conditional logistic regressions were applied to adjust for potential confounders. The median time from blood collection to CLL diagnosis was 10 years (p25-p75: 7-13 years). Overall, the upregulation of hsa-miR-150-5p, hsa-miR-155-5p and hsa-miR-29a-3p was associated with subsequent risk of CLL [OR1Ct-unit increase (95%CI) = 1.42 (1.18-1.72), 1.64 (1.31-2.04) and 1.75 (1.31-2.34) for hsa-miR-150-5p, hsa-miR-155-5p and hsa-miR-29a-3p, respectively] and the strongest associations were observed within 10 years of diagnosis. However, the predictive performance of these miRNAs was modest (area under the curve <0.62). hsa-miR-16-5p and hsa-miR-223-3p levels were unrelated to CLL risk. The findings of this first prospective study suggest that hsa-miR-29a, hsa-miR-150-5p and hsa-miR-155-5p were upregulated in early stages of CLL but were modest predictive biomarkers of CLL risk.","['Casabonne, Delphine', 'Benavente, Yolanda', 'Seifert, Julia', 'Costas, Laura', 'Armesto, Maria', 'Arestin, Maria', 'Besson, Caroline', 'Hosnijeh, Fatemeh S', 'Duell, Eric J', 'Weiderpass, Elisabete', 'Masala, Giovanna', 'Kaaks, Rudolf', 'Canzian, Federico', 'Chirlaque, Maria-Dolores', 'Perduca, Vittorio', 'Mancini, Francesca R', 'Pala, Valeria', 'Trichopoulou, Antonia', 'Karakatsani, Anna', 'La Vecchia, Carlo', 'Sanchez, Maria-Jose', 'Tumino, Rosario', 'Gunter, Marc J', 'Amiano, Pilar', 'Panico, Salvatore', 'Sacerdote, Carlotta', 'Schmidt, Julie A', 'Boeing, Heiner', 'Schulze, Matthias B', 'Barricarte, Aurelio', 'Riboli, Elio', 'Olsen, Anja', 'Tjonneland, Anne', 'Vermeulen, Roel', 'Nieters, Alexandra', 'Lawrie, Charles H', 'de Sanjose, Silvia']","['Casabonne D', 'Benavente Y', 'Seifert J', 'Costas L', 'Armesto M', 'Arestin M', 'Besson C', 'Hosnijeh FS', 'Duell EJ', 'Weiderpass E', 'Masala G', 'Kaaks R', 'Canzian F', 'Chirlaque MD', 'Perduca V', 'Mancini FR', 'Pala V', 'Trichopoulou A', 'Karakatsani A', 'La Vecchia C', 'Sanchez MJ', 'Tumino R', 'Gunter MJ', 'Amiano P', 'Panico S', 'Sacerdote C', 'Schmidt JA', 'Boeing H', 'Schulze MB', 'Barricarte A', 'Riboli E', 'Olsen A', 'Tjonneland A', 'Vermeulen R', 'Nieters A', 'Lawrie CH', 'de Sanjose S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7874-3707', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4364-7173', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7572-9715', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5256-0163', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2237-0128', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2297-3869', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1441-897X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8008-5096', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7733-8750']","['Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red: Epidemiologia y Salud Publica (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.', 'Unit of Molecular and Genetic Epidemiology in Infections and Cancer, Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO-IDIBELL), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red: Epidemiologia y Salud Publica (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.', 'Unit of Molecular and Genetic Epidemiology in Infections and Cancer, Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO-IDIBELL), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Molecular Oncology Group, Biodonostia Research Institute, San Sebastian, Spain.', 'Unit of Molecular and Genetic Epidemiology in Infections and Cancer, Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO-IDIBELL), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Molecular Oncology Group, Biodonostia Research Institute, San Sebastian, Spain.', 'Molecular Oncology Group, Biodonostia Research Institute, San Sebastian, Spain.', 'CESP, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris-Sud, UVSQ, INSERM, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hospital of Versailles, Le Chesnay, France.', 'Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Division of Environmental Epidemiology, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Laboratory Medical Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Unit of Nutrition and Cancer, Cancer Epidemiology Research Program, Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO-IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain."", 'International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization, Lyon, France.', 'Cancer Risk Factors and Life-Style Epidemiology Unit, Institute for Cancer Research, Prevention and Clinical Network -

Blood samples from 41 normal weight and 41 overweight children of the Lifestyle Immune System Allergy (LISA) study were analyzed with respect to MAIT cell surface and activation markers [CD107a, CD137, CD69, interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha] after Escherichia coli stimulation, mRNA expression of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) and major histocompatibility complex class I-related gene protein (MR1), the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-8 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha as well as the concentrations of 13 conjugated and unconjugated BAs. Higher body weight was associated with reduced MAIT cell activation and expression of natural killer cell marker (NKp80) and chemokine receptor (CXCR3). BA concentrations were positively associated with the inflammatory parameters CRP, IL-8 and MIP-1alpha, but were negatively associated with the number of activated MAIT cells and the MAIT cell transcription factor PLZF. These relationships were exclusively found with conjugated BAs. BA-mediated inhibition of MAIT cell activation was confirmed in vitro. Thus, conjugated BAs have the capacity to modulate the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses.","['Mendler, A', 'Pierzchalski, A', 'Bauer, M', 'Roder, S', 'Sattler, A', 'Standl, M', 'Borte, M', 'von Bergen, M', 'Rolle-Kampczyk, U', 'Herberth, G']","['Mendler A', 'Pierzchalski A', 'Bauer M', 'Roder S', 'Sattler A', 'Standl M', 'Borte M', 'von Bergen M', 'Rolle-Kampczyk U', 'Herberth G']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5752-038X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0212-3509']","['Department of Environmental Immunology, UFZ-Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Environmental Immunology, UFZ-Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Environmental Immunology, UFZ-Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Environmental Immunology, UFZ-Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department for General, Visceral, and Vascular Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.', ""Children's Hospital, Municipal Hospital 'St Georg', Academic Teaching Hospital of the University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany."", 'Department of Molecular Systems Biology, UFZ-Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Systems Biology, UFZ-Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Environmental Immunology, UFZ-Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200217,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*immunology', 'Bile Acids and Salts/*immunology', '*Body Weight', 'Cytokines/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mucosal-Associated Invariant T Cells/cytology/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*MAIT cell activation', '*MAIT cells', '*bile acids', '*body weight', '*conjugated bile acids']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/02/04 06:00'],"['2020/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cei.13423 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2020 May;200(2):199-213. doi: 10.1111/cei.13423.

Loncastuximab tesirine is an antibody-drug conjugate against CD19, an antigen expressed in many B-cell malignancies. This open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation, dose-expansion study assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PKs), immunogenicity, and preliminary clinical activity of loncastuximab tesirine in adults with R/R B-ALL. A total of 35 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 55 years (range, 20-80) and a median of 3 prior therapies (range, 1-15). All patients received at least 1 IV infusion of loncastuximab tesirine at 15 to 150 mug/kg once every 3 weeks (Q3W; n = 30) or 50 mug/kg IV weekly (n = 5). Common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were nausea (42.9%), febrile neutropenia (37.1%), and reversible liver test abnormalities. Grade >/=3 TEAEs were reported in 85.7% patients, most commonly febrile neutropenia and other hematologic abnormalities and reversible liver test abnormalities. There were no treatment-related deaths. Four patients (11.4%) had grade 2 infusion-related reactions, and 1 patient (150 mug/kg Q3W) had a dose-limiting toxicity of hyperbilirubinemia that resolved within 6 days without further action. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Three patients achieved complete responses, 1 each at 30, 120, and 150 mug/kg Q3W. PK studies showed marked interpatient variability, with target-mediated drug disposition seeming to contribute to time- and dose-dependent disposition. No clinically relevant anti-drug-antibody formation occurred. The trial was terminated in the dose-escalation phase because of slow accrual.

AIM: We report a case of a 57-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who manifested a left breast mass, two years and four months after the initial diagnosis and treatRomament of NSCLC. METHOD: Physical examination revealed a poorly defined mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast, suspicious for breast cancer. After mammography results, the patient underwent Fine Needle Aspiration that was indicative of cancer. He underwent then modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. Histology and immunohistochemical analyses were conducted, that revealed a NSCLC that metastasized to the left breast.

However, compared with other cancers, there is a lack of studies assessing adherence, health care resource utilization, and costs in patients with these cancers. OBJECTIVE: To assess factors associated with adherence to oral oncolytic therapies, health care utilization, and costs in patients with CLL/SLL or MM. METHODS: A retrospective database study was conducted using the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Medicare Supplement databases. Adults (aged >/= 18 years) diagnosed with and prescribed an oral oncolytic for CLL/SLL (ibrutinib or idelalisib) or MM (thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide) between 2013 and 2016 and with continuous eligibility 6 months before and 12 months after oral oncolytic initiation were identified. Adherence to oral oncolytics was measured using the proportion of days covered (PDC) metric. Multiple linear regression and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify adherence predictors. Count models assessed the relationship between adherence and resource utilization, and generalized linear models assessed the relationship between adherence and health care costs. RESULTS: A total of 701 and 2,385 patients were identified with CLL/SLL or MM, respectively. Mean PDC (SD) for CLL/SLL and MM patients was 75.3 (22.5) and 57.6 (26.5), respectively. For CLL/SLL patients, those aged >/= 65 years (beta [B] = -4.00) had lower medication use. Among MM patients, multiple predictors of higher medication use emerged: aged >/= 65 years (B = 3.44), higher than average outpatient resource utilization (B = 3.53), insurance plan other than preferred provider organization (PPO; B = -2.58), previous cancer therapy (B = -2.81), higher number of concurrent unique therapeutic classes (B = -0.35), and higher comorbidity burden (B = -2.55). Patients with CLL/SLL and enrolled in plans other than a PPO were more likely to be adherent (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.01-1.98), whereas patients who were aged >/= 65 years, were residents of the southern United States, and had visited the emergency department in the baseline period were less likely to be adherent. For MM patients, those aged >/= 65 years (OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.38-2.04) and with higher than average outpatient services utilization (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.01-1.52) were more likely to be adherent, whereas those enrolled in plans other than a PPO, previously treated with cancer therapy, and with higher comorbidity burden were less likely to be adherent. In both cohorts, adherent patients had significantly lower odds of health care utilization and incurred lower medical costs, but higher prescription costs, following oncolytic initiation; however, total costs were not significantly lower in those adherent. CONCLUSIONS: Factors were identified that influenced adherence at the patient, treatment, and health system levels. These factors can be used to identify patients requiring interventions for improving medication-taking behavior and associated health care burden. DISCLOSURES: This study received no outside funding.

Several studies recently reported that components of the rRNA methylation complex are associated with leukemogenesis. However, no study ever investigated the alteration of ribosome biogenesis factors in the most common pediatric malignancy - B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine the expression of factors building the rRNA methylation complex, either the protein components (1 methyl-transferase (FBL), NOP56, NOP58, NHP2L1) or some RNA components (box C/D snoRNAs: SNORD35B, SNORD65, SNORD46, SNORD50A, SNORD38B), as well as CMYC, and nucleolin (NCL) - a protein involved in rRNA synthesis. Clinical effects in children with BCP-ALL were also investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The factors involved in ribosome biogenesis were studied in 28 children with BCP-ALL with the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the BioMark HD System (Fluidigm, San Francisco, USA) in cDNA prepared from the bone marrow samples collected at diagnosis. RESULTS: Strong correlations were observed between NOP56, NOP58 and NCL, and multiple weaker correlations were observed in the box C/D snoRNA category, and between box C/D snoRNA and transcripts coding proteins of the rRNA methylation complex. The expression of analyzed transcripts did not correlate with the initial white blood cells count (WBC) or with bone marrow blast percentage. Ribosome biogenesis upregulation with overexpression of FBL and NOP56, and CMYC was found in patients who subsequently relapsed and the upregulation signature was not associated with known risk predictors. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on the clinical aspect of ribosome biogenesis in pediatric BCP-ALL, and it shows that overexpression of CMYC and C/D box nucleoproteins FBL and NOP56 is an antecedent event in patients who subsequently relapse. The dysregulation pattern is different from the previous reports in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggesting that dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis is specific for BCP-ALL.","['Ussowicz, Marek', 'Marcel, Virginie', 'Long, Flora Nguyen Van', 'Kazanowska, Bernarda', 'Diaz, Jean-Jacques', 'Wolowiec, Dariusz']","['Ussowicz M', 'Marcel V', 'Long FNV', 'Kazanowska B', 'Diaz JJ', 'Wolowiec D']",,"['Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'The Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Centre Leon Berard, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon, France.', 'The Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Centre Leon Berard, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'The Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Centre Leon Berard, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon, France.', 'Department and Clinic of Hematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Adv Clin Exp Med,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,101138582,IM,,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Pilot Projects', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', '*RNA, Ribosomal', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence', '*Ribosomes/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', '*methylation', '*pediatric', '*relapse', '*ribosome']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/03/05 06:00,['2020/02/04 06:00'],"['2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.17219/acem/112608 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Clin Exp Med. 2020 Jan;29(1):107-113. doi: 10.17219/acem/112608.,,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NOP56 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: By referring to electronic medical records, the demographic characteristics, diagnosis, test, and treatment information including ABT were collected. According to the risk stratification of the CCCG-ALL-2015 protocol, ABTs between groups were compared, and the differences were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-three newly treated children with ALL were enrolled in this study, who received 643.5 U of red blood cells and 377.6 U of platelets (PLTs) during the VDLP. The amount of ABT in the intermediate-risk (IR) group (n=102) was significantly higher than that in the low-risk group (n=61), which were reflected in the red blood cells in the first half of VDLP (P=0.033) and the PLTs in the second half of VDLP (P<0.001). Meanwhile, the PLT counts in the IR group were significantly lower in the same period. The time node was bounded by the minimal residual disease test on the 19th day. CONCLUSIONS: Children in the IR group or with unsatisfactory induction may need more ABTs during the VDLP, and the relatively low PLT counts seem to contribute to this. The results of this study can provide a basis for patient blood management, as well as a reference for studying the long-term effects of ABT on children with ALL.","['Sun, Jun-Bo', 'Lu, Ying-Yu', 'Huang, Ling-Ling', 'Yu, Qian-Qian', 'Tu, Song-Ji', 'Xie, Zhi-Wei']","['Sun JB', 'Lu YY', 'Huang LL', 'Yu QQ', 'Tu SJ', 'Xie ZW']",,"['Department of Blood Transfusion.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Blood Transfusion.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Blood Transfusion/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,,2020/02/06 06:00,2021/01/01 06:00,['2020/02/04 06:00'],"['2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001741 [doi]', '00043426-202008000-00013 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2020 Aug;42(6):e410-e415. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001741.,,,,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a fraction of patients, achieving complete cytogenetic response after TKI therapy, develop a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with additional clonal chromosomal abnormalities in Philadelphia-negative cells (CCA/Ph-). PATIENT CONCERNS: A 56-year-old woman with AML, developing from Philadelphia-negative CML after TKI therapy. She showed 6 kinds of somatic variants-CEBPA, ATRX, WT1, CSMD1, IKZF1, and LRP1B mutation after diagnosed as AML. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with chronic phase CML that developed to AML after achieving durable complete cytogenetic response (CCR) and major molecular response (MMR). INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with TKI therapy at the period of CML. When diagnosed with AML, she received induction chemotherapy regimens, consolidation therapy, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation subsequently. OUTCOMES: The patient has been CCR and MMR for nearly 4 years, and has achieved complete remission after intervention related to AML. She is now preparing for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. LESSONS: These rare occurrences highlight the importance of exploring the relevant pathogenesis of AML developing from CML after TKI therapy.

To better investigate the effects of LQFM030 regarding the p53 mutation status, this study investigated the antiproliferative activity of LQFM030 against the p53-null K562 leukemia cells as well as the cell death pathways involved. In addition, the effects of LQFM030 on the levels of the p53/MDM2 complex were also carried out using 3T3 cells as a p53 wild-type model. Our data suggest that LQFM030 triggered apoptosis in K562 cells via different mechanisms including cell cycle arrest, caspase activation, reduction of mitochondrial activity, decrease in MDM2 expression, and transcriptional modulation of MDMX, p73, MYC, and NF-kB. Additionally, it promoted effects in p53/MDM2 binding in p53 wild-type 3T3 cells. Therefore, LQFM030 has antiproliferative effects in cancer cells by a p53 mutation status-independent manner with different signaling pathways. These findings open new perspectives to the treatment of leukemic cells considering the resistance development associated with cancer treatment with conventional cytotoxic drugs.","['de Oliveira Ribeiro, Higor', 'Cortez, Alane Pereira', 'de Avila, Renato Ivan', 'da Silva, Artur Christian Garcia', 'de Carvalho, Flavio Silva', 'Menegatti, Ricardo', 'Liao, Luciano Morais', 'Valadares, Marize Campos']","['de Oliveira Ribeiro H', 'Cortez AP', 'de Avila RI', 'da Silva ACG', 'de Carvalho FS', 'Menegatti R', 'Liao LM', 'Valadares MC']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0379-1325'],"['Laboratory of Education and Research in In Vitro Toxicology - Tox In, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Goias, Goiania, 74605-220, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Education and Research in In Vitro Toxicology - Tox In, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Goias, Goiania, 74605-220, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Education and Research in In Vitro Toxicology - Tox In, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Goias, Goiania, 74605-220, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Education and Research in In Vitro Toxicology - Tox In, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Goias, Goiania, 74605-220, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Quimica Farmaceutica Medicinal (LQFM), Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Goias, Goiania, 74605-220, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Quimica Farmaceutica Medicinal (LQFM), Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Goias, Goiania, 74605-220, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Ressonancia Magnetica Nuclear, Instituto de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Goias, Goiania, 74605-220, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Education and Research in In Vitro Toxicology - Tox In, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Goias, Goiania, 74605-220, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200314,England,Fundam Clin Pharmacol,Fundamental & clinical pharmacology,8710411,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'BALB 3T3 Cells', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*deficiency/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['MDM2', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'drug discovery', 'nutlins', 'p53']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/04/21 06:00,['2020/02/04 06:00'],"['2019/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/fcp.12540 [doi]'],ppublish,Fundam Clin Pharmacol. 2020 Aug;34(4):444-457. doi: 10.1111/fcp.12540.

The emergence of these mutations in the era of second-generation TKIs, such as dasatinib and nilotinib, remains an evolving field. We conducted a retrospective study to quantitatively characterize the BCR-ABL transcript and mutation status during treatment with first-generation and second-generation TKI therapies. BCR-ABL mutations were detected by direct sequencing for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukaemia receiving TKI therapies. The efficacy of TKI therapy was quantitatively assessed by calculating the log reduction of BCR-ABL transcripts, which was measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Fisher's exact test was performed to analyse the associations of log reduction <3 and mutation status. We found 35 patients harbouring 55 mutations of 43 different types, of which 30% occurred in patients receiving imatinib, 27% in nilotinib, and 43% in dasatinib. We found a novel germline mutation, N336 N (AACAAT), and two novel frameshift mutations, Asn358Thr fs*14 and Gly251Ala fs*16. T315I was the most common missense mutation, followed by V299L and F317L. Intron 8 35-bp insertion was the most frequent frameshift mutation. Both missense and multiple BCR-ABL mutations were significantly associated with worse molecular response compared with the molecular response of patients without mutation. Missense mutations, rather than frameshift, were associated with less log reduction, while the T315I, F317L, and T315A mutations were significantly correlated with poor log reduction. Collectively, amino acid substitutions at T315I, F317L, and T315A accounted for the majority of missense mutations and the loss of major molecular response. Mutation analysis is essential for patients receiving TKI therapy who exhibit an unfavourable response. The present study provided a landscape of BCR-ABL mutations in the era of second-generation TKIs.","['Chien, Sheng-Hsuan', 'Liu, Hsueng-Mei', 'Chen, Po-Ming', 'Ko, Po-Shen', 'Lin, Jeong-Shi', 'Chen, Ying-Ju', 'Lee, Li-Hsuan', 'Hsiao, Liang-Tsai', 'Chiou, Tzeon-Jye', 'Gau, Jyh-Pyng', 'Yang, Muh-Hwa', 'Liu, Chun-Yu']","['Chien SH', 'Liu HM', 'Chen PM', 'Ko PS', 'Lin JS', 'Chen YJ', 'Lee LH', 'Hsiao LT', 'Chiou TJ', 'Gau JP', 'Yang MH', 'Liu CY']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4820-8500', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9284-6665', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2336-4731']","['Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Food and Science and biotechnology, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Oncology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Oncology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200224,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'log reduction', 'mutation', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2020/02/04 06:00'],"['2019/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2721 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2020 Aug;38(3):390-398. doi: 10.1002/hon.2721.

There are various types of biomarkers based on their application and molecular alterations. Treatment-sensitivity or drug resistance biomarkers include prognostic and predictive molecules with utmost importance in selecting appropriate treatment protocols and improving survival rates. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most prevalent hematological malignancy diagnosed in children with nearly 80% cure rate. Despite the favorable survival rates of childhood ALL (chALL), resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and, as a consequence, a dismal prognosis develops in a significant number of patients. Therefore, there are urgent needs to have robust, sensitive, and disease-specific molecular prognostic and predictive biomarkers, which could allow better risk classification and then better clinical results. In this article, we review the currently known drug resistance biomarkers, including somatic or germ line nucleic acids, epigenetic alterations, protein expressions and metabolic variations.

A 15-year-old male with NS was referred with suspicion of acute leukemia. Severe anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated CRP level were demonstrated in pre-hospital laboratory tests. Physical examination revealed generalized ichthyosiform erythroderma. ALL was diagnosed on the basis of bone marrow biopsy. The patient was initially classified as CNS3 status. No signals indicating fusion of BCR/ABL1, ETV6, and RUNX1 genes and MLL gene rearrangement were found in the cytogenetic analysis. The patient was qualified for chemotherapy and treated according to ALL IC-BFM 2009 protocol for high-risk ALL. During induction therapy, severe skin toxicity occurred (WHO grade III), which prompted the modification of treatment down to intermediate-risk strategy. In the course of reinduction therapy, severe chemotherapy-induced adverse drug reactions occurred, including progression of skin toxicity to WHO grade IV. The patient achieved complete remission. In view of life-threatening toxicities and the confirmed complete remission, intensive chemotherapy regimen was discontinued and maintenance treatment was started. Because of the baseline CNS3 status, the patient received cranial radiotherapy. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was used to identify disease-associated mutations. WES revealed two germline mutations: a novel premature termination variant in SPINK5 (p.Cys510(*)), along with a novel potentially pathogenic variant in NUP214 (p.Arg815Gln). Somatic mutations were known pathogenic variants of JAK2 (p.Arg683Gly), IL17RC (p.Ala303Thr), and potentially pathogenic non-synonymous variants of TTN (p.Gly1091Arg and p.Pro17245Leu), ACTN2 (p.Ile143Leu), TRPV3 (p.Arg729(*)), and COL7A1 (p.Glu2842fs) genes. Currently, the patient continues maintenance chemotherapy, with stable status of skin lesions and no features of ALL relapse. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ALL in a patient with NS. As has been presented, in such patients, optimal treatment according to the current protocols is extremely difficult. WES was used to confirm the diagnosis of Ph-like ALL in our patient. The detection of JAK2 gene mutation offers the possibility of therapy personalization. A specific signature of rare germline variants and somatic mutations can be proposed as a factor predisposing to the co-incidence of ALL and NS.","['Skoczen, Szymon', 'Stepien, Konrad', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech', 'Centkowski, Piotr', 'Kwiecinska, Kinga', 'Korostynski, Michal', 'Piechota, Marcin', 'Wyrobek, Elzbieta', 'Moryl-Bujakowska, Angelina', 'Strojny, Wojciech', 'Rej, Magdalena', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy', 'Balwierz, Walentyna']","['Skoczen S', 'Stepien K', 'Mlynarski W', 'Centkowski P', 'Kwiecinska K', 'Korostynski M', 'Piechota M', 'Wyrobek E', 'Moryl-Bujakowska A', 'Strojny W', 'Rej M', 'Kowalczyk J', 'Balwierz W']",,"[""Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', 'Student Scientific Group of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Student Scientific Group of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Molecular Neuropharmacology, Institute of Pharmacology of Polish Academy of Sciences, Krakow, Poland.', 'Intelliseq sp. z o.o., Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Molecular Neuropharmacology, Institute of Pharmacology of Polish Academy of Sciences, Krakow, Poland.', 'Intelliseq sp. z o.o., Krakow, Poland.', ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200117,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Netherton syndrome', 'children', 'leukemia', 'malignancy', 'mutation']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:01,['2020/02/04 06:00'],"['2019/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01477 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jan 17;9:1477. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01477. eCollection 2019.,PMC6978700,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Skoczen, Stepien, Mlynarski, Centkowski, Kwiecinska,', 'Korostynski, Piechota, Wyrobek, Moryl-Bujakowska, Strojny, Rej, Kowalczyk and', 'Balwierz.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new method was tested on three types of samples, including a phantom sample, human fingernail and leukemia cells. Compared to two common denoising methods, i.e. moving-average filtering and Savitzky-Golay filtering, the performance of the proposed method is significantly less sensitive to the choices of parameters.

We review unique toxicities of each of these in this article. Blinatumomab, a bispecific T cell engager, has been associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurological toxicities, both of which can be prevented and managed with corticosteroids. Inotuzumab is a calicheamicin-conjugated CD22 targeting antibody. The calicheamicin component of the drug is likely associated with the hepatotoxicity seen with inotuzumab, especially sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, which can happen both in the context of the drug alone, and also with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. QT prolongation has also been noted with inotuzumab. CAR T therapy uses genetically modified autologous T cells directed against CD19, a known target on B cells. CRS and neurological symptoms, formally termed as immune-effector-cell-associated neurological syndrome, have been described along with hypogammaglobulinemia, cytopenias, and infections.","['Jain, Tania', 'Litzow, Mark R']","['Jain T', 'Litzow MR']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9816-6302'],"['Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 1650 Orleans Street, 3M88, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200120,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['blinatumomab', 'chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy', 'inotuzumab']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:01,['2020/02/04 06:00'],"['2019/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620719899897 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620719899897 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2020 Jan 20;11:2040620719899897. doi: 10.1177/2040620719899897. eCollection 2020.,PMC6971963,"['Conflict of interest statement: TJ declares no conflicts of interest in preparing', 'this article.

Exposure to total body irradiation (TBI), alkylating agent and graft versus host disease (GvHD) can all affect sexual function, leading to problems in sexual desire, arousal and the orgasm phase of the sexual response cycle. In high-risk haematological malignancies, such as acute leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, HCT often offers the highest chance for long-term survival. In addition, these haematological diseases and HCT can have an impact on body image, self-esteem, (sexual) relationship and psychosocial factors, all of which are able to affect sexuality and sexual function. Five years post HCT, 80% of the female survivors and 46% of the male survivors report sexual dysfunction. It has been shown that these patients cope better after having discussed sexual health. While healthcare providers (HCPs) have the responsibility to address sexual issues, it has been demonstrated that 48%-82% HCT recipients reported not having discussed sexual issues with their HCPs and that only one-third of the HCPs routinely discussed sexual issues with their patients. HCPs describe a lack of knowledge and being uncomfortable with the topic as the most important reasons for not addressing sexual functioning. Even so, it would help >90% HCPs if the patient initiated discussing sexual issues. However, to empower patients addressing sexual issues, adequate comprehensive patient information is needed. In an effort to better meet the patients' need, a patient information sheet: 'Information for patients undergoing Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: the impact of the disease and treatment on sexual function and sexuality', has been created. In this review, we describe what is known about the impact of HCT on sexual function and briefly the management of sexual problems.","['Eeltink, Corien M', 'Incrocci, Luca', 'Leeuw, Irma M Verdonck-de', 'Zweegman, Sonja']","['Eeltink CM', 'Incrocci L', 'Leeuw IMV', 'Zweegman S']",,"['Amsterdam University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Erasmus MC, 3015 GD Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Department of Clinical Psychology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers (Amsterdam UMC), location VUmc, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, EMGO+ Institute, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191212,England,Ecancermedicalscience,Ecancermedicalscience,101392236,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['communication', 'haematopoietic cell transplantation', 'patient information', 'sexual function', 'sexuality']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:01,['2020/02/04 06:00'],"['2019/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3332/ecancer.2019.987 [doi]', 'can-13-987 [pii]']",epublish,Ecancermedicalscience. 2019 Dec 12;13:987. doi: 10.3332/ecancer.2019.987. eCollection 2019.,PMC6974367,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,['(c) the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human NK cell activation and function are regulated by an array of HLA class I-specific inhibitory receptors and activating receptors recognizing ligands expressed de novo on tumor or virus-infected cells. NK cells have been exploited in immunotherapy of cancer, including: (1) the in vivo infusion of IL-2 or IL-15, cytokines inducing activation and proliferation of NK cells that are frequently impaired in cancer patients. Nonetheless, the significant toxicity experienced, primarily with IL-2, limited their use except for combination therapies, e.g., IL-15 with checkpoint inhibitors; (2) the adoptive immunotherapy with cytokine-induced NK cells had effect on some melanoma metastases (lung), while other localizations were not affected; (3) a remarkable evolution of adoptive cell therapy is represented by NK cells engineered with CAR-targeting tumor antigens (CAR-NK). CAR-NK cells complement CAR-T cells as they do not cause GvHD and may be obtained from unrelated donors. Accordingly, CAR-NK cells may represent an ""off-the-shelf"" tool, readily available for effective tumor therapy; (4) the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy in cancer is also witnessed by the alphabetaT cell- and B cell-depleted haploidentical HSC transplantation in which the infusion of donor NK cells and gammadeltaT cells, together with HSC, sharply reduces leukemia relapses and infections; (5) a true revolution in tumor therapy is the use of mAbs targeting checkpoint inhibitors including PD-1, CTLA-4, the HLA class I-specific KIR, and NKG2A. Since PD-1 is expressed not only by tumor-associated T cells but also by NK cells, its blocking might unleash NK cells playing a crucial effector role against HLA class I-deficient tumors that are undetectable by T cells.","['Vacca, Paola', 'Pietra, Gabriella', 'Tumino, Nicola', 'Munari, Enrico', 'Mingari, Maria Cristina', 'Moretta, Lorenzo']","['Vacca P', 'Pietra G', 'Tumino N', 'Munari E', 'Mingari MC', 'Moretta L']",,"['Immunology Research Area, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'UOC Immunology, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine (DIMES), Universita di Genova, Genoa, Italy.', 'Immunology Research Area, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology, IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria, Negrar, Italy.', 'UOC Immunology, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine (DIMES), Center of Excellence for Biomedical Research, Universita di Genova, Genoa, Italy.', 'Immunology Research Area, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200117,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,,"['Animals', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/genetics/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*NK cells', '*anti-tumor therapy', '*immunotherapy', '*inhibitory checkpoints', '*innate immunity']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/02/04 06:00'],"['2019/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.03013 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Jan 17;10:3013. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.03013. eCollection 2019.,PMC6978749,,,"['0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)']","['Copyright (c) 2020 Vacca, Pietra, Tumino, Munari, Mingari and Moretta.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to determine whether this intervention would be cost-effective in Spain. Methods: A partitioned survival model with five health states was developed (diagnosis and induction, complete remission, no complete remission, transplantation and death). A lifetime time horizon and the Spanish National Health System perspective were adopted. During the first three years, permanence in the different health states was determined according to the results of the RATIFY study. In successive years, the death rates of the Spanish population adjusted by a factor to reflect long-term disease-related mortality were used. Utilities were obtained from the literature. Pharmacological costs (first and second line) and the costs of other health resources (hospitalizations, visits and tests) were included. The robustness of the model was evaluated by deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: The addition of midostaurin resulted in 1.46 life years gained (LYG) and 1.23 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained and implied an additional cost of euro 47,955, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro 32,854/LYG and an incremental cost-utility ratio of euro 38,985/QALY. In the univariate sensitivity analysis, the threshold of euro 50,000/QALY was not exceeded in any case; taking into consideration potential discounts of 20-40% in the PVL of midostaurin the ICER would be below euro 30,000/QALY, a commonly accepted threshold in Spain. In the probabilistic analysis, when the threshold was euro 50,000/QALY, midostaurin was cost-effective in 82.3% of simulations. Conclusion: According to our modeling, midostaurin, in combination with standard chemotherapy, could be an efficient alternative for the treatment of FLT3-AML in Spain.","['Arenaza, Ainhoa', 'Diez, Raul', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Di Nicolantonio, Roberta', 'Gostkorzewicz, Joana', 'Martinez, Carlos', 'Martinez Llinas, Diana', 'Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Moure-Fernandez, Aida', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Vinent, Joan Lluis']","['Arenaza A', 'Diez R', 'Esteve J', 'Di Nicolantonio R', 'Gostkorzewicz J', 'Martinez C', 'Martinez Llinas D', 'Martinez-Lopez J', 'Montesinos P', 'Moure-Fernandez A', 'Sierra J', 'Vinent JL']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9627-5337', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0802-3181', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7908-0063']","['Pharmacy Department, Clinico San Carlos Hospital, Madrid, Spain.', 'Pharmacy Department, University De Getafe Hospital, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Clinic Hospital, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Health Economics and Outcome Research, Novartis Farmaceutica S.A., Madrid, Spain.', 'Health Economics and Outcome Research, Novartis Farmaceutica S.A., Madrid, Spain.', 'Pharmacy Department, University Hospital Araba, Vitoria, Spain.', 'Oblikue Consulting, S.L., Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital 12 de Octubre, CNIO, Complutense University, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital La Fe, Valencia, & CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Oblikue Consulting, S.L., Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Pharmacy Department, Sant Joan de Deu Hospital, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191113,New Zealand,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,ClinicoEconomics and outcomes research : CEOR,101560564,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'economic evaluation', 'efficiency', 'health economics', 'modeling']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:01,['2020/02/04 06:00'],"['2019/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CEOR.S222879 [doi]', '222879 [pii]']",epublish,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res. 2019 Nov 13;11:683-694. doi: 10.2147/CEOR.S222879. eCollection 2019.,PMC6859089,"['AA, RD, JE, CM, JS and JLV are, respectively, employed by San Carlos Hospital,', 'University Hospital of Getafe, Clinic Hospital of Barcelona, University Hospital', 'of Araba, Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau and Hospital Sant Joan de Deu.

However, our molecular understanding of the virus is rudimentary, and it is necessary to study the biological properties of its envelope proteins as therapeutic targets and to develop strategies to control infection. We developed a solid viral pseudotyped particle (pp) platform to study avian influenza virus, including the functional analysis of its hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) envelope glycoproteins, the reassortment characteristics of the HAs and NAs, receptors, tropisms, neutralizing antibodies, diagnosis, infectivity, for the purposes of drug development and vaccine design. Here, we describe an experimental procedure to establish pps with the envelope glycoproteins (HA, NA) from two influenza A strains (HAPI H5N1 and 2013 avian H7N9). Their generation is based on the capacity of some viruses, such as murine leukemia virus (MLV), to incorporate envelope glycoproteins into a pp. In addition, we also detail how these pps are quantified with RT-qPCR, and the infectivity detection of native and mismatched virus pps depending on the origin of the HAs and NAs. This system is highly flexible and adaptable and can be used to establish viral pps with envelope glycoproteins that can be incorporated in any other type of enveloped virus. Thus, this viral particle platform can be used to study wild viruses in many research investigations.","['Zhang, Fengwei', 'Wang, Yanan', 'Shang, Xuechai', 'Wang, Shanshan', 'Xiao, Rong', 'Zhou, Hongjuan', 'Cai, Long']","['Zhang F', 'Wang Y', 'Shang X', 'Wang S', 'Xiao R', 'Zhou H', 'Cai L']",,"['Central Laboratory, Hang Zhou Red Cross Hospital; tome_walker@zcmu.edu.cn.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Yuhang District Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital.', 'Central Laboratory, Hang Zhou Red Cross Hospital.', 'Central Laboratory, Hang Zhou Red Cross Hospital.', 'Central Laboratory, Hang Zhou Red Cross Hospital.', 'Central Laboratory, Hang Zhou Red Cross Hospital.', 'Central Laboratory, Hang Zhou Red Cross Hospital; cailong@hz.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20200115,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,IM,,"['Animals', 'Birds', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype/*pathogenicity', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Influenza, Human/*virology', 'Virion/*metabolism']",,,2020/02/06 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2020/02/04 06:00'],"['2020/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/60663 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2020 Jan 15;(155). doi: 10.3791/60663.,,,,['0 (Glycoproteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical pathology evaluation revealed a marked leukocytosis with bicytopenia. A serum protein electrophoresis was consistent with monoclonal gammopathy. The architecture of the lymph node, spleen, and thymus were variably effaced by neoplastic cells, which also infiltrated other tissues. Immunohistochemistry of the affected tissues confirmed a predominant population of CD20+, CD79a+, CD3-, CD68-, and CD34-neoplastic cells. The full data best support a diagnosis of Stage V lymphoma. Nextgen sequencing and negative prestudy serology results suggested a recent infection by macaque lymphocryptovirus (mLCV) with a unique transcriptional profile comparable with a rarely observed direct LCV infection model. This infection model might be associated with a temporary lack of an LCV antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell adaptive immune response. Consistent with the established mechanisms of LCV-related lymphoproliferation, MYC and BCL2L11 gene expression were increased and decreased, respectively. While there was no overt immunosuppression, immunophenotyping revealed the index animal had a relatively low NK cell count, which further decreased by >50% on day 24 of the study. In addition to the temporary lack of adaptive immunity, the low NK cell counts were suggestive of an impaired innate immunity to control the virally-transformed cells and the subsequent unchecked lymphoproliferation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a Stage V lymphoma with a unique pathogenesis in an otherwise immunocompetent cynomolgus monkey.","['Adedeji, Adeyemi O', 'Vemireddi, Vimala', 'Tripathi, Niraj', 'Durinck, Steffen', 'Maher, Jonathan M', 'Vucic, Domagoj', 'Halpern, Wendy']","['Adedeji AO', 'Vemireddi V', 'Tripathi N', 'Durinck S', 'Maher JM', 'Vucic D', 'Halpern W']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5153-1990'],"['Genentech, A Member of the Roche Group, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Covance Laboratories, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Covance Laboratories, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Genentech, A Member of the Roche Group, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Genentech, A Member of the Roche Group, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Genentech, A Member of the Roche Group, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Genentech, A Member of the Roche Group, South San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200203,United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,IM,,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Herpesviridae Infections/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Immunophenotyping/veterinary', 'Lymphocryptovirus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Monkey Diseases/*diagnosis/pathology/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary/virology']",['NOTNLM'],"['cynomolgus monkey', 'leukemia', 'lymphocryptovirus', 'lymphoma']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/01/26 06:00,['2020/02/04 06:00'],"['2019/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/vcp.12822 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2020 Mar;49(1):130-136. doi: 10.1111/vcp.12822.

MDS are heterogeneous in nature but uniformly characterized by chronic and progressive cytopenia from ineffective hematopoiesis, dysplasia in single or multiple lineages, and transformation to acute leukemia in a subset of patients. The genomic landscape revealed by next-generation sequencing has provided a comprehensive picture of the molecular pathways involved in MDS pathogenesis. Recurrent mutational targets in MDS are the genes involved in RNA splicing, DNA methylation, histone modification, transcription, signal transduction, cohesin complex and DNA repair. Sequential acquisition of mutations in these sets of genes serves as a driver for the initiation, clonal evolution and progression of MDS. Based on these findings, novel agents targeting driver mutations of MDS are currently under development and expected to improve the clinical outcome of MDS in the coming decades.","['Nakajima, Hideaki']",['Nakajima H'],,"['Department of Stem Cell and Immune Regulation, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200201,Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,IM,,"['DNA Methylation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Mutation', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/therapy', 'RNA Splicing']",['NOTNLM'],"['MDS', 'epigenome', 'genome', 'molecular pathogenesis', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'treatment']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/04/15 06:00,['2020/02/04 06:00'],"['2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.2169/internalmedicine.4214-19 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med. 2021 Jan 1;60(1):15-23. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.4214-19.

In the present study, we examined Tax-specific T-cell responses in C57BL/6 mice after syngeneic transplantation with tax-transgenic mouse-derived ATL (mATL) cells. We first confirmed that cellular tax cDNAs are mostly maintained and detectable in the spleen three weeks after mATL cell transplantation. However, mATL cell transplantation did not induce significant Tax-specific T-cell responses. Mice immunized with DNA and adenovirus vectors expressing Tax exhibited Tax-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses but showed no enhancement of the responses or reduction in cellular tax cDNA levels after mATL cell transplantation. This study provides an animal model for analyzing the interaction between ATL cells and host immune responses as well as indicates the limited impact of Tax-specific T-cell responses on the proliferation of ATL cells.","['Nakamura-Hoshi, Midori', 'Suzuki, Tadaki', 'Ainai, Akira', 'Hasegawa, Hideki', 'Ishii, Hiroshi', 'Matano, Tetsuro']","['Nakamura-Hoshi M', 'Suzuki T', 'Ainai A', 'Hasegawa H', 'Ishii H', 'Matano T']",,"['AIDS Research Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases.', 'Global Virus Network.', 'Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases.', 'Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases.', 'Global Virus Network.', 'AIDS Research Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases.', 'AIDS Research Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases.', 'The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo.', 'Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200131,Japan,Jpn J Infect Dis,Japanese journal of infectious diseases,100893704,IM,,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genes, pX/*genetics/*immunology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Vaccination']",['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'HTLV-1', 'T-cell response', 'tax']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/01/30 06:00,['2020/02/04 06:00'],"['2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.7883/yoken.JJID.2019.494 [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Infect Dis. 2020 May 22;73(3):221-225. doi: 10.7883/yoken.JJID.2019.494.

However, patients with advanced neuroblastoma, metastatic Ewing's sarcoma family of tumor (ESFT), and metastatic osteosarcoma continue to have an extremely poor prognosis. Therefore novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to improve their survival. Apoptotic cell death is a key mechanism for normal cellular homeostasis. Intact apoptotic mechanisms are pivotal for embryonic development, tissue remodeling, immune regulation, and tumor regression. Genetic aberrations disrupting programmed cell death often underpin tumorigenesis and drug resistance. Moreover, it has been suggested that apoptosis or cell differentiation proceeds to spontaneous regression in early stage neuroblastoma. Therefore apoptosis or cell differentiation is a critical event in this cancer. We extracted many compounds from natural plants (Angelica keiskei, Alpinia officiarum, Lycaria puchury-major, Brassica rapa) or synthesized cyclophane pyridine, indirubin derivatives, vitamin K3 derivatives, burchellin derivatives, and GANT61, and examined their effects on apoptosis, cell differentiation, and cell cycle in neuroblastoma and ESFT cell lines compared with normal cells.

Accumulative evidence showed that specific alleles of HLA class II were associated with the susceptibility to malignant tumors including acute leukemia. In this study, we investigated the association between four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at HLA-DP/DQ and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) risk. We genotyped four SNPs in HLA-DP (rs3077 G > A and rs9277535 G > A) and HLA-DQ (rs2856718 A > G and rs7453920 G > A) in a case-control study of 545 AML cases and 1034 cancer-free controls using Taqman allelic discrimination assay. The associations between these SNPs and AML risk were estimated by computing the odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from multivariate logistic regression analysis. We found significant associations of the variant alleles in HLA-DP (rs3077 and rs9277535) and HLA-DQ rs7453920 with increased AML risk (adjusted OR = 1.29, 95%CI = 1.10-1.51for rs3077 in additive model; adjusted OR = 1.29, 95%CI = 1.11-1.51 for rs9277535 in additive model; adjusted OR = 3.18, 95%CI = 1.86-5.46 for rs7453920 in recessive model). When combining the effects of rs3077, rs9277535 and rs7453920, we found that AML risk was significantly increased with the increasing number of variant alleles of the three SNPs in a dose-dependent manner (P for trend < 0.001). Besides, we found multiplicative interaction between rs3077 and age (</=45 years old and > 45 years old; P = 0.046). In conclusion, HLA-DP and HLA-DQ loci are candidate susceptibility regions for AML in Han Chinese.","['Cao, Songyu', 'Wu, Yifei', 'Qian, Xifeng', 'Ma, Hongxia']","['Cao S', 'Wu Y', 'Qian X', 'Ma H']",,"['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Jiangsu Key Lab of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Jiangsu Key Lab of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Wuxi Peoples' Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, No. 299 Qingyang Road, Wuxi, China."", 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Jiangsu Key Lab of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.

Methods: A total of 104 newly diagnosed patients with CBF-AML in Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital from January 2014 to February 2018 were analyzed, and high-throughput gene sequencing for the detection of mutations among 58 genes was executed. Also, the clinical features of KIT mutation-positive CBF-AML (KIT+CBF-AML) patients and the effects of other concomitant gene mutations on the prognoses of patients were also analyzed. Results: A total of 56 cases (53.85%) with KIT mutations were found in 104 CBF-AML patients. Among this, KIT D816 mutation was the most common (32 patients), followed by the N822 mutation (17 patients). Patients with KIT+CBF-AML have a higher proportion of bone marrow blasts at the time of diagnoses and are more likely to have sex chromosome loss. Among the 52 patients with KIT+CBF-AML who were followed up, the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) group had a higher overall survival rate (OS) than that of the chemotherapy group (88.9% vs 57.1%, chi(2)=6.076, P<0.05). The event-free survival (EFS) and OS of patients with KIT+CBF-AML with FLT3 mutation were both significantly lower than those of the FLT3 mutation-negative group (EFS: 40.0% vs 72.3%, chi(2)=6.557, P<0.05; OS: 60.0% vs 87.2%, chi(2)=8.305, P<0.05). The OS of the patient with TET2 mutation was lower than that of the TET2 mutation-negative group (50.0% vs 87.5%, chi(2)=4.130, P<0.05).

METHODS: CLL-B cells were co-cultured with Fb, as a simulation of CLL microenvironment. CD147 was evaluated in healthy donor (HD)-B cells and CLL-B cells by flow cytometry. MMP2 and MMP9 activity in CLL-plasma samples and conditioned media (CMs) was studied by zymography. RESULTS: MMP9/MMP2 plasma levels were significantly higher in CLL patients than in HD. CD147 expression (median fluorescence intensity) in CLL patients characterized 3 groups: low- (19.1 +/- 3.2; n=3), middle- (42.7 +/- 12.8; n=18) and high- (76.5 +/- 9.6; n=5) related to CD147 expression in HD-B cells. CD147 expression significantly increased in CLL-B cells after Fb-CLL-B cell co-culture. A significant increase in proMMP2 activity was observed in CMs obtained from Fb-CLL-B cell co-cultures in comparison with isolated CLL-B cells. CONCLUSIONS: CD147 expression in CLL-B cells and MMPs secretion was induced by Fb-CLL-B cell contact, suggesting CD147 participation in the CLL pathophysiology.","['Rodriguez, Cecilia M', 'Gilardoni, Monica B', 'Remedi, Maria M', 'Sastre, Dario', 'Heller, Viviana', 'Pellizas, Claudia G', 'Donadio, Ana C']","['Rodriguez CM', 'Gilardoni MB', 'Remedi MM', 'Sastre D', 'Heller V', 'Pellizas CG', 'Donadio AC']",,"['Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas, Departamento de Bioquimica Clinica, Centro de Investigaciones en Bioquimica Clinica e Inmunologia, CIBICI-CONICET, Cordoba, Argentina; Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, Hospital Nacional de Clinicas, Laboratorio de Oncohematologia, Argentina.', 'Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas, Departamento de Bioquimica Clinica, Centro de Investigaciones en Bioquimica Clinica e Inmunologia, CIBICI-CONICET, Cordoba, Argentina.

It is a common problem in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Whether grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) could reverse MDR in patients with AML is still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the MDR reverse ability of GSPE and its possible mechanism in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human leukemia cell line HL-60 cells and HL-ADR cells were used. MTT assay were employed to identify the cytotoxic effects of different chemotherapeutic drugs and reverse ability of GSPE. Flow cytometry assays were used to verify the cell apoptosis induced by GSPE. MDR-related genes expression was tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). MDR-related protein expression was assessed by Western blotting assays. The genes and their related protein expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) and lung resistance-related protein (LRP) were tested in this study. KEY RESULTS: We found that HL-60/ADR cells were resistant to a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs, including cytarabine (Ara-C), adriamycin (ADR), vincristine (VCR), daunorubicin (DNR), mitoxantrone (MTZ), pirarubicin (THP), homoharringtonine (HHT) and etoposide (VP16). Co-treatment with GSPE could significant lower the IC50 of Ara-C and ADR in HL-60/ADR cells (P < 0.01). MDR related mRNA and their protein expression of MRP1 and MDR1 were significant highly expressed in HL-60/ADR cells than HL-60 cells (P < 0.01). But only protein expression of LRP was higher in HL-60/ADR cells than HL-60 cells (P < 0.05). GSPE could induce a higher intracellular level of ADR in HL-60/ADR cells. It could also inhibit Akt phosphorylation resulted in the down regulation of MRP1, MDR1 and LRP and induce cell apoptosis. 25.0 mug/mL GSPE significant inhibited the Akt phosphorylation (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: GSPE-reversed MDR of HL-60/ADR cells might be associated with the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which resulted in the down-regulation the expression of MRP1, MDR1 and LRP. These results provide that GSPE may serve as a combination therapy in AML chemotherapy for future study.","['Lin, Ka-Na', 'Jiang, Yue-Lian', 'Zhang, Shun-Guo', 'Huang, Shi-Ying', 'Li, Hao']","['Lin KN', 'Jiang YL', 'Zhang SG', 'Huang SY', 'Li H']",,"[""Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China.

Detection of clonal cells may be based on direct tracking of cell lineage-specific sequences or disease-specific somatic mutations identifying the clonal population. Historically, clonal hematopoiesis was defined using the principle of X-chromosome inactivation based on observation that in circulating clonal cells, only one of the active chromosomes was expressed. In myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) virtually all circulating erythrocytes, platelets, and granulocytes are products of single mutated stem cells that preferentially differentiate into the myeloid rather than lymphoid lineage. Thus, clonal differentiated myeloid cells co-exist in circulation with polyclonal long-lived T lymphocytes that originated before the MPN-initiating somatic clonal event. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) starts in a differentiating B cell, but other lymphoid lineages and myeloid cells remain polyclonal. Normal T and B cells co-exist with the CLL clone, but are diluted by the massively expanded CLL population, which outnumbers the residual normal cells. Clonal hematopoiesis of undetermined potential (CHIP) has been identified by whole-genome sequencing of healthy individuals. These clones contain a specific somatic mutation previously considered to be disease defining but are detected in only a small proportion of circulating leukocytes, and there is no obvious suppression of normal hematopoietic stem cells. However, more studies are needed to properly define these clones, their persistence or disappearance, and their relative propensity for transforming into leukemias, myeloproliferative neoplasms, or other clonal hematological malignancies.","['Swierczek, Sabina', 'Prchal, Josef T']","['Swierczek S', 'Prchal JT']",,"['Hematology and Hematological Malignancies, University of Utah and Veterans Administration Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT; Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT; Nuvance Health Rudy L.

In this study, we have explored the suitability of the erythroleukemia K562 cell line as a continuous source of such reticulocytes and have investigated regulatory factors behind the terminal differentiation (and enucleation, in particular) of this cell line that can be used to drive the reticulocyte production process. The Duffy blood group antigen receptor (Fy), essential for P. vivax invasion, was stably introduced into K562 cells by lentiviral gene transfer. miRNA-26a-5p and miRNA-30a-5p were downregulated to promote erythroid differentiation and enucleation, resulting in a tenfold increase in the production of reticulocytes after stimulation with an induction cocktail compared with controls. Our results suggest an interplay in the mechanisms of action of miRNA-26a-5p and miRNA-30a-5p, which makes it necessary to downregulate both miRNAs to achieve a stable enucleation rate and Fy receptor expression. In the context of establishing P. vivax-permissive, stable, and reproducible reticulocytes, a higher enucleation rate may be desirable, which may be achieved by the targeting of further regulatory mechanisms in Fy-K562 cells; promoting the shift in hemoglobin production from fetal to adult may also be necessary. Despite the fact that K562 erythroleukemia cell lines are of neoplastic origin, this cell line offers a versatile model system to research the regulatory mechanisms underlying erythropoiesis.","['Kronstein-Wiedemann, Romy', 'Klop, Onny', 'Thiel, Jessica', 'Milanov, Peter', 'Ruhland, Claudia', 'Vermaat, Lars', 'Kocken, Clemens H M', 'Tonn, Torsten', 'Pasini, Erica M']","['Kronstein-Wiedemann R', 'Klop O', 'Thiel J', 'Milanov P', 'Ruhland C', 'Vermaat L', 'Kocken CHM', 'Tonn T', 'Pasini EM']",,"['Department of Experimental Transfusion Medicine, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, Technische, Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Biomedical Primate Research Centre, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Transfusion Medicine, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, Technische, Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Transfusion Medicine, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, Technische, Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Transfusion Medicine, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, Technische, Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Biomedical Primate Research Centre, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.', 'Biomedical Primate Research Centre, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Transfusion Medicine, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, Technische, Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany; Institute for Transfusion Medicine Dresden, German Red Cross Blood Donation Service North East, Dresden, Germany.

Questions on the clonal structure of the human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool, such as ""how many HSCs are there?"" and ""do all HSC clones actively produce all blood cell types in equal proportions?"" remain open. These questions have inherent value for understanding normal human physiology, but also directly inform our comprehension of the process by which the system is subverted to drive diseases of the blood, in particular blood cancers and bone marrow failure syndromes. The critical link between normal and abnormal hematopoiesis is perhaps best illustrated by the recent discovery of clonal hematopoiesis in healthy people with no abnormal blood parameters. In such individuals, large clones derived from single cells are present and are dominant relative to their normal counterparts, but their presence does not necessitate abnormal blood cell production. Intriguingly, however, these individuals are also at a significantly greater risk of developing leukemias and of cardiovascular events, underscoring the importance of understanding how blood stem cell clones compete against each other.","['Lee-Six, Henry', 'Kent, David G']","['Lee-Six H', 'Kent DG']",,"['Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, United Kingdom.', 'York Biomedical Research Institute, Department of Biology, University of York, York, United Kingdom; Wellcome MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Hills Road, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.

Deregulation of the KDM5 family has been reported in various types of cancers, including hematological malignancies. However, their transcriptional regulatory roles in the context of leukemia remain unclear. Here, we find that KDM5B is strongly expressed in normal CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. Knockdown of KDM5B in K562 CML cells reduced leukemia colony-forming potential. Transcriptome profiling of KDM5B knockdown K562 cells revealed the deregulation of genes involved in myeloid differentiation and Toll-like receptor signaling. Through the integration of transcriptome and ChIP-seq profiling data, we show that KDM5B is enriched at the binding sites of the GATA and AP-1 transcription factor families, suggesting their collaborations in the regulation of transcription. Even though the binding of KDM5B substantially overlapped with H3K4me1 or H3K4me3 mark at gene promoters, only a small subset of the KDM5B targets showed differential expression in association with the histone demethylation activity. By characterizing the interacting proteins in K562 cells, we discovered that KDM5B recruits protein complexes involved in the mRNA processing machinery, implying an alternative epigenetic action mediated by KDM5B in gene regulation. Our study highlights the oncogenic functions of KDM5B in CML cells and suggests that KDM5B is vital to the transcriptional regulation via multiple epigenetic mechanisms.","['Xue, Shen', 'Lam, Yuk Man', 'He, Zhikai', 'Zheng, Yan', 'Li, Lin', 'Zhang, Yonghong', 'Li, Chen', 'Mbadhi, Magdaleena Naemi', 'Zheng, Lanlan', 'Cheng, Zhongshan', 'Liu, Ying', 'Wang, Xuanbing', 'Chan, Li Chong', 'Ng, Ray Kit', 'Zhang, Jingxuan']","['Xue S', 'Lam YM', 'He Z', 'Zheng Y', 'Li L', 'Zhang Y', 'Li C', 'Mbadhi MN', 'Zheng L', 'Cheng Z', 'Liu Y', 'Wang X', 'Chan LC', 'Ng RK', 'Zhang J']",,"['Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, China.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, China.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, China.', 'Laboratory of Chinese Herbal Pharmacology, Oncology Center, Renmin Hospital, Shiyan, China; Hubei Key Laboratory of Wudang Local Chinese Medicine Research, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.

Such analyses are hampered by the limited geographical resolution of the available data. Typically the available data are counts per spatial unit and the common approach is the Besag-York-Mollie (BYM) model. When precise geocodes are available, it is more natural to use Log-Gaussian Cox processes (LGCPs). In a simulation study mimicking childhood leukaemia incidence using actual residential locations of all children in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, we compare the ability of these models to recover risk surfaces and identify high-risk areas. We then apply both approaches to actual data on childhood leukaemia incidence in the canton of Zurich during 1985-2015. We found that LGCPs outperform BYM models in almost all scenarios considered. Our findings suggest that there are important gains to be made from the use of LGCPs in spatial epidemiology.","['Konstantinoudis, Garyfallos', 'Schuhmacher, Dominic', 'Rue, Havard', 'Spycher, Ben D']","['Konstantinoudis G', 'Schuhmacher D', 'Rue H', 'Spycher BD']",,"['Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.

Cytokines and adhesion molecules may contribute to this resistance and affect treatment outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the independence and additional prognostic information of baseline serum levels of selected cytokines and soluble adhesion molecules, included in analyses with standard prognostic indicators. METHODS: We used biochip array technology to measure levels of selected cytokines and soluble adhesion molecules in serum samples of 80 newly diagnosed AML patients. The markers of tumour microenvironment were analysed against high risk karyotype, hyperleucocytosis, higher age, lactic dehydrogenase levels and presence of FLT3-ITD and NPM-1 mutation. RESULTS: All evaluated analytes were independent of standard prognostic indicators. Fifteen were associated with overall and eight with progression-free survival in univariate analysis. After correction for multiple testing, we identified soluble interleukin-2 receptor-alpha as an independent indicator of overall survival. Further, the soluble type I TNF-alpha receptor was close to statistical significance for both overall and progression-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor-alpha predict overall survival in newly diagnosed AML. The TNF-alpha type I soluble receptor is a candidate prognostic marker in AML and is worth of further investigation.","['Kupsa, Tomas', 'Vanek, Jan', 'Zak, Pavel', 'Jebavy, Ladislav', 'Horacek, Jan M']","['Kupsa T', 'Vanek J', 'Zak P', 'Jebavy L', 'Horacek JM']",,"['Department of Military Internal Medicine and Military Hygiene, University of Defence, Faculty of Military Health Sciences (FMHS), Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; Department of Internal Medicine IV - Hematology, University Hospital Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Military Internal Medicine and Military Hygiene, University of Defence, Faculty of Military Health Sciences (FMHS), Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine IV - Hematology, University Hospital Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Military Internal Medicine and Military Hygiene, University of Defence, Faculty of Military Health Sciences (FMHS), Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; Department of Internal Medicine IV - Hematology, University Hospital Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Military Internal Medicine and Military Hygiene, University of Defence, Faculty of Military Health Sciences (FMHS), Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; Department of Internal Medicine IV - Hematology, University Hospital Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.

Therapies for pediatric ALL have improved such that more than 80% of patients survive to 5 years post-therapy, and most survive to adulthood. These ALL patients experience long-term side effects that permanently affect their quality of life, with bone loss and reduced longitudinal growth being the most common skeletal complications. To determine the effects of the chemotherapeutic agents used in ALL induction therapy on bone density and longitudinal growth in mice, we treated juvenile mice with doxorubicin, dexamethasone, vincristine, l-asparaginase, or combination therapy. At adulthood, mice were culled and bones collected and scanned by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). Mice that received doxorubicin and combination therapy exhibited reduced longitudinal growth and significant reductions in trabecular bone volume, trabecular thickness, and trabecular number, with increased trabecular separation. Mean cortical thickness, cortical area, marrow area, endocortical perimeter, and polar moment of inertia were significantly reduced by doxorubicin and combination therapy. Vincristine treatment significantly decreased trabecular bone volume, trabecular number, and increased trabecular separation but had no effects on cortical bone. Dexamethasone treatment increased trabecular bone separation, cortical marrow area, and cortical bone periosteal perimeter. Mice treated with l-asparaginase did not have any bone phenotypes. In conclusion, these data indicate that the majority of the chemotherapy agents used in induction therapy for pediatric ALL have long-term effects on bone in mice. A single dose of doxorubicin in juvenile mice was sufficient to cause the majority of the bone phenotypes, with combination therapy intensifying these effects.","['Straszkowski, Lenny', 'Jovic, Tanja', 'Castillo-Tandazo, Wilson', 'Ritchie, David S', 'Purton, Louise E']","['Straszkowski L', 'Jovic T', 'Castillo-Tandazo W', 'Ritchie DS', 'Purton LE']",,"[""St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, Fitzroy, VIC, Australia."", ""St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, Fitzroy, VIC, Australia."", ""St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, Fitzroy, VIC, Australia; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", 'Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia; Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Parkville, VIC, Australia; Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Parkville, VIC, Australia; Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', ""St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, Fitzroy, VIC, Australia; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.

Human immature DCs produced high levels of the immune-response protein interferon-alpha and tumor necrosis factor- alpha upon incubation with siRNA/lipid formulations, resulting in their maturation and expression of co-stimulatory molecules like CD80, CD86, and CD40 on the cell surface. These molecules are used by mature DCs to co-stimulate T cells during antigen presentation in lymphoid organs. Ex vivo loading of immature DCs with DOTAP-formulated immunostimulatory siRNAs and tumor antigens has proven effective as a cancer vaccine in a rat model of acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we describe this new vaccination strategy that targets tumor cells by activating DCs and blocking the expression of immunosuppressive factors.","['Iversen, Per Ole', 'Sioud, Mouldy']","['Iversen PO', 'Sioud M']",,"['Department of Hematology, Oslo University Hospital-Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital-Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway. mouldy.sioud@rr-research.no.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/transplantation', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'RNA, Small Interfering/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer vaccines', '*Dendritic cells', '*Immunosuppression', '*Immunotherapy', '*Lipid formulations', '*RNA interference', '*Small interfering RNAs']",2020/02/02 06:00,2021/02/02 06:00,['2020/02/02 06:00'],"['2020/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-0716-0290-4_16 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2020;2115:281-287. doi: 10.1007/978-1-0716-0290-4_16.,,,,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AMKL is often preceded by a transient neonatal pre-leukaemic syndrome, transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD). Although TMD often spontaneously resolves, 20-30% of these patients subsequently develop AMKL within the first 4 years of life. AIMS: To perform a retrospective consecutive national audit of all documented cases of childhood TMD and AMKL-DS from 1990 to 2018 at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin (OLCHC), Ireland. METHODS: All patients with a diagnosis of AMKL treated consecutively at (OLCHC) between 1990 and 2018 were reviewed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with AMKL-DS were identified. A prior neonatal diagnosis of TMD was described in 10 patients (37%). Nineteen patients (70%) are alive and well, in complete remission, at a median follow-up of 11.4 years. Overall survival (OS) of this cohort has risen from 54% from those treated between the years 1990 and 2004 (n = 13) to 93% for those treated between the years 2005 and 2018 (n = 14). CONCLUSION: High cure rates are observed in AMKL-DS using current polychemotherapy protocols. The finding of a low platelet count at time of diagnosis is in keeping with the knowledge that AMKL-DS is a malignancy of platelet progenitor cells.","['Dowling, Gavin P', 'Piccin, Andrea', 'Gavin, Katherine T', 'Betts, David R', 'Malone, Andrea', 'Cotter, Melanie', 'Sills, Aoife', 'Evans, Pamela', ""O' Marcaigh, Aengus"", 'Smith, Owen P']","['Dowling GP', 'Piccin A', 'Gavin KT', 'Betts DR', 'Malone A', 'Cotter M', 'Sills A', 'Evans P', ""O' Marcaigh A"", 'Smith OP']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2645-8496'],"['Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.', ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Children's Health Ireland at Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland. apiccin@gmail.com."", 'Internal Medicine V, Haematology and Oncology, University of Medicine, Innsbruck, Austria. apiccin@gmail.com.', ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Children's Health Ireland at Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland."", ""Department of Clinical Genetics, Children's Health Ireland at Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland."", ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Children's Health Ireland at Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland."", ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Children's Health Ireland at Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland."", ""Temple Street Children's University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."", 'Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.', ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Children's Health Ireland at Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland."", ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Children's Health Ireland at Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland."", ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Children's Health Ireland at Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland."", 'University College Dublin (UCD), Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200131,Ireland,Ir J Med Sci,Irish journal of medical science,7806864,IM,,"['Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Ireland', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['AMKL', 'Acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia', 'Down syndrome', 'TMD', 'Transient myeloproliferative disorder']",2020/02/02 06:00,2020/08/29 06:00,['2020/02/02 06:00'],"['2019/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11845-020-02181-y [doi]', '10.1007/s11845-020-02181-y [pii]']",ppublish,Ir J Med Sci. 2020 Aug;189(3):979-984. doi: 10.1007/s11845-020-02181-y.

This study involved 60 subjects (40 de novo adult ALL patients and 20 controls). Serum PGRN level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and was correlated with patient outcome. Serum PGRN level was significantly higher in patients than controls. Serum PGRN level did not correlate with age, total leukocytic count, hemoglobin, platelets, absolute blast count in peripheral blood, lactate dehydrogenase, percent of blasts in bone marrow, gender, comorbidities, the presence of central nervous system infiltration, ALL phenotype, cytogenetics and risk of the disease. High serum PGRN level was not associated with inferior overall survival (OS) on univariate analysis. Regarding cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and disease-free survival (DFS), high PGRN level was associated with poor results on univariate analysis. Moreover, it tended to be independent risk factor on multivariate analysis for CIR but was not an independent predictor of inferior DFS. Serum PGRN level is significantly elevated in de novo adult ALL patients and may be used as a predictor of increased relapse risk.","['El-Ghammaz, Amro M S', 'Azzazi, Mohamed O', 'Mostafa, Nevine', 'Hegab, Hany M', 'Mahmoud, Amir A']","['El-Ghammaz AMS', 'Azzazi MO', 'Mostafa N', 'Hegab HM', 'Mahmoud AA']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1567-7511'],"['Clinical Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt. amro.sedky@yahoo.com.', 'Clinical Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200131,Italy,Clin Exp Med,Clinical and experimental medicine,100973405,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Progranulins/*blood', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Adults', 'De novo', 'Prognosis', 'Serum progranulin level']",2020/02/02 06:00,2021/02/23 06:00,['2020/02/02 06:00'],"['2019/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10238-020-00610-x [doi]', '10.1007/s10238-020-00610-x [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Med. 2020 May;20(2):269-276. doi: 10.1007/s10238-020-00610-x.

In different microenvironments, macrophages can polarize into two types: classically activated macrophages (M1) or alternatively activated macrophages (M2). M1 macrophages are a well-known bacteriostatic macrophage, and conversely, M2 macrophages may play an important role in tumor growth and tissue remodeling. M1 macrophages have been reported to have high intracellular iron stores, while M2 macrophages contain lower intracellular iron. It has been well-described that disturbances of iron homeostasis are associated with altered immune function. Thus, it is important to investigate if chronic iron overload is capable of polarizing macrophages. Human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells were maintained in culture medium that contained 100 muM ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4) (I-THP-1) and differentiated into THP-1-derived macrophages (I-TDMs) by induction with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). We characterized that I-TDMs not only enhanced the surface expression of CD163 and CD206 but also increased arginase and decreased iNOS protein expression. I-TDMs enhanced pSTAT6 expression and decreased pSTAT1 and NF-kappaB expressions. Furthermore, the gene expression profile of I-TDMs was comparable with M2 macrophages by performing human oligonucleotide DNA microarray analysis. Finally, functional assays demonstrated I-TDMs secreted higher levels of IL-10 but not M1 cytokines. Additionally, the conditional medium of I-TDMs had enhanced migration and increased invasion of A375 melanoma cells which was similar to the characteristics of tumor-associated macrophages. Taken together, we demonstrated that THP-1-derived macrophages polarized to a phenotype of M2-like characteristics when subjected to chronic iron overload.","['Kao, Jun-Kai', 'Wang, Shih-Chung', 'Ho, Li-Wei', 'Huang, Shi-Wei', 'Lee, Cheng-Han', 'Lee, Ming-Sheng', 'Yang, Rei-Cheng', 'Shieh, Jeng-Jer']","['Kao JK', 'Wang SC', 'Ho LW', 'Huang SW', 'Lee CH', 'Lee MS', 'Yang RC', 'Shieh JJ']",,"['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, 145 Xingda Rd., South Dist., Taichung City, 402, Taiwan (Republic of China).', ""Pediatric Department, Children's Hospital, Changhua Christian Hospital, No. 320, Xuguang Rd., Changhua City, Changhua County, 500, Taiwan (Republic of China)."", 'School of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, No.100, Shiquan 1st Rd., Sanmin Dist., Kaohsiung City, Taiwan (Republic of China).', ""Pediatric Department, Children's Hospital, Changhua Christian Hospital, No. 320, Xuguang Rd., Changhua City, Changhua County, 500, Taiwan (Republic of China)."", 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, 145 Xingda Rd., South Dist., Taichung City, 402, Taiwan (Republic of China).', ""Pediatric Department, Children's Hospital, Changhua Christian Hospital, No. 320, Xuguang Rd., Changhua City, Changhua County, 500, Taiwan (Republic of China)."", 'Center for Cell Therapy, China Medical University Hospital, No. 2, Yude Road, North District, Taichung City, 40447, Taiwan.', ""Pediatric Department, Children's Hospital, Changhua Christian Hospital, No. 320, Xuguang Rd., Changhua City, Changhua County, 500, Taiwan (Republic of China)."", ""Pediatric Department, Children's Hospital, Changhua Christian Hospital, No. 320, Xuguang Rd., Changhua City, Changhua County, 500, Taiwan (Republic of China)."", ""Pediatric Department, Children's Hospital, Changhua Christian Hospital, No. 320, Xuguang Rd., Changhua City, Changhua County, 500, Taiwan (Republic of China)."", 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, 145 Xingda Rd., South Dist., Taichung City, 402, Taiwan (Republic of China). shiehjj@vghtc.gov.tw.', 'Department of Education and Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, 650 Taiwan Boulevard Sect. 4, Taichung, 40705, Taiwan (Republic of China). shiehjj@vghtc.gov.tw.', 'Rong Hsing Research Center for Translational Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, 145 Xingda Rd., South Dist., Taichung City, 402, Taiwan (Republic of China). shiehjj@vghtc.gov.tw.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200201,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['Cell Movement/drug effects/*immunology', 'Ferrous Compounds/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Iron Overload/chemically induced/*immunology/pathology', 'Macrophages/*immunology/pathology', 'Monocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Iron overload', 'Macrophage differentiation', 'Macrophage polarization']",2020/02/02 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2020/02/02 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-03916-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-03916-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Mar;99(3):431-441. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-03916-8.

The t(11;16)(q23;p13)/KMT2A-CREBBP is considered presumptive evidence of a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a MDS-related cytogenetic abnormality in the classification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we report 18 cases of hematologic neoplasms with t(11;16). There were 8 males and 10 females with a median age of 51.9 years at time of detection of t(11;16). Of 17 patients with enough clinical information and pathological materials for review, 16 had a history of cytotoxic therapies for various malignancies including 12/15 patients who received topoisomerase II inhibitors, and 15 were classified as having therapy-related neoplasms. The median interval from the diagnosis of primary malignancy to the detection of t(11;16) was 23.2 months. Dysplasia, usually mild, was observed in 7/17 patients. Blasts demonstrated monocytic differentiation in 8/8 patients who developed AML at the time or following detection of t(11;16). t(11;16) was observed as the sole chromosomal abnormality in 10/18 patients. KMT2A rearrangement was confirmed in 11/11 patients. The median survival from the detection of t(11;16) was 15.4 months. In summary, t(11;16)(q23;p13) is rare and overwhelmingly associated with prior exposure of cytotoxic therapy. Instead of being considered presumptive evidence of myelodysplasia, we suggest that the detection of t(11;16) should automatically prompt a search for a history of malignancy and cytotoxic therapy so that proper risk stratification and clinical management are made accordingly.

However, haplo-HSCT carries a potential risk of treatment-related mortality including severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Therefore, we conducted a prospective pilot study in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of reduced-intensity haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (haplo-PBSCT) with low-dose thymoglobulin (2.5 mg/kg only on day -2), fludarabine, melphalan, and total body irradiation 4 Gy for aggressive ATLL. Three consecutive acute type ATLL patients, who were ineligible for conventional myeloablative conditioning due to advanced age or comorbidities, were enrolled. One patient received pretransplant mogamulizumab therapy. All the patients were not in complete remission (CR) at the time of transplantation. Our transplantation protocol was safely carried out. CR was achieved in all the patients after transplantation. HTLV-I viral loads became undetectable after transplantation. No severe adverse events such as grade III-IV GVHD or viral/fungal diseases were observed. At a follow-up of 2 years, they were still in CR. However, T cell receptor repertoire diversities were low 1 year after transplantation in next-generation sequencing. Our results show encouraging therapeutic benefits of this pilot approach using reduced-intensity haplo-PBSCT with low-dose thymoglobulin for aggressive ATLL patients.","['Hirosawa, Makoto', 'Yamaguchi, Takahiro', 'Tanaka, Aya', 'Kominato, Yoshihiko', 'Higashi, Takehiro', 'Morimoto, Hiroaki', 'Tsukada, Junichi']","['Hirosawa M', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Tanaka A', 'Kominato Y', 'Higashi T', 'Morimoto H', 'Tsukada J']",,"['Hematology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu, 807-8556, Japan.', 'Hematology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu, 807-8556, Japan.', 'Hematology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu, 807-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Legal Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma University, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Hematology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu, 807-8556, Japan.', 'Hematology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu, 807-8556, Japan.', 'Hematology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu, 807-8556, Japan. jtsukada@med.uoeh-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20200131,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['Aged', 'Allografts', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Time Factors', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Viral Load', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Thymoglobulin and reduced intensity conditioning']",2020/02/02 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2020/02/02 06:00'],"['2019/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-03934-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-03934-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Mar;99(3):599-607. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-03934-6.

The cutoff value for the extensively validated 30% of positive CLL cells is able to separate CLL patients into 2 subgroups with different prognoses, but it does not consider the pattern of CD49d expression. In the present study, we analyzed a cohort of 1630 CLL samples and identified the presence of approximately 20% of CLL cases (n = 313) characterized by a bimodal expression of CD49d, that is, concomitant presence of a CD49d+ subpopulation and a CD49d- subpopulation. At variance with the highly stable CD49d expression observed in CLL patients with a homogeneous pattern of CD49d expression, CD49d bimodal CLL showed a higher level of variability in sequential samples, and an increase in the CD49d+ subpopulation over time after therapy. The CD49d+ subpopulation from CD49d bimodal CLL displayed higher levels of proliferation compared with the CD49d- cells; and was more highly represented in the bone marrow compared with peripheral blood (PB), and in PB CLL subsets expressing the CXCR4dim/CD5bright phenotype, known to be enriched in proliferative cells. From a clinical standpoint, CLL patients with CD49d bimodal expression, regardless of whether the CD49d+ subpopulation exceeded the 30% cutoff or not, experienced clinical behavior similar to CD49d+ CLL, both in chemoimmunotherapy (n = 1522) and in ibrutinib (n = 158) settings. Altogether, these results suggest that CD49d can drive disease progression in CLL, and that the pattern of CD49d expression should also be considered to improve the prognostic impact of this biomarker in CLL.","['Tissino, Erika', 'Pozzo, Federico', 'Benedetti, Dania', 'Caldana, Chiara', 'Bittolo, Tamara', 'Rossi, Francesca Maria', 'Bomben, Riccardo', 'Nanni, Paola', 'Chivilo, Hillarj', 'Cattarossi, Ilaria', 'Zaina, Eva', 'Norris, Kevin', 'Polesel, Jerry', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Tripepi, Giovanni', 'Moia, Riccardo', 'Santinelli, Enrico', 'Innocenti, Idanna', 'Olivieri, Jacopo', ""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Zaja, Francesco', 'Pozzato, Gabriele', 'Chiarenza, Annalisa', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Pepper, Chris', 'Hartmann, Tanja Nicole', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Zucchetto, Antonella']","['Tissino E', 'Pozzo F', 'Benedetti D', 'Caldana C', 'Bittolo T', 'Rossi FM', 'Bomben R', 'Nanni P', 'Chivilo H', 'Cattarossi I', 'Zaina E', 'Norris K', 'Polesel J', 'Gentile M', 'Tripepi G', 'Moia R', 'Santinelli E', 'Innocenti I', 'Olivieri J', ""D'Arena G"", 'Laurenti L', 'Zaja F', 'Pozzato G', 'Chiarenza A', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Rossi D', 'Pepper C', 'Hartmann TN', 'Gaidano G', 'Del Poeta G', 'Gattei V', 'Zucchetto A']",,"['Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Aviano, Italy.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Unit of Cancer Epidemiology, CRO, IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera (AO) of Cosenza, Cosenza, Italy.', 'Nephrology Center, National Research Institute of Biomedicine and Molecular Immunology, Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento Scienze Radiologiche Radioterapiche ed Ematologiche, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A Gemelli, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', 'Clinica Ematologica, Centro Trapianti e Terapie Cellulari ""Carlo Melzi"" Dipartimento Interaziendale di Salute Mentale, AO Universitaria S.

Horizontally transferred lineage-specific (LS) chromosomes were reported to determine host-specific pathogenicity among phytopathogenic F. oxysporum. However, the existence and functional importance of LS chromosomes among human pathogenic isolates are unknown. Here we report four unique LS chromosomes in a human pathogenic strain NRRL 32931, isolated from a leukemia patient. These LS chromosomes were devoid of housekeeping genes, but were significantly enriched in genes encoding metal ion transporters and cation transporters. Homologs of NRRL 32931 LS genes, including a homolog of ceruloplasmin and the genes that contribute to the expansion of the alkaline pH-responsive transcription factor PacC/Rim1p, were also present in the genome of NRRL 47514, a strain associated with Fusarium keratitis outbreak. This study provides the first evidence, to our knowledge, for genomic compartmentalization in two human pathogenic fungal genomes and suggests an important role of LS chromosomes in niche

Zhang and his team recently proved that FLT3 gene mutation was identified in ~5% of ALL and the mutation spectrum is different from AML. Recently, chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CART) therapy presents great efficacy in treating refractory leukemia. We report a case of a refractory ALL patient with FLT3-ITD mutations and unfavorable karyotypes, who failed to respond to chemotherapy and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, successfully treated by CART therapy. FLT3-ITD mutations were downregulated dramatically into 14.1% positive 3 days after the infusion and remained negative until now. MRD has stayed to be negative from the 10th day. This case suggests that CART-cell therapy might be effective in treating FLT3-ITD positive refractory ALL, implying the possibility to overcome the traditional prognosis scoring system for leukemia and providing a new chance for other leukemia patients with inferior prognosis factors.","['Jin, Aiyun', 'Feng, Jingjing', 'Wei, Guoqing', 'Wu, Wenjun', 'Yang, Luxin', 'Xu, Huijun', 'Zhang, Yanlei', 'Cui, Jiazhen', 'Chang, Alex Hongsheng', 'Hu, Yongxian', 'Huang, He']","['Jin A', 'Feng J', 'Wei G', 'Wu W', 'Yang L', 'Xu H', 'Zhang Y', 'Cui J', 'Chang AH', 'Hu Y', 'Huang H']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1607-4499', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2723-1621']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Shanghai YaKe Biotechnology Ltd, Shanghai, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Shanghai YaKe Biotechnology Ltd, Shanghai, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, China. huyongxian2000@aliyun.com.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. huyongxian2000@aliyun.com.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China. huyongxian2000@aliyun.com.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, China. huanghe@zju.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. huanghe@zju.edu.cn.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China. huanghe@zju.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200131,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mutation', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', '*Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,2020/02/02 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/02/02 06:00'],"['2019/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-0807-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-0807-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2020 Apr;55(4):717-721. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-0807-7.

Because of current medical treatment methods, a high survival rate can be reached for many types of the disease. Nevertheless, patients face a number of long-term effects related to the treatment. As a result, physical and psychological consequences have increasingly become the focus of research in recent years. Social dimensions of health have received little attention in health services research in oncology so far. Yet, there are no robust results that allow an estimation of whether and to what extent the disease and treatment impair the participation of children and adolescents and which factors mediate this effect. Social participation is of great importance especially because interactions with peers and experiences in different areas of life are essential for the development of children and adolescents. METHODS: Data are collected in a longitudinal, prospective, observational multicenter study. For this purpose, all patients and their parents who are being treated for cancer in one of the participating clinics throughout Germany will be interviewed within the first month after diagnosis (t1), after completion of intensive treatment (t2) and half a year after the end of intensive treatment (t3) using standardized questionnaires. Analysis will be done by descriptive and multivariate methods. DISCUSSION: The results can be used to identify children and adolescents in high-risk situations at an early stage in order to be able to initiate interventions tailored to the needs. Such tailored interventions will finally reduce the risk of impairments in the participation of children and adolescents and increase quality of life.

It has become evident that endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-induced apoptosis was contributed to beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. Our previous work showed that emulsified isoflurane (EIso) could alleviate ERS in lung reperfusion injury. This study aimed to elucidate whether EIso could alleviate apoptosis induced by glucose in rat islet RIN-m5F beta cells via inhibiting ERS. METHODS: RIN-m5F cells were divided into five groups: the control group; the 0.1G group, cultured in 0.1M glucose for 24 h; the 0.3G group, cultured in 0.3M glucose for 24 h; the 0.3G + 57E group, cultured in 0.3M glucose with 57 microM EIso for 24 h, and the 0.3G + 76E group, cultured in 0.3M glucose with 76 microM EIso for 24 h. First, cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay, and the level of insulin secretion was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Second, the expression of B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) associated X (Bax) and Bcl-2 were detected by Western blotting. The level of caspase-3 activity was assessed by colorimetric method. Finally, the ERS marker CHOP and GRP78 expression were detected by Western blotting. The levels of activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), X-box-binding protein 1 (Xbp1), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2alpha (eIF2alpha) mRNA were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) after being treated with EIso for 24 h. RESULTS: We found that exposure to high glucose reduced RIN-m5F cell viability, stimulated the secretion of insulin, activated caspase-3, improved the expression of Bax, and down-regulated Bcl-2. EIso improved the survival and protected the function of RIN-m5F. Compared to the 0.3G group, treatment with EIso inhibited the activity of caspase-3, and decreased the expression of Bax. The expression of CHOP and GRP78 were significantly suppressed by EIso at 24 h in a dose-dependent manner. The level of ATF6, Xbp1, and eIF2alpha mRNA of RIN-m5F were enhanced by high glucose, but only eIF2alpha mRNA was significantly decreased by EIso treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that high glucose induces rat islet beta cell RIN-m5F apoptosis and aggravates the function of beta cells. EIso protects beta cells against high glucose through the ERS-dependent apoptotic pathway and might serve as a potential therapy for diabetes.","['Yang, Zhenkun', 'Wu, Shuoxiong', 'Zhao, Jingjing', 'Wang, Zuoyu', 'Yao, Min', 'Lu, Peihua', 'Dong, Wenyan', 'Sun, Jie']","['Yang Z', 'Wu S', 'Zhao J', 'Wang Z', 'Yao M', 'Lu P', 'Dong W', 'Sun J']",,"[""Center of Clinical Research, Wuxi People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi 214023, China."", ""Department of Anesthesiology, Wuxi Children's Hospital, Wuxi 214023, China."", ""Center of Clinical Research, Wuxi People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi 214023, China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Wuxi People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi 214023, China."", ""Department of Anesthesiology, Wuxi Children's Hospital, Wuxi 214023, China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Wuxi People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi 214023, China."", ""Department of Anesthesiology, Wuxi Children's Hospital, Wuxi 214023, China. wxdongwenyan@163.com."", ""Center of Clinical Research, Wuxi People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi 214023, China. sunjie0220@njmu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Ann Palliat Med,Annals of palliative medicine,101585484,IM,,"['Anesthetics, Inhalation/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Emulsions', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects', 'Glucose/*administration & dosage', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Isoflurane/*pharmacology', 'Rats']",['NOTNLM'],"['Emulsified isoflurane (EIso)', 'apoptosis', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)', 'glucotoxicity', 'islet beta cell']",2020/02/02 06:00,2020/10/28 06:00,['2020/02/02 06:00'],"['2019/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.21037/apm.2019.11.31 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Palliat Med. 2020 Jan;9(1):90-97. doi: 10.21037/apm.2019.11.31.,,,,"['0 (Anesthetics, Inhalation)', '0 (Emulsions)', 'CYS9AKD70P (Isoflurane)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For haematological malignancies, targeted therapies, such as small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, have a high anti-tumour activity, are well tolerated, and have a low incidence of associated tumour lysis syndrome. The BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax has a high anti-tumour activity in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, achieving deep remissions by potently inducing apoptosis and increasing the risk for tumour lysis syndrome. In this Viewpoint, we discuss the pathophysiology, risk factors, monitoring, changes in laboratory parameters, and clinical manifestations of tumour lysis syndrome, and the prophylaxis and treatments available for this complication. Prophylaxis and treatment strategies have been implemented as standard of care in patients receiving venetoclax to minimise the risk of both laboratory and clinical manifestations of tumour lysis syndrome.","['Tambaro, Francesco Paolo', 'Wierda, William G']","['Tambaro FP', 'Wierda WG']",,"['Dipartimento di Oncoematologia-Unita di trapianto di midollo osseo, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Azienda Ospedaliera di Rilievo Nazionale Santobono-Pausilipon, Napoli, Italy.', 'Department of Leukemia, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

A cohort of AA patients (n = 325) was queried for those with non-severe disease using stringent criteria including bone marrow hypocellularity and chronic persistence of moderately depressed blood counts. As a result, we have identified and analyzed pathological and clinical features in 85 mAA patients. Progression to sAA and direct clonal evolution (paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria/acute myeloid leukaemia; PNH/AML) occurred in 16%, 11% and 1% of mAA cases respectively. Of the mAA patients who received immunosuppressive therapy, 67% responded irrespective of time of initiation of therapy while conservatively managed patients showed no spontaneous remissions. Genomic analysis of mAA identified evidence of clonal haematopoiesis with both persisting and remitting patterns at low allelic frequencies; with more pronounced mutational burden in sAA. Most of the mAA patients have autoimmune pathogenesis similar to those with sAA, but mAA contains a mix of patients with diverse aetiologies. Although progression rates differed between mAA and sAA (P = 0.003), cumulative incidences of mortalities were only marginally different (P = 0.095). Our results provide guidance for diagnosis/management of mAA, a condition for which no current standard of care is established.","['Patel, Bhumika J', 'Barot, Shimoli V', 'Kuzmanovic, Teodora', 'Kerr, Cassandra', 'Przychodzen, Bartlomiej P', 'Thota, Swapna', 'Lee, Sarah', 'Patel, Saurabh', 'Radivoyevitch, Tomas', 'Lichtin, Alan', 'Advani, Anjali', 'Kalaycio, Matt', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Carraway, Hetty E', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Patel BJ', 'Barot SV', 'Kuzmanovic T', 'Kerr C', 'Przychodzen BP', 'Thota S', 'Lee S', 'Patel S', 'Radivoyevitch T', 'Lichtin A', 'Advani A', 'Kalaycio M', 'Sekeres MA', 'Carraway HE', 'Maciejewski JP']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5313-9992'],"['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200131,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia, Aplastic/blood/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Autoimmune Diseases/genetics/pathology', 'Benzoates/therapeutic use', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Danazol/therapeutic use', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/etiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/therapeutic use', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*clinical outcomes', '*moderate aplastic anaemia', '*molecular mutation', '*myelodysplastic syndrome']",2020/02/01 06:00,2021/01/28 06:00,['2020/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16460 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Jun;189(5):967-975. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16460.

To design highly effective covalent inhibitors, a strategy is to fill its large catalytic cleft by designing tranylcypromine (TCP) analogs decorated with long, hindered substituents. We prepared three series of TCP analogs, carrying aroyl- and arylacetylamino (1 a-h), Z-amino acylamino (2 a-o), or double-substituted benzamide (3 a-n) residues at the C4 or C3 position of the phenyl ring. Further fragments obtained by chemical manipulation applied on the TCP scaffold (compounds 4 a-i) were also prepared. When tested against LSD1, most of 1 and 3 exhibited IC50 values in the low nanomolar range, with 1 e and 3 a,d,f,g being also the most selective respect to monoamine oxidases. In MV4-11 AML and NB4 APL cells compounds 3 were the most potent, displaying up to sub-micromolar cell growth inhibition against both cell lines (3 a) or against NB4 cells (3 c). The most potent compounds in cellular assays were also able to induce the expression of LSD1 target genes, such as GFI-1b, ITGAM, and KCTD12, as functional read-out for LSD1 inhibition. Mouse and human intrinsic clearance data highlighted the high metabolic stability of compounds 3 a, 3 d and 3 g. Further studies will be performed on the new compounds 3 a and 3 c to assess their anticancer potential in different cancer contexts.","['Fioravanti, Rossella', 'Romanelli, Annalisa', 'Mautone, Nicola', 'Di Bello, Elisabetta', 'Rovere, Annarita', 'Corinti, Davide', 'Zwergel, Clemens', 'Valente, Sergio', 'Rotili, Dante', 'Botrugno, Oronza A', 'Dessanti, Paola', 'Vultaggio, Stefania', 'Vianello, Paola', 'Cappa, Anna', 'Binda, Claudia', 'Mattevi, Andrea', 'Minucci, Saverio', 'Mercurio, Ciro', 'Varasi, Mario', 'Mai, Antonello']","['Fioravanti R', 'Romanelli A', 'Mautone N', 'Di Bello E', 'Rovere A', 'Corinti D', 'Zwergel C', 'Valente S', 'Rotili D', 'Botrugno OA', 'Dessanti P', 'Vultaggio S', 'Vianello P', 'Cappa A', 'Binda C', 'Mattevi A', 'Minucci S', 'Mercurio C', 'Varasi M', 'Mai A']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9176-2382'],"['Department of Drug Chemistry and Technologies, Sapienza University of Rome, P. le A.

Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) plays an important role in DNA damage repair and contributes to the progression of several types of cancer. Here, we investigated the impact of PARP1 V762A polymorphism on the susceptibility to and prognosis of MDS. METHODS: Samples collected from 105 MDS patients and 202 race-matched healthy controls were subjected to polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism for genotyping. RESULTS: The allele and genotype frequencies of PARP1 V762A did not differ between MDS patients and the control group. However, MDS patients with the PARP1 V762A non-AA genotype, which is associated with high gene activity, had shorter overall survival rates (P = .01) than those with the AA genotype. Multivariate analysis of overall survival also revealed PARP1 V762A non-AA genotype as a poor prognostic factor (P = .02). When patients were analyzed according to treatment history, the PARP1 V762A non-AA genotype was only associated with poor survival in patients who had received treatment (P = .02). CONCLUSION: PARP1 V762A polymorphism may be an independent prognostic factor for MDS, and a predictive biomarker for MDS treatment.","['Gotoh, Nanami', 'Minato, Yusuke', 'Saitoh, Takayuki', 'Takahashi, Noriyuki', 'Kasamatsu, Tetsuhiro', 'Souma, Kana', 'Oda, Tsukasa', 'Hoshino, Takumi', 'Sakura, Toru', 'Ishizaki, Takuma', 'Shimizu, Hiroaki', 'Takizawa, Makiko', 'Yokohama, Akihiko', 'Tsukamoto, Norifumi', 'Handa, Hiroshi', 'Murakami, Hirokazu']","['Gotoh N', 'Minato Y', 'Saitoh T', 'Takahashi N', 'Kasamatsu T', 'Souma K', 'Oda T', 'Hoshino T', 'Sakura T', 'Ishizaki T', 'Shimizu H', 'Takizawa M', 'Yokohama A', 'Tsukamoto N', 'Handa H', 'Murakami H']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5524-7455', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7943-9176', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3753-9862']","['Graduate School of Health Sciences, Gunma University, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Hyogo College of Medicine, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Health Sciences, Gunma University, Gunma, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Health Sciences, Gunma University, Gunma, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Health Sciences, Gunma University, Gunma, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Health Sciences, Gunma University, Gunma, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Institute for Molecular and Cellular Regulation, Gunma University, Gunma, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Gunma, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma, Japan.', 'Division of Blood Transfusion Service, Gunma University Hospital, Gunma, Japan.', 'Oncology Center, Gunma University Hospital, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Health Sciences, Gunma University, Gunma, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200304,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Odds Ratio', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['PARP1', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'polymorphism']",2020/02/01 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2020/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13393 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2020 Jun;104(6):526-537. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13393.

Previously-described links between formaldehyde exposure and lung cancer have been weak and inconsistent. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate quantitatively the association between formaldehyde exposure and lung cancer. METHODS: We searched for articles on occupational formaldehyde exposure and lung cancer in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases. In total, 32 articles were selected and 31 studies were included in a meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses and quality assessments were also performed. RESULTS: The risk of lung cancer among workers exposed to formaldehyde was not significantly increased, with an overall pooled risk estimate of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-1.12). The pooled risk estimate of lung cancer was increased when higher exposure studies were considered (1.19; 95% CI, 0.96-1.46). More statistically robust results were obtained when high quality (1.13; 95% CI, 1.08-1.19) and recent (1.13; 95% CI, 1.07-1.19) studies were used in deriving pooled risk estimates. CONCLUSIONS: No significant increase in the risk of lung cancer was evident in the overall pooled risk estimate; even in higher formaldehyde exposure groups. Our findings do not provide strong evidence in favor of formaldehyde as a risk factor for lung cancer. However, since risk estimates were significantly increased for high-quality and recent studies, the possibility that exposure to formaldehyde can increase the risk of lung cancer might still be considered.","['Kwak, Kyeongmin', 'Paek, Domyung', 'Park, Jong-Tae']","['Kwak K', 'Paek D', 'Park JT']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6296-8058', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4510-6362', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0687-3609']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Ansan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Environmental Sciences, Seoul National University Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Environmental Sciences, Seoul National University Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Ansan, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20200130,United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,IM,,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Formaldehyde/*adverse effects/analysis/*poisoning', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Respiratory Hypersensitivity/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*formaldehyde', '*lung cancer', '*meta-analysis', '*occupational exposure', '*respiratory cancer']",2020/02/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:00,['2020/02/01 06:00'],"['2020/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.23093 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2020 Apr;63(4):312-327. doi: 10.1002/ajim.23093.

The human Clec11a gene encodes a polypeptide of 323 amino acids with characteristics of a secreted glycoprotein encompassing two integrin-binding motifs, RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) and LDT (Leu-Asp-Thr), a putative leucine zipper domain, and a functional C-type lectin domain. It regulates hematopoietic differentiation and homeostasis and exhibits a protective effect against severe malarial anemia and lipotoxicity. Furthermore, Clec11a promotes the differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors into mature osteoblasts in vitro and plays an important role in the maintenance of adult skeleton age-related bone loss and fracture repair. Receptor ligand binding results in activation of downstream signaling cascades including glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), beta-catenin, and Wnt, resulting in the expression of osteoblast-related gene transcripts including Alp, Runx2, Lef1, and Axin2. In addition, Clec11a is also associated with the development of several cancers, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, and gastrointestinal tract tumors. To date, however, the mechanisms governing transcription regulation of the Clec11a gene are not known and remain to be uncovered. Understanding the function and mechanism of action of Clec11a will pave the way for the development of Clec11a as a novel therapeutic target for conditions such as cancer, anemia, and skeletal diseases.","['Wang, Miao', 'Guo, Jianmin', 'Zhang, Lingli', 'Kuek, Vincent', 'Xu, Jiake', 'Zou, Jun']","['Wang M', 'Guo J', 'Zhang L', 'Kuek V', 'Xu J', 'Zou J']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2021-8309', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6036-8067']","['School of Kinesiology, Shanghai University of Sport, Shanghai, China.', 'School of Kinesiology, Shanghai University of Sport, Shanghai, China.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Kinesiology, Shanghai University of Sport, Shanghai, China.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Kinesiology, Shanghai University of Sport, Shanghai, China.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Kinesiology, Shanghai University of Sport, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200131,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Clec11a', '*cancers', '*integrin signaling', '*mesenchymal progenitors', '*osteoblasts']",2020/02/01 06:00,2021/03/05 06:00,['2020/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.29600 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2020 Oct;235(10):6357-6365. doi: 10.1002/jcp.29600.

This study was designed to explore the anti-leukemia activity of physcion 8-O-beta-glucopyranoside (PG) in B-cell ALL. METHODS: NALM6 and SupB15 cells were used as model cell lines. Cell viability, cell apoptosis, cell cycle distribution were determined by CCK-8 assay, DNA fragmentation assay and flow cytometry, and flow cytometry, respectively. Expression of proteins involved in cell apoptosis and cell cycle regulation was determined by western blot and the levels of ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) were determined by ELISA. Activity of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) was also determined with a Sphingosine Kinase Assay Kit. In the present study, both model cell lines were transfected with siRNA targeting SphK1 or an overexpression plasmid to examine the role of SphK1 in the anti-leukemia activity of PG. Moreover, the efficacy of PG was examined in vivo in a mouse model by measuring survival and spleen weight. RESULTS: Our results provided experimental evidence that PG could significantly induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vitro. Mechanistically, the anti-leukemia activity of PG was mediated by its ability to repress SphK1 and thus modulate ceramide-S1P rheostat. Moreover, the anti-leukemia activity of PG was also verified in a murine model. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results indicate that PG may be a promising agent for the treatment of B-cell leukemia.","['Han, Jinyan', 'Zhao, Ping', 'Shao, Weiqin', 'Wang, Zengmin', 'Wang, Fengxue', 'Sheng, Lei']","['Han J', 'Zhao P', 'Shao W', 'Wang Z', 'Wang F', 'Sheng L']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Provincial Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Provincial Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Provincial Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Provincial Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Provincial Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', ""Department of Pediatrics, The First People's Hospital of Jining, Jining, Shandong, China. leisjnsd@126.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180316,Switzerland,Pharmacol Rep,Pharmacological reports : PR,101234999,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Emodin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Glucosides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Sphingolipids/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Apoptosis', 'Physcion 8-O-beta-glucopyranoside', 'Sphingosine kinase 1']",2018/09/01 00:00,2020/04/11 06:00,['2020/02/01 06:00'],"['2017/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.pharep.2018.03.003 [doi]', '10.1016/j.pharep.2018.03.003 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Rep. 2018 Sep;70(5):853-862. doi: 10.1016/j.pharep.2018.03.003.

Cpf1 is a smaller and simpler endonuclease than Cas9, overcoming some limitations of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The applications of CRISPR to rodent embryos for the production of knock-out (KO) mice have been achieved mainly by microinjection, which requires heavily-equipped instruments with skillful hands. Here, we evaluated the genome editing efficiency between Cpf1/mRNA and Cpf1/ribonuclear protein (RNP) in mouse embryos, and established an easy, fast, and technically less demanding method to produce KO mice using electroporation of the Cfp1/RNP system. METHODS: The efficiency of electroporation-based delivery of AsCpf1/mRNA and AsCpf1/RNP to target exon 3 of leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif) into mouse zygotes was evaluated. Embryos that developed to the two-cell stage after zygote electroporation were transferred into the oviducts of surrogate mothers to produce AsCpf1-mediated LIF KO mice. The genome editing efficiency of blastocysts and pups was tested using the T7E1 assay and/or DNA sequencing. Congenital abnormalities and reproductive phenotypes in LIF KO mice produced by electroporation with AsCpf1/RNP were examined. RESULTS: Survival and two-cell development of electroporated zygotes were comparable between the AsCpf1/mRNA and AsCpf1/RNP groups, whereas genome editing efficiency was relatively higher in the AsCpf1/RNP group (13.3% vs 18.1% at blastocyst and 33.3% vs 45.5% at offspring), respectively. Two mouse lines with a frameshift mutation in exon 3 of the Lif gene were established from the AsCpf1/RNP group. All congenital abnormalities of LIF KO mice produced by AsCpf1/RNP electroporation were observed. AsCpf1-mediated LIF KO mice showed postnatal growth retardation and implantation failure, both of which are major phenotypes of LIF KO mice generated by conventional gene targeting. CONCLUSION: Electroporation of AsCpf1/RNP at the zygote stage is an efficient genome editing method to produce KO mice.","['Kim, Yeon Sun', 'Kim, Gyeong Ryeong', 'Park, Mira', 'Yang, Seung Chel', 'Park, So Hee', 'Won, Ji Eun', 'Lee, Ju Hee', 'Shin, Ha Eun', 'Song, Haengseok', 'Kim, Hye-Ryun']","['Kim YS', 'Kim GR', 'Park M', 'Yang SC', 'Park SH', 'Won JE', 'Lee JH', 'Shin HE', 'Song H', 'Kim HR']",,"['Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, 335 Pangyo-ro, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, 13488, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, 335 Pangyo-ro, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, 13488, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, 335 Pangyo-ro, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, 13488, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, 335 Pangyo-ro, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, 13488, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, 335 Pangyo-ro, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, 13488, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, 335 Pangyo-ro, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, 13488, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, 335 Pangyo-ro, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, 13488, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, 335 Pangyo-ro, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, 13488, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, 335 Pangyo-ro, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, 13488, Republic of Korea. hssong@cha.ac.kr.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, 335 Pangyo-ro, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, 13488, Republic of Korea. hrkim@cha.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191119,Korea (South),Tissue Eng Regen Med,Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine,101699923,IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blastocyst/metabolism', 'CRISPR-Associated Protein 9', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Electroporation/*methods', 'Endonucleases', 'Gene Editing/*methods', 'Gene Targeting', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microinjections', 'RNA, Guide/genetics', 'Zygote/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AsCpf1/RNP', '*CRISPR/AsCpf1', '*Electroporation', '*Embryo', '*Gene targeting', '*LIF']",2020/02/01 06:00,2021/05/18 06:00,['2020/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13770-019-00225-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s13770-019-00225-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Tissue Eng Regen Med. 2020 Feb;17(1):45-53. doi: 10.1007/s13770-019-00225-8.

A variety of mostly retrospective studies have shown that AML patients with a positive MRD test, assessed by different techniques at defined cutoffs and time-points, are at significantly higher risk of relapse and experience shorter overall survival compared to MRD-negative patients. How this valuable information may be adapted in the daily routine of patients' treatment to distinguish individuals who need more aggressive therapy from the ones who can be spared additional therapy to avoid treatment-related toxicities is still being investigated. With the exception of MRD analyses in acute promyelocitic leukemia (APL), the clinical implications of MRD tests for the individual AML patient are still mostly unknown. We currently lack hard evidence that MRD-based therapy modulation during treatment or pre-emptive intervention in MRD-positive patients after therapy would improve outcomes in non-APL AML patients. These questions will be evaluated in prospective randomized clinical trials. Today, however, some conclusions with regard to MRD assessment in AML can be drawn from the published data and are reviewed in this article.","['Schwind, Sebastian', 'Jentzsch, Madlen', 'Bach, Enrica', 'Stasik, Sebastian', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Platzbecker, Uwe']","['Schwind S', 'Jentzsch M', 'Bach E', 'Stasik S', 'Thiede C', 'Platzbecker U']",,"['Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Liebigstrasse 22, Haus 7, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Liebigstrasse 22, Haus 7, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Liebigstrasse 22, Haus 7, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Department I, University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, TU Dresden, Dresden, 01307, Germany.', 'Medical Department I, University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, TU Dresden, Dresden, 01307, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Liebigstrasse 22, Haus 7, 04103, Leipzig, Germany. haematologie@medizin.uni-leipzig.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200130,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,IM,,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Measurable residual disease', '*Pre-emptive therapy', '*Risk stratification', '*Therapeutic decisions']",2020/02/01 06:00,2021/06/12 06:00,['2020/02/01 06:00'],"['2020/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11864-019-0695-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-019-0695-5 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2020 Jan 30;21(1):8. doi: 10.1007/s11864-019-0695-5.,,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survivin belongs to IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) gene family and is a pivotal target for treatment due to its overexpression and oncogenic function in many malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Although survivin is a specific target for YM155, recent reports have shown that it has many other crucial targets that regulate its anti-apoptotic effects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether YM155 could have an effect on cell death-inducing genes as well as inducing apoptosis in T-ALL MOLT4- cell line. Methods: We treated MOLT-4 cells with increasing concentrations of YM155 and then cell viability was determined using MTT (methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium) assay. Also, the rate of induction of apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells and the target genes expression levels were evaluated by Annexin V/PI and real-time PCR, respectively. Results: YM155 inhibited cell growth in MOLT-4 cells. This outcome is achieved by inducing apoptosis and a significant increase in the expression level of P53, MiR-9, caspase 3 and decreasing the mRNA expression levels of survivin, Sirtuin1(SIRT1), member of anti-apoptotic proteins family (Bcl-2), and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) initiating factors Snail1and Zeb2. Conclusion: The results showed that use of YM155 can be a potential drug therapy in T-ALL patients with promising effects on apoptosis induction.","['Shojaei Moghadam, Kobra', 'Farshdousti Hagh, Majid', 'Alivand, Mohammad Reza', 'Fardi, Masoumeh', 'Movassaghpour, Ali Akbar', 'Mohammadi, Ali', 'Moghadasi, Maryam', 'Solali, Saeed']","['Shojaei Moghadam K', 'Farshdousti Hagh M', 'Alivand MR', 'Fardi M', 'Movassaghpour AA', 'Mohammadi A', 'Moghadasi M', 'Solali S']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5800-1626', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5583-1835', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6487-3551']","['Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetic, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Departments of Cancer and Inflammation Research, Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Division of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191211,Iran,Adv Pharm Bull,Advanced pharmaceutical bulletin,101578021,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cancer', 'Drug', 'MOLT-4', 'Survivin', 'YM155']",2020/02/01 06:00,2020/02/01 06:01,['2020/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.15171/apb.2020.010 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Pharm Bull. 2020 Jan;10(1):81-87. doi: 10.15171/apb.2020.010.

Here, using an established computational algorithm (CIBERSORT), we systematically analyzed the overall distribution of 22 tumor-infiltrating leukocyte (TIL) populations in more than 2000 bone marrow (BM) samples from 5 major hematological malignancies and healthy controls. Focusing on significantly altered TILs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we found that patients with AML exhibited increased frequencies of M2 macrophages, compared to either healthy controls or the other four malignancies. High infiltration of M2 macrophages was associated with poor outcome in AML. Further analysis revealed that CD206, a M2 marker gene, could faithfully reflect variation in M2 fractions and was more highly expressed in AML than normal controls. High CD206 expression predicted inferior overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in two independent AML cohorts. Among 175 patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, the survival still differed greatly between low and high CD206 expressers (OS; P < .0001; 3-year rates, 56% v 32%; EFS; P < .001; 3-year rates, 47% v 25%). When analyzed in a meta-analysis, CD206 as a continuous variable showed superior predictive performance than classical prognosticators in AML (BAALC, ERG, EVI1, MN1, and WT1). In summary, M2 macrophages are preferentially enriched in AML. The M2 marker CD206 may serve as a new prognostic marker in AML.","['Xu, Zi-Jun', 'Gu, Yu', 'Wang, Cui-Zhu', 'Jin, Ye', 'Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Tang, Li-Juan', 'Mao, Zhen-Wei', 'Qian, Jun', 'Lin, Jiang']","['Xu ZJ', 'Gu Y', 'Wang CZ', 'Jin Y', 'Wen XM', 'Ma JC', 'Tang LJ', 'Mao ZW', 'Qian J', 'Lin J']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5051-6799', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4704-9157']","[""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, P.R.

Here, we retrospectively analysed the contributions of lineage-sorted donor cell chimerism (sDCC) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting disease-specific genetic rearrangements to detect minimal residual/relapsing disease (MRD) and predict impending relapse in 94 adult ALL patients after SCT. With a median follow-up of surviving patients (n = 61) of 3.3 years, qPCR and/or sDCC measurements turned positive in 38 patients (40%). Of these, 22 patients relapsed and 16 remained in complete remission. At 3 years, qPCR and/or sDCC positive patients showed an increased incidence of relapse (50% vs. 4%, p < 0.0001), decreased relapse-free survival (RFS, 40% vs. 85%, p < 0.0001), and decreased overall survival (OS, 47% vs. 87%, p 0.004). Both, qPCR and sDCC pre-detected 11 of 21 relapses occurring within the first two years after SCT and, overall, complemented for each other method in four of the relapsing and four of the non-relapsing cases. Patients receiving pre-emptive MRD-driven interventions (n = 11) or not (n = 10) showed comparable median times until relapse, RFS, and OS. In our single centre cohort, qPCR and sDCC were similarly effective and complementary helpful to indicate haematological relapse of ALL after SCT.","['Wethmar, Klaus', 'Matern, Svenja', 'Esseling, Eva', 'Angenendt, Linus', 'Pfeifer, Heike', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Stelmach, Patrick', 'Call, Simon', 'Albring, Jorn C', 'Mikesch, Jan-Henrik', 'Reicherts, Christian', 'Groth, Christoph', 'Schliemann, Christoph', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Lenz, Georg', 'Stelljes, Matthias']","['Wethmar K', 'Matern S', 'Esseling E', 'Angenendt L', 'Pfeifer H', 'Bruggemann M', 'Stelmach P', 'Call S', 'Albring JC', 'Mikesch JH', 'Reicherts C', 'Groth C', 'Schliemann C', 'Berdel WE', 'Lenz G', 'Stelljes M']",,"['Department of Medicine A/Haematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Haematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Haematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Haematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Haematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Haematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Haematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Haematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Haematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Haematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Haematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Haematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Haematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Haematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany. stelljes@ukmuenster.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200130,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,,"['Adult', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",,,2020/02/01 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-0801-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-0801-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2020 Jul;55(7):1410-1420. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-0801-0.

There are no immunotherapies and few molecularly targeted therapeutics available for treatment of this malignancy. The identification and characterization of genes and pathways that drive T-ALL progression are critical for the development of new therapies for T-ALL. Here, we determined that the protein tyrosine phosphatase 4A3 (PTP4A3 or PRL-3) plays a critical role in T-ALL initiation and progression by promoting leukemia cell migration. PRL-3 is highly expressed in patient T-ALL samples at both the mRNA and protein levels compared to normal lymphocytes. Knock-down of PRL-3 expression using short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) in human T-ALL cell lines significantly impeded T-ALL cell migration capacity in vitro and reduced their ability to engraft and proliferate in vivo in xenograft mouse models. Additionally, PRL-3 overexpression in a Myc-induced zebrafish T-ALL model significantly accelerated disease onset and shortened the time needed for cells to enter blood circulation. Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that the SRC signaling pathway is affected by PRL-3. Immunoblot analyses validated that manipulation of PRL-3 expression in T-ALL cells affected the SRC signaling pathway, which is directly involved in cell migration, although Src was not a direct substrate of PRL-3. More importantly, T-ALL cell growth and migration were inhibited by small molecule inhibition of PRL-3, suggesting that PRL-3 has potential as a therapeutic target in T-ALL. Taken together, our study identifies PRL-3 as an oncogenic driver in T-ALL both in vitro and in vivo and provides a strong rationale for targeted therapies that interfere with PRL-3 function.","['Wei, M', 'Haney, M G', 'Rivas, D R', 'Blackburn, J S']","['Wei M', 'Haney MG', 'Rivas DR', 'Blackburn JS']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9464-3784'],"['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, 4053, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, 4053, USA.', 'Markey Cancer Center, Lexington, KY, 40536, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, 4053, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, 4053, USA. jsblackburn@uky.edu.', 'Markey Cancer Center, Lexington, KY, 40536, USA. jsblackburn@uky.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200130,United States,Oncogenesis,Oncogenesis,101580004,,,,,,2020/02/01 06:00,2020/02/01 06:01,['2020/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41389-020-0192-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41389-020-0192-5 [pii]']",epublish,Oncogenesis. 2020 Jan 30;9(1):6. doi: 10.1038/s41389-020-0192-5.,PMC6992623,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DP2 CA228043/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA181500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA165990/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA177558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA227656/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R50 CA221675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether therapies targeting these mutations can eradicate premalignant cells is unclear. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an attractive system for investigating the effect of preventative treatment because this disease is often preceded by a premalignant state (clonal hematopoiesis or myelodysplastic syndrome). In Npm1c/Dnmt3a mutant knock-in mice, a model of AML development, leukemia is preceded by a period of extended myeloid progenitor cell proliferation and self-renewal.

Here, we show that selective blockade of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) enhances the susceptibility of CML-LSCs to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which facilitates the eradication of CML-LSCs and leads to sustained remission of the disease. We demonstrated for the first time that TGF-beta-PAI-1 axis was selectively augmented in CML-LSCs in the bone marrow (BM), whereby protecting CML-LSCs from TKI treatment. Furthermore, the combined administration of TKI plus a PAI-1 inhibitor, in a mouse model of CML, significantly enhanced the eradication of CML cells in the BM and prolonged the survival of CML mice. The combined therapy of imatinib and a PAI-1 inhibitor prevented the recurrence of CML-like disease in serially transplanted recipients, indicating the elimination of CML-LSCs. Interestingly, PAI-1 inhibitor treatment augmented membrane-type matrix metalloprotease-1 (MT1-MMP)-dependent motility of CML-LSCs, and the anti-CML effect of PAI-1 inhibitor was extinguished by the neutralizing antibody for MT1-MMP, underlining the mechanistic importance of MT1-MMP. Our findings provide evidence of, and a rationale for, a novel therapeutic tactic, based on the blockade of PAI-1 activity, for CML patients.","['Yahata, Takashi', 'Ibrahim, Abd Aziz', 'Hirano, Ken-Ichi', 'Muguruma, Yukari', 'Naka, Kazuhito', 'Hozumi, Katsuto', 'Vaughan, Douglas E', 'Miyata, Toshio', 'Ando, Kiyoshi']","['Yahata T', 'Ibrahim AA', 'Hirano KI', 'Muguruma Y', 'Naka K', 'Hozumi K', 'Vaughan DE', 'Miyata T', 'Ando K']",,"['Tokai University School of Medicine.', 'Tokai University School of Medicine.', 'Tokai University School of Medicine.', 'National Cancer Center Research Institute.', 'Hiroshima University.', 'Tokai University School of Medicine.', 'Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.', 'Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Tokai University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210201,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Animals', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Serpin E2']",,,2020/02/01 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.230227 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.230227 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Feb 1;106(2):483-494. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.230227.,PMC7849585,,['R01 HL051387/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (SERPINE1 protein, human)', '0 (Serpin E2)', '0 (Serpine2 protein, mouse)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Children's Oncology Group study AALL0433 evaluated a new platform for relapsed ALL. Between March 2007 and October 2013 AALL0433 enrolled 275 participants with late bone marrow or very early isolated central nervous system (iCNS) relapse of childhood B-ALL. Patients were randomized to receive standard versus intensive vincristine dosing; this randomization closed due to excess peripheral neuropathy in 2010. Patients with matched sibling donors received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) after the first three blocks of therapy. The prognostic value of minimal residual disease (MRD) was also evaluated in this study. The 3-year event free and overall survival (EFS/OS) for the 271 eligible patients were 63.6% +/- 3.0% and 72.3% +/- 2.8% respectively. MRD at the end of Induction-1 was highly predictive of outcome, with 3-year EFS/OS of 84.9 +/- 4.0% and 93.8 +/- 2.7% for patients with MRD <0.1%, vs. 53.7 +/- 7.8% and 60.6 +/- 7.8% for patients with MRD >/=0.1% (p<0.0001). Patients who received HCT vs. chemotherapy alone had an improved 3-year disease-free survival (77.5 +/- 6.2% vs. 66.9 +/- 4.5%, p=0.03) but not OS (81.5 +/- 5.8% for HCT vs. 85.8 +/- 3.4% for chemotherapy, p=0.46). Patients with early iCNS relapse fared poorly, with a 3-year EFS/OS of 41.4% +/- 9.2% and 51.7% +/- 9.3%, respectively. Infectious toxicities of the chemotherapy platform were significant. The AALL0433 chemotherapy platform is efficacious for late bone marrow relapse of B-ALL, but with significant toxicities. The MRD threshold of 0.1% at the end of Induction-1 was highly predictive of outcome. The optimal role for HCT for this patient population remains uncertain.

Though transformed cells are predominantly BCR-ABL-dependent and sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment, some BMPR1B+ leukemic stem cells are treatment-insensitive and rely, among others, on the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway for their survival via a BMP4 autocrine loop. Here, we further studied the involvement of BMP signaling in favoring residual leukemic stem cell persistence in the bone marrow of patients having achieved remission under treatment. We demonstrate by single-cell RNA-Seq analysis that a sub-fraction of surviving BMPR1B+ leukemic stem cells are co-enriched in BMP signaling, quiescence and stem cell signatures, without modulation of the canonical BMP target genes, but enrichment in actors of the Jak2/Stat3 signaling pathway. Indeed, based on a new model of persisting CD34+CD38- leukemic stem cells, we show that BMPR1B+ cells display co-activated Smad1/5/8 and Stat3 pathways. Interestingly, we reveal that only the BMPR1B+ cells adhering to stromal cells display a quiescent status. Surprisingly, this quiescence is induced by treatment, while non-adherent BMPR1B+ cells treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors continued to proliferate. The subsequent targeting of BMPR1B and Jak2 pathways decreased quiescent leukemic stem cells by promoting their cell cycle re-entry and differentiation. Moreover, while Jak2-inhibitors alone increased BMP4 production by mesenchymal cells, the addition of the newly described BMPR1B inhibitor (E6201) impaired BMP4-mediated production by stromal cells. Altogether, our data demonstrate that targeting both BMPR1B and Jak2/Stat3 efficiently impacts persisting and dormant leukemic stem cells hidden in their bone marrow microenvironment.","['Jeanpierre, Sandrine', 'Arizkane, Kawtar', 'Thongjuea, Supat', 'Grockowiak, Elodie', 'Geistlich, Kevin', 'Barral, Lea', 'Voeltzel, Thibault', 'Guillemin, Anissa', 'Gonin-Giraud, Sandrine', 'Gandrillon, Olivier', 'Nicolini, Franck-Emmanuel', 'Mead, Adam J', 'Maguer-Satta, Veronique', 'Lefort, Sylvain']","['Jeanpierre S', 'Arizkane K', 'Thongjuea S', 'Grockowiak E', 'Geistlich K', 'Barral L', 'Voeltzel T', 'Guillemin A', 'Gonin-Giraud S', 'Gandrillon O', 'Nicolini FE', 'Mead AJ', 'Maguer-Satta V', 'Lefort S']",,"['Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon.', 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon.', 'Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine.', 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon.', 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon.', 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon.', 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon.', 'Laboratoire de biologie et modelisation de la cellule.

Using a genome-wide loss-of-function screen, we identified that impaired death receptor signaling in ALL led to rapidly progressive disease despite CART19 treatment. This was mediated by an inherent resistance to T-cell cytotoxicity that permitted antigen persistence and was subsequently magnified by the induction of CAR T-cell functional impairment. These findings were validated using samples from two CAR T-cell clinical trials in ALL, where we found that reduced expression of death receptor genes was associated with worse overall survival and reduced T-cell fitness. Our findings suggest that inherent dysregulation of death receptor signaling in ALL directly leads to CAR T-cell failure by impairing T-cell cytotoxicity and promoting progressive CAR T-cell dysfunction. SIGNIFICANCE: Resistance to CART19 is a significant barrier to efficacy in the treatment of B-cell malignancies. This work demonstrates that impaired death receptor signaling in tumor cells causes failed CART19 cytotoxicity and drives CART19 dysfunction, identifying a novel mechanism of antigen-independent resistance to CAR therapy.See related commentary by Green and Neelapu, p. 492.","['Singh, Nathan', 'Lee, Yong Gu', 'Shestova, Olga', 'Ravikumar, Pranali', 'Hayer, Katharina E', 'Hong, Seok Jae', 'Lu, Xueqing Maggie', 'Pajarillo, Raymone', 'Agarwal, Sangya', 'Kuramitsu, Shunichiro', 'Orlando, Elena J', 'Mueller, Karen Thudium', 'Good, Charly R', 'Berger, Shelley L', 'Shalem, Ophir', 'Weitzman, Matthew D', 'Frey, Noelle V', 'Maude, Shannon L', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'June, Carl H', 'Gill, Saar', 'Ruella, Marco']","['Singh N', 'Lee YG', 'Shestova O', 'Ravikumar P', 'Hayer KE', 'Hong SJ', 'Lu XM', 'Pajarillo R', 'Agarwal S', 'Kuramitsu S', 'Orlando EJ', 'Mueller KT', 'Good CR', 'Berger SL', 'Shalem O', 'Weitzman MD', 'Frey NV', 'Maude SL', 'Grupp SA', 'June CH', 'Gill S', 'Ruella M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1463-3111', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3299-0929', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4272-515X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9713-167X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0241-3557', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4301-5811']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. nathan.singh@wustl.edu saar.gill@pennmedicine.upenn.edu mruella@upenn.edu.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, East Hanover, New Jersey.', 'Epigenetics Institute, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Epigenetics Institute, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Center for Cell and Molecular Therapeutics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Divison of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia;

They cause genome-wide splicing alterations that affect important regulators of hematopoiesis. Several mRNA isoforms promoted by the various splicing factor mutants comprise a premature termination codon (PTC) and are therefore potential targets of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In light of the mechanistic relationship between splicing and NMD, we sought evidence for a specific role of mutant SRSF2 in NMD. We show that SRSF2 Pro95 hot spot mutations elicit enhanced mRNA decay, which is dependent on sequence-specific RNA binding and splicing. SRSF2 mutants enhance the deposition of exon junction complexes (EJCs) downstream from the PTC through RNA-mediated molecular interactions. This architecture then favors the association of key NMD factors to elicit mRNA decay. Gene-specific blocking of EJC deposition by antisense oligonucleotides circumvents aberrant NMD promoted by mutant SRSF2, restoring the expression of PTC-containing transcript. Our study uncovered critical effects of SRSF2 mutants in hematologic malignancies, reflecting the regulation at multiple levels of RNA metabolism, from splicing to decay.","['Rahman, Mohammad Alinoor', 'Lin, Kuan-Ting', 'Bradley, Robert K', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Krainer, Adrian R']","['Rahman MA', 'Lin KT', 'Bradley RK', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Krainer AR']",,"['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.', 'Computational Biology Program, Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.', 'Basic Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200130,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay/genetics', 'RNA Splicing/*genetics', 'RNA Stability/*genetics', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/*genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*SRSF2', '*leukemia', '*mutation', '*myelodysplastic syndromes', '*nonsense-mediated mRNA decay', '*splicing', '*splicing factor']",2020/02/01 06:00,2020/04/24 06:00,['2020/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['gad.332270.119 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.332270.119 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2020 Mar 1;34(5-6):413-427. doi: 10.1101/gad.332270.119.

CHIP associates with a wide range of comorbidities from atherosclerosis to pulmonary disease. A growing body of evidence, primarily from studies involving Tet2-knockout and stem cell transplant models of CH, suggest that dysregulated inflammation contributes to clonal expansion and associated comorbidities. Mutant leukocytes from animal models contribute to an inflammatory milieu that may confer a selective advantage to the clone, thus perpetuating a cycle of inflammation and expansion. Although it is unclear whether inflammation or expansion sets this cycle in motion, some evidence suggests that inflammation from infections or pre-existing comorbidities initiates this cycle. The pro-inflammatory phenotypes of macrophages from mutant clones and their contributions to disease are well characterized in murine models, but have not yet been confirmed in humans. Furthermore, the roles of other cell types that can carry mutations of CHIP are not fully understood. We propose a rationale for further investigation of neutrophils, other granulocytes and T, B, and NK cells as they may play a role in CHIP-associated comorbidities. As the understanding of CH has advanced, potential interventions, especially those targeting aberrant inflammation, have been proposed. We are hopeful that as studies continue to unravel the complex links between CHIP, inflammation, and leukocyte dysfunction, CHIP-related comorbidities may be more effectively managed.","['Cook, Elina K', 'Luo, Michael', 'Rauh, Michael J']","['Cook EK', 'Luo M', 'Rauh MJ']",,"[""Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.

HSV encodes a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) infected cell polypeptide 0 (ICP0) that degrades PML NBs to alleviate the repression. The molecular details of the mechanism used by ICP0 to target PML NBs are unclear. Here, we identify a bona fide SUMO-interacting motif in ICP0 (SIM-like sequence [SLS] 4) that is essential and sufficient to target SUMOylated proteins in PML NBs such as the PML and Sp100. We shown that phosphorylation of SLS4 creates new salt bridges between SUMO and SLS4, increases the SUMO/SLS4 affinity, and switches ICP0 into a potent STUbL. HSV activates the Ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated kinase-Checkpoint kinase 2 (ATM-Chk2) pathway to regulate the cell cycle of the host. We report that the activated Chk2 also phosphorylates ICP0 at SLS4 and enhances its STUbL activity. Our results uncover that a viral STUbL counters antiviral response by exploiting an unprecedented cross-talk of three post-translational modifications: ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and phosphorylation.","['Hembram, Dambarudhar Shiba Sankar', 'Negi, Hitendra', 'Biswas, Poulomi', 'Tripathi, Vasvi', 'Bhushan, Lokesh', 'Shet, Divya', 'Kumar, Vikas', 'Das, Ranabir']","['Hembram DSS', 'Negi H', 'Biswas P', 'Tripathi V', 'Bhushan L', 'Shet D', 'Kumar V', 'Das R']",,"['National Center for Biological Sciences, TIFR, Bangalore, India.', 'National Center for Biological Sciences, TIFR, Bangalore, India; SASTRA University, Thirumalaisamudram, Thanjavur, India.', 'National Center for Biological Sciences, TIFR, Bangalore, India.', 'National Center for Biological Sciences, TIFR, Bangalore, India.', 'National Center for Biological Sciences, TIFR, Bangalore, India.', 'National Center for Biological Sciences, TIFR, Bangalore, India.', 'National Center for Biological Sciences, TIFR, Bangalore, India.', 'National Center for Biological Sciences, TIFR, Bangalore, India.

Despite being life-threatening, PE is preventable if diagnosed and managed early, especially in high-risk patients like pediatric oncology patients. A negative d-dimer has a high negative predictive value and can rule out PE in low-risk patients; however, it does not lower post-test probability enough and should be coupled with further diagnostics in high-risk patients. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 14-year-old girl known to have acute lymphoblastic leukemia and presented to the ED with persistent nausea and vomiting only, which was exacerbated by exertion. She had previously presented to the ED 1 week earlier for the same complaint, with a nonrevealing physical examination. At that time, the patient was worked up for nausea and vomiting and received symptomatic treatment. An electrocardiogram (ECG) during that presentation showed normal sinus rhythm. During this presentation, ECG showed new ST segment depressions from V1 to V6 in addition to an S1Q3T3 pattern. This, coupled with the exacerbation of her initial symptoms, triggered further investigations. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest was performed and showed a right lower lobe segmental pulmonary artery embolus. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: This case highlights the importance of having a high level of suspicion for PE, especially in pediatric oncology patients and specifically in hematologic malignancies. Although our patient's presentation, examination, and laboratory results were not concerning initially, CTA of the chest showed a PE. We are addressing this particular topic to increase the awareness of emergency physicians of cases like this, as PE can have an unusual presentation and missing such a diagnosis can be fatal.","['Sawaya, Rasha D', 'Cheaito, Rola', 'Cheaito, Mohamad Ali', 'Zgheib, Hady', 'El Majzoub, Imad']","['Sawaya RD', 'Cheaito R', 'Cheaito MA', 'Zgheib H', 'El Majzoub I']",,"['Department of Emergency Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200127,United States,J Emerg Med,The Journal of emergency medicine,8412174,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Female', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products', 'Humans', 'Nausea', '*Neoplasms', '*Pulmonary Embolism/diagnosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['d-dimer', 'exertion', 'nausea', 'oncology', 'palpitations', 'pediatrics', 'pulmonary embolism', 'vomiting']",2020/02/01 06:00,2021/06/24 06:00,['2020/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0736-4679(19)31118-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jemermed.2019.12.016 [doi]']",ppublish,J Emerg Med. 2020 Jun;58(6):927-931. doi: 10.1016/j.jemermed.2019.12.016.

Previous studies have shown that EZH2 has an important role in the induction of the resistance against the Tumor necrosis factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL)-Induced Apoptosis (TIA) in some leukemia cells. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of silencing EZH2 gene expression using RNA interference on the expression of death receptors 4 and 5 (DR4/5), Preferentially expressed Antigen in Melanoma (PRAME), and TRAIL human lymphoid leukemia MOLT-4 cells. METHODS: Quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the EZH2 expression and other candidate genes following the siRNA knockdown in MOLT-4 cells. The toxicity of the EZH2 siRNA was evaluated using Annexin V/PI assay following the transfection of the cells by 80 pM EZH2 siRNA at 48 hours. RESULTS: Based on the flow-cytometry results, the EZH2 siRNA had no toxic effects on MOLT-4 cells. Also, the EZH2 inhibition increased the expression of DR4/5 but reduced the PRAME gene expression at the mRNA levels. Moreover, the EZH2 silencing could not change the TRAIL mRNA in the transfected cells. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that the down-regulation of EZH2 in MOLT-4 cells was able to affect the expression of important genes involved in the induction of resistance against TIA. Hence, we suggest that the silencing of EZH2 using RNA interference can be an effective and safe approach to help defeat the MOLT-4 cell resistance against TIA.","['Naimi, Adel', 'Safaei, Sahar', 'Entezari, Atefeh', 'Solali, Saeed', 'Hassanzadeh, Ali']","['Naimi A', 'Safaei S', 'Entezari A', 'Solali S', 'Hassanzadeh A']",,"['Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Sabzevar University of Medical Science, Sabzevar, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Paramedicine, Sabzevar University of Medical Sciences, Sabzevar, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'RNA, Messenger/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['*EZH2', '*Leukemia', '*PRAME', '*TRAIL', '*death receptor', '*knockdown', '*siRNA.']",2020/02/01 06:00,2021/02/04 06:00,['2020/02/01 06:00'],"['2019/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-104079 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520620666200130091955 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2020;20(5):571-579. doi: 10.2174/1871520620666200130091955.,,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)']","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this connection it is necessary to study the dynamics of mental and emotional condition of the child at different stages of chemotherapy and the timing of formation of asthenic syndrome. The aim: Determine the presence of psycho-emotional disorders and the severity of asthenic syndrome in children with acute leukemia after the first stage of chemotherapy in order to further predict the development of this pathology and develop a package of solutions that minimize its manifestations. Material and methods: A survey of 36 children was conducted, of them 21 people aged 6-10 years old, 15 people aged 11-16 years old. There are 27 boys (75%) and 9 girls (25%). The survey was conducted on the 78th day of the ALL IC-BFM 2009 protocol, which corresponds to the end of the first phase of chemotherapy. In the survey did not participate children with the syndrome of multiple organ failure, as well as with the presence of background mental disorders. To assess the psycho-emotional state, a questionnaire was used: ""state of health, activity, mood"", adapted for children. For the study of asthenia was used questionnaire I. K. Schatz. Results: The findings suggest that absolutely all children receiving chemotherapy at the end of the first phase have been violations of the psycho-emotional background. The index of state of health suffers the most, and to a lesser extent - activity. Indicators of state of health had lower values in the older group - from 11 to 16 years. Thus according to the data in the group of children aged 6 to 10 years being the average was 4.02 +/- 0.09 (p <0.05), in children age 11 - 16 years - 3.83 +/- 0.11 (p <0.05). The average activity substantially the same in groups and indicates a favorable condition. Mood indicators are also within the framework of a favorable state in both groups. Also during the investigation revealed that the general for all children is a symptom asthenic. According to the data, fatigue reaction (less than 7 points) was present only in 9 children (25%). The most numerous manifestations were moderate asthenia - 21 children (58%). Severe asthenia (13 - 18 points) was observed only in 6 children (17%). Conclusions: This study will allow to develop a package of solutions for the prevention and minimization of asthenic syndrome in children with acute leukemia receiving chemotherapy.","['Adamchuk, Nataliia M', 'Sorokina, Olena Y']","['Adamchuk NM', 'Sorokina OY']",,"['Ukrainian Medical Stomatological Academy, Poltava, Ukraine', 'State Institution <<Dnipropetrovsc Medical Academy Of The Ministry Of Health Of Ukraine>>, Dnipro, Ukraine']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Wiad Lek,"Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)",9705467,,,"['Adolescent', 'Anxiety', '*Asthenia', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Quality of Life']",['NOTNLM'],"['*children', '*acute leukemia', '*psycho-emotional', '*esthenic syndrome']",2020/02/01 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00,['2020/02/01 06:00'],"['2020/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Wiad Lek. 2019 Aug 31;72(8):1460-1462.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine if there are characteristics in bone marrow biopsies in children and adults previously diagnosed with acquired AA, which could predict progression to MDS, we evaluated 118 hypocellular bone marrow biopsies from adults (76 patients) and children (42) diagnosed initially with acquired AA previously to any treatment. Histology was reviewed according to a detailed protocol including Bennett and Orazi criteria for hypocellular myelodysplastic syndrome (h-MDS) and Bauman et al. criteria for refractory cytopenia of childhood (RCC). Twelve patients (10.2%; 6 children and 6 adults) progressed to MDS after a median time of 56 months. Criteria described by Bennett and Orazi suggestive of h-MDS in bone marrow biopsies were detected in 16 cases (13.5%; 8 adults and 8 children), and none in patients that progressed to MDS/AML. Twenty adults' biopsies (26.3%) had the histological criteria used for the diagnosis of pediatric RCC, and none showed MDS/AML evolution. Ten children (23.8%) were reclassified morphologically as RCC, and only one progressed to MDS. In this population with acquired aplastic anemia (AAA), no histological/immunohistochemical (H/IHC) bone marrow findings could discriminate patients with higher risk for myeloid clonal progression, which questions the diagnosis of h-MDS/RCC based only on the finding of dysplasia in the cases without increased blasts and/or the characteristic genetic abnormalities.","['Marchesi, Raquel F', 'Velloso, Elvira D R P', 'Garanito, Marlene P', 'Leal, Aline M', 'Siqueira, Sheila A C', 'Azevedo Neto, Raymundo S', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Zerbini, Maria Claudia N']","['Marchesi RF', 'Velloso EDRP', 'Garanito MP', 'Leal AM', 'Siqueira SAC', 'Azevedo Neto RS', 'Rocha V', 'Zerbini MCN']",,"['Department of Pathology, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

METHODS: In this single-institution, phase 2 study, 122 patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML received nilotinib 400 mg twice daily. The median follow-up on study was 78.3 months (interquartile range, 58.4-96.5 months). RESULTS: Fifty-six percent of patients remained on therapy at the last follow-up. Both the complete cytogenetic response rate and the major molecular response (MR) rate were 91%. Seventy-five percent and 59% of patients achieved a >/=4.5-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcripts (MR4.5) and a sustained MR4.5 beyond 2 years, respectively. The estimated event-free survival and overall survival rates at 5 years were 89% and 93%, respectively, and the corresponding rates at 10 years were 85% and 88%, respectively. Treatment discontinuation due to toxicity occurred in 19% of patients, mostly because of cardiovascular events (10%) and biochemical abnormalities (6%). The top 3 nonhematologic toxicities were rash (55%), elevated bilirubin (57%), and elevated aminotransferases (48%). Hematologic toxicity was transient and mild. Ischemic cardiovascular adverse events occurred in 8% of patients. Four patients (3%) progressed to accelerated or blast phase while on therapy, and 7 patients (6%) died on study. CONCLUSIONS: The current data confirm the long-term efficacy of nilotinib 400 mg twice daily in patients with CP-CML.

The authors report the long-term follow-up from the first study using dasatinib as initial therapy for chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Between November 2005 and August 2014, patients were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg daily or 50 mg twice daily. After June 2009, all patients started with 100 mg daily. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 6.5 years, 94 of 149 treated patients (63%) were still receiving dasatinib on study. The median patient age was 48 years (interquartile range, 37-55 years), and 9% of patients had a high risk Sokal risk score. The cumulative complete cytogenetic response rate at 11 years was 92.6%, the major molecular response (MR) rate was 88.2%, and the MR4.5 rate (indicating a >/=4.5-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcripts) was 79.5%. The median time to a major MR and MR4.5 was 6 and 23 months, respectively. A sustained MR4.5 (>/=2 years) was achieved in 82 patients (55%). The 10-year overall survival, transformation-free survival, event-free survival, and failure-free survival rates were 89%, 95%, 86%, and 65%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the achievement of a complete MR was associated with improved overall survival. The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation were toxicity and elective discontinuation. The most common treatment-emergent grade 3 and 4 adverse events were fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and infections. CONCLUSIONS: After this long-term follow-up, dasatinib continues to show an excellent safety profile and produces rapid cytogenetic responses and MRs, durable deep MRs, and excellent long-term survival outcomes in patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Maiti, Abhishek', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Masarova, Lucia', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Nogueras-Gonzalez, Graciela M', 'Skinner, Jeffrey', 'Poku, Rebecca', 'DellaSala, Sara', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Jabbour, Elias J', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Maiti A', 'Cortes JE', 'Patel KP', 'Masarova L', 'Borthakur G', 'Ravandi F', 'Verstovsek S', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Estrov Z', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Kadia TM', 'Nogueras-Gonzalez GM', 'Skinner J', 'Poku R', 'DellaSala S', 'Luthra R', 'Jabbour EJ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian HM']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9043-538X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6624-4196', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3631-2482', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4465-6119', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1908-3307']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, Irvine, California.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200130,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', 'Time', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*chromic myeloid leukemia', '*dasatinib', '*early chronic phase', '*frontline']",2020/01/31 06:00,2020/11/06 06:00,['2020/01/31 06:00'],"['2019/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32627 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Apr 1;126(7):1502-1511. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32627.

We aimed to examine differences in cancer survival by area-level socio-economic disadvantage in Victoria, Australia and assess whether these inequalities varied by year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, time since diagnosis and sex. Cases diagnosed with a first primary cancer in 2001-2015 were identified using the Victorian Cancer Registry and followed to the end of 2016. Five-year net survival and the excess risk of death due to a cancer diagnosis were estimated. People living in more disadvantaged areas had lower five-year survival than residents of less disadvantaged regions for 21 of 29 cancer types: head and neck, oesophagus, stomach, colorectum, anus/anal canal, liver, gallbladder/biliary tract, pancreas, lung, melanoma, connective/soft tissue, female breast, ovary, prostate, kidney, bladder, brain and central nervous system, unknown primary, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma and leukemia. The observed lower survival in more deprived regions persisted over time, except head and neck cancer, for which the gap in survival has widened. Socio-economic inequalities in survival decreased with increasing age at diagnosis for cancers of connective/soft tissue, bladder and unknown primary. For colorectal cancer, the observed survival disadvantage in lower socio-economic regions was greater for men than for women, while for brain and central nervous system tumours, it was larger for women. Cancer survival is generally lower for residents of more socio-economically disadvantaged areas. Identifying the underlying reasons for these inequalities is important and may help to identify effective interventions to increase survival for underprivileged cancer patients.","['Afshar, Nina', 'English, Dallas R', 'Blakely, Tony', 'Thursfield, Vicky', 'Farrugia, Helen', 'Giles, Graham G', 'Milne, Roger L']","['Afshar N', 'English DR', 'Blakely T', 'Thursfield V', 'Farrugia H', 'Giles GG', 'Milne RL']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5587-9540'],"['Cancer Epidemiology Division, Cancer Council Victoria, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Cancer Epidemiology Division, Cancer Council Victoria, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Victorian Cancer Registry, Cancer Council Victoria, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Victorian Cancer Registry, Cancer Council Victoria, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Cancer Epidemiology Division, Cancer Council Victoria, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Precision Medicine, School of Clinical Sciences at Monash Health, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.', 'Cancer Epidemiology Division, Cancer Council Victoria, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Precision Medicine, School of Clinical Sciences at Monash Health, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200130,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/classification/*mortality', 'Registries', 'Research Design', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Victoria/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/31 06:00,2020/04/21 06:00,['2020/01/31 06:00'],"['2019/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0228551 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-31129 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Jan 30;15(1):e0228551. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0228551. eCollection 2020.,PMC6992207,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous reports and some of others demonstrate the potential capacity of ClF to regulate the epigenetic machinery. The study presented here is the first to investigate the influence of ClF on modulators of the DNA methylation machinery, including DNMT1 and CDKN1A, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. ClF effects on promoter methylation and transcriptional activity of hypermethylated and silenced tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), including APC, CDKN2A, PTEN, and RARB, have been tested as well. Methylation level of the proximal promoter region of APC, CDKN2A, PTEN, and RARB, as well as expression of those TSGs, DNMT1 and CDKN1A, were estimated by using a methylation-sensitive restriction analysis and qPCR, respectively. The Nalm-6 cell line was used as an experimental in vitro model of ALL cells. We observed ClF-mediated inhibition of cellular viability and apoptosis induction of Nalm-6 cells with an increased percentage of cells positive for active Caspase-3. Interestingly, exposure of Nalm-6 cells to CIF at 20 nM concentration for three days has led to a significant DNMT1 downregulation, accompanied by robust CDKN1A upregulation. ClF caused hypomethylation of APC, CDKN2A, and PTEN, with a concomitant increase in their transcript levels. Taken together, our results demonstrate the ability of ClF to reactivate DNA methylation-silenced TSGs in ALL cells. This may implicate translational significance of our findings and support ClF application as a new epigenetic modulator in the anti-leukemia therapy.","['Kaufman-Szymczyk, Agnieszka', 'Lubecka, Katarzyna']","['Kaufman-Szymczyk A', 'Lubecka K']",,"['Department of Biomedical Chemistry, Faculty of Health Sciences, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biomedical Chemistry, Faculty of Health Sciences, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,IM,,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clofarabine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",,,2020/01/31 06:00,2020/11/06 06:00,['2020/01/31 06:00'],"['2019/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['2901 [pii]', '10.18388/abp.2020_2901 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 2020 Jan 30;67(1):65-72. doi: 10.18388/abp.2020_2901.,,,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the health care expenditures associated with imatinib have increased steadily since its introduction in 2001. Since the generic market entry of imatinib on February 1, 2016, it became possible to determine the effect of generic entry on the health care expenditures associated with imatinib, along with the concurrent pricing trends of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Objective: To compare health care expenditure related to imatinib treatment for patients with CML prior to its generic status with expenditures after, in a real-world setting. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study using data from the Truven Health MarketScan Database was carried out including 1301 commercially insured patients or patients with Medicaid between the ages of 18 and 64 years with a CML diagnosis between September 1, 2014 and December 31, 2017. A single interrupted time series (ITS) method was used to evaluate monthly expenditures associated with imatinib for the health plan from September 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017, with imatinib switching to generic on February 1, 2016, as the interruption. The initial 6-month period postinterruption was excluded to allow for the new price structure to stabilize. Nilotinib and dasatinib were evaluated using a comparative ITS design. The analysis took place between September 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Commercial and Medicaid health plan expenditure and patient cost responsibility for 30-day blocks per patient for imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib were calculated from September 1, 2014 through December 31, 2017. Pricing was adjusted via 2017 consumer price index for medical services. Results: The sample included a total of 1301 patients (1102 commercially insured and 199 insured through Medicaid) with a median (range) age at diagnosis of 50 (18-62) years for commercially insured patients and 50 (47-52) years for patients with Medicaid. Of the 1301 patients, 704 (54.1%) were men. There was a significant pregeneric increase in expenditure (commercially insured: $143 per patient per month, P < .001; Medicaid: $152 per patient per month, P = .001). There was a significant reduction over the 6-month interruption period (February 2016 through August 2016) between the pregeneric and generic phase (commercial: $-3097 per patient, P < .001; Medicaid: $-2077 per patient, P = .002). Controlling for secular trends, this was followed by a small decline in expenditure during the generic phase (commercially insured: -$93 per patient per month; P = .03; Medicaid: -$182 per patient per month; P = .001). Nilotinib and dasatinib maintained an increasing trend in both the pregeneric and generic phase of imatinib, resulting in a significant difference-in-difference slope for commercially insured patients (nilotinib: -$186, P = .006; dasatinib: -$175, P = .007) and patients with Medicaid (nilotinib: -$299, P = .002; dasatinib: -$329, P < .001). There were no significant trends for patient cost responsibility. Conclusions and Relevance: The modest decline in expenditure associated with imatinib after generic entry accompanied by the increasing expenditure trends associated with the second-generation TKIs suggest a need for measures to facilitate cost reduction as well as standardization of CML treatment.","['Kenzik, Kelly M', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Bhatia, Smita']","['Kenzik KM', 'Bhatia R', 'Bhatia S']",,"['Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*economics/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Medicaid/economics', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/31 06:00,2020/12/29 06:00,['2020/01/31 06:00'],"['2020/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['2759195 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2019.6390 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2020 Apr 1;6(4):542-546. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2019.6390.,PMC7042837,,,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ASNS expression is highly regulated at the transcriptional level, being induced by both the Amino Acid Response (AAR) and the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathways. Lack of ASNS protein expression is a hallmark of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) blasts, which, therefore, are auxotrophic for Asn. This peculiarity is the rationale for the use of bacterial L-Asparaginase (ASNase) for ALL therapy, the first example of anti-cancer treatment targeting a tumor-specific metabolic feature. Other hematological and solid cancers express low levels of ASNS and, therefore, should also be Asn auxotrophs and ASNase sensitive. Conversely, in the last few years, several reports indicate that in some cancer types ASNS is overexpressed, promoting cell proliferation, chemoresistance, and a metastatic behavior. However, enhanced ASNS activity may constitute a metabolic vulnerability in selected cancer models, suggesting a variable and tumor-specific role of the enzyme in cancer. Recent evidence indicates that, beyond its canonical role in protein synthesis, Asn may have additional regulatory functions. These observations prompt a re-appreciation of ASNS activity in the biology of normal and cancer tissues, with particular attention to the fueling of Asn exchange between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment.","['Chiu, Martina', 'Taurino, Giuseppe', 'Bianchi, Massimiliano G', 'Kilberg, Michael S', 'Bussolati, Ovidio']","['Chiu M', 'Taurino G', 'Bianchi MG', 'Kilberg MS', 'Bussolati O']",,"['Laboratory of General Pathology, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Laboratory of General Pathology, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Laboratory of General Pathology, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL, United States.', 'Laboratory of General Pathology, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200109,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'asparagine', 'asparagine synthetase', 'cancer', 'glutamine']",2020/01/31 06:00,2020/01/31 06:01,['2020/01/31 06:00'],"['2019/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01480 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jan 9;9:1480. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01480. eCollection 2019.,PMC6962308,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Chiu, Taurino, Bianchi, Kilberg and Bussolati.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their occurrence correlates with a more aggressive disease with unmutated VHIG status and unfavorable cytogenetics (17p and 11q deletions). CLL lymphocytes are thought to be responsible of a number of pathogenic mechanisms, including aberrant antigen presentation and cytokine production. Moreover, pathogenic B-cell lymphocytes may induce T-cell subsets imbalance that favors the emergence of autoreactive B-cells producing anti-red blood cells and anti-platelets autoantibodies. In the last 15 years, molecular insights into the pathogenesis of both primary and secondary AIHA/ITP has shown that autoreactive B-cells often display stereotyped B-cell receptor and that the autoantibodies themselves have restricted phenotypes. Moreover, a skewed T-cell repertoire and clonal T cells (mainly CD8+) may be present. In addition, an imbalance of T regulatory-/T helper 17-cells ratio has been involved in AIHA and ITP development, and correlates with various cytokine genes polymorphisms. Finally, altered miRNA and lnRNA profiles have been found in autoimmune cytopenias and seem to correlate with disease phase. Genomic studies are limited in these forms, except for recurrent mutations of KMT2D and CARD11 in cold agglutinin disease, which is considered a clonal B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder resulting in AIHA. In this manuscript, we review the most recent literature on AIHA and ITP secondary to CLL, focusing on available molecular evidences of pathogenic, clinical, and prognostic relevance.","['Fattizzo, Bruno', 'Barcellini, Wilma']","['Fattizzo B', 'Barcellini W']",,"[""Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."", ""Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200110,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"[""Evans' syndrome"", 'autoimmune hemolytic anemia', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'immune thrombocytopenia', 'molecular']",2020/01/31 06:00,2020/01/31 06:01,['2020/01/31 06:00'],"['2019/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01435 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jan 10;9:1435. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01435. eCollection 2019.,PMC6967408,,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Fattizzo and Barcellini.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Case Description: Here, we report an 8-month-old male domestic cat with altered consciousness, symmetric ataxia, hypermetric gait, vertical positional nystagmus, mydriasis, strabismus, intention tremor of the head, and increased patellar reflexes. Neuroanatomical diagnosis suggested a multifocal brain dysfunction (cerebellar and cerebral). The cat tested seropositive for feline leukemia virus. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis indicated mononuclear and neutrophilic pleocytosis. Contrast computed tomography imaging revealed multiple hypodense heterogeneous areas in both cerebral hemispheres, mild ventriculomegaly at the level of the caudal fossa, and a circular sharply marginated, homogeneously hyperdense mass occupying the right cerebellar hemisphere. Postmortem study indicated a 1.1 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere close to the vermis. Histopathological analysis showed diffuse and severe Purkinje cell loss with a decrease in granular cell density and moderate gliosis compatible with CCD. Further, numerous neoplastic lymphoid cells were observed in the infiltrated mass, consistent with a diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry showed CD20 expression, indicative of a B-cell immunophenotype. In humans, CCD is reported as a rare paraneoplastic syndrome in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. CNS lymphoma and/or Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) infection were both considered as a possible cause of CCD in this case. Conclusion: This is the first described case of possible paraneoplastic cerebellar cortical degeneration associated with CNS lymphoma and/or FeLV infection in a domestic cat.","['Pardo, Alejandra Parra', 'Gomez, Marcelo A', 'Gonzalez, Carlos M']","['Pardo AP', 'Gomez MA', 'Gonzalez CM']",,"['Facultad de Ciencias Veterinarias, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile.', 'Facultad de Ciencias Veterinarias, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile.', 'Escuela de Medicina Veterinaria, Facultad de Ciencias de la Vida, Universidad Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20190829,Libya,Open Vet J,Open veterinary journal,101653182,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/pathology/*virology', 'Cats', 'Cerebellum/pathology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*physiology', 'Male', 'Paraneoplastic Cerebellar Degeneration/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Retroviridae Infections/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/pathology/*veterinary/virology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cat', '*Cerebellar degeneration', '*Feline leukemia virus', '*Lymphoma', '*Paraneoplastic syndrome']",2020/01/31 06:00,2020/05/26 06:00,['2020/01/31 06:00'],"['2019/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4314/ovj.v9i3.9 [doi]', 'OVJ-9-246 [pii]']",ppublish,Open Vet J. 2019 Oct;9(3):246-252. doi: 10.4314/ovj.v9i3.9.

LUNAR1(leukemia-induced noncoding activator RNA-1) is a specific LncRNA regulated by Notch signaling that not only can enhance the expression of IGFR-1 but also can promote angiogenesis and cell survival. Here, we investigated the relationship between LncRNA-LUNAR1 levels in peripheral plasma and the formation of coronary collaterals. In total, 172 patients with CTO were enrolled and followed up for 12 months. Coronary collaterals were scored according to the Rentrop scoring system. Preclinical tests of tube formation were used to address the mechanisms behind the association between LncRNA-LUNAR1 and development of collaterals. Clinical data and inflammatory factors, including comorbidity, CD14(++)CD16(-) monocytes, and CCL2 (chemokine motif ligand 2), were compared and analyzed. Real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of LncRNA-LUNAR1 in peripheral blood plasma. The Rentrop score was positively correlated with LncRNA-LUNAR1 levels in patients with CTO (R = 0.47, p < 0.001). Tube formation assay proved the direct association between LncRNA-LUNAR1 and development of collaterals (p = 0.011). The univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with low LncRNA-LUNAR1 expression exhibited worse clinical outcomes than those with high LncRNA-LUNAR1 levels (p = 0.008). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and correlation analysis further confirmed that LncRNA-LUNAR1 expression was closely related to chronic inflammatory diseases, especially diabetes (area = 0.644, p = 0.001; 95% CI, 0.562-0.726). Furthermore, both CD14(++)CD16(-) monocytes (r = - 0.37; p < 0.001) and CCL2 levels (r = - 0.35; p < 0.001) negatively affected the expression of LncRNA-LUNAR1. LncRNA-LUNAR1 expression was positively correlated with coronary collaterals in patients with CTO.

Here, we review the use of monoclonal antibody-based drugs and cellular therapies to treat ALL. We discuss the challenges facing the field regarding the optimal timing and sequencing of these therapies in relation to other treatment options as well as considerations of cost effectiveness. RECENT FINDINGS: By early identification of patients at risk for leukemic relapse, monoclonal antibody and cellular immunotherapies can be brought to the forefront of treatment options. Novel CAR design and manufacturing approaches may enhance durable patient response. Multiple clinical trials are now underway to evaluate the sequence and timing of monoclonal antibody, cellular therapy, and/or stem cell transplantation. The biologic and clinical contexts in which immunotherapies have advanced the treatment of ALL confer optimism that more patients will achieve durable remissions. Immunotherapy treatments in ALL will expand through rationally targeted approaches alongside advances in CAR T cell therapy design and clinical experience.","['Barsan, Valentin', 'Ramakrishna, Sneha', 'Davis, Kara L']","['Barsan V', 'Ramakrishna S', 'Davis KL']",,"['Bass Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders, Center for Cancer Cell Therapy, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, 265 Campus Drive, G2065, Stanford, CA, 94305-5435, USA. vbarsan@stanford.edu.', 'Bass Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders, Center for Cancer Cell Therapy, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, 265 Campus Drive, G2065, Stanford, CA, 94305-5435, USA. ramakrs@stanford.edu.', 'Bass Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders, Center for Cancer Cell Therapy, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, 265 Campus Drive, G2065, Stanford, CA, 94305-5435, USA. kardavis@stanford.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200129,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/adverse effects/economics/*methods', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Bispecific targeting', '*Blinatumomab', '*CAR T cell', '*Cancer immunotherapy', '*Cellular therapy', '*Checkpoint blockade', '*Inotuzumab ozogamicin', '*Minimal residual disease', '*Targeted therapy']",2020/01/31 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/01/31 06:00'],"['2020/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11912-020-0875-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11912-020-0875-2 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2020 Jan 29;22(2):11. doi: 10.1007/s11912-020-0875-2.,,,['U54 CA232568/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assigned intensity weight scores for frequently used conditioning regimen components and used their sum to generate the transplant conditioning intensity (TCI) score. We retrospectively tested the impact of TCI on 8255 adult (45-65 years) acute myeloid leukemia patients who underwent HCT in first complete remission. A Cox model for early nonrelapse mortality (NRM) yielded a 3-group TCI risk scheme (low, intermediate, high) with respective TCI scores of [1-2], [2.5-3.5] and [4-6]. On multivariate modeling, TCI grouping was highly and better predictive for early (day 100 and 180) NRM, 2-year NRM and relapse (REL) as compared with the RIC/MAC classification. Validation was done on 200 bootstrap samples. Moreover, TCI scoring enabled the identification of a distinct subgroup of RIC and MAC conditioning regimens with an intermediate TCI [2.5-3.5] score that had identical outcomes and which are frequently referred as ""reduced toxicity conditioning"". TCI scheme provides an improvement of the RIC/MAC classification. We propose TCI as a new tool to define and measure the conditioning regimen intensity.","['Spyridonidis, Alexandros', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Niittyvuopio, Riitta', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Huynh, Anne', 'Griskevicius, Laimonas', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Brissot, Eolia', 'Malard, Florent', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Peric, Zinaida', 'Baron, Frederic', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Gilleece, Maria', 'Gorin, Norbert-Claude', 'Lanza, Francesco', 'Shouval, Roni', 'Versluis, Jurjen', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Floisand, Yngvar', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Sanz, Jamie', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Spyridonidis A', 'Labopin M', 'Savani BN', 'Niittyvuopio R', 'Blaise D', 'Craddock C', 'Socie G', 'Platzbecker U', 'Beelen D', 'Milpied N', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Ganser A', 'Huynh A', 'Griskevicius L', 'Giebel S', 'Aljurf M', 'Brissot E', 'Malard F', 'Esteve J', 'Peric Z', 'Baron F', 'Ruggeri A', 'Schmid C', 'Gilleece M', 'Gorin NC', 'Lanza F', 'Shouval R', 'Versluis J', 'Bug G', 'Floisand Y', 'Ciceri F', 'Sanz J', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3097-2532', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3304-9965', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5684-9447', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2114-7533', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3474-0002', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0364-3573', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6934-4619']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University Hospital of Patras, Patras, Greece. spyridonidis@upatras.gr.', ""Service d' Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Hospital Saint-Antoine, Sorbonne Universite, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), Paris, France."", 'Long term Transplant Clinic, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'HUCH Comprehensive Cancer Center, Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Hematology-BMT, Hospital St. Louis, Paris, France.', 'Hematology and Cellular Therapy, University Hospital, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'CHU Bordeaux, Hospital Haut-Leveque, Pessac, France.', 'Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'CHU -

To define the underlining regulatory dynamics, we analyze high-resolution time courses of ibrutinib treatment in patients with CLL, combining immune-phenotyping, single-cell transcriptome profiling, and chromatin mapping. We identify a consistent regulatory program starting with a sharp decrease of NF-kappaB binding in CLL cells, which is followed by reduced activity of lineage-defining transcription factors, erosion of CLL cell identity, and acquisition of a quiescence-like gene signature. We observe patient-to-patient variation in the speed of execution of this program, which we exploit to predict patient-specific dynamics in the response to ibrutinib based on the pre-treatment patient samples. In aggregate, our study describes time-dependent cellular, molecular, and regulatory effects for therapeutic inhibition of B cell receptor signaling in CLL, and it establishes a broadly applicable method for epigenome/transcriptome-based treatment monitoring.","['Rendeiro, Andre F', 'Krausgruber, Thomas', 'Fortelny, Nikolaus', 'Zhao, Fangwen', 'Penz, Thomas', 'Farlik, Matthias', 'Schuster, Linda C', 'Nemc, Amelie', 'Tasnady, Szabolcs', 'Reti, Marienn', 'Matrai, Zoltan', 'Alpar, Donat', 'Bodor, Csaba', 'Schmidl, Christian', 'Bock, Christoph']","['Rendeiro AF', 'Krausgruber T', 'Fortelny N', 'Zhao F', 'Penz T', 'Farlik M', 'Schuster LC', 'Nemc A', 'Tasnady S', 'Reti M', 'Matrai Z', 'Alpar D', 'Bodor C', 'Schmidl C', 'Bock C']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9362-5373', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1374-0329', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0729-692X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6091-3088']","['CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Central Hospital of Southern Pest, National Institute of Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Central Hospital of Southern Pest, National Institute of Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Central Hospital of Southern Pest, National Institute of Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Budapest, Hungary.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'MTA-SE Lendulet Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE Lendulet Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Regensburg Center for Interventional Immunology (RCI), Regensburg, Germany.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria. cbock@cemm.oeaw.ac.at.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases, Vienna, Austria. cbock@cemm.oeaw.ac.at.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. cbock@cemm.oeaw.ac.at.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200129,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,IM,,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*drug effects', 'Chromatin/*genetics', 'Epigenome', 'Epigenomics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Heterogeneity/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Machine Learning', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/drug effects', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptome']",,,2020/01/31 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,['2020/01/31 06:00'],"['2019/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-019-14081-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-019-14081-6 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2020 Jan 29;11(1):577. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-14081-6.,PMC6989523,,"['M 2403/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', '679146/EC | EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation H2020 | H2020', 'Priority Excellent Science | H2020 European Research Council (H2020 Excellent', 'Science - European Research Council)']","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most frequent DNMT3A mutation in AML patients (R882H) encodes a dominant-negative protein that reduces methyltransferase activity by approximately 80% in cells with heterozygous mutations, causing a focal, canonical DNA hypomethylation phenotype; this phenotype is partially recapitulated in murine Dnmt3a (-/-) bone marrow cells. To determine whether the hypomethylation phenotype of Dnmt3a (-/-) hematopoietic cells is reversible, we developed an inducible transgene to restore expression of DNMT3A in transplanted bone marrow cells from Dnmt3a (-/-) mice. Partial remethylation was detected within 1 wk, but near-complete remethylation required 6 mo. Remethylation was accurate, dynamic, and highly ordered, suggesting that differentially methylated regions have unique properties that may be relevant for their functions. Importantly, 22 wk of DNMT3A addback partially corrected dysregulated gene expression, and mitigated the expansion of myeloid cells. These data show that restoring DNMT3A expression can alter the epigenetic ""state"" created by loss of Dnmt3a activity; this genetic proof-of-concept experiment suggests that this approach could be relevant for patients with ARCH or AML caused by loss-of-function DNMT3A mutations.","['Ketkar, Shamika', 'Verdoni, Angela M', 'Smith, Amanda M', 'Bangert, Celia V', 'Leight, Elizabeth R', 'Chen, David Y', 'Brune, Meryl K', 'Helton, Nichole M', 'Hoock, Mieke', 'George, Daniel R', 'Fronick, Catrina', 'Fulton, Robert S', 'Ramakrishnan, Sai Mukund', 'Chang, Gue Su', 'Petti, Allegra A', 'Spencer, David H', 'Miller, Christopher A', 'Ley, Timothy J']","['Ketkar S', 'Verdoni AM', 'Smith AM', 'Bangert CV', 'Leight ER', 'Chen DY', 'Brune MK', 'Helton NM', 'Hoock M', 'George DR', 'Fronick C', 'Fulton RS', 'Ramakrishnan SM', 'Chang GS', 'Petti AA', 'Spencer DH', 'Miller CA', 'Ley TJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9913-0520'],"['Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Dermatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110; timley@wustl.edu.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200129,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA methylation', '*DNA methyltransferase', '*gene expression', '*hematopoiesis']",2020/01/31 06:00,2020/05/12 06:00,['2020/01/31 06:00'],"['2020/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['1918611117 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1918611117 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020 Feb 11;117(6):3123-3134. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1918611117.

Successful treatment is limited by resistance to chemotherapies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel effective strategies. Artesunate (ART), a widely used antimalarial compound, has been shown to exert cytotoxicity. Here, we aimed to assess the anti-ATLL activities of ART and to elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms involved in this effect. Compared with uninfected T cells, HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines were sensitive to ART-induced cytotoxicity. ART caused cell cycle arrest at G1 and/or G2/M phases, which was associated with decreased expression of cyclin dependent kinase 1/2/4/6, cyclin B1/D2/E and c-Myc, and increased expression of p21. ART-induced apoptosis corresponded to activation of caspase-8/9/3; decreased expression of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, myeloid cell leukemia-1, survivin, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1/2; and increased expression of Bak. ART increased intracellular reactive oxygen species and activation of the DNA damage marker gamma-H2AX. Moreover, ART-induced cytotoxicity was partly reversed by treatment with a reactive oxygen species scavenger, iron chelator, and necroptosis or ferroptosis inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of caspase-dependent and -independent lethal pathways. These effects were correlated with inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein-1 signaling through dephosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, IkappaB kinase (IKK) alpha and IKKbeta, and decreased expression of JunB and JunD. Importantly, intraperitoneal injection with ART lowered tumor burden in an ATLL murine model. These preclinical results provide a rationale for evaluating the efficacy of ART in patients with ATLL.","['Ishikawa, Chie', 'Senba, Masachika', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Ishikawa C', 'Senba M', 'Mori N']",,"['Department of Microbiology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan; Division of Health Sciences, Transdisciplinary Research Organization for Subtropics and Island Studies, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, 903-0213, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, 852-8523, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan.

As a matter of fact, ibrutinib, the first-in-class Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, became a milestone in the treatment of both naive or relapsed/refractory CLL patients. Most patients treated with such an agent achieve durable clinical response; however, a deeper response is rarely reached and continuous treatment is required. Since ibrutinib-resistant CLL clones can develop in about 20% of patients and toxicities, leading to drug discontinuation, occur in about 30% of patients treated with ibrutinib, several new BTK inhibitors have been developed in order to lower off-target effects and overcome ibrutinib resistance.Areas covered: In this review, we summarize the main English publications exploring efficacy and side effects of first and next-generation BTK inhibitors. Results of clinical trials evaluating these novel agents are presented and critically discussed.Expert opinion: Efforts in the development of highly specific second-generation BTK inhibitors and combination strategies provide challenging options to overcome limitations of therapy with ibrutinib. It is also crucial to identify additional risk factors and to understand disease biology underlying clonal evolution of CLL in the context of novel agents.","['Molica, Stefano', 'Gianfelici, Valentina', 'Levato, Luciano']","['Molica S', 'Gianfelici V', 'Levato L']",,"['Department Haematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department Haematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department Haematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200206,England,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs,Expert opinion on emerging drugs,101135662,IM,,"['Adenine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Piperidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*combination strategies', '*continuous treatment', '*minimal residual disease', '*resistance', '*side effects']",2020/01/31 06:00,2021/02/03 06:00,['2020/01/31 06:00'],"['2020/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14728214.2020.1724282 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs. 2020 Mar;25(1):25-35. doi: 10.1080/14728214.2020.1724282.

Despite durable responses to front-line therapy and sustained remission rates in patients with CLL, a majority of patients eventually relapse in 5 years of initial treatment. The depth of the response may affect the length of response. Maintenance therapies were aimed to deep remissions and extend the period of disease quiescence. Lenalidomide, rituximab and ofatumumab had demonstrated some efficacy as a maintenance therapy compared to no intervention for CLL patients. The relative effect on disease control and safety between different maintenance therapies were unclear. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis to evaluate relative effect on disease control and safety of current available maintenance therapies. We searched PubMed, Embase and Cochrane database up to March 6, 2019. Relevant reference of review article and conference abstract including European Hematology Association Annual Meeting (EHA 2018), American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting (ASH 2018) and American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting (ASCO 2018) were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) involving current available maintenance therapy including ""Lenalidomide"", ""Rituximab"", ""Ofatumumab"", ""Ibrutinib"", ""Idelalisib"", ""Venetoclax""and ""Obinutuzumab""were eligible. Outcomes of interest included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and serious adverse events (SAE) in CLL patients received subsequent maintenance therapy. Two authors CHL and CL) independently assessed eligibility for all identified citations and extracted data from the original trial reports. The selected studies' risk of bias was assessed following the guidelines of Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. RESULTS: In total, six phase III RCTs with total 1,615 CLL patients were identified. Maintenance therapy using lenalidomide, rituximab, and ofatumumab demonstrated a statistically significant effect in prolongation of progression-free survival (HR:0.37, 95% CI: 0.27-0.50 of lenalidomide; HR:0.50, 95% CI: 0.38-0.66 of rituximab; HR:0.52, 95% CI:0.41-0.66 of ofatumumab, separately) compared with no intervention; however, for overall survival, the effect of maintenance therapy showed no significant difference versus no intervention (HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.70-1.14). Lenalidomide showed the best efficacy for PFS (HR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.27-0.50, Probability of being best treatment: 96%). CONCLUSIONS: Our network meta-analysis provided an integrated overview of relative efficacy and safety of different maintenance therapies in CLL.

Almost all patients achieve a complete molecular remission (CMR) by nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, which can be maintained with low-dose imatinib (eg, 3 x 100 mg/wk). Because imatinib can be safely stopped in a substantial proportion of patients with BCR-ABL1-positive CML, we sought to analyze the clinical and molecular follow-up of 12 FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive patients with MLN-eo in chronic phase who discontinued imatinib after achievement of a CMR. Median time of treatment and median time of CMR before imatinib discontinuation (last dose at 3 x 100 mg/wk, n = 8; or 100 mg/d, n = 4) were 80 (range, 43-175) and 66 (range, 37-174) months, respectively. A molecular relapse was observed in 4 patients after 10, 22 (n = 2), and 24 months. A second CMR was achieved in 3 patients after 3, 4, and 21 months. Eight patients (62%) are in ongoing CMR (median, 17 months; range, 3-71 months). Molecular relapse-free survival was 91% at 12 months and 65% at 24 months. No significant differences (eg, dose and duration of imatinib treatment or duration of CMR before imatinib discontinuation) were identified between patients with and without molecular relapse. Our data demonstrate that imatinib can be safely stopped in FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive MLN-eo because of a high treatment-free remission at 12 and 24 months and because most patients achieve a rapid second CMR after restart of imatinib.","['Metzgeroth, Georgia', 'Schwaab, Juliana', 'Naumann, Nicole', 'Jawhar, Mohamad', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Fabarius, Alice', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Reiter, Andreas']","['Metzgeroth G', 'Schwaab J', 'Naumann N', 'Jawhar M', 'Haferlach T', 'Fabarius A', 'Hochhaus A', 'Hofmann WK', 'Cross NCP', 'Reiter A']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury, United Kingdom; and.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,"['Eosinophilia/*etiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*blood/mortality', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,,2020/01/30 06:00,2020/08/26 06:00,['2020/01/30 06:00'],"['2019/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31487-7 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001111 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Feb 11;4(3):440-443. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001111.,PMC7013256,,,['8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)'],['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A multicenter CCCG-ALL-2015 study was conducted in China and factors associated with septicemia and mortality were studied. METHODS: Patients participated in CCCG-ALL-2015 study from January 2015 to December 2017 were included. Patients with documented septicemia were identified from the Data Center and additional data were collected. RESULTS: A total of 4080 patients were recruited in the study and 527 patients with septicemia were identified (12.9%, 95% CI 11.9%-13.9%). The intermediate risk (IR)/high risk (HR) group had significantly higher incidence of septicemia as compared with low risk (LR) group, 17.1% vs 9.1% (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.71-2.49, P < .001). Induction phase was the period with majority of septicemia episodes happened, 66.8% in LR and 56.1% in IR/HR groups. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 54.1%, gram-negative bacteria 44.5%, and fungus 1.4% of positive cultures. Multidrug-resistant organisms were detected in 20.5% of all organisms. The mortality rate after septicemia was 3.4% (95% CI 1.9%-4.9%). Multiple logistic regression identified female gender, comorbid complications, and fungal infection as risk factors associated with mortality. Gram-negative septicemia was associated with higher mortality, 4.9% vs 1.4% (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09-0.88, P = .02). There was marked variation in the incidence of septicemia among the 18 centers, from 4.8% to 29.1%. CONCLUSION: Overall the incidence and pattern of septicemia in this multicenter study in China was similar to the reports of western countries. The septicemia-related mortality rate was low. There was marked variation in the incidence of septicemia among the centers.","['Zhu, Yiping', 'Yang, Rong', 'Cai, Jiaoyang', 'Yu, Jie', 'Tang, Yanjing', 'Chen, Yumei', 'Wang, Ningling', 'He, Hailong', 'Wu, Xuedong', 'Cheng, Frankie W T', 'Sun, Lirong', 'He, Yingyi', 'Ju, Xiuli', 'Tian, Xin', 'Hu, Qun', 'Jin, Runming', 'Pan, Kaili', 'Fang, Yongjun', 'Zhai, Xiaowen', 'Jiang, Hui', 'Li, Chi-Kong']","['Zhu Y', 'Yang R', 'Cai J', 'Yu J', 'Tang Y', 'Chen Y', 'Wang N', 'He H', 'Wu X', 'Cheng FWT', 'Sun L', 'He Y', 'Ju X', 'Tian X', 'Hu Q', 'Jin R', 'Pan K', 'Fang Y', 'Zhai X', 'Jiang H', 'Li CK']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1724-5146', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2810-5758']","['Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, West China Second Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, West China Second Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University of School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University of School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology and Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Anhui Medical University Second Affiliated Hospital, Hefei, China.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Paediatrics, Hong Kong Children's Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children Health Care Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kunming Children's Hospital, Kunming, China."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Xi'an Northwest Women and Children Hospital, Xian, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Nanjing Children's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Hematology Oncology, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology Oncology, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Hong Kong Children's Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200128,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Bacteremia/blood/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Female', 'Fungemia/blood/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Infant', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*children', '*mortality', '*multicenter study', '*septicemia']",2020/01/30 06:00,2021/04/24 06:00,['2020/01/30 06:00'],"['2019/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2889 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2020 Mar;9(6):2113-2121. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2889.

The Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox analysis were used to study the risk factors of thrombosis in patients with JAK2(V617F) -mutated MPN. Among the 1537 MPN patients, 931, 468, and 138 had polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), respectively. The median follow-up time was 7 years (range 1-47), and 12.8% of patients (197/1537) died during this period. A total of 16.8% (259/1399) of PV and ET patients had secondary myelofibrosis, and 2.5% (38/1537) of patients developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Thrombotic events occurred in 43.9% (675/1537) of patients, among which 91.4% (617/675) were arterial thrombosis and 16.6% (112/675) were venous thrombosis. The number of thrombotic events in PV, ET, and PMF patients was 439 (47.2%), 197 (42.1%) and 39 (28.2%), respectively. The multivariate analysis indicated that age >/=60 years old, HCT >/=48%, at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a history of thrombosis, and JAK2(V617F) allele burden (V617F%) >/=50% are risk factors for thrombosis in JAK2(V617F) -mutated MPN. According to the results of the multivariate analysis, a risk model of thrombosis was established and comprised low-risk (0 points), intermediate-risk (1 points) and high-risk (>/=2 points) groups, among which the incidence of thrombosis was 9.1%, 33.7% and 72.9%. For elderly patients with JAK2(V617F) -mutated MPN and a history of thrombosis, reducing the V617F%, controlling HCT and preventing cardiovascular risk factors are necessary measures to prevent thrombosis.","['Zhang, Yuhui', 'Zhou, Yuan', 'Wang, Yingshao', 'Teng, Guangshuai', 'Li, Dapeng', 'Wang, Yan', 'Du, Chenxiao', 'Chen, Yafang', 'Zhang, Huiqin', 'Li, Yanqi', 'Fu, Lixia', 'Chen, Kangyin', 'Bai, Jie']","['Zhang Y', 'Zhou Y', 'Wang Y', 'Teng G', 'Li D', 'Wang Y', 'Du C', 'Chen Y', 'Zhang H', 'Li Y', 'Fu L', 'Chen K', 'Bai J']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7493-8347'],"['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Ionic-Molecular Function of Cardiovascular Disease, Department of Cardiology, Tianjin Institute of Cardiology, Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200128,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'China/epidemiology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polycythemia Vera/*complications/genetics/mortality', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*complications/genetics/mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*complications/genetics/mortality', 'Thrombosis/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['* JAK2V617F', '*myeloproliferative neoplasms', '*thrombosis']",2020/01/30 06:00,2021/04/24 06:00,['2020/01/30 06:00'],"['2019/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2886 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2020 Mar;9(6):2096-2105. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2886.

The association between VIPN and genetic polymorphisms is largely unknown in adult lymphoma patients. To examine the possible relationship between known genetic polymorphisms in patients with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and incidence of VIPN in adult patients with B cell lymphoma, we examined CEP72 rs924607, ETAA1 rs17032980, MTNR1B rs12786200, CYP3A5 rs776746, rs7963521, and rs1045644 genetic polymorphisms in samples from 56 adult patients with B-cell lymphoma who received rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, VCR, and prednisone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy. Mutation analysis was performed by direct sequencing. The median age was 65 years (range 30-79). The median cumulative dose of VCR was 12 mg (range 2-16). VIPN was documented in 42 patients (75%), and 9 (16%) had grade 2-4 VIPN. Age, impaired glucose tolerance, number of cycles of R-CHOP, and VCR cumulative dose were not associated with incidence of VIPN. There was no association between the incidence of grade 2-4 or any grade VIPN and these six genetic polymorphisms.

Yet, the emergence of cardiometabolic comorbidities in this population may impact long-term outcomes including the quality of life and lifespan. Obesity is a major driver of cardiometabolic disorders in the general population, and in ALL patients it is associated with increased risk of hypertension, dysglycemia, and febrile neutropenia when compared with lean ALL patients undergoing therapy. This systematic review aims to assess the current evidence for bariatric interventions to manage obesity in children with ALL. The primary outcome for this systematic review was the change in BMI z-score with implementation of the interventions studied. Literature searches were conducted in several databases. Ten publications addressing the study question were included in this review, and five studies were used in the meta-analysis to assess the impact of the bariatric interventions on obesity. The BMI z-score did not change significantly with the interventions. However, the quality of evidence was low, which precluded the recommendation of their use. In conclusion, prospective, rigorous, adequately powered, and high-quality longitudinal studies are urgently needed to deliver effective lifestyle interventions to children with ALL to treat and prevent obesity. These interventions, if successful, may improves cardiometabolic health outcomes and enhance the quality of life and life expectancy in children with ALL.","['Wang, Kuan-Wen', 'Ladhani, Salma', 'Empringham, Brianna', 'Portwine, Carol', 'Fleming, Adam', 'Banfield, Laura', 'Balakumaran, Janatani', 'Sarpong, Lisa', 'Sims, E Danielle', 'Popa, Alexander Nicholas', 'Thabane, Lehana', 'Samaan, M Constantine']","['Wang KW', 'Ladhani S', 'Empringham B', 'Portwine C', 'Fleming A', 'Banfield L', 'Balakumaran J', 'Sarpong L', 'Sims ED', 'Popa AN', 'Thabane L', 'Samaan MC']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, HSC-3A57, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 4K1, Canada.', ""Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, HSC-3A57, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 4K1, Canada.', ""Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, HSC-3A57, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 4K1, Canada.', ""Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, HSC-3A57, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 4K1, Canada.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, HSC-3A57, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 4K1, Canada.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", 'Health Sciences Library, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, HSC-3A57, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 4K1, Canada.', ""Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", 'Michael G.

Thus, multidisciplinary preventive, curative, and supportive strategies must be incorporated in childhood cancer care that require understanding the distribution and trend of cancer in the target population. In this article, we aimed to report the national and subnational trends of childhood cancer incidence in Iran from 1990 to 2016, and mortality/incidence ratio (MIR), which, to our knowledge, have not been reported in previous literature. Method: Data on the incidence and mortality rates were collected from the National and Subnational Burden of Diseases project. We employed a two-stage spatiotemporal model to estimate cancer incidences by sex, age, province, and year based on the primary dataset of national death registration system. National and subnational age and gender-specific trends as well as MIR were calculated. Result: The age-standardized incidence rate had a steady increasing trend for cancers in both female [annual percent change (APC), 1.6%] and male (APC, 2.1%) patients. Not only there was an increasing trend in most provinces but also there was a 40% divergence in age-standardized incidence rate at subnational levels. Leukemia, lymphoma, neoplasms of the central nervous system (CNS), digestive tract, endocrine gland, and urinary tract were the leading causes of cancer comprising more than half of all cancers. There was a remarkable general decrease in MIR by 75% as a proxy of care quality. Conclusion: Regarding the increased trend of childhood cancer incidence, there is an essential need to address the etiologic factors and establish preventive plans for childhood cancers. Despite the favorable outcomes observed in cancer care, commensurate health resource allocation must be applied to diminish the subnational disparities.","['Shabani, Mahsima', 'Saeedi Moghaddam, Sahar', 'Ataeinia, Bahar', 'Rezaei, Nazila', 'Mohebi, Farnam', 'Mohajer, Bahram', 'Gohari, Kimiya', 'Sheidaei, Ali', 'Pishgar, Farhad', 'Yoosefi, Moein', 'Kompani, Farzad', 'Farzadfar, Farshad']","['Shabani M', 'Saeedi Moghaddam S', 'Ataeinia B', 'Rezaei N', 'Mohebi F', 'Mohajer B', 'Gohari K', 'Sheidaei A', 'Pishgar F', 'Yoosefi M', 'Kompani F', 'Farzadfar F']",,"['Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'International Hematology/Oncology of Pediatrics Experts, Universal Scientific Education and Research Network, Tehran, Iran.', 'Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Pediatrics Center of Excellence, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."", 'Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinical Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200114,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Iran', 'child', 'incidence', 'mortality', 'neoplasms']",2020/01/30 06:00,2020/01/30 06:01,['2020/01/30 06:00'],"['2019/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01428 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jan 14;9:1428. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01428. eCollection 2019.,PMC6970968,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Shabani, Saeedi Moghaddam, Ataeinia, Rezaei, Mohebi, Mohajer,', 'Gohari, Sheidaei, Pishgar, Yoosefi, Kompani and Farzadfar.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cryptococcus in the oral cavity is rare and skeletal infection is uncommon. We report the case of a 31-year-old man in whom cellulitis developed due to infection after tooth extraction complicated by acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Cellulitis of the left mandible did not improve after conservative therapy, including antimicrobial therapy, because of AML and chemotherapy, and gas was generated in the left cervical and supraclavicular regions. We considered the infection symptoms to be life-threatening, and surgery was performed for the infection of the head and neck under poor general conditions.

One such factor is B-cell activating factor (BAFF), a cytokine that is produced mainly by nurse-like cells (NLC) and enhances CLL cells survival and modulates response to therapy. In CLL cells, BAFF activates NF-kappaB signaling, but how NF-kappaB supports CLL survival is not entirely clear. In this study we show that BAFF induces accumulation of the signaling and autophagy adaptor p62/SQSTM1 in a manner dependent on NF-kappaB activation. p62 potentiates mTORC1 signaling and activates NRF2, the master regulator of the anti-oxidant response. We found that expression of NRF2 target genes, such as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), is particularly enriched in CLL cells with high ROR1 surface expression (ROR1(Hi)). ROR1(Hi) CLL cells with elevated NQO1 expression exhibit resistance to drugs that induce ROS accumulation, such venetoclax. However, such cells are more sensitive to compound 29h, a pro-drug that only becomes active after being metabolized by NQO1. Accordingly, 29h sensitizes high NQO1 CLL cells to venetoclax. Collectively, our study unravels a previously unknown signaling network through which the NF-kappaB-p62-NRF2 axis protects ROR1-high CLL cells from ROS-inducing therapeutics.","['Sanchez-Lopez, Elsa', 'Ghia, Emanuela M', 'Antonucci, Laura', 'Sharma, Natasha', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Xu, Jinyi', 'Sun, Beicheng', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Karin, Michael']","['Sanchez-Lopez E', 'Ghia EM', 'Antonucci L', 'Sharma N', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Xu J', 'Sun B', 'Kipps TJ', 'Karin M']",,"['Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Signal Transduction, Departments of Pharmacology and Pathology, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Signal Transduction, Departments of Pharmacology and Pathology, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Signal Transduction, Departments of Pharmacology and Pathology, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Department of Medicinal Chemistry, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008, China.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Signal Transduction, Departments of Pharmacology and Pathology, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA. karinoffice@ucsd.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200128,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/metabolism', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytoprotection/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Prodrugs/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors/*metabolism', 'Sequestosome-1 Protein/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",,,2020/01/30 06:00,2021/09/23 06:00,['2020/01/30 06:00'],"['2019/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41418-020-0496-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41418-020-0496-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2020 Jul;27(7):2206-2216. doi: 10.1038/s41418-020-0496-1.

Because the MDS-AL risk has also been shown to be associated with exposure to GCSF, since 2005, in France, patients receiving high daily GCSF doses (>15 mug/kg/day) are eligible for HSCT, in addition to classic indications (MDS-AL or GCSF refractoriness). We analyzed the effect of this policy. Among 144 prospectively followed ELANE-neutropenia patients enrolled in the French Severe Congenital Neutropenia Registry, we defined two groups according to period: ""before 2005"" for those born before 2005 and followed until 31/12/2004 (1588 person-years); and ""after 2005"" comprised of those born after 2005 or born before 2005 but followed after 2005 until 31/03/2019 (1327 person-years). Sixteen of our cohort patients underwent HSCT (14 long-term survivors) and six developed MDS-ALs. Six leukemic transformations occurred in the before-2005 group and none after 2005 (respective frequencies 3.8 x 10(-3) vs. 0; P < 0.01), while four HSCTs were done before 2005 and 12 since 2005 (respective HSCT rates increased 2.5 x 10(-3) vs. 9 x 10(-3); P < 0.01). Our results support early HSCT for patients with ELANE mutations who received high GCSF doses, as it might lower the risk of leukemic transformation.","['Rotulo, Gioacchino Andrea', 'Beaupain, Blandine', 'Rialland, Fanny', 'Paillard, Catherine', 'Nachit, Ouahiba', 'Galambrun, Claire', 'Gandemer, Virginie', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Neven, Benedicte', 'Dore, Eric', 'Moshous, Despina', 'Filhon, Bruno', 'Aladjdi, Nathalie', 'Sicre de Fontbrune, Flore', 'de la Tour, Regis Peffault', 'Ouachee, Marie', 'Bellanne-Chantelot, Christine', 'Dalle, Jean-Hugues', 'Donadieu, Jean']","['Rotulo GA', 'Beaupain B', 'Rialland F', 'Paillard C', 'Nachit O', 'Galambrun C', 'Gandemer V', 'Bertrand Y', 'Neven B', 'Dore E', 'Moshous D', 'Filhon B', 'Aladjdi N', 'Sicre de Fontbrune F', 'de la Tour RP', 'Ouachee M', 'Bellanne-Chantelot C', 'Dalle JH', 'Donadieu J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4485-146X'],"['Registre des Neutropenies Chroniques, Centre de Reference des Neutropenies Chroniques, Sorbonne Universite, Inserm, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine, Hopital Trousseau, APHP, Paris, F-75012, France.', 'IRCCS Giannina Gaslini and Universita degli Studi di Genova, Genoa, Italy.', 'Registre des Neutropenies Chroniques, Centre de Reference des Neutropenies Chroniques, Sorbonne Universite, Inserm, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine, Hopital Trousseau, APHP, Paris, F-75012, France.', 'CHU de Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'University of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Registre des Neutropenies Chroniques, Centre de Reference des Neutropenies Chroniques, Sorbonne Universite, Inserm, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine, Hopital Trousseau, APHP, Paris, F-75012, France.', 'CHU La Timone, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital of Rennes, Rennes, France.', ""Institut d'Hemato-Oncologie Pediatrie IHOPE, Lyon, France."", ""Necker Children's Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."", 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Centre Regional de Cancerologie et Therapie Cellulaire Pediatrique, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""Unite d'Immunologie Hematologie Pediatrique, Necker Children's Hospital, Paris, France."", 'Department de Pediatrie, Hemato-Oncologie, CHU de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department de Pediatrie, Hemato-Oncologie, CHU de Rouen, Rouen, France.', ""Department d'Hematologie, Service de Transplantation Medullaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France."", ""Department d'Hematologie, Service de Transplantation Medullaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France."", ""Institut d'Hemato-Oncologie Pediatrie IHOPE, Lyon, France."", 'Departement de Genetique, APHP, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology Department, Robert-Debre Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Registre des Neutropenies Chroniques, Centre de Reference des Neutropenies Chroniques, Sorbonne Universite, Inserm, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine, Hopital Trousseau, APHP, Paris, F-75012, France. jean.donadieu@trs.aphp.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200128,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,,"['Congenital Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes', 'Controlled Before-After Studies', 'France/epidemiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Neutropenia/chemically induced/congenital', 'Registries']",,,2020/01/30 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/01/30 06:00'],"['2019/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-0800-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-0800-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2020 Aug;55(8):1614-1622. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-0800-1.

We performed a comprehensive study of 200 adult patients with T-ALL included in the GRAALL2003/2005 protocols to address the clinical significance of IL7Rp mutations. Next-generation sequencing of the IL7Rp (IL7R/JAK1/JAK3/STAT5B) revealed that IL7Rp mutations were frequent in adult T-ALL (28%) particularly in immature/early T-cell progenitor (ETP)-ALL. They were associated with mutations of NOTCH-pathway, PHF6, and PRC2 components but not with K/NRAS. IL7Rp mutated (IL7Rp(mut)) T-ALL were slow-responders, with a high rate of M2/M3 day-8 marrow compared with IL7Rp non-mutated (IL7Rp(WT)) T-ALL (p = 0.002) and minimal residual disease positivity at 6-weeks (MRD1) (p = 0.008) but no difference in MRD2 positivity at 12-weeks. Despite this, no adverse prognosis was evidenced when censored for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In time-dependent analysis, HSCT did not benefit IL7Rp(mut) patients whereas it was of marked benefit to IL7Rp(WT) cases. IL7Rp-mutations identify a subgroup of slow-responder T-ALLs which benefit from post-induction chemotherapy regimens but not from HSCT. Our data suggest that prior knowledge of the mutation status of IL7Rp may influence HSCT decision and help to guide therapy reduction.","['Kim, Rathana', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Touzart, Aurore', 'Leguay, Thibaut', 'Thonier, Florian', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Villarese, Patrick', 'Fourrage, Cecile', 'Passini, Loic', 'Hunault, Mathilde', 'Lepretre, Stephane', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Braun, Thorsten', 'Lheritier, Veronique', 'Chantepie, Sylvain', 'Maury, Sebastien', 'Escoffre, Martine', 'Tavernier, Emmanuelle', 'Chalandon, Yves', 'Graux, Carlos', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Lhermitte, Ludovic']","['Kim R', 'Boissel N', 'Touzart A', 'Leguay T', 'Thonier F', 'Thomas X', 'Raffoux E', 'Huguet F', 'Villarese P', 'Fourrage C', 'Passini L', 'Hunault M', 'Lepretre S', 'Chevallier P', 'Braun T', 'Lheritier V', 'Chantepie S', 'Maury S', 'Escoffre M', 'Tavernier E', 'Chalandon Y', 'Graux C', 'Macintyre E', 'Ifrah N', 'Asnafi V', 'Dombret H', 'Lhermitte L']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9341-8104', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2498-0376']","['Universite de Paris, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Institut National de Recherche Medicale U1151, Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, EA-3518, Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, Hematology Adolescent and Young Adult Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Institut National de Recherche Medicale U1151, Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU de Bordeaux, Hopital du Haut-Leveque, Pessac, France.', 'Universite de Paris, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Institut National de Recherche Medicale U1151, Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Pierre-Benite, France.', 'Universite de Paris, Department of Hematology, Adult Hematology Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", 'Universite de Paris, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Institut National de Recherche Medicale U1151, Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.', 'Plateforme Bioinformatique, Institut Imagine, Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Institut National de Recherche Medicale U1151, Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU Angers, Angers, France.', ""CRCINA, INSERM Universite de Nantes, Universite d'Angers, Angers, France."", 'Inserm U1245 and Department of Hematology, Centre Henri Becquerel and Normandie Univ UNIROUEN, Rouen, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU, Nantes, France.', 'INSERM UMR1232 & CNRS ERL6001 CRCINA IRS-UN, Nantes, France.', ""Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris Cancer Research Institute (PACRI), Paris, France."", 'Laboratoire de Transfert des Leucemies, EA3518, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, Assistance Publique -

Over the past decade, APL has emerged from a highly fatal disease to a highly curable one. The published data on outcomes of APL from India are scant. The present study was designed to analyze the clinicopathologic features and outcomes in adult APL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present report is a single institutional, observational, retrospective study, and data of patients diagnosed with APL from 2006 to 2018 were analyzed. All patients with APL, diagnosed by morphology and confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha) and over 18 years of age, were included in this study. SPSS software v25.1 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1396 patients with AML were seen between January 2005 and June 2018, of which 190 (13.6%) had APL. Of these, 111 patients met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The median age at presentation was 33 years (range, 19-60 years). The median duration of symptoms before presentation was 15 days (range, 3-180 days). High risk, intermediate risk, and low risk were seen in 43.3%, 41.4%, and 15.3% of patients, respectively. At the end of induction chemotherapy, 88 (79%) patients achieved complete hematologic remission, and 23 (21%) succumbed during induction. The median time to attain complete hematologic remission was 30 days (range, 19-47 days). At a median follow-up of 34 months, the event-free survival and overall survival were 69.3% and 74.7%, respectively. On univariate analysis, bcr3 variant and high-risk category at presentation had significant impact on event-free survival (P = .029 and P = .003, respectively) and overall survival (P </= .001 and P = .007, respectively). On multivariate analysis, only high risk at presentation was significant for event-free survival (P = .04) and overall survival (P = .02). CONCLUSION: APL constituted one-tenth of patients with AML. The majority of patients were high risk at presentation. Sanz high risk category and bcr3 variant at presentation had significant impact on outcomes in APL.","['Yedla, Rajani Priya', 'Bala, Stalin Chowdary', 'Pydi, Venkateswar Rao', 'Kuruva, Siva Prasad', 'Chennamaneni, Rachana', 'Konatam, Meher Lakshmi', 'Paul, Tara Roshni', 'Gundeti, Sadashivudu']","['Yedla RP', 'Bala SC', 'Pydi VR', 'Kuruva SP', 'Chennamaneni R', 'Konatam ML', 'Paul TR', 'Gundeti S']",,"[""Department of Medical Oncology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India.

Several studies have demonstrated that oncogenesis in AML is enhanced by kinase signaling pathways such as Src family kinases (SFK) including Src and Lyn, spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), and bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Recently, the multi-kinase inhibitor ArQule 531 (ARQ 531) has demonstrated potent inhibition of SFK and BTK that translated to improved pre-clinical in vivo activity as compared with the irreversible BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) models. Given the superior activity of ARQ 531 in CLL, and recognition that this molecule has a broad kinase inhibition profile, we pursued its application in pre-clinical models of AML. METHODS: The potency of ARQ 531 was examined in vitro using FLT3 wild type and mutated (ITD) AML cell lines and primary samples. The modulation of pro-survival kinases following ARQ 531 treatment was determined using AML cell lines. The effect of SYK expression on ARQ 531 potency was evaluated using a SYK overexpressing cell line (Ba/F3 murine cells) constitutively expressing FLT3-ITD. Finally, the in vivo activity of ARQ 531 was evaluated using MOLM-13 disseminated xenograft model. RESULTS: Our data demonstrate that ARQ 531 treatment has anti-proliferative activity in vitro and impairs colony formation in AML cell lines and primary AML cells independent of the presence of a FLT3 ITD mutation. We demonstrate decreased phosphorylation of oncogenic kinases targeted by ARQ 531, including SFK (Tyr416), BTK, and fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), ultimately leading to changes in down-stream targets including SYK, STAT5a, and ERK1/2. Based upon in vitro drug synergy data, we examined ARQ 531 in the MOLM-13 AML xenograft model alone and in combination with venetoclax. Despite ARQ 531 having a less favorable pharmacokinetics profile in rodents, we demonstrate modest single agent in vivo activity and synergy with venetoclax. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support consideration of the application of ARQ 531 in combination trials for AML targeting higher drug concentrations in vivo.","['Elgamal, Ola A', 'Mehmood, Abeera', 'Jeon, Jae

While often innocuous, contamination can lead to inaccurate results. Cantalupo et al., for example, found HeLa-derived human papillomavirus 18 (H-HPV18) in several of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-sequencing samples. This work motivated us to assess a greater number of samples and determine the origin of possible contaminations using viral sequences. To detect viruses with high specificity, we developed the publicly available workflow, VirDetect, that detects virus and laboratory vector sequences in RNA-seq samples. We applied VirDetect to 9143 RNA-seq samples sequenced at one TCGA sequencing center (28/33 cancer types) over 5 years. RESULTS: We confirmed that H-HPV18 was present in many samples and determined that viral transcripts from H-HPV18 significantly co-occurred with those from xenotropic mouse leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV). Using laboratory metadata and viral transcription, we determined that the likely contaminant was a pool of cell lines known as the ""common reference"", which was sequenced alongside TCGA RNA-seq samples as a control to monitor quality across technology transitions (i.e. microarray to GAII to HiSeq), and to link RNA-seq to previous generation microarrays that standardly used the ""common reference"". One of the cell lines in the pool was a laboratory isolate of MCF-7, which we discovered was infected with XMRV; another constituent of the pool was likely HeLa cells. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, this indicates a multi-step contamination process. First, MCF-7 was infected with an XMRV.

In this paper, Lavandin Essential Oil (LEO), a natural sterile hybrid obtained by cross-breeding L. angustifolia x L. latifolia, was tested on human leukaemia cells (HL60). Based on the MTT results, the reduced cell viability of HL60 cells was further investigated to determine whether cell death was related to the apoptotic process. HL60 cells treated for 24 h with LEO were processed by flow cytometry, and the presence of Annexin V was measured. The activation of caspases-3 was evaluated by western blot and immunofluorescence techniques. Treated cells were also examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy to establish the possible occurrence of morphological alterations during the apoptotic process. LEO main compounds, such as linalool, linalyl acetate, 1,8-cineole, and terpinen-4-ol, were also investigated by MTT and flow cytometry analysis. The set of obtained results showed that LEO treatments induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent, but not time-dependent, manner on HL60 cells, while among LEO main compounds, both terpinen-4-ol and linalyl acetate were able to induce apoptosis.","['Laghezza Masci, Valentina', 'Ovidi, Elisa', 'Taddei, Anna Rita', 'Turchetti, Giovanni', 'Tiezzi, Antonio', 'Giacomello, Pierluigi', 'Garzoli, Stefania']","['Laghezza Masci V', 'Ovidi E', 'Taddei AR', 'Turchetti G', 'Tiezzi A', 'Giacomello P', 'Garzoli S']",,"['Department for the Innovation in Biological, Agrofood and Forestal Systems, Tuscia University, 01100 Viterbo, Italy.', 'Department for the Innovation in Biological, Agrofood and Forestal Systems, Tuscia University, 01100 Viterbo, Italy.', 'High Equipment Centre, Tuscia University, 01100 Viterbo, Italy.', 'Department for the Innovation in Biological, Agrofood and Forestal Systems, Tuscia University, 01100 Viterbo, Italy.', 'Department for the Innovation in Biological, Agrofood and Forestal Systems, Tuscia University, 01100 Viterbo, Italy.', 'Department of Drug Chemistry and Technology, Sapienza University, 00185 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Drug Chemistry and Technology, Sapienza University, 00185 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200126,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lavandula/*chemistry', 'Oils, Volatile/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Plant Oils/chemistry/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['HL60', 'Lavandin Essential Oil', 'MTT test', 'apoptosis', 'caspase-3', 'electron microscopy', 'flow cytometry', 'immunofluorescence techniques']",2020/01/30 06:00,2020/11/13 06:00,['2020/01/30 06:00'],"['2019/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25030538 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25030538 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 Jan 26;25(3). pii: molecules25030538. doi: 10.3390/molecules25030538.,PMC7036901,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,"['0 (Oils, Volatile)', '0 (Plant Oils)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intercellular signals by the BM stromal cells in the form of cell-bound or secreted factors, or by physical interaction, regulate HSC localization, maintenance, and differentiation within increasingly defined BM HSC niches. Gap junctions (GJ) are comprised of arrays of membrane embedded channels formed by connexin proteins, and control crucial signaling functions, including the transfer of ions, small metabolites, and organelles to adjacent cells which affect intracellular mechanisms of signaling and autophagy. This review will discuss the role of GJ in both normal and leukemic hematopoiesis, and highlight some of the most novel approaches that may improve the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs. Connexin GJ channels exert both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic effects on HSC and BM stromal cells, involved in regenerative hematopoiesis after myelosuppression, and represent an alternative system of cell communication through a combination of electrical and metabolic coupling as well as organelle transfer in the HSC niche. GJ intercellular communication (GJIC) in the HSC niche improves cellular bioenergetics, and rejuvenates damaged recipient cells. Unfortunately, they can also support leukemia proliferation and survival by creating leukemic niches that provide GJIC dependent energy sources and facilitate chemoresistance and relapse. The emergence of new strategies to disrupt self-reinforcing malignant niches and intercellular organelle exchange in leukemic niches, while at the same time conserving normal hematopoietic GJIC function, could synergize the effect of chemotherapy drugs in eradicating minimal residual disease. An improved understanding of the molecular basis of connexin regulation in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis is warranted for the re-establishment of normal hematopoiesis after chemotherapy.","['Singh, Abhishek K', 'Cancelas, Jose A']","['Singh AK', 'Cancelas JA']",,"[""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 3333 Burnet Ave., Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'Hoxworth Blood Center, University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center, 3333 Burnet Ave., Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 3333 Burnet Ave., Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'Hoxworth Blood Center, University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center, 3333 Burnet Ave., Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200125,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Gap Junctions/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Progenitor Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', '*Stem Cell Niche']",['NOTNLM'],"['connexin', 'gap junction', 'hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors', 'leukemia', 'mitochondria', 'niche', 'reactive oxygen species', 'stromal cells', 'tunneling nanotubes']",2020/01/30 06:00,2020/11/06 06:00,['2020/01/30 06:00'],"['2019/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21030796 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21030796 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jan 25;21(3). pii: ijms21030796. doi: 10.3390/ijms21030796.,PMC7038046,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since this discovery, RUNX1 has been shown to play important roles not only in leukemia but also in the ontogeny of the normal hematopoietic system. Although it is currently still challenging to fully assess the different parameters regulating RUNX1 dosage, it has become clear that the dose of RUNX1 can greatly affect both leukemia and normal hematopoietic development. It is also becoming evident that varying levels of RUNX1 expression can be used as markers of tumor progression not only in the hematopoietic system, but also in non-hematopoietic cancers. Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of the effects of RUNX1 dosage in normal development of both hematopoietic and epithelial tissues and their associated cancers.","['Lie-A-Ling, Michael', 'Mevel, Renaud', 'Patel, Rahima', 'Blyth, Karen', 'Baena, Esther', 'Kouskoff, Valerie', 'Lacaud, Georges']","['Lie-A-Ling M', 'Mevel R', 'Patel R', 'Blyth K', 'Baena E', 'Kouskoff V', 'Lacaud G']",,"['Cancer Research UK Stem Cell Biology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Macclesfield, SK10 4TG, UK.', 'These authors contributed equally to this work.', 'Cancer Research UK Stem Cell Biology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Macclesfield, SK10 4TG, UK.', 'These authors contributed equally to this work.', 'Cancer Research UK Stem Cell Biology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Macclesfield, SK10 4TG, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, G61 1BD, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G61 1QH, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Prostate Oncobiology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Macclesfield, SK10 4TG, UK.', 'Division of Developmental Biology & Medicine, The University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Stem Cell Biology Group, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Macclesfield, SK10 4TG, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,IM,,"['Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['development', 'dosage', 'hematopoiesis', 'runx1', 'tumorigenesis']",2020/01/30 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2020/01/30 06:00'],"['2019/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['molcells.2019.0301 [pii]', '10.14348/molcells.2019.0301 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cells. 2020 Feb 29;43(2):126-138. doi: 10.14348/molcells.2019.0301.,PMC7057845,,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, the importance of producing microarray data from tissue and cell samples and analyzing these microarray data has increased. Machine learning and deep learning methods have been started to use in the diagnosis and classification of microarray data of cancer diseases. However, it is challenging to analyze microarray data due to the small number of sample size and high number of features of microarray data and in some cases some features may not be relevant with the classification. Because of this reason, studies in the literature focused on developing feature selection/dimension reduction techniques and classification algorithms to improve classification accuracy of the microarray data. This study proposes hybrid methods by using Relief and stacked autoencoder approaches for dimension reduction and support vector machines (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for classification. In the study, three microarray datasets of Overian, Leukemia and Central Nervous System (CNS) were used. Ovarian dataset contains 253 samples, 15,154 genes and 2 classes, Leukemia dataset contains 72 samples, 7129 genes, and 2 classes and CNS dataset contains 60 samples, 7129 genes and 2 classes. Among the methods applied to the three microarray data, the best classification accuracy without dimension reduction was observed with SVM as 96.14% for ovarian dataset, 94.83% for leukemia dataset and 65% for CNS dataset. The proposed hybrid method ReliefF + CNN method outperformed other approaches. It gave 98.6%, 99.86% and 83.95% classification accuracy for the datasets of ovarian, leukemia, and CNS datasets, respectively. Results shows that dimension reduction methods improved the classification accuracy of the methods of SVM and CNN.","['Kilicarslan, Serhat', 'Adem, Kemal', 'Celik, Mete']","['Kilicarslan S', 'Adem K', 'Celik M']",,"['Gaziosmanpasa University, Department of Informatics, 60250 Tokat, Turkey.

However, CTCs being extremely rare in blood makes them difficult to reach. In this paper, we introduced different surface modification techniques for the enrichment and detection of MCF-7 in microfluidic biosensor applications using gold surface and EpCAM antibody. Mainly, two different mechanisms were employed to immobilize the antibodies; covalent bonding and bioaffinity interaction. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) formed on the gold surfaces were treated further for the immobilization of the antibody. The bioaffinity-based studies were performed with streptavidin and biotinylated EpCAM over the SAM coated surfaces. The cell attachment events were monitored using fluorescent microscope. Comparisons were made considering the length and functional end of alkanethiols and the positioning of the antibody. Then, these methods were integrated into a microfluidic channel system. Surface characterizations were performed with X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy, and contact angle measurements. The selectivity studies were carried out with EpCAM negative K562 leukaemia cell lines and the experiments were repeated for different types of surfaces, such as glass and polymer. Studies showed that long (n>10) and aromatic ring containing alkanethiols lead to better cell capture events compared to shorter ones. Results obtained from the comparisons are of importance for the gold surface-based microfluidic biosensor designs aimed for CTC detection.","['Cetin, Didem', 'Okan, Meltem', 'Bat, Erhan', 'Kulah, Haluk']","['Cetin D', 'Okan M', 'Bat E', 'Kulah H']",,"['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Micro and Nanotechnology, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey; METU MEMS Center, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey; Department of Chemical Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey; Department of Micro and Nanotechnology, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey; METU MEMS Center, Ankara, Turkey; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey.

In an attempt to discover new functions of NA, we conducted a classical yeast two-hybrid screen and found acute myeloid leukaemia marker 1 (AML1) as a novel interacting partner of IAV-NA. The interaction was further validated by co-immunoprecipitation in IAV-infected cells and in an in vitro coupled transcription/translation system. Interestingly, we found an increase in the expression of AML1 upon IAV infection in a dose-dependent manner. As expected, we also observed an increase in the IFN-beta levels, the first line of defence against viral infections. Subsequently, when AML1 was downregulated using siRNA, the IFN-beta levels were found to be remarkably reduced. Our study also shows that AML1 is induced upon IAV infection and results in the induction of IFN-beta. Thus, AML1 is proposed to be an important player in IFN induction and has a role in an antiviral response against IAV infection. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Influenza epidemics and pandemics are constant threats to human health. Development of antiviral therapeutics has focused on important and major IAV proteins as targets. However, the rate at which this virus mutates makes the task challenging. Thus, next-generation approaches aim at host cellular proteins that aid the virus in its replication. This study reports a new host-virus interaction, of acute myeloid leukaemia marker 1 (AML1) with influenza A neuraminidase (IAV-NA). We have found that this interaction has a direct effect on the upregulation of host IFN-beta response. Further studies may lead to a greater understanding of this new innate defence pathway in infected cells.","['Gaur, P', 'Kumar, P', 'Sharma, A', 'Lal, S K']","['Gaur P', 'Kumar P', 'Sharma A', 'Lal SK']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3548-4853'],"['School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Mewar University, Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, India.', 'Virology Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, The Institute for Medical Research - Israel-Canada (IMRIC), The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Mewar University, Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, India.', 'Virology Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, New Delhi, India.', 'School of Science, Monash University Malaysia, Selangor DE, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200217,England,Lett Appl Microbiol,Letters in applied microbiology,8510094,IM,,"['Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype/genetics/*metabolism', 'Influenza, Human/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Interferon-beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neuraminidase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Up-Regulation', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['IFN-beta', 'acute myeloid leukaemia marker', 'influenza A virus', 'neuraminidase', 'siRNA']",2020/01/29 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2020/01/29 06:00'],"['2019/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/lam.13279 [doi]'],ppublish,Lett Appl Microbiol. 2020 Apr;70(4):252-258. doi: 10.1111/lam.13279.

Using deep phenotypic analysis of early progenitors in FA/SDS bone marrow samples, we revealed selective survival of progenitors that phenotypically resembled granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP). Whole-exome and targeted sequencing of GMP-like cells in leukemia-free patients revealed a higher mutation load than in healthy controls and molecular changes that are characteristic of AML: increased G>A/C>T variants, decreased A>G/T>C variants, increased trinucleotide mutations at Xp(C>T)pT, and decreased mutation rates at Xp(C>T)pG sites compared with other Xp(C>T)pX sites and enrichment for Cancer Signature 1 (X indicates any nucleotide). Potential preleukemic targets in the GMP-like cells from patients with FA/SDS included SYNE1, DST, HUWE1, LRP2, NOTCH2, and TP53. Serial analysis of GMPs from an SDS patient who progressed to leukemia revealed a gradual increase in mutational burden, enrichment of G>A/C>T signature, and emergence of new clones. Interestingly, the molecular signature of marrow cells from 2 FA/SDS patients with leukemia was similar to that of FA/SDS patients without transformation. The predicted founding clones in SDS-derived AML harbored mutations in several genes, including TP53, while in FA-derived AML the mutated genes included ARID1B and SFPQ. We describe an architectural change in the hematopoietic hierarchy of FA/SDS with remarkable preservation of GMP-like populations harboring unique mutation signatures. GMP-like cells might represent a cellular reservoir for clonal evolution.","['Heidemann, Stephanie', 'Bursic, Brian', 'Zandi, Sasan', 'Li, Hongbing', 'Abelson, Sagi', 'Klaassen, Robert J', 'Abish, Sharon', 'Rayar, Meera', 'Breakey, Vicky R', 'Moshiri, Houtan', 'Dhanraj, Santhosh', 'de Borja, Richard', 'Shlien, Adam', 'Dick, John E', 'Dror, Yigal']","['Heidemann S', 'Bursic B', 'Zandi S', 'Li H', 'Abelson S', 'Klaassen RJ', 'Abish S', 'Rayar M', 'Breakey VR', 'Moshiri H', 'Dhanraj S', 'de Borja R', 'Shlien A', 'Dick JE', 'Dror Y']",,"['Genetics & Genome Biology Program and.', 'Marrow Failure and Myelodysplasia (Pre-leukemia) Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Genetics & Genome Biology Program and.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Genetics & Genome Biology Program and.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", ""Hematology-Oncology, Montreal Children's Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."", ""Division of Hematology, Oncology & Bone Marrow Transplant, University of British Columbia and British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Genetics & Genome Biology Program and.', 'Genetics & Genome Biology Program and.', 'Institute of Medical Science and.', 'Genetics & Genome Biology Program and.', 'Genetics & Genome Biology Program and.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Genetics & Genome Biology Program and.', 'Marrow Failure and Myelodysplasia (Pre-leukemia) Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute of Medical Science and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200227,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,IM,,"['Bone Marrow Failure Disorders/genetics/*pathology', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', '*Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone marrow', '*Genetic diseases', '*Hematology', '*Leukemias', '*Oncology']",2020/01/29 06:00,2021/05/27 06:00,['2020/01/29 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['131018 [pii]', '10.1172/jci.insight.131018 [doi]']",epublish,JCI Insight. 2020 Feb 27;5(4). pii: 131018. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.131018.,PMC7101147,,"['377600/CIHR/Canada', '378100/CIHR/Canada']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, approximately half of all childhood AML cases relapse. Therefore, precise risk stratification is needed for predicting relapse potential.Methods: RNA-seq data of TARGET-AML and corresponding clinical information of pediatric and adolescent AML cases were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Clinical information of 156 patients with gene expression data was extracted. The effects of PAX7 expression profiles on overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were analyzed.Results: Positive expression of PAX7 indicated shorter OS and EFS, especially in patients older than 14 years. Furthermore, positive PAX7 expression also predicted shorter OS and EFS in intermediate- and low-risk group patients, compared to patients with negative PAX7 expression. In addition, patients who have received allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in the first complete remission had better outcome than those who did not receive HSCT.Conclusions: Positive PAX7 expression in pediatric and adolescent AML patients indicates a poor outcome. Hence, the detection of PAX7 expression profiles is helpful for further stratification of intermediate- and low-risk groups.","['Yan, Tianyou', 'Naren, Duolan', 'Gong, Yuping']","['Yan T', 'Naren D', 'Gong Y']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6081-2962', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2437-9348']","['Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20200128,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Databases, Nucleic Acid', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'PAX7 Transcription Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*PAX7 expression profiles', '*pediatric and Adolescent', '*prognosis', '*risk stratification']",2020/01/29 06:00,2021/02/05 06:00,['2020/01/29 06:00'],"['2020/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2020.1719826 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2020 Mar;13(3):289-297. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2020.1719826.

Fanconi anemia: a single center experience of a large cohort. Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 477-484. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disease, characterized by congenital malformations, short stature, progressive bone marrow failure and predisposition to leukemia and solid tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and prognostic features of FA patients followed in a single center. The charts of FA patients were reviewed 35 years retrospectively and a total of 175 patients were included in the study in which 51.4% of patients were male. The mean age at diagnosis was 6.3+/-4.1 years. The incidence of microcephaly was 92.6%, skin findings were 88.0%, eye abnormality was 74.3%, thumb and radius abnormality was 53.1%, urinary system abnormality was 30.9%, skeletal system abnormality other than thumb and radius was 18.9%, genital system abnormality was 11.4%, cardiovascular system abnormality was 11.4%, ear and hearing abnormalities were 9.7% and gastrointestinal system abnormality was 5.7%. Short stature was present in 75.4% of the patients. Of the 175 patients 167 (95.4%) developed bone marrow failure during follow-up and the mean age of bone marrow failure was 7.1 +/-3.7 years (1 month-old-19.8 years). The first clinical symptom was thrombocytopenia in 83.4% of patients. Malignancy developed in a total of 23 (13.1 %) patients (20 leukemia, 3 solid tumors) during follow-up. Of 175 patients, 35 (20%) underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Fatality rate among patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was 31.4% (11/35) and fatality rate among other patients was 63.4% (83/131; p < 0.05). Of 94 patients who deceased, death was due to bleeding in 44.7%, infection in 34%, leukemia progression in 16.0% and graft versus host disease in 5.3%. In terms of the number of patients included, this study is one of the largest cohorts with a remarkable duration of follow-up time. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was found to have a good impact on sur vival of patients.","['Kesici, Selman', 'Unal, Sule', 'Kuskonmaz, Baris', 'Aytac, Selin', 'Cetin, Mualla', 'Gumruk, Fatma']","['Kesici S', 'Unal S', 'Kuskonmaz B', 'Aytac S', 'Cetin M', 'Gumruk F']",,"['Divisions of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara.', 'Divisions of Pediatric Hematology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara.', 'Divisions of Pediatric Hematology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara.', 'Divisions of Pediatric Hematology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara.', 'Divisions of Pediatric Hematology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara.', 'Divisions of Pediatric Hematology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Turk J Pediatr,The Turkish journal of pediatrics,0417505,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Fanconi Anemia/complications/*diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Fanconi anemia', 'congenital anomalies', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'leukemia', 'mortality']",2020/01/29 06:00,2020/05/08 06:00,['2020/01/29 06:00'],"['2020/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['1960 [pii]', '10.24953/turkjped.2019.04.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Turk J Pediatr. 2019;61(4):477-484. doi: 10.24953/turkjped.2019.04.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Azacitidine (AZA), a hypomethylating agent, has showed activity in t-MDS/AML. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the clonal dynamics of AZA-treated t-MDS/AML. METHODS: We collected bone marrow samples, at diagnosis and during treatment, from AZA-treated t-MDS/AML patients. NGS on 19 myeloid genes was performed, and candidate mutations with a variant allele frequency >5% were selected. RESULTS: Seven t-AML and 12 t-MDS were included with median age of 71 (56-82) years old, median number of AZA cycles of 6 (1-15), and median overall survival (OS) of 14 (3-29) months. We observed correlation between AZA response and clonal selection. Decrease of TP53-mutated clone was correlated with response to AZA, confirming AZA efficacy in this subgroup. In some patients, emergence of mutations was correlated with progression or relapse without impact on OS. Clones with mutations in genes for DNA methylation regulation frequently occurred with other mutations and remained stable during AZA treatment, independent of AZA response. CONCLUSION: We confirmed that the molecular complexity of t-MNs and that the follow-up of clonal selection during AZA treatment could be useful to define treatment combination.","['Calleja, Anne', 'Yun, Seongseok', 'Moreilhon, Chimene', 'Karsenti, Jean Michel', 'Gastaud, Lauris', 'Mannone, Lionel', 'Komrokji, Rami', 'Al Ali, Najla', 'Dadone-Montaudie, Berangere', 'Robert, Guillaume', 'Auberger, Patrick', 'Raynaud, Sophie', 'Sallman, David A', 'Cluzeau, Thomas']","['Calleja A', 'Yun S', 'Moreilhon C', 'Karsenti JM', 'Gastaud L', 'Mannone L', 'Komrokji R', 'Al Ali N', 'Dadone-Montaudie B', 'Robert G', 'Auberger P', 'Raynaud S', 'Sallman DA', 'Cluzeau T']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0714-7921'],"[""Hematology Department, Cote D'Azur University, Nice Sophia Antipolis University, CHU of Nice, Nice, France."", ""Cote d'Azur University, INSERM U1065, Mediterranean Center of Molecular Medecine, Nice, France."", 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

Recently, we showed that photodynamic therapy (PDT) with nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (N-TiO2 ) nanoparticles (NPs) could promote the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent autophagy in leukemia cells. However, the differential autophagic effects of N-TiO2 NPs in the dark and light conditions and the potential of N-TiO2- based PDT for the treatment of melanoma cells remain unknown. Here we show that depending on the visible-light condition, the autophagic response of human melanoma A375 cells to N-TiO2 NPs switches between two different statuses (ie., flux or blockade) with the opposite outcomes (ie., survival or death). Mechanistically, low doses of N-TiO2 NPs (1-100 microg/ml) stimulate a nontoxic autophagy flux response in A375 cells, whereas their photo-activation leads to the impairment of the autophagosome-lysosome fusion, the blockade of autophagy flux and consequently the induction of RIPK1-mediated necroptosis via ROS production. These results confirm that photo-controllable autophagic effects of N-TiO2 NPs can be utilized for the treatment of cancer, particularly melanoma.","['Mohammadalipour, Zahra', 'Rahmati, Marveh', 'Khataee, Alireza', 'Moosavi, Mohammad A']","['Mohammadalipour Z', 'Rahmati M', 'Khataee A', 'Moosavi MA']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9958-2220'],"['Department of Molecular Medicine, National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cancer Biology Research Center, Cancer Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Research Laboratory of Advanced Water and Wastewater Treatment Processes, Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Materials Science and Nanotechnology Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Near East University, Nicosia, North Cyprus, Turkey.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200128,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,,"['Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Light', '*Melanoma/pathology', 'Metal Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Necroptosis/*drug effects', 'Nitrogen/chemistry', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Photochemotherapy/methods', 'Photosensitizing Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Titanium/chemistry/*pharmacology/radiation effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*autophagy', '*nanoparticle', '*necroptosis', '*reactive oxygen species', '*titanium dioxide']",2020/01/29 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/01/29 06:00'],"['2019/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.29479 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2020 Nov;235(11):8246-8259. doi: 10.1002/jcp.29479.

The exogenous addition of ALA to cells leads to protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) accumulation that has been exploited in photodynamic diagnostic and photodynamic therapy. Several types of ALA transporters have been described depending on the cell type, but there was no clear entry pathway for erythroid cells. The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has been proposed to be involved in the transport of porphyrins and heme analogs. RESULTS: ALA-induced PPIX accumulation in erythroleukemia cells (UT-7 and K562) was impaired by PK 11195, a competitive inhibitor of both transmembrane proteins TSPO (1 and 2). PK 11195 did not modify the activity of the enzymes of heme biosynthesis, suggesting that ALA entry at the plasma membrane was the limiting factor. In contrast, porphobilinogen (PBG)-induced PPIX accumulation was not affected by PK 11195, suggesting that plasma membrane TSPO2 is a selective transporter of ALA. Overexpression of TSPO2 at the plasma membrane of erythroleukemia cells increased ALA-induced PPIX accumulation, confirming the role of TSPO2 in the import of ALA into the cells. CONCLUSIONS: ALA-induced PPIX accumulation in erythroid cells involves TSPO2 as a selective translocator through the plasma membrane. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first characterisation of molecular mechanisms involving a new actor in ALA transport in ALA-induced PPIX accumulation in erythroleukemia cells, which could be inhibited by specific drug ligands.","['Manceau, Hana', 'Lefevre, Sophie D', 'Mirmiran, Arienne', 'Hattab, Claude', 'Sugier, Hugo R', 'Schmitt, Caroline', ""Peoc'h, Katell"", 'Puy, Herve', 'Ostuni, Mariano A', 'Gouya, Laurent', 'Lacapere, Jean-Jacques']","['Manceau H', 'Lefevre SD', 'Mirmiran A', 'Hattab C', 'Sugier HR', 'Schmitt C', ""Peoc'h K"", 'Puy H', 'Ostuni MA', 'Gouya L', 'Lacapere JJ']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4158-0964', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7504-1881', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9513-7506', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2057-3909', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2217-3650', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5145-7260', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8203-1243', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3362-2634', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6769-3786', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1326-7025', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0520-6609']","[""Centre de recherche sur l'inflammation, INSERM U1149, Universite de Paris, F-75018, Paris, France."", 'Laboratoire de Biochimie, Hopital Beaujon, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, DHU Unity, 92110, Clichy, France.', 'UMR_S1134, Integrated Biology of Red Blood Cell, INSERM, Universite de Paris, F-75015, Paris, France.', 'Institut National de Transfusion Sanguine, F-75015, Paris, France.', ""Centre de recherche sur l'inflammation, INSERM U1149, Universite de Paris, F-75018, Paris, France."", 'UMR_S1134, Integrated Biology of Red Blood Cell, INSERM, Universite de Paris, F-75015, Paris, France.', 'Institut National de Transfusion Sanguine, F-75015, Paris, France.', 'Institut National de Transfusion Sanguine, F-75015, Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, UMR_S1134, Integrated Biology of Red Blood Cell, INSERM, F-75015, Paris, France.', ""Centre de recherche sur l'inflammation, INSERM U1149, Universite de Paris, F-75018, Paris, France."", 'Centre Francais des Porphyries, Hopital Louis Mourier, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, 92701, Colombes, France.', ""Centre de recherche sur l'inflammation, INSERM U1149, Universite de Paris, F-75018, Paris, France."", 'Laboratoire de Biochimie, Hopital Beaujon, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, DHU Unity, 92110, Clichy, France.', ""Centre de recherche sur l'inflammation, INSERM U1149, Universite de Paris, F-75018, Paris, France."", 'Centre Francais des Porphyries, Hopital Louis Mourier, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, 92701, Colombes, France.', 'UMR_S1134, Integrated Biology of Red Blood Cell, INSERM, Universite de Paris, F-75015, Paris, France.', 'Institut National de Transfusion Sanguine, F-75015, Paris, France.', ""Centre de recherche sur l'inflammation, INSERM U1149, Universite de Paris, F-75018, Paris, France."", 'Centre Francais des Porphyries, Hopital Louis Mourier, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, 92701, Colombes, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, Ecole Normale Superieure, PSL University, CNRS, Laboratoire des Biomolecules (LBM), F-75005, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200205,England,Biol Cell,Biology of the cell,8108529,IM,,"['Biological Transport', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Levulinic Acids/*pharmacokinetics', 'Protoporphyrins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",['NOTNLM'],"['Membrane protein', 'Membrane transport', 'Metabolism', 'Transporters']",2020/01/29 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/01/29 06:00'],"['2019/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/boc.201900098 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Cell. 2020 Apr;112(4):113-126. doi: 10.1111/boc.201900098.

We present here a system for analyzing the fate of documented DNA breaks, using the MLL gene as an example, through application of ligation-mediated PCR. Here, a simple asymmetric double-stranded DNA adapter molecule is ligated to experimentally induced DNA breaks and subjected to seminested PCR using adapter and gene-specific primers. The rate of appearance and loss of specific PCR products allow detection of both the break and its repair. Using the additional technique of inverse PCR, the presence of misrepaired products (translocations) can be detected at the same site, providing information on the fidelity of the ligation reaction in intact cells. Such techniques may be adapted for the analysis of DNA breaks and rearrangements introduced into any identifiable genomic location. We have also applied parallel sequencing for the high-throughput analysis of inverse PCR products to facilitate the unbiased recording of all rearrangements located at a specific genomic location.","['Singh, Sheetal', 'Shih, Shy-Jen', 'Vaughan, Andrew T M']","['Singh S', 'Shih SJ', 'Vaughan ATM']",,"['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California at Davis, Sacramento, CA, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California at Davis, Sacramento, CA, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California at Davis, Sacramento, CA, USA. atvaughan@ucdavis.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Chromosomes/*genetics', 'DNA/*genetics', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Ligases', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Repair', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Workflow']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*DNA', '*Double-strand break repair', '*IPCR', '*LM-PCR', '*MLL', '*Parallel sequencing', '*Translocation']",2020/01/29 06:00,2020/10/24 06:00,['2020/01/29 06:00'],"['2020/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-0716-0223-2_15 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2020;2102:271-288. doi: 10.1007/978-1-0716-0223-2_15.,,,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Ligases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we evaluated PP for potential anti-leukemic activity in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines, in an effort to evaluate the repurposing potential of this drug in leukemia. METHODS: ALL cells were treated with PP at various concentrations to determine its effect on cell proliferation. Metabolic function was tested by evaluating Extracellular Acidification Rate (ECAR) and Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR). Lastly, 3D spheroids were grown, and PP was reformulated into nanoparticles to evaluate distribution effectiveness. RESULTS: PP was found to inhibit ALL proliferation, with varied selectivity to different ALL cell subtypes. We also found that PP's cell death activity was specific for leukemic cells, as primary normal immune cells were resistant to PP-mediated cell death. Metabolic studies indicated that PP, in part, inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. To increase the targeting of PP to a hypoxic bone tumor microenvironment (BTME) niche, we successfully encapsulated PP in a nanoparticle drug delivery system and demonstrated that it retained its anti-leukemic activity in a hemosphere assay. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that PP is a novel therapeutic lead compound that counteracts the respiratory reprogramming found in refractory ALL cells and can be effectively formulated into a nanoparticle delivery system to target the BTME.","['Nair, Rajesh R', 'Piktel, Debbie', 'Hathaway, Quincy A', 'Rellick, Stephanie L', 'Thomas, Patrick', 'Saralkar, Pushkar', 'Martin, Karen H', 'Geldenhuys, Werner J', 'Hollander, John M', 'Gibson, Laura F']","['Nair RR', 'Piktel D', 'Hathaway QA', 'Rellick SL', 'Thomas P', 'Saralkar P', 'Martin KH', 'Geldenhuys WJ', 'Hollander JM', 'Gibson LF']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2405-376X'],"['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cell Biology, West Virginia University School of Medicine, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.', 'West Virginia University Cancer Institute, Robert C.

RECENT FINDINGS: The balance of cell death versus survival is ultimately leveraged at the mitochondria. Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) is the critical event that governs the release of pro-apoptotic molecules from the intermembrane mitochondrial space. MOMP is achieved through the coordinated actions of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member proteins. Recognition of functional alterations among the Bcl-2 family member proteins led to identification of tractable targets to combat hematologic malignancies. A new class of drugs, termed BH3 mimetics, was introduced in the clinic. Venetoclax, a Bcl-2 inhibitor, received regulatory approvals in therapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. Alternative pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins, in particular Mcl-1, have been successfully targeted in preclinical studies using novel-specific BH3 mimetics. Finally, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members may be targeted indirectly, via interference with the pro-survival signaling pathways, e.g., phosphoinotiside-3 kinase, B-cell receptor signaling, and NF-kappaB.","['Fletcher, Luke', 'Nabrinsky, Edward', 'Liu, Tingting', 'Danilov, Alexey']","['Fletcher L', 'Nabrinsky E', 'Liu T', 'Danilov A']",,"['Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Graduate Medical Education, Internal Medicine, Advocate Lutheran General Hospital, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA. danilov@ohsu.edu.', 'Department of Hematology, City of Hope National Medical Center, 1500 E Duarte Rd, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA. danilov@ohsu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200127,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Bcl-2', 'Mcl-1', 'Venetoclax']",2020/01/29 06:00,2020/06/05 06:00,['2020/01/29 06:00'],"['2020/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11912-020-0874-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s11912-020-0874-3 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2020 Jan 27;22(1):10. doi: 10.1007/s11912-020-0874-3.,,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial tisagenlecleucel manufacturing process technology was developed at an academic center and was subsequently transferred, optimized, validated, and scaled out to supply large global trials before commercialization. Tisagenlecleucel manufactured in two centralized facilities has been successfully used in global multicenter trials for B-ALL and DLBCL (>50 clinical centers in 12 countries). In this paper, we describe some of the continuous process improvements made to tisagenlecleucel manufacturing over time to meet global demand while maintaining and improving product quality. During early tisagenlecleucel clinical trials, process enhancements were made to address logistical challenges related to manufacturing for multicenter trials and to accommodate the variability observed in patient starting cellular material. These enhancements resulted in improvements in manufacturing capacity, process robustness, manufacturing success rates, and product quality, and reductions in throughput time. In summary, through continuous evaluation and improvements based on experience during global trials, a consistent and robust commercial manufacturing process for tisagenlecleucel has been developed, leading to improvements in manufacturing success when compared to the initial processes.","['Tyagarajan, Seshu', 'Spencer, Tom', 'Smith, Jonathan']","['Tyagarajan S', 'Spencer T', 'Smith J']",,"['Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ 07936, USA.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ 07936, USA.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ 07936, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191129,United States,Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,Molecular therapy.

The EU has shown some clarity of assessment in recognising the needs, and some laudable determination to improve the situation, and it has intermittently taken some real steps to deliver on its ambitions to turn its research into valuable innovations. But Europe still faces harsh choices about whether it is actually going to do what it has so often discussed. The EU has to make some firm decisions about what research deserves support - and where. It must turn words into deeds to promote effective links between research and innovation. That requires a sharper focus on developing and retaining the right skill sets in Europe, on funding innovation, on creating an encouraging regulatory environment, and on building greater public understanding and engagement. Here, among other issues, the authors discuss where resources should be deployed, how to maximise the potential of personalised medicine, the time it takes for search to be turned into products ready for market, education, and the EU's regulatory role.","['Horgan, Denis', 'Harfelach, Torsten', 'Ciliberto, Gennaro']","['Horgan D', 'Harfelach T', 'Ciliberto G']",,"['European Alliance for Personalised Medicine, Brussels, Belgium, Germany.', 'MLL Leukaemia Laboratory GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'Istituto Nazionale Tumori ""Regina Elena,"" Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20171121,Switzerland,Biomed Hub,Biomedicine hub,101692630,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Healthcare systems', 'Horizon 2020', 'Innovation', 'Innovative Medicines Initiative', 'Personalised medicine', 'Stratified medicine', 'Targeted drugs', 'Translational research']",2017/11/21 00:00,2017/11/21 00:01,['2020/01/29 06:00'],"['2017/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/21 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000481130 [doi]', 'bmh-0002-0095 [pii]']",epublish,Biomed Hub. 2017 Nov 21;2(Suppl 1):95-103. doi: 10.1159/000481130. eCollection 2017 Nov-Dec.,PMC6945917,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2017 by S.

Most conventional therapies aim to induce apoptosis in myeloma cells but resistance to these drugs often arises and drives relapse. In this study, we sought to identify the best adjunct targets to kill myeloma cells resistant to conventional therapies using deep profiling by mass cytometry (CyTOF). We validated probes to simultaneously detect 26 regulators of cell death, mitosis, cell signaling, and cancer-related pathways at the single-cell level following treatment of myeloma cells with dexamethasone or bortezomib. Time-resolved visualization algorithms and machine learning random forest models (RFMs) delineated putative cell death trajectories and a hierarchy of parameters that specified myeloma cell survival versus apoptosis following treatment. Among these parameters, increased amounts of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and the pro-survival protein, MCL-1, were defining features of cells surviving drug treatment. Importantly, the RFM prediction that the combination of an MCL-1 inhibitor with dexamethasone would elicit potent, synergistic killing of myeloma cells was validated in other cell lines, in vivo preclinical models and primary myeloma samples from patients. Furthermore, CyTOF analysis of patient bone marrow cells clearly identified myeloma cells and their key cell survival features. This study demonstrates the utility of CyTOF profiling at the single-cell level to identify clinically relevant drug combinations and tracking of patient responses for future clinical trials.","['Teh,

Gene mutation and expression profiles can be used as prognosis predictors for different prognostic subgroups. Secretory carrier-associated membrane proteins (SCAMPs) are a multigenic family with five members and act as cell surface vectors in the post-Golgi recycling pathways in mammals. Nevertheless, the prognostic and clinical influence of SCAMP family has hardly ever been illustrated in AML. In our study, expression patterns of SCAMP family (SCAMP1-5) were analyzed in 155 AML patients which were extracted from the Cancer Genome Atlas database. In chemotherapy, only subgroup, higher SCAMP1 level was significantly associated with longer EFS and OS (all P = 0.002), and SCAMP1 was confirmed to be an independent favorable factor in un-transplanted patients by Multivariate analysis (all P < 0.05).

In addition to TP53 mut patients, TCGA AML patient sequencing data show that there are around 3% of patients have detectable low-frequency TP53mut reads. Importantly, these patients showed worse outcome as compared with the TP53 wild type (TP53wt) patients. We have studied the effect of low-frequency TP53mut in two AML cell lines, OCI-AML2 and MV4-11. Both cells have low-frequency single hotspot TP53mut. Interestingly, the resistant cells derived from both lines have homogeneous TP53mut. TP53mut clones isolated from the parental cells also show increased chemoresistance potential and have higher population of leukemia stem cell (LSC) maker positive cells, a characteristic of chemoresistant cells. When mixed with TP53wt cells, the TP53mut cells show survival advantage suggesting its potential to develop chemoresistance. We previously showed that histone deacetylase inhibitor Romidepsin can re-sensitize chemoresistant cells by eradicating LSC marker positive cells. Here we further show that Romidepsin can reactivate p53 targeted genes which are dysregulated in TP53mut cells and preferentially targets TP53mut subpopulation. Therefore, our study shows that low-frequency TP53mut is linked to chemoresistance and sheds light on therapeutic strategies for treatments on chemoresistance.","['Yan, Bowen', 'Chen, Qinwei', 'Xu, Jianfeng', 'Li, Wei', 'Xu, Bing', 'Qiu, Yi']","['Yan B', 'Chen Q', 'Xu J', 'Li W', 'Xu B', 'Qiu Y']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9931-5990'],"['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361003, China.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Dan L.

The leukemic HL-60/S4 [human myeloid leukemic cell line HL-60/S4 (ATCC CRL-3306)] promyelocytic cell can be easily differentiated from its undifferentiated promyelocyte state into neutrophil- and macrophage-like cell states. In this study, we present the underlying genome and epigenome architecture of HL-60/S4 through its differentiation. We performed whole-genome bisulphite sequencing of HL-60/S4 cells and their differentiated counterparts. With the support of karyotyping, we show that HL-60/S4 maintains a stable genome throughout differentiation. Analysis of differential Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine dinucleotide methylation reveals that most methylation changes occur in the macrophage-like state. Differential methylation of promoters was associated with immune-related terms. Key immune genes, CEBPA, GFI1, MAFB and GATA1 showed differential expression and methylation. However, we observed the strongest enrichment of methylation changes in enhancers and CTCF binding sites, implying that methylation plays a major role in large-scale transcriptional reprogramming and chromatin reorganisation during differentiation. Correlation of differential expression and distal methylation with support from chromatin capture experiments allowed us to identify putative proximal and long-range enhancers for a number of immune cell differentiation genes, including CEBPA and CCNF Integrating expression data, we present a model of HL-60/S4 differentiation in relation to the wider scope of myeloid differentiation.","['Antwi, Enoch B', 'Olins, Ada', 'Teif, Vladimir B', 'Bieg, Matthias', 'Bauer, Tobias', 'Gu, Zuguang', 'Brors, Benedikt', 'Eils, Roland', 'Olins, Donald', 'Ishaque, Naveed']","['Antwi EB', 'Olins A', 'Teif VB', 'Bieg M', 'Bauer T', 'Gu Z', 'Brors B', 'Eils R', 'Olins D', 'Ishaque N']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5931-7534', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3606-4917', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4961-3639', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0034-4036', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8426-901X']","['Division of Theoretical Bioinformatics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular and Cellular Engineering, Signalling Research Centres BIOSS and CIBSS, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Biosciences International Graduate School (HBIGS), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of New England, Portland, ME, USA.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Essex, Colchester, UK.', 'Division of Theoretical Bioinformatics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Center for Personalized Oncology (DKFZ-HIPO), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health.', 'Digital Health Centre, Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Anna-Louisa-Karsch-Str. 2, 10178 Berlin, Germany.', 'Division of Theoretical Bioinformatics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Center for Personalized Oncology (DKFZ-HIPO), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Theoretical Bioinformatics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Center for Personalized Oncology (DKFZ-HIPO), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Applied Bioinformatics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Core Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Theoretical Bioinformatics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Center for Personalized Oncology (DKFZ-HIPO), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health.', 'Digital Health Centre, Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Anna-Louisa-Karsch-Str. 2, 10178 Berlin, Germany.', 'Translational Lung Research Center Heidelberg (TLRC), German Center for Lung Research (DZL), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of New England, Portland, ME, USA.', 'Division of Theoretical Bioinformatics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany naveed.ishaque@charite.de.', 'Heidelberg Center for Personalized Oncology (DKFZ-HIPO), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health.', 'Digital Health Centre, Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Anna-Louisa-Karsch-Str. 2, 10178 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200217,England,Biol Open,Biology open,101578018,,,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Epigenome', '*Epigenomics/methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA methylation', '*Differentiation', '*Epigenomic regulation', '*HL60', '*Long range interactions', '*Promyelocyte']",2020/01/29 06:00,2020/01/29 06:01,['2020/01/29 06:00'],"['2020/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/29 06:01 [medline]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['bio.044222 [pii]', '10.1242/bio.044222 [doi]']",epublish,Biol Open. 2020 Feb 17;9(2). pii: bio.044222. doi: 10.1242/bio.044222.,PMC7044446,['Competing interestsThe authors declare no competing or financial interests.'],,,['(c) 2020.

However, the role of miR-370-3p in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains unknown. Here, the expression level and molecular mechanism of miR-370-3p in CML were investigated. Firstly, the expression of miR-370-3p has markedly decreased in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with CML and in cell lines. Moreover, miR-370-3p in CML cells upregulated and downregulated proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. Notably, miR-370-3p directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region of PDZ and LIM domain protein 1 (PDLIM1). A negative correlation was observed between the levels of miR-370-3p and PDLIM1 in the PBMCs of patients with CML and healthy volunteers. PDLIM1 was shown to have an oncogenic role in CML cells by promoting proliferation and suppressing apoptosis. Finally, the miR-370-3p-PDLIM1-Wnt/beta-catenin signaling axis was indicated to play an important role in CML progression.","['Li, L M', 'Luo, F J', 'Song, X']","['Li LM', 'Luo FJ', 'Song X']",,"[""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Zhuji People's Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Shaoxing, China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Zhuji People's Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Shaoxing, China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Zhuji People's Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Shaoxing, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200127,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,IM,,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway']",,,2020/01/29 06:00,2020/09/10 06:00,['2020/01/29 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.4149/neo_2020_190612N506 [doi]', '190612N506 [pii]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 2020 May;67(3):509-518. doi: 10.4149/neo_2020_190612N506.

In the late 1960s, Soviet scientists inoculated 12 baboons with cells from hospitalized human leukemia patients, causing the death of a total of 135 animals between 1967 and 1978. The death rate from lymphoma averages almost 12 baboons per year in the Sukhumi colony. Genetic investigations of these baboons revealed the following: 1) Six blood protein markers out of 16 systems (38%) tested were polymorphic; 2) the average inbreeding coefficient for the entire colony (N = 1,226) was 0.027 (exclusion of baboons with F values equal to 0.0 raised the mean inbreeding coefficient to 0.096); 3) no relationship between inbreeding and risk of lymphoma was noted; and 4) there was an apparent association between both PGM loci and the incidence of lymphoma at the 0.005 levels of significance. This association was further supported by the significantly lower incidence of PGM2 (2-1) genotype in baboons with high anti-VCA-HVP titers.","['Crawford, Michael H', ""O'Rourke, Dennis H"", 'Dykes, Dale D', 'Yakovleva, L A', 'Voevodin, A F', 'Lapin, Boris', 'Polesky, H F']","['Crawford MH', ""O'Rourke DH"", 'Dykes DD', 'Yakovleva LA', 'Voevodin AF', 'Lapin B', 'Polesky HF']",,"['Department of Anthropology, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas.', 'Department of Anthropology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Minneapolis War Memorial Blood Bank, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Institute of Experimental Pathology and Therapy, USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, Sukhumi, USSR.', 'Institute of Experimental Pathology and Therapy, USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, Sukhumi, USSR.', 'Institute of Experimental Pathology and Therapy, USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, Sukhumi, USSR.', 'Minneapolis War Memorial Blood Bank, Minneapolis, Minnesota.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Primatol,American journal of primatology,8108949,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Papio hamadryas', 'baboon', 'genetic markers', 'inbreeding', 'lymphoma']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['2020/01/29 06:00'],"['1983/04/16 00:00 [received]', '1983/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajp.1350060303 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Primatol. 1984;6(3):143-153. doi: 10.1002/ajp.1350060303.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 1984 Wiley-Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TP53 gene product regulates cell growth, aging, and cancer. To determine the important targets of TP53 in PDAC, we examined the expression of 440 proteins on a reverse phase protein array (RPPA) in PDAC-derived MIA-PaCa-2 cells which either had WT-TP53 or lacked WT-TP53. MIA-PaCa-2 cells have a TP53 mutation as well as mutant KRAS and represent a good in vitro model to study PDAC. RPPA analysis demonstrated expression of tumor promoting proteins in cells that lacked WT-TP53; and this feature could be reversed significantly when the cells were transfected with vector encoding WT-TP53 or treated with berberine or a modified berberine (BBR). Expression of miR-34a-associated signaling was elevated in cells expressing WT-TP53 compared to cells expressing mTP53. Results from in vivo studies using human PDAC specimens confirmed the in vitro results as the expression of miR-34a and associated signaling was significantly decreased in PDAC specimens compared to non-cancerous tissues. This study determined SERPINE1 as a miR-34a target with relevance to the biology of PDAC. Thus, we have identified a key target (SERPINE1) of the TP53/miR-34a axis that may serve as a potential biomarker for early detection of pancreatic cancer.","['Akula, Shaw M', 'Ruvolo, Peter P', 'McCubrey, James A']","['Akula SM', 'Ruvolo PP', 'McCubrey JA']",,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27834,USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27834,USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200127,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Berberine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Aging', '*PDAC', '*SERPINE1', '*TP53', '*cancer', '*miR-34a']",2020/01/28 06:00,2021/01/23 06:00,['2020/01/28 06:00'],"['2019/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.18632/aging.102776 [doi]', '102776 [pii]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2020 Jan 27;12(3):2777-2797. doi: 10.18632/aging.102776.

FTY720 (Gilenya), an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, has recently been shown to inhibit cancer progression through the down-regulation of essential nutrient transport proteins, selectively starving cancer cells to death. However, the clinical use of FTY720 for cancer therapy is prohibited because of its capability of inducing immunosuppression (lymphopenia) and bradycardia when phosphorylated upon administration. A prodrug to specifically prevent phosphorylation during circulation, hence avoiding bradycardia and lymphopenia, was synthesized by capping its hydroxyl groups with polyethylene glycol (PEG) via an acid-cleavable ketal linkage. Improved aqueous solubility was also accomplished by PEGylation. The prodrug reduces to fully potent FTY720 upon cellular uptake and induces metabolic stress in cancer cells. Enhanced release of FTY720 at a mildly acidic endosomal pH and the ability to substantially down-regulate cell-surface nutrient transporter proteins in leukemia cells only by an acid-cleaved drug were confirmed. Importantly, the prodrug demonstrated nearly identical efficacy to FTY720 in an animal model of BCR-Abl-driven leukemia without inducing bradycardia or lymphopenia in vivo, highlighting its potential clinical value. The prodrug formulation of FTY720 demonstrates the utility of precisely engineering a drug to avoid undesirable effects by tackling specific molecular mechanisms as well as a financially favorable alternative to new drug development. A multitude of existing cancer therapeutics may be explored for prodrug formulation to avoid specific side effects and preserve or enhance therapeutic efficacy.","['Kemp, Jessica A', 'Keebaugh, Andrew', 'Edson, Julius A', 'Chow, David', 'Kleinman, Michael T', 'Chew, Yap Ching', 'McCracken, Alison N', 'Edinger, Aimee L', 'Kwon, Young Jik']","['Kemp JA', 'Keebaugh A', 'Edson JA', 'Chow D', 'Kleinman MT', 'Chew YC', 'McCracken AN', 'Edinger AL', 'Kwon YJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4086-6995'],"['Zymo Research Corporation, Irvine, California 92604, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200127,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,IM,,"['Acetals/chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Biocompatible Materials/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*chemistry']",,,2020/01/28 06:00,2021/02/12 06:00,['2020/01/28 06:00'],"['2020/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.9b00822 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2020 Mar 18;31(3):673-684. doi: 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.9b00822.

Recent studies suggest that genetic and phenotypic alterations in the BM microenvironment support leukemogenesis and allow leukemic cells to survive and evade chemotherapy-induced death. However, despite substantial evidence indicating the role of tumor-host interactions in AML pathogenesis, little is known about the complex microenvironment of the BM. To address this, we performed novel proteomic profiling of the noncellular compartment of the BM microenvironment in patients with AML (n = 10) and age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects (n = 10) using an aptamer-based, highly multiplexed, affinity proteomics platform (SOMAscan). We show that proteomic assessment of blood or RNA-sequencing of BM are suboptimal alternate screening strategies to determine the true proteomic composition of the extracellular soluble compartment of AML patient BM. Proteomic analysis revealed that 168 proteins significantly differed in abundance, with 91 upregulated and 77 downregulated in leukemic BM. A highly connected signaling network of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-8, was found to be the most prominent proteomic signature associated with AML in the BM microenvironment. We report the first description of significantly elevated levels of the myelosuppressive chemokine CCL23 (myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor-1) in both AML and myelodysplastic syndrome patients and perform functional experiments supportive of a role in the suppression of normal hematopoiesis. This unique paired RNA-sequencing and proteomics data set provides innovative mechanistic insights into AML and healthy aging and should serve as a useful public resource.","['Celik, Haydar', 'Lindblad, Katherine E', 'Popescu, Bogdan', 'Gui, Gege', 'Goswami, Meghali', 'Valdez, Janet', 'DeStefano, Christin', 'Lai, Catherine', 'Thompson, Julie', 'Ghannam, Jack Y', 'Fantoni, Giovanna', 'Biancotto, Angelique', 'Candia, Julian', 'Cheung, Foo', 'Sukumar, Gauthaman', 'Dalgard, Clifton L', 'Smith, Richard H', 'Larochelle, Andre', 'Dillon, Laura W', 'Hourigan, Christopher S']","['Celik H', 'Lindblad KE', 'Popescu B', 'Gui G', 'Goswami M', 'Valdez J', 'DeStefano C', 'Lai C', 'Thompson J', 'Ghannam JY', 'Fantoni G', 'Biancotto A', 'Candia J', 'Cheung F', 'Sukumar G', 'Dalgard CL', 'Smith RH', 'Larochelle A', 'Dillon LW', 'Hourigan CS']",,"['Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and.', 'Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity and Inflammation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity and Inflammation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity and Inflammation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity and Inflammation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Collaborative Health Initiative Research Program.', 'Collaborative Health Initiative Research Program.', 'Department of Anatomy, Physiology, and Genetics, and.', 'The American Genome Center, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'Laboratory of Regenerative Therapies for Inherited Blood Disorders, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Regenerative Therapies for Inherited Blood Disorders, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cellular Microenvironment', 'Chemokines/analysis', 'Chemokines, CC/metabolism', 'Cytokines/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Proteomics/*methods']",,,2020/01/28 06:00,2020/07/21 06:00,['2020/01/28 06:00'],"['2019/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31666-9 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001124 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Jan 28;4(2):367-379. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001124.,PMC6988405,,['ZIA HL006163/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (CCL23 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL8 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, more than half ultimately experience disease relapse that is associated with a dismal median survival of just 6 months, highlighting the need for novel therapies. In the current study we explore the therapeutic potential of targeting cyclin A1 (CCNA1), a cancer-testis antigen that is overexpressed in malignant blasts and leukemic stem cells. We demonstrate the immunogenicity of this antigen to native T cells, with >90% of donors screened mounting a specific response. The expanded cells were Th1 polarized, polyfunctional, and cytotoxic toward CCNA1+/HLA-matched tumor cell lines. Furthermore, these cells were exquisitely specific for CCNA1 and exhibited no reactivity against other cyclin family members, including CCNA2, which shares 56% homology with CCNA1 and is ubiquitously expressed in dividing cells. Lastly, the detection of CCNA1-specific T cells in AML patients post-HSCT was associated with prolonged disease remission, suggesting the protective potential of such endogenous cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of targeting CCNA1 and the potential for therapeutic benefit associated with the adoptive transfer of reactive cells.","['Leung, Wingchi K', 'Workineh, Aster', 'Mukhi, Shivani', 'Tzannou, Ifigeneia', 'Brenner, Daniel', 'Watanabe, Norihiro', 'Leen, Ann M', 'Lulla, Premal']","['Leung WK', 'Workineh A', 'Mukhi S', 'Tzannou I', 'Brenner D', 'Watanabe N', 'Leen AM', 'Lulla P']",,"[""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital and Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX."", ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital and Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX."", ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital and Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX."", ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital and Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX."", ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital and Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX."", ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital and Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX."", ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital and Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX."", ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital and Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX.""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin A1/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Th1 Cells', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2020/01/28 06:00,2020/07/21 06:00,['2020/01/28 06:00'],"['2019/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31668-2 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000715 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Jan 28;4(2):387-397. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000715.,PMC6988407,,['P50 CA126752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (CCNA1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin A1)']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To counter this, BH3-mimetic drugs that target and inhibit select BCL-2 prosurvival proteins to induce apoptosis have been developed for cancer therapy. Venetoclax, which targets BCL-2, has been effective as therapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and MCL-1-targeting BH3-mimetic drugs have been extensively evaluated in preclinical studies for a range of blood cancers. Recently, BCL-W, a relatively understudied prosurvival member of the BCL-2 protein family, has been reported to be abnormally upregulated in Burkitt lymphoma (BL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and Hodgkin lymphoma patient samples. Therefore, to determine if BCL-W would be a promising therapeutic target for B-cell lymphomas, we have examined the role of BCL-W in the sustained growth of human BL- and DLBCL-derived cell lines. We found that CRISPR/CAS9-mediated loss or short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of BCL-W expression in selected BL and DLBCL cell lines did not lead to spontaneous apoptosis and had no effect on their sensitivity to a range of BH3-mimetic drugs targeting other BCL-2 prosurvival proteins. Our results suggest that BCL-W is not universally required for the sustained growth and survival of human BL and DLBCL cell lines. Thus, targeting BCL-W in this subset of B-cell lymphomas may not be of broad therapeutic benefit.","['Diepstraten, Sarah T', 'Chang, Catherine', 'Tai, Lin', 'Gong, Jia-Nan', 'Lan, Ping', 'Dowell, Alexander C', 'Taylor, Graham S', 'Strasser, Andreas', 'Kelly, Gemma L']","['Diepstraten ST', 'Chang C', 'Tai L', 'Gong JN', 'Lan P', 'Dowell AC', 'Taylor GS', 'Strasser A', 'Kelly GL']",,"['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Institute for Advanced and Applied Chemical Synthesis, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China; and.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism/pharmacology']",,,2020/01/28 06:00,2020/07/21 06:00,['2020/01/28 06:00'],"['2019/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31665-7 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000541 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Jan 28;4(2):356-366. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000541.,PMC6988404,,,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its pathogenesis comprises subversion of transcriptional regulation, through mutation and by hijacking normal chromatin regulation. Kat2a is a histone acetyltransferase central to promoter activity, that we recently associated with stability of pluripotency networks, and identified as a genetic vulnerability in AML. Through combined chromatin profiling and single-cell transcriptomics of a conditional knockout mouse, we demonstrate that Kat2a contributes to leukemia propagation through preservation of leukemia stem-like cells. Kat2a loss impacts transcription factor binding and reduces transcriptional burst frequency in a subset of gene promoters, generating enhanced variability of transcript levels. Destabilization of target programs shifts leukemia cell fate out of self-renewal into differentiation. We propose that control of transcriptional variability is central to leukemia stem-like cell propagation, and establish a paradigm exploitable in different tumors and distinct stages of cancer evolution.","['Domingues, Ana Filipa', 'Kulkarni, Rashmi', 'Giotopoulos, George', 'Gupta, Shikha', 'Vinnenberg, Laura', 'Arede, Liliana', 'Foerner, Elena', 'Khalili, Mitra', 'Adao, Rita Romano', 'Johns, Ayona', 'Tan, Shengjiang', 'Zeka, Keti', 'Huntly, Brian J', 'Prabakaran, Sudhakaran', 'Pina, Cristina']","['Domingues AF', 'Kulkarni R', 'Giotopoulos G', 'Gupta S', 'Vinnenberg L', 'Arede L', 'Foerner E', 'Khalili M', 'Adao RR', 'Johns A', 'Tan S', 'Zeka K', 'Huntly BJ', 'Prabakaran S', 'Pina C']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2575-6301'],"['Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, NHS-BT Blood Donor Centre, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, NHS-BT Blood Donor Centre, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, NHS-BT Blood Donor Centre, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, NHS-BT Blood Donor Centre, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, NHS-BT Blood Donor Centre, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, NHS-BT Blood Donor Centre, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, NHS-BT Blood Donor Centre, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences (ZUMS), Zanjan, Islamic Republic of Iran.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, NHS-BT Blood Donor Centre, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Biosciences, College of Health and Life Sciences, Brunel University London, Uxbridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, NHS-BT Blood Donor Centre, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Biology, IISER, Pune, India.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Biosciences, College of Health and Life Sciences, Brunel University London, Uxbridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200127,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,IM,,"['Animals', 'Chromatin/genetics', '*Histone Acetyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Transcriptome/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Kat2a', '*Single-cell RNA seq', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*cancer biology', '*chromosomes', '*epigenetics', '*gene expression', '*mouse', '*transcriptional bursting', '*transcriptional heterogeneity']",2020/01/28 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2020/01/28 06:00'],"['2019/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.7554/eLife.51754 [doi]', '51754 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2020 Jan 27;9. pii: 51754. doi: 10.7554/eLife.51754.,PMC7039681,"['AD, RK, GG, SG, LV, LA, EF, MK, RA, AJ, ST, KZ, BH, SP, CP No competing interests', 'declared']","['MC_PC_17230/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'KKL888/Kay Kendall Leukaemia Fund', '800274/European Commission', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '800274/H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions', 'MR/R009708/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['0 (Chromatin)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT2A protein, human)']","['(c) 2020, Domingues et al.']",['GEO/GSE118769'],,,,,,,,,"['Less than 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia - an aggressive cancer of', 'the white blood cells - survive five years post-diagnosis.

Ex. Colebr. (Burseraceae) extract (ETOH and DCM) contain biologically active compounds that are well known for having inflammation inhibitory properties. In this work, the purified fractions were tested in-vitro for LTC4, LTA4 and COX-2 activities using ELISA and qPCR was performed to determine gene regulation in human leukemia (HL-60) Cells. Two D-imaging tomography was performed to determine the anti-inflammatory activities of the fractions in BALB/c mouse model of lung inflammation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate anti-inflammatory activities of bioactive compounds of Boswellia serrata purified fractions. METHODS: In-vitro MTT assay was performed in HL-60 cell lines for measuring the toxicity/ viability of the cells. ELISA tests were performed for evaluating LTA4, LTC4 and COX-2 activities. qPCR was performed to evaluate the expression of mRNA in HL-60 cells. In-vivo experiments were performed in OVA sensitized and challenged BALB/c mice at two doses of Boswellia serrata purified fraction containing 6% Boswellic acid of 50 and 100mg/kg body weight were given orally and the standard drug dexamethasone (DXA, 4 mg/kg body weight) and reduction in lung inflammation was assessed by using an IVIS Xenogen in-vivo fluorescence imaging system. RESULTS: A purified fraction of Boswellia serrata ETOH extracts reduced leukotriene-C4-synthase activity by 52%, leuktotriene-A4-hydrolase activity by 22% and COX-2 activity by 99% with an IC50 of 12.5mug/ml. Intragastric administration of the purified fraction of Boswellia serrata at two doses of 50mg/kg b.w. and 100mg/kg b.w., respectively along with 2-3% HPMC resulted in a ~51% (P value <0.01) reduction in OVA induced lung inflammation in BALB/c mice as observed by imaging tomography. Treatment of the OVA challenged mice with standard drug dexamethasone (DXA) reduced inflammation by ~66% with significant value (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: The present study describes that Boswellia serrata ethanolic extracts purified fraction (ETOH-BS) possess significant anti-inflammatory activities in HL-60 and in BALB/c and further supports for its use as Ayurvedic medicines traditionally in the treatment of lung disorders including allergy and asthma.","['Soni, Kapil K', 'Meshram, Deepak', 'Lawal, Temitope O', 'Patel, Udeshi', 'Mahady, Gail B']","['Soni KK', 'Meshram D', 'Lawal TO', 'Patel U', 'Mahady GB']",,"['Clinical Pharmacognosy Lab., Department of Pharmacy Practice, WHO/PAHO Collaborating Centre for Traditional Medicine, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago, IL 60612, United States.', 'Pharmacogenomics Lab., Department of Biosciences, Barkatullah University, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh 462026, India.', 'Clinical Pharmacognosy Lab., Department of Pharmacy Practice, WHO/PAHO Collaborating Centre for Traditional Medicine, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago, IL 60612, United States.', 'Clinical Pharmacognosy Lab., Department of Pharmacy Practice, WHO/PAHO Collaborating Centre for Traditional Medicine, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago, IL 60612, United States.', 'Clinical Pharmacognosy Lab., Department of Pharmacy Practice, WHO/PAHO Collaborating Centre for Traditional Medicine, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago, IL 60612, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Discov Technol,Current drug discovery technologies,101157212,IM,,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', '*Boswellia', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*metabolism', 'Epoxide Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glutathione Transferase/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phytochemicals/*pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', '*Pneumonia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Ayurveda', '*allergy', '*anti-inflammatory', '*asthma', '*bioactive compounds', '*inflammation', '*leukotrienes', '*secondary metabolites', '*tomography']",2020/01/28 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/01/28 06:00'],"['2019/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['CDDT-EPUB-103919 [pii]', '10.2174/1570163817666200127112928 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Discov Technol. 2021;18(1):95-104. doi: 10.2174/1570163817666200127112928.,,,,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Phytochemicals)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.3.2.- (Epoxide Hydrolases)', 'EC 4.4.1.20 (leukotriene-C4 synthase)', 'V38765PUZ6 (leukotriene A4 hydrolase)']","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed in Medline/Embase (since 2000) and ClinicalTrials.gov (since 2013) to identify PROMs used in MDS and AML clinical studies. Additionally, PROMs included in approved drug labels since 2000 were reviewed. RESULTS: Overall, 112 different PROMs were used in 168 published MDS studies and 152 PROMs were used in 172 AML studies. From ClinicalTrials.gov, 16 different PROMs were used in 22 ongoing registered studies in MDS, and 24 were reported in 41 AML studies. The most frequently used PROMs were cancer-specific (eg, EORTC QLQ-C30, FACT-An) or generic (SF-36, EQ-5D) instruments, whereas MDS- and AML-specific instruments (eg, QUALMS and QOL-E in MDS; FACT-Leu and EORTC QLQ-Leu in AML) were used in a minority of studies. Two EMA-approved drugs for MDS included PROMs in their label. EORTC QLQ-C30 is by far the most frequently used cancer-specific PROM in both MDS and AML studies. CONCLUSIONS: This research indicated an underuse of AML/MDS-specific PROMs for these two indications in clinical studies and labeling claims. However, AML/MDS-specific instruments in development might be considered in future studies.","['Stauder, Reinhard', 'Lambert, Jeremy', 'Desruol-Allardin, Sandra', 'Savre, Isabelle', 'Gaugler, Lona', 'Stojkov, Igor', 'Siebert, Uwe', 'Chevrou-Severac, Helene']","['Stauder R', 'Lambert J', 'Desruol-Allardin S', 'Savre I', 'Gaugler L', 'Stojkov I', 'Siebert U', 'Chevrou-Severac H']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8993-9561'],"['Department of Internal Medicine V (Haematology and Oncology), Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Patient-Centered Outcomes, ICON plc, Lyon, France.', 'Mapi Research Trust, Lyon, France.', 'Mapi Research Trust, Lyon, France.', 'Celgene, A Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Boudry, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Public Health, Medical Decision Making and Health Technology Assessment, Department of Public Health, Health Services Research and Health Technology Assessment, UMIT-University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology, Hall in Tirol, Austria.', 'Institute of Public Health, Medical Decision Making and Health Technology Assessment, Department of Public Health, Health Services Research and Health Technology Assessment, UMIT-University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology, Hall in Tirol, Austria.', 'Division of Public Health Decision Modelling, Health Technology Assessment and Health Economics, ONCOTYROL-Center for Personalized Cancer Medicine, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Center for Health Decision Science, Department of Health Policy and Management, Harvard T.H.

The availability of large amounts of biomedical data, characterized by large feature sets and sparse content, motivates the development of new methods to compute patient similarities able to fuse heterogeneous data sources with the available knowledge. Materials and Methods: In this work, we developed a data integration approach based on matrix trifactorization to compute patient similarities by integrating several sources of data and knowledge. We assess the accuracy of the proposed method: (1) on several synthetic data sets which similarity structures are affected by increasing levels of noise and data sparsity, and (2) on a real data set coming from an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) study. The results obtained are finally compared with the ones of traditional similarity calculation methods. Results: In the analysis of the synthetic data set, where the ground truth is known, we measured the capability of reconstructing the correct clusters, while in the AML study we evaluated the Kaplan-Meier curves obtained with the different clusters and measured their statistical difference by means of the log-rank test. In presence of noise and sparse data, our data integration method outperform other techniques, both in the synthetic and in the AML data. Discussion: In case of multiple heterogeneous data sources, a matrix trifactorization technique can successfully fuse all the information in a joint model. We demonstrated how this approach can be efficiently applied to discover meaningful patient similarities and therefore may be considered a reliable data driven strategy for the definition of new research hypothesis for precision oncology. Conclusion: The better performance of the proposed approach presents an advantage over previous methods to provide accurate patient similarities supporting precision medicine.","['Vitali, F', 'Marini, S', 'Pala, D', 'Demartini, A', 'Montoli, S', 'Zambelli, A', 'Bellazzi, R']","['Vitali F', 'Marini S', 'Pala D', 'Demartini A', 'Montoli S', 'Zambelli A', 'Bellazzi R']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2916-6402'],"['Center for Biomedical Informatics and Biostatistics, The University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.', 'BIO5 Institute, The University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Pavia, PV, Italy.', 'Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Pavia, PV, Italy.', 'Centre for Health Technologies, University of Pavia, PV, Italy.', 'Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Pavia, PV, Italy.', 'Centre for Health Technologies, University of Pavia, PV, Italy.', 'Oncology Unit, ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, BG, Italy.', 'Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Pavia, PV, Italy.', 'Centre for Health Technologies, University of Pavia, PV, Italy.', 'IRCCS Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri, Pavia, PV, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180514,United States,JAMIA Open,JAMIA open,101730643,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'data integration', 'matrix trifactorization', 'patient similarity', 'precision medicine']",2018/05/14 00:00,2018/05/14 00:01,['2020/01/28 06:00'],"['2017/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/14 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/jamiaopen/ooy008 [doi]', 'ooy008 [pii]']",epublish,JAMIA Open. 2018 May 14;1(1):75-86. doi: 10.1093/jamiaopen/ooy008. eCollection 2018 Jul.,PMC6951984,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2018.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of ferulic acid on HeLa and Caski human cervical carcinoma cells and the molecular mechanisms involved. MATERIAL AND METHODS HeLa and Caski human cervical carcinoma cells were grown in culture and treated with increasing doses of ferulic acid. The MTT assay was used to evaluate cell viability. Flow cytometry was performed with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and Annexin V staining for cell apoptosis. The expression of myeloid leukemia cell differentiation-1 (Mcl-1) protein and MCL-1 mRNA were determined by Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS Ferulic acid significantly reduced HeLa and Caski cell viability in the concentration range of 4-20 microM (P<0.05). Ferulic acid treatment promoted DNA condensation and significantly increased apoptosis in Caski cells (P<0.05). Ferulic acid treatment resulted in the activation of pro-caspase-3, pro-caspase-8, pro-caspase-9, and PARP. The MTT assay showed that ferulic acid did not reduce the viability of Caski cells treated with the caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk. Ferulic acid reduced the levels of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, and increased the levels of Bax and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In Caski cells, Akt and PI3K phosphorylation were reduced by ferulic acid in a concentration-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS The effects of ferulic acid were dose-dependent and resulted in cell cytotoxicity and apoptosis of HeLa and Caski cells, and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was down-regulated in Caski cells.","['Luo, Liping', 'Zhu, Sihong', 'Tong, Yan', 'Peng, Shiwei']","['Luo L', 'Zhu S', 'Tong Y', 'Peng S']",,"['Department of Obstetrics, Jiangxi Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China (mainland).', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Jiangxi Health Vocational College, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China (mainland).', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China (mainland).', ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Jiangxi Provincial People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China (mainland).""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200127,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Coumaric Acids/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', '*Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*pathology']",,,2020/01/28 06:00,2020/11/04 06:00,['2020/01/28 06:00'],"['2020/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['920095 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.920095 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2020 Jan 27;26:e920095. doi: 10.12659/MSM.920095.,PMC7003662,,,"['0 (Coumaric Acids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'AVM951ZWST (ferulic acid)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study, which included 164 Yemeni patients, was performed. Data regarding the disease characteristics, adherence to treatment (the medication possession ratio) and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 60 months and a median duration of imatinib treatment of 46 months, 79 (48.2%) patients were adherent to treatment. In adherent patients, the overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) were 78 (98.7%) and 73 patients (92.4%), respectively and major molecular response (MMR) rates at 12 months and at 46 months were 32 (41.0%) and 45 patients (57.0%), respectively, compared with 67 (78.8%), 51 (60%), 5 (6.9%), and 2 patients (2.4%), respectively, in nonadherent patients (P < .001 for all parameters). Nonadherence to imatinib treatment and duration of hydroxyurea treatment of more than 12 months before starting imatinib were found to adversely affect PFS in univariate (hazard ratio [HR], 7.5 and 9.7, respectively and P < .001 for both) and multivariate (HR, 5.6 and 9.3; P = .001 and P < .001, respectively) analysis. High risk Sokal score was found to adversely affect PFS in univariate analysis (HR of high to low risk, 2.8; P < .022) but not in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Yemeni patients who were adherent to imatinib therapy achieved response rates similar to that of international standards. Nonadherence to imatinib treatment and previous duration of hydroxyurea treatment for more than 12 months, as a proxy of long interval between diagnosis and starting imatinib treatment, reduced the optimal response to imatinib therapy.","['Al-Ghazaly, Jameel', 'Al-Dubai, Waled', 'Noaman, Yousr', 'Abdullah, Munasser', 'Al-Gharasi, Leila', 'Rosti, Gianantonio']","['Al-Ghazaly J', 'Al-Dubai W', 'Noaman Y', 'Abdullah M', 'Al-Gharasi L', 'Rosti G']",,"[""Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Sana'a University, Sana'a, Yemen; Hematology unit, Al-Jomhori Teaching Hospital, Sana'a, Yemen.

MicroRNAs regulate various normal processes; however, they are aberrantly regulated in many cancers. They control the expression of various genes, including cancer-related genes. This causes microRNAs to be considered as a good target for further investigations for designing novel therapeutic strategies. Since miR124 is known for some time already, it has a tumor-suppressing role in various cancers. Numerous studies indicate its definite roles in malignant processes such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cell cycle arrest, metastasis, cancer stem cell formation and induction of apoptosis. However, some studies have indicated a dual role for miR-124 in oncogenic processes like autophagy and multi-drug resistance. In this article, we will review recent researches on the biological functions and clinical implications of miR-124. Subsequently, we will discuss future perspectives in terms of the roles of this miRNA in cancers.","['Moghadasi, Maryam', 'Alivand, Mohammadreza', 'Fardi, Masoumeh', 'Moghadam, Kobra Shojaei', 'Solali, Saeed']","['Moghadasi M', 'Alivand M', 'Fardi M', 'Moghadam KS', 'Solali S']",,"['Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran; Immunology Research Center (IRC), Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center (IRC), Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center (IRC), Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran; Division of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.

Most hematologists tend to avoid aggressive treatment leaving patients with a choice of best supportive care. We hypothesized that metronomic chemotherapy could be an alternative treatment for unfit AML patients. METHODS: A multi-center randomized controlled trial was conducted in seven university-affiliated hospitals in Thailand. Unfit AML patients were recruited and followed up from December 2014 to December 2017. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either metronomic chemotherapy or palliative hydroxyurea. Overall survival rates were compared using Cox's proportional hazard survival analysis. RESULTS: A total of 81 eligible patients were randomly allocated and included for ITT analysis. The OS rate was higher in group receiving metronomic chemotherapy than in group receiving palliative treatment at 6 and 12 months with borderline significance (6 months HR 0.60; 95%CI 0.36, 1.02; p-value 0.060; 12 months: HR 0.66; 95%CI 0.41, 1.08; p-value 0.097). CONCLUSION: Metronomic chemotherapy could prolong survival time of unfit AML patients, especially in the first 12 months after diagnosis without increasing treatment-associated adverse events.","['Pongudom, Saranya', 'Phinyo, Phichayut', 'Chinthammitr, Yingyong', 'Charoenprasert, Kanyaporn', 'Kasyanan, Harutaya', 'Wongyai, Klaijith', 'Purattanamal, Jittiporn', 'Panoi, Naiyana', 'Surawong, Anoree']","['Pongudom S', 'Phinyo P', 'Chinthammitr Y', 'Charoenprasert K', 'Kasyanan H', 'Wongyai K', 'Purattanamal J', 'Panoi N', 'Surawong A']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1441-6739'],"['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Udon Thani Hospital, Udon Thani, Thailand.', 'Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Clinical Statistics, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Si Sa Ket Hospital, Si Sa Ket, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Buddhachinaraj, Hospital, Phitsanulok,Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Sawanpracharak Hospital, Nakhon Sawan,Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Maharaj Nakhon Si Thammarat Hospital, Nakhon Si Thammarat,Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chonburi Hospital, Chon Buri, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Sanprasithiprasong Hospital, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20200101,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['Elderly', 'Hydroxyurea', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'metronomic chemotherapy']",2020/01/28 06:00,2020/09/26 06:00,['2020/01/28 06:00'],"['2019/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.1.147 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Jan 1;21(1):147-155. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.1.147.,PMC7294042,,,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) have been widely used in GVHD prophylaxis, the incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) remains at roughly 30% to 50%. Moreover, some allo-SCT recipients cannot tolerate CNI. Thus, improved GVHD prevention methods are needed. Our study aimed to determine the prophylactic value of ruxolitinib for GVHD in CNI-intolerant patients after allo-SCT. Between September 2017 and March 2019, 10 patients with hematopoietic malignancies after allo-SCT who were intolerant to CNI at our center were enrolled in this study. The regimens were based on a myeloablative busulfan and cyclophosphamide regimen. Antithymocyte globulin was administered to patients with an HLA-haploidentical related donor (HRD) at a dosage of 6 mg/kg. All received ruxolitinib to replace CNI as GVHD prophylaxis. Ruxolitinib was initiated at 5 to 10 mg twice daily until 2 to 3 months post-transplantation and then tapered gradually, and in the absence of GVHD, discontinued by day +180. Eight patients had acute leukemia, 1 patient had myeloproliferative neoplasm, and 1 patient had natural killer T cell (NK/T) lymphoma. The donor type was a matched sibling donor in 3 patients and an HLA-haploidentical related donor (HRD) in 7 patients. All patients received CNI plus short-course of methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis, but showed intolerance to CNI within 45 days post-transplantation. After ruxolitinib replacement, only 1 patient (10%) developed grade II skin aGVHD within 100 days, and only 1 patient developed severe aGVHD after 100 days. Two patients developed moderate/severe chronic GVHD (cGVHD) after tapering or stopping ruxolitinib, resulting in a 1-year cumulative incidence of moderate/severe cGVHD of 21.4%. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation occurred in 4 patients (40%), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation occurred in 3 patients (30%). None of the patients developed CMV disease or EBV post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder. After a median follow-up of 11 months (range, 2 to 15.5 months), 2 patients (20%) relapsed and 7 (70%) were alive, of whom 6 (60%) were negative for minimal residual disease and 4 were off immunosuppressant therapy. The prophylactic application of ruxolitinib for CNI-intolerant patients after allo-SCT appears to be safe and effective in preventing GVHD, but this awaits further study in larger cohorts.","['Zhao, Yanmin', 'Shi, Jimin', 'Luo, Yi', 'Gao, Fei', 'Tan, Yamin', 'Lai, Xiaoyu', 'Yu, Jian', 'Wei, Guoqing', 'Huang, He']","['Zhao Y', 'Shi J', 'Luo Y', 'Gao F', 'Tan Y', 'Lai X', 'Yu J', 'Wei G', 'Huang H']",,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.

Several pan-RSK inhibitors have been identified with BI-D1870 and the pseudo-analogs LJH685 and LJI308 being the most selective, potent, and frequently used small molecule inhibitors. We designed and synthesized a series of pteridinones and pyrimidines to evaluate the structural features of BI-D1870 that are required for RSK2 inhibition. We have identified inhibitors of RSK2 activity, evaluated their target engagement in cells, and measured their effect on cell viability and cytotoxicity in the MOLM-13 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line. The results of our studies support that RSK2 inhibition can be achieved in MOLM-13 cells without potent cytotoxicity. The structure-activity data from this study will be used as a platform to develop novel RSK2 inhibitors.","['Casalvieri, Kimberly A', 'Matheson, Christopher J', 'Backos, Donald S', 'Reigan, Philip']","['Casalvieri KA', 'Matheson CJ', 'Backos DS', 'Reigan P']",,"['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, 12850 East Montview Boulevard, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, 12850 East Montview Boulevard, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, 12850 East Montview Boulevard, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, 12850 East Montview Boulevard, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.

METHODS: A discrete-choice experiment elicited preferences of women with ovarian cancer regarding 6 attributes (levels in parentheses) relevant to decisions for MT versus treatment break: (1) overall survival (OS; 36, 38, 42 months); (2) progression-free survival (PFS; 15, 17, 21 months); (3) nausea (none, mild, moderate); (4) fatigue (none, mild, moderate); (5) probability of death from myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelogenous leukemia (MDS/AML; 0% to 10%); (6) monthly out-of-pocket cost ($0 to $1000). Participants chose between 2 variable MT scenarios and a static scenario representing treatment break, with multiple iterations. Random-parameters logit regression was applied to model choices as a function of attribute levels. RESULTS: 95 eligible participants completed the survey; mean age was 62, 48% had recurrence, and 17% were ever-PARP inhibitor users. Participants valued OS (average importance weight 24.5 out of 100) and monthly costs (24.6) most highly, followed by risk of death from MDS/AML (17.9), nausea (14.7), PFS (10.5) and fatigue (7.8). Participants would accept 5% risk of MDS/AML if treatment provided 2.2 months additional OS or 4.8 months PFS. Participants would require gains of 2.6 months PFS to accept mild treatment-related fatigue and 4.4 months to accept mild nausea. CONCLUSIONS: When considering MT, women with ovarian cancer are most motivated by gains in OS. Women expect at least 3-4 months of PFS benefit to bear mild side effects of treatment.","['Havrilesky, Laura J', 'Lim, Stephanie', 'Ehrisman, Jessie A', 'Lorenzo, Amelia', 'Alvarez Secord, Angeles', 'Yang, Jui-Chen', 'Johnson, F Reed', 'Gonzalez, Juan Marcos', 'Reed, Shelby D']","['Havrilesky LJ', 'Lim S', 'Ehrisman JA', 'Lorenzo A', 'Alvarez Secord A', 'Yang JC', 'Johnson FR', 'Gonzalez JM', 'Reed SD']",,"['Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States of America; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States of America; Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States of America.

Little is known about its incidence, survival and optimal management in the recent time period. Based on a case observed in our clinic, we queried the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 2000 and 2016. A total of 1,888 cases of AUL were diagnosed (1.34 per million person-years). The incidence of AUL has significantly decreased over time. Compared to other acute leukemias, patients with AUL have the highest median age (74 years); in contrast to acute myeloid leukemia (AML, 65) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, 12). Excluding patients with preexisting malignancies, 1,444 patients with AUL were analyzed for survival. Only 35% of AUL patients had received chemotherapy. Comparatively, 94% of ALL and 71% of AML cases received chemotherapy. Among AUL patients who received chemotherapy, the median survival was 12 months as opposed to 1 month in the group who did not receive chemotherapy (or unknown status). Among adults, AUL patients had the worst prognosis, with a median overall survival (OS) of 9 months, compared to 27 months in ALL and 13 months in AML. Among children, the median OS was superior for all three groups of leukemias, the OS of AUL patients being better than in AML and very similar to ALL. On multivariate analysis, older age and time period were associated with worse outcome. We describe here the largest series of cases with AUL published to date.","['Qasrawi, Ayman', 'Gomes, Victor', 'Chacko, Charles Andrew', 'Mansour, Akila', 'Kesler, Melissa', 'Arora, Ranjana', 'Wei, Sainan', 'Ramlal, Reshma', 'Munker, Reinhold']","['Qasrawi A', 'Gomes V', 'Chacko CA', 'Mansour A', 'Kesler M', 'Arora R', 'Wei S', 'Ramlal R', 'Munker R']",,"['Department of Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.

Besides, ASCs are known to support ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Ex vivo expansion enables to amplify significantly the number of HSPCs of different commitment. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) from cord blood (cb) contain HSPCs and are easily assessed. The rarity of those HSPCs is a serious limitation of its application in cell therapy. Here we expanded cbMNCs in stroma-dependent setting to generate heterocellular associates consisting of ASCs and undifferentiated and low committed hematopoietic cbHSPCs. A part of cbHSPCs in associates demonstrated a primitive phenotype confirmed by formation of ""cobblestone areas"". ASCs associated with cbHSPCs demonstrated up-regulation of immunosuppressive indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cyclooxygenase-2 (PTGS2) genes. ASC-cbHSPCs as well as ASCs provoked the suppression of HLA-DR activation and apoptosis of mitogen-stimulated T cells. VEGF transcription and secretion were elevated providing stimulation of blood vessel formation in ovo. Thus, ASCs retain immunosuppressive and proangiogenic capacities evidencing ""third party"" potential along with the effective support of ex vivo expansion of cbHSPCs. Above functions expand the relevance of ASCs for needs of regenerative medicine.","['Andreeva, Elena', 'Andrianova, Irina', 'Bobyleva, Polina', 'Gornostaeva, Aleksandra', 'Ezdakova, Maria', 'Golikova, Ekaterina', 'Buravkova, Ludmila']","['Andreeva E', 'Andrianova I', 'Bobyleva P', 'Gornostaeva A', 'Ezdakova M', 'Golikova E', 'Buravkova L']",,"['Cell Physiology Laboratory, Institute of Biomedical Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences, Khoroshevskoye Shosse, 76a, 123007 Moscow, Russia.

Its Fc domain was silenced by introduction of mutations L234F L235E D265A. METHODS: T-cell activation and T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity were measured by flow cytometry following co-culture with tumour cells. Anti-tumour activity of DuoBody-CD3xCD20 was assessed in humanized mouse models in vivo. Non-clinical safety studies were performed in cynomolgus monkeys. FINDINGS: DuoBody-CD3xCD20 induced highly potent T-cell activation and T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity towards malignant B cells in vitro. Comparison of DuoBody-CD3xCD20 to CD3 bsAb targeting alternative B-cell antigens, or to CD3xCD20 bsAb generated using alternative CD20 Ab, emphasized its exceptional potency. In vitro comparison with other CD3xCD20 bsAb in clinical development showed that DuoBody-CD3xCD20 was significantly more potent than three other bsAb with single CD3 and CD20 binding regions and equally potent as a bsAb with a single CD3 and two CD20 binding regions. DuoBody-CD3xCD20 showed promising anti-tumour activity in vivo, also in the presence of excess levels of a CD20 Ab that competes for binding. In cynomolgus monkeys, DuoBody-CD3xCD20 demonstrated profound and long-lasting B-cell depletion from peripheral blood and lymphoid organs, which was comparable after subcutaneous and intravenous administration. Peak plasma levels of DuoBody-CD3xCD20 were lower and delayed after subcutaneous administration, which was associated with a reduction in plasma cytokine levels compared to intravenous administration, while bioavailability was comparable. INTERPRETATION: Based on these preclinical studies, a clinical trial was initiated to assess the clinical safety of subcutaneous DuoBody-CD3xCD20 in patients with B-cell malignancies.

Small molecule FLT3 kinase inhibitors have been developed, but despite having clinical efficacy, they are effective only on a subset of patients and associated with high risk of relapse. A durable therapy that can target a wider population of AML patients is needed. Here, we developed an anti-FLT3-CD3 immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based bispecific antibody (7370) with a high affinity for FLT3 and a long half-life, to target FLT3-expressing AML blasts, irrespective of FLT3 mutational status. We demonstrated that 7370 has picomolar potency against AML cell lines in vitro and in vivo. 7370 was also capable of activating T cells from AML patients, redirecting their cytotoxic activity against autologous blasts at low effector-to-target (E:T) ratio. Additionally, under our dosing regimen, 7370 was well tolerated and exhibited potent efficacy in cynomolgus monkeys by inducing complete but reversible depletion of peripheral FLT3(+) dendritic cells (DCs) and bone marrow FLT3(+) stem cells and progenitors. Overall, our results support further clinical development of 7370 to broadly target AML patients.","['Yeung, Yik Andy', 'Krishnamoorthy, Veena', 'Dettling, Danielle', 'Sommer, Cesar', 'Poulsen, Kris', 'Ni, Irene', 'Pham, Amber', 'Chen, Wei', 'Liao-Chan, Sindy', 'Lindquist, Kevin', 'Chin, S Michael', 'Chunyk, Allison Given', 'Hu, Wenyue', 'Sasu, Barbra', 'Chaparro-Riggers, Javier', 'Djuretic, Ivana']","['Yeung YA', 'Krishnamoorthy V', 'Dettling D', 'Sommer C', 'Poulsen K', 'Ni I', 'Pham A', 'Chen W', 'Liao-Chan S', 'Lindquist K', 'Chin SM', 'Chunyk AG', 'Hu W', 'Sasu B', 'Chaparro-Riggers J', 'Djuretic I']",,"['Cancer Immunology Discovery, Oncology R&D, Pfizer Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.

Reagents that target cells in a specific cell cycle phase (e.g., antimitotics or DNA synthesis inhibitors/replication stress inducers) have demonstrated success as broad-spectrum anticancer drugs. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are drivers of cell cycle transitions. A CDK inhibitor, flavopiridol/alvocidib, is an FDA-approved drug for acute myeloid leukemia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is another serious issue in contemporary medicine. The cause of AD remains elusive, although a critical role of latent amyloid-beta accumulation has emerged. Existing AD drug research and development targets include amyloid, amyloid metabolism/catabolism, tau, inflammation, cholesterol, the cholinergic system, and other neurotransmitters. However, none have been validated as therapeutically effective targets. Recent reports from AD-omics and preclinical animal models provided data supporting the long-standing notion that cell cycle progression and/or mitosis may be a valid target for AD prevention and/or therapy. This review will summarize the recent developments in AD research: (a) Mitotic re-entry, leading to the ""amyloid-beta accumulation cycle,"" may be a prerequisite for amyloid-beta accumulation and AD pathology development; (b) AD-associated pathogens can cause cell cycle errors; (c) thirteen among 37 human AD genetic risk genes may be functionally involved in the cell cycle and/or mitosis; and (d) preclinical AD mouse models treated with CDK inhibitor showed improvements in cognitive/behavioral symptoms. If the ""amyloid-beta accumulation cycle is an AD drug target"" concept is proven, repurposing of cancer drugs may emerge as a new, fast-track approach for AD management in the clinic setting.","['Rao, Chinthalapally V', 'Asch, Adam S', 'Carr, Daniel J J', 'Yamada, Hiroshi Y']","['Rao CV', 'Asch AS', 'Carr DJJ', 'Yamada HY']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0536-5581'],"['Center for Cancer Prevention and Drug Development, Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology Section, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC), Oklahoma City, OK, USA.', 'Stephenson Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology Section, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC), Oklahoma City, OK, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC), Oklahoma City, OK, USA.', 'Center for Cancer Prevention and Drug Development, Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology Section, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC), Oklahoma City, OK, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20200125,England,Aging Cell,Aging cell,101130839,IM,,"['Alzheimer Disease/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/prevention & control', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides/*metabolism', 'Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"[""*Alzheimer's disease (AD)"", '*Shugoshin 1 (Sgo1)', '*amyloid-beta (Abeta)', '*brain', '*cell cycle', '*chromosome instability (CIN)', '*cohesinopathy', '*cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor', '*mitosis', '*mouse']",2020/01/26 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/01/26 06:00'],"['2019/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/acel.13109 [doi]'],ppublish,Aging Cell. 2020 Mar;19(3):e13109. doi: 10.1111/acel.13109.

The gold standard used to evaluate response in the United States includes morphologic evaluation and minimal residual disease (MRD) testing of aspirated bone marrow (BM) by flow cytometry (FC). This MRD assessment is usually made on a single aspirate sample that is subject to variability in collection techniques and sampling error. Additionally, central nervous system (CNS) assessments for ALL include evaluations of cytopathology and cell counts, which can miss subclinical involvement. PROCEDURE: We retrospectively compared BM biopsy, aspirate, and FC samples obtained from children and young adults with relapsed/refractory ALL to identify the frequency and degree of disease discrepancies in this population. We also compared CNS FC and cytopathology techniques. RESULTS: Sixty of 410 (14.6%) BM samples had discrepant results, 41 (10%) of which were clinically relevant as they resulted in a change in the assignment of marrow status. Discrepant BM results were found in 28 of 89 (31.5%) patients evaluated. Additionally, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FC identified disease in 9.7% of cases where cytopathology was negative. CONCLUSIONS: These results support further investigation of the role of concurrent BM biopsy, with aspirate and FC evaluations, and the addition of FC to CSF evaluations, to fully assess disease status and response, particularly in patients with relapsed/refractory ALL. Prospective studies incorporating more comprehensive analysis to evaluate the impact on clinical outcomes are warranted.","['Shalabi, Haneen', 'Yuan, Constance M', 'Kulshreshtha, Amita', 'Dulau-Florea, Alina', 'Salem, Dalia', 'Gupta, Gaurav K', 'Roth, Mark', 'Filie, Armando C', 'Yates, Bonnie', 'Delbrook, Cindy', 'Derdak, Joanne', 'Mackall, Crystal L', 'Lee, Daniel W', 'Fry, Terry J', 'Wayne, Alan S', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice', 'Shah, Nirali N']","['Shalabi H', 'Yuan CM', 'Kulshreshtha A', 'Dulau-Florea A', 'Salem D', 'Gupta GK', 'Roth M', 'Filie AC', 'Yates B', 'Delbrook C', 'Derdak J', 'Mackall CL', 'Lee DW', 'Fry TJ', 'Wayne AS', 'Stetler-Stevenson M', 'Shah NN']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8692-8034', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8474-9080']","['Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, Hematology Section, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Mansoura University Faculty of Medicine, Clinical Pathology, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, Hematology Section, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', ""Division of Human Immunology and Immunotherapy Initiative, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Division of Hematology, Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California."", 'Laboratory of Pathology, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20200125,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*pathology/therapy', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CSF', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*minimal residual disease']",2020/01/26 06:00,2020/06/27 06:00,['2020/01/26 06:00'],"['2019/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28149 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Apr;67(4):e28149. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28149.

Defining genotypes with a higher risk for developing anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity could help to reduce cardiotoxicity. METHODS: Data originated from a phase II study assessing the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin in 100 children. Studied patients (0-17 years) were treated for solid tumours or leukaemia. Two cycles of doxorubicin were studied. Concentrations of natriuretic peptides proANP, BNP and NT-proBNP and cardiac troponins T and I were measured at five time points before, during and after two cycles of doxorubicin treatment. Genotypes of 17 genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding for anthracycline metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters were determined for each patient. We analysed the influence of genotypes on cardiac biomarker concentrations at different time points by a Kruskal-Wallis test. To perform a pairwise comparison significant genetic polymorphisms with more than two genotypes were analysed by a post hoc test. RESULTS: The Kruskal-Wallis tests and the post hoc-tests showed a significant association for seven genetic polymorphisms (ABCB1-rs1128503, ABCB1-rs1045642, ABCC1-rs4148350, CBR3-rs8133052, NQO2-in/del, SLC22A16-rs714368 and SLC22A16-rs6907567) with the concentration of at least one biomarker at one or more time points. We could not identify any polymorphism with a consistent effect on any biomarker over the whole treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of patients treated with doxorubicin for different tumour entities, seven genetic polymorphisms possibly influencing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of doxorubicin could lead occasionally to differences in the concentration of cardiac biomarkers. Since, the role of cardiac biomarkers for monitoring anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity has not yet been clarified, further trials with a long follow-up time are required to assess the impact of these genetic polymorphisms on chemotherapy-related cardiotoxicity.

Our objective was to conduct a systematic literature review to determine the association between allo-HSCT and anxiety, depression, and psychological health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in pediatric allo-HSCT recipients compared to survivors of pediatric cancer or healthy children. A literature search of peer-reviewed databases was conducted. Data extraction was conducted using a standardized form. Due to the heterogeneity in studies, populations, and measurement instruments, only a qualitative synthesis was performed. A total of 24 studies met eligibility criteria. Rates of anxiety and depression were higher among survivors of pediatric allo-HSCT compared to population normal values or children treated for health conditions without allo-HSCT. Most allo-HSCT survivors self-reported psychological HRQOL within normal levels, although some studies in leukemia patients identified poorer psychological HRQOL. The presence of multiple chronic health conditions, chronic graft-versus-host-disease, and patient sex were important risk factors for worse mental health. Patients who receive allo-HSCT during childhood experience subsequent anxiety, depression, and poorer psychological HRQOL after transplant and several clinical characteristics contribute to these mental health sequelae.","['Di Giuseppe, Giancarlo', 'Thacker, Nirav', 'Schechter, Tal', 'Pole, Jason D']","['Di Giuseppe G', 'Thacker N', 'Schechter T', 'Pole JD']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5112-7560'],"['Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada. gdigiuseppe@pogo.ca.', 'Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. gdigiuseppe@pogo.ca.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20200124,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,,"['Anxiety/etiology', 'Child', 'Depression/etiology', '*Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Quality of Life', 'Survivors']",,,2020/01/26 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/01/26 06:00'],"['2019/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-0782-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-0782-z [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2020 Jul;55(7):1240-1254. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-0782-z.

Here we describe CRISPR/dCas9-based enhancer-targeting epigenetic editing systems, enCRISPRa and enCRISPRi, for efficient analysis of enhancer function in situ and in vivo. Using dual effectors capable of re-writing enhancer-associated chromatin modifications, we show that enCRISPRa and enCRISPRi modulate gene transcription by remodeling local epigenetic landscapes at sgRNA-targeted enhancers and associated genes. Comparing with existing methods, the improved systems display more robust perturbations of enhancer activity and gene transcription with minimal off-targets. Allele-specific targeting of enCRISPRa to oncogenic TAL1 super-enhancer modulates TAL1 expression and cancer progression in xenotransplants. Single or multi-loci perturbations of lineage-specific enhancers using an enCRISPRi knock-in mouse establish in vivo evidence for lineage-restricted essentiality of developmental enhancers during hematopoiesis. Hence, enhancer-targeting CRISPR epigenetic editing provides opportunities for interrogating enhancer function in native biological contexts.","['Li, Kailong', 'Liu, Yuxuan', 'Cao, Hui', 'Zhang, Yuannyu', 'Gu, Zhimin', 'Liu, Xin', 'Yu, Andy', 'Kaphle, Pranita', 'Dickerson, Kathryn E', 'Ni, Min', 'Xu, Jian']","['Li K', 'Liu Y', 'Cao H', 'Zhang Y', 'Gu Z', 'Liu X', 'Yu A', 'Kaphle P', 'Dickerson KE', 'Ni M', 'Xu J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1988-7337'],"[""Children's Medical Center Research Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Harold C.

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a carcinogenic retrovirus that uses two independent -1 PRFs to express viral enzymes critical to establishing new HTLV-1 infections. How the cis-acting RNA elements in this viral transcript function to induce frameshifting is unknown. The objective of this work was to conclusively define the 3' boundary of and the RNA elements within the HTLV-1 pro-pol frameshift site. We hypothesized that the frameshift site structure was a pseudoknot and that its 3' boundary would be defined by the pseudoknot's 3' end. To test these hypotheses, the in vitro frameshift efficiencies of three HTLV-1 pro-pol frameshift sites with different 3' boundaries were quantified. The results indicated that nucleotides included in the longest construct were essential to highly efficient frameshift stimulation. Interestingly, only this construct could form the putative frameshift site pseudoknot. Next, the secondary structure of this frameshift site was determined. The dominant structure was an H-type pseudoknot which, together with the slippery sequence, stimulated frameshifting to 19.4(+/-0.3)%. The pseudoknot's critical role in frameshift stimulation was directly revealed by examining the impact of structural changes on HTLV-1 pro-pol -1 PRF. As predicted, mutations that occluded pseudoknot formation drastically reduced the frameshift efficiency. These results are significant because they demonstrate that a pseudoknot is important to HTLV-1 pro-pol -1 PRF and define the frameshift site's 3' boundary.","['Thulson, Eliza', 'Hartwick, Erik W', 'Cooper-Sansone, Andrew', 'Williams, Marcus A C', 'Soliman, Mary E', 'Robinson, Leila K', 'Kieft, Jeffrey S', 'Mouzakis, Kathryn D']","['Thulson E', 'Hartwick EW', 'Cooper-Sansone A', 'Williams MAC', 'Soliman ME', 'Robinson LK', 'Kieft JS', 'Mouzakis KD']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8760-3087', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9276-8567', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3718-1891', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6355-8851']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Fort Lewis College, Durango, Colorado 81301, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA.', 'RNA Bioscience Initiative, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Fort Lewis College, Durango, Colorado 81301, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Fort Lewis College, Durango, Colorado 81301, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles, California 90045, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles, California 90045, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA.', 'RNA Bioscience Initiative, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles, California 90045, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200124,United States,RNA,"RNA (New York, N.Y.)",9509184,IM,,"['*Frameshifting, Ribosomal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry/*genetics', 'Ribosomes/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HTLV-1', '*RNA pseudoknot', '*chemical probing', '*frameshifting', '*retrovirus', '*translation']",2020/01/26 06:00,2020/06/18 06:00,['2020/01/26 06:00'],"['2019/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['rna.070490.119 [pii]', '10.1261/rna.070490.119 [doi]']",ppublish,RNA. 2020 Apr;26(4):512-528. doi: 10.1261/rna.070490.119.

The syndrome is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by eosinophilia and lymphadenopathy, with risk of progression to either acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or T- or B-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia. Within the EMS subtype, translocations between breakpoint cluster region (BCR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) have been shown to produce a dominant fusion protein that is notoriously resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Here, we report two cases of BCR-FGFR1 (+) EMS identified via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Sanger sequencing revealed that both cases harbored the exact same breakpoint. In the first case, the patient presented with AML-like disease, and in the second, the patient progressed to B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Additionally, we observed that that primary leukemia cells from Case 1 demonstrated sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors ponatinib and dovitinib that can target FGFR1 kinase activity, whereas primary cells from Case 2 were resistant to both drugs. Taken together, these results suggest that some but not all BCR-FGFR1 fusion positive leukemias may respond to TKIs that target FGFR1 kinase activity.","['Barnes, Evan J', 'Leonard, Jessica', 'Medeiros, Bruno C', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Tognon, Cristina E']","['Barnes EJ', 'Leonard J', 'Medeiros BC', 'Druker BJ', 'Tognon CE']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6972-8137', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4872-3078']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239, USA.', 'Department of Medicine-Hematology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Portland, Oregon 97239, USA.', 'Department of Medicine-Hematology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Portland, Oregon 97239, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200401,United States,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud,Cold Spring Harbor molecular case studies,101660017,IM,,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Biopsy', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*hematological neoplasm']",2020/01/26 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/01/26 06:00'],"['2019/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['mcs.a004838 [pii]', '10.1101/mcs.a004838 [doi]']",epublish,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud. 2020 Apr 1;6(2). pii: mcs.a004838. doi: 10.1101/mcs.a004838.

Magnetic CD138 enrichment followed by interphase FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridisation) is the gold standard to identify prognostic translocations and copy number alterations (CNA). Although clinical implications of gene expression profiling (GEP) or panel based sequencing results are evident, those tests have not yet reached routine clinical application. We set up a single workflow to analyse MM of 211 patients at first diagnosis by whole genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA-Seq and validate the results by FISH analysis. We observed a 96% concordance of FISH and WGS results when assessing translocations involving the IGH locus and an overall concordance of FISH and WGS of 92% when assessing CNA. WGS analysis resulted in the identification of 17 additional MYC-translocations that were missed by FISH analysis. RNA-Seq followed by supervised clustering grouped patients in their expected genetically defined subgroup and prompted the assessment of WGS data in cases that were not congruent with FISH. This allowed the identification of additional IGH-translocations and hyperdiploid cases. We show the reliability of WGS an RNA-Seq in a clinical setting, which is a prerequisite for a novel routine diagnostic test.","['Hollein, Alexander', 'Twardziok, Sven O', 'Walter, Wencke', 'Hutter, Stephan', 'Baer, Constance', 'Hernandez-Sanchez, Jesus Maria', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Claudia']","['Hollein A', 'Twardziok SO', 'Walter W', 'Hutter S', 'Baer C', 'Hernandez-Sanchez JM', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Haferlach T', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach C']",,"['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany; Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC) Campus Universitario Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca, Spain.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.

We aimed to describe the clinico-biological characteristics, treatment, and evolutive course of myelofibrosis patients in Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 1,000 patients from the Spanish Registry of Myelofibrosis diagnosed with primary (n=641) or secondary (n=359) myelofibrosis were analysed. RESULTS: Median age was 68 years. The frequency of constitutional symptoms, moderate to severe anaemia (Hb<10g/dL), and symptomatic splenomegaly was 35%, 36%, and 17%, respectively. The rate of thrombosis and haemorrhage was 1.96 and 1.6 events per 100 patient-years, respectively. The cumulative incidence of leukaemia at 10 years was 15%. The most frequent therapies for the anaemia were the erythropoiesis stimulating agents and danazol. From 2010, a progressive increase in the use of ruxolitinib was noticed. A total of 7.5% of patients were transplanted. During the observation period, 42% of patients died mainly due to the clinical deterioration caused by myelofibrosis or leukaemic transformation. The median survival of the series was 5.7 years. Four different risk categories were identified by the IPSS: median survival was not reached in the low risk group and was 8.8 years, 5.3 years, and 2.8 years in the intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high-risk groups, respectively.

Autoimmune cytopenias (AIC) affect 4-7% of patients with CLL and mainly consist of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia. Although less common, non-hematological autoimmune manifestations have also been reported. Treatment of CLL associated AIC should be primarily directed against the autoimmune phenomenon, and CLL specific therapy should be reserved to refractory cases or patients with additional signs of disease progression. New targeted drugs (ibrutinib, idelalisib and venetoclax) recently entered the therapeutic armamentarium of CLL, showing excellent results in terms of efficacy and became an alternative option to standard chemo-immunotherapy for the management of CLL associated AIC. However, the possible role of these drugs in inducing or exacerbating autoimmune phenomena still needs to be elucidated. In this article, we review currently available data concerning autoimmune phenomena in patients with CLL, particularly focusing on patients treated with ibrutinib, idelalisib, or venetoclax, and we discuss the possible role of these agents in the management of AIC.","['Vitale, Candida', 'Montalbano, Maria Chiara', 'Salvetti, Chiara', 'Boccellato, Elia', 'Griggio, Valentina', 'Boccadoro, Mario', 'Coscia, Marta']","['Vitale C', 'Montalbano MC', 'Salvetti C', 'Boccellato E', 'Griggio V', 'Boccadoro M', 'Coscia M']",,"['University Division of Hematology, A.O.U.

Norrin is a secreted protein that protects RGC from N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated excitotoxic damage, which is accompanied by increased expression of protective factors such as Lif, Edn2 and Fgf2. METHODS: Lif-deficient mice were injected with NMDA in one eye and NMDA plus Norrin into the other eye. RGC damage was investigated and quantified by TUNEL labeling 24 h after injection. Retinal mRNA expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction following retinal treatment. RESULTS: After intravitreal injection of NMDA and Norrin in wild-type mice approximately 50% less TUNEL positive cells were observed in the RGC layer when compared to NMDA-treated littermates, an effect which was lost in Lif-deficient mice. The mRNA expression for Gfap, a marker for Muller cell gliosis, as well as Edn2 and Fgf2 was induced in wild-type mice following NMDA/Norrin treatment but substantially blocked in Lif-deficient mice. CONCLUSIONS: Norrin mediates its protective properties on RGC via Lif, which is required to enhance Muller cell gliosis and to induce protective factors such as Edn2 or Fgf2.","['Kassumeh, Stefan', 'Leopold, Stephanie', 'Fuchshofer, Rudolf', 'Thomas, Carina N', 'Priglinger, Siegfried G', 'Tamm, Ernst R', 'Ohlmann, Andreas']","['Kassumeh S', 'Leopold S', 'Fuchshofer R', 'Thomas CN', 'Priglinger SG', 'Tamm ER', 'Ohlmann A']",,"['Laboratory for Cell and Molecular Biology, Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, 80336 Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Anatomy and Embryology, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Anatomy and Embryology, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA.', 'Laboratory for Cell and Molecular Biology, Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, 80336 Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Anatomy and Embryology, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Cell and Molecular Biology, Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, 80336 Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Anatomy and Embryology, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200123,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,,"['Animals', 'Endothelin-2/metabolism', 'Ependymoglial Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Eye Proteins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism', 'Gliosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'N-Methylaspartate/pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Neuroprotection/*drug effects', 'Neurotoxins/*toxicity', 'Optic Nerve/drug effects/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Retinal Neurons/drug effects/pathology', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Lif', '*NMDA', '*Norrin', '*Wnt/beta-catenin signaling', '*apoptosis', '*excitotoxic damage', '*neuroprotection', '*retinal ganglion cells']",2020/01/26 06:00,2021/02/12 06:00,['2020/01/26 06:00'],"['2019/12/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9020277 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9020277 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Jan 23;9(2). pii: cells9020277. doi: 10.3390/cells9020277.,PMC7072268,"['The authors declare no conflict of interest.

METHODS: In this retrospective, single center study, 2770 infants (7.8% with trisomy 21) were studied. All infants underwent cardiac catheterization under one year of age between January 1980 and December 1998. Newly diagnosed cancer in the first 15 years of life was assessed through record linkage to the German Childhood Cancer Registry (GCCR). Cancer risk in study patients was compared to the GCCR population of children less than 15 years. Patients with trisomy 21 were compared to the Danish Cytogenic Register for trisomy 21. Effective radiation doses were calculated for each tumor patient and 60 randomly selected patients who did not develop cancer. RESULTS: In total, 24,472.5 person-years were analyzed. Sixteen children developed cancer, while 3.64 were expected (standardized incidence ratio (SIR) = 4.4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.5-7.2, p < 0.001). There was no preferred cancer type. The observed incidence of leukemia and solid tumors in trisomy 21 was only slightly higher (1 in 476 py) than expected (1 in 609 py, p = 0.64). There was no direct relationship between the radiation dose and the incidence of cancer. CONCLUSION: Cardiac catherization in the first year of life was associated with a significantly increased cancer risk in a population with congenital heart disease.","['Stern, Heiko', 'Seidenbusch, Michael', 'Hapfelmeier, Alexander', 'Meierhofer, Christian', 'Naumann, Susanne', 'Schmid, Irene', 'Spix, Claudia', 'Ewert, Peter']","['Stern H', 'Seidenbusch M', 'Hapfelmeier A', 'Meierhofer C', 'Naumann S', 'Schmid I', 'Spix C', 'Ewert P']",,"['German Heart Center Munich, Clinic for Pediatric Cardiology and Congenital Heart Disease, Lazarettstrasse 36, D-80636 Munich, Germany.', 'German Research Center for Environmental Health, Institute of Radiation Protection, Ingolstaedter Landstrasse 1, Neuherberg, D-85764 Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, Technical University Munich, Grillparzerstr. 18, Alexander Hapfelmeier, D-81675 Munich, Germany.', 'German Heart Center Munich, Clinic for Pediatric Cardiology and Congenital Heart Disease, Lazarettstrasse 36, D-80636 Munich, Germany.', 'German Heart Center Munich, Clinic for Pediatric Cardiology and Congenital Heart Disease, Lazarettstrasse 36, D-80636 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Dr. von Hauner Childrens Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Lindwurmstrasse 4, 80337 Munich, Germany.', 'German Childhood Cancer Registry (GCCR), Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Obere Zahlbacher Strasse 69, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'German Heart Center Munich, Clinic for Pediatric Cardiology and Congenital Heart Disease, Lazarettstrasse 36, D-80636 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200122,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cardiac Catheterization', 'cancer', 'cancer risk', 'children', 'congenital heart disease', 'radiation']",2020/01/26 06:00,2020/01/26 06:01,['2020/01/26 06:00'],"['2020/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/26 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9020315 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9020315 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Jan 22;9(2). pii: jcm9020315. doi: 10.3390/jcm9020315.,PMC7074298,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

N-glycosylation of the Fc fragment affects the effector functions of IgG by enhancing or suppressing the cytotoxicity effect. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of HT-specific IgG glycosylation in ADCC and CDC, using in vitro models. The normal thyroid Nthy-ori 3-1 cell line and thyroid carcinoma FTC-133 cells were used as the target cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors and the HL-60 human promyelotic leukemia cell line served as the effector cells. IgG was isolated from sera of HT and healthy donors and then treated with alpha2-3,6,8-neuraminidase to cut off sialic acids (SA) from N-glycans. We observed more intensive cytotoxicity in the presence of IgG from HT patients than in the presence of IgG from healthy donors. Removal of SA from IgG N-glycans increased ADCC intensity and reduced CDC. We conclude that the enhanced thyrocyte lysis resulted from the higher anti-TPO content in the whole IgG pool of HT donors and from altered IgG glycosylation in HT autoimmunity.","['Zabczynska, Marta', 'Polak, Katarzyna', 'Kozlowska, Kamila', 'Sokolowski, Grzegorz', 'Pochec, Ewa']","['Zabczynska M', 'Polak K', 'Kozlowska K', 'Sokolowski G', 'Pochec E']",,"['Department of Glycoconjugate Biochemistry, Institute of Zoology and Biomedical Research, Faculty of Biology, Jagiellonian University, Gronostajowa 9, 30-387 Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Glycoconjugate Biochemistry, Institute of Zoology and Biomedical Research, Faculty of Biology, Jagiellonian University, Gronostajowa 9, 30-387 Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Glycoconjugate Biochemistry, Institute of Zoology and Biomedical Research, Faculty of Biology, Jagiellonian University, Gronostajowa 9, 30-387 Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Endocrinology, University Hospital in Krakow, Kopernika 17, 31-501 Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Glycoconjugate Biochemistry, Institute of Zoology and Biomedical Research, Faculty of Biology, Jagiellonian University, Gronostajowa 9, 30-387 Krakow, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200122,Switzerland,Biomolecules,Biomolecules,101596414,IM,,"['*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Autoantibodies/chemistry', 'Autoimmunity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology', 'Glycosylation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hashimoto Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*chemistry', 'Lectins/chemistry', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Polysaccharides', 'Sialic Acids/chemistry', 'Thyroid Epithelial Cells/immunology', 'Thyroid Gland/immunology/physiopathology']",['NOTNLM'],"[""*Hashimoto's thyroiditis"", '*IgG', '*N-glycosylation', '*antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)', '*complement-dependent cyttoxicity (CDC)', '*sialylation']",2020/01/26 06:00,2021/03/30 06:00,['2020/01/26 06:00'],"['2019/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['biom10020171 [pii]', '10.3390/biom10020171 [doi]']",epublish,Biomolecules. 2020 Jan 22;10(2). pii: biom10020171. doi: 10.3390/biom10020171.,PMC7072644,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],"['K/DSC/002996, K/DSC/003987/Uniwersytet Jagiellonski w Krakowie/International', '2015/18/E/NZ6/00602/Narodowe Centrum Nauki/International']","['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '0 (glycosylated IgG)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the precise underlying mechanism of such protection remains unclear so far. In this experiment, protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (Shp2), which was encoded by the PTPN11 gene, was highly expressed in BMSCs of the newly diagnosed and the recurrent B-ALL patients. The plasmid-induced (including Shp2 E76K) Shp2 activation in BMSCs (Shp2-activated BMSCs) markedly increased the BMSCs-mediated resistance of leukemia cells both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, studies in vitro suggested that, the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) was markedly up-regulated in Shp2-activated BMSCs, and VCAM-1 expression in BMSCs of B-ALL patients was negatively correlated with Shp2 expression. Down-regulation of VCAM-1 in BMSCs using siRNA reversed the resistance of CCRF-SB cells mediated by the Shp2-activated BMSCs. As for the molecular mechanism, the PI3K/AKT pathway mediated the regulation of VCAM-1 by Shp2. Blocking the very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) by antibodies in CCRF-SB cells dramatically reversed the resistance of CCRF-SB cells mediated by the Shp2-activated BMSCs, and decreased the adhesion effects of both CCRF-SB cells and BMSCs. In conclusion, Shp2 activation in BMSCs up-regulates VCAM-1 expression through increasing the PI3K/AKT phosphorylation level, and targeting the VCAM-1/VLA-4 signaling may serve as a clinically relevant mechanism to overcome the BMSCs-mediated chemoresistance of B-ALL cells.","['Yu, Kunlin', 'Yin, Yi', 'Ma, Dan', 'Lu, Tingting', 'Wei, Danna', 'Xiong, Jie', 'Zhou, Zheng', 'Zhang, Tianzhuo', 'Zhang, Siyu', 'Fang, Qin', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Yu K', 'Yin Y', 'Ma D', 'Lu T', 'Wei D', 'Xiong J', 'Zhou Z', 'Zhang T', 'Zhang S', 'Fang Q', 'Wang J']",,"['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, Guizhou, China; College of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Imaging, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.

Thus, DOT1L is an attractive therapeutic target and discovery of small molecule inhibitors remain of high interest. Herein, we are presenting screening results for a unique focused library of 1200 nucleoside analogs originally produced under the aegis of the NIH Pilot Scale Library Program. The complete nucleoside set was screened virtually against DOT1L, resulting in 210 putative hits. In vitro screening of the virtual hits resulted in validation of 11 compounds as DOT1L inhibitors clustered into two distinct chemical classes, adenosine-based inhibitors and a new chemotype that lacks adenosine. Based on the developed DOT1L ligand binding model, a structure-based design strategy was applied and a second-generation of non-nucleoside DOT1L inhibitors was developed. Newly synthesized compound 25 was the most potent DOT1L inhibitor in the new series with an IC50 of 1.0 muM, showing 40-fold improvement in comparison with hit 9 and exhibiting reasonable on target effects in a DOT1L dependent murine cell line. These compounds represent novel chemical probes with a unique non-nucleoside scaffold that bind and compete with the SAM binding site of DOT1L, thus providing foundation for further medicinal chemistry efforts to develop more potent compounds.","['Gibbons, Garrett S', 'Chakraborty, Amarraj', 'Grigsby, Sierrah M', 'Umeano, Afoma C', 'Liao, Chenzhong', 'Moukha-Chafiq, Omar', 'Pathak, Vibha', 'Mathew, Bini', 'Lee, Young-Tae', 'Dou, Yali', 'Schurer, Stephan C', 'Reynolds, Robert C', 'Snowden, Timothy S', 'Nikolovska-Coleska, Zaneta']","['Gibbons GS', 'Chakraborty A', 'Grigsby SM', 'Umeano AC', 'Liao C', 'Moukha-Chafiq O', 'Pathak V', 'Mathew B', 'Lee YT', 'Dou Y', 'Schurer SC', 'Reynolds RC', 'Snowden TS', 'Nikolovska-Coleska Z']",,"['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA; Molecular and Cellular Pathology Graduate Program, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Alabama, 250 Hackberry Lane, Tuscaloosa, AL, 35487, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA; Molecular and Cellular Pathology Graduate Program, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, 33136, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Southern Research Institute, Drug Discovery Division, Birmingham, AL, 35205, USA.', 'Southern Research Institute, Drug Discovery Division, Birmingham, AL, 35205, USA.', 'Southern Research Institute, Drug Discovery Division, Birmingham, AL, 35205, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, 33136, USA; Center for Computational Science, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, 33136, USA; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, 33136, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, 35294, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Alabama, 250 Hackberry Lane, Tuscaloosa, AL, 35487, USA.

Such variations have been shown to have a direct role in the pathogenesis of various diseases either through inhibition of tumor suppressor genes or increasing the expression of oncogenes. Enzymes involving in epigenetic machinery are the main actors in tuning the epigenetic-based controls on gene expressions. Aberrant expression of these enzymes can trigger big chaos in the cellular gene expression networks and finally lead to cancer progression. This situation has been shown in different types of leukemia, where high or low levels of an epigenetic enzyme are partly or highly responsible for the involvement or progression of a disease. DNA hypermethylation, different histone modifications, and aberrant miRNA expressions are three main epigenetic variations, which have been shown to play a role in leukemia progression. Epigenetic based treatments now are considered as novel and effective therapies in order to decrease the abnormal epigenetic modifications in patient cells. Different epigenetic-based approaches have been developed and tested to inhibit or reverse the unusual expression of epigenetic agents in leukemia. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the most prevalent acute leukemia in adults, is anaggressive hematological malignancy arising in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. With the exception of a few specific AML subtypes, the mainstays of treatment have not significantly changed over the last 20 years, and are still based on standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. In this review, we will discuss the recent development of therapeutics specifically targeting these key epigenetic programs in AML, describe their mechanism of action and present their current clinical development. Finally, we will discuss the opportunities presented by epigenetically targeted therapy in AML and will highlight future challenges ahead for the AML community, to ensure that this novel therapeutics are optimally translated into clinical practice and result in clinical improvement for AML patients.","['Liu, Xiao-Liang', 'Liu, Huan-Qiu', 'Li, Ji', 'Mao, Cui-Ying', 'He, Jin-Ting', 'Zhao, Xin']","['Liu XL', 'Liu HQ', 'Li J', 'Mao CY', 'He JT', 'Zhao X']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, 130021, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, 130021, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, 130021, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, China-Japan Union Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, 130033, Jilin Province, China.', 'Department of Neurology, China-Japan Union Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, 130033, Jilin Province, China.

However, the safety and efficacy of discontinuing first-line dasatinib remains unclear. In this trial (the first-line DADI trial) we aimed to assess molecular relapse-free survival at 6 months after discontinuation of dasatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia who had been treated with first-line dasatinib and had maintained deep molecular response for at least 1 year. METHODS: The first-line DADI trial was a single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 trial done at 23 hospitals in Japan. Patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia without hepatosplenomegaly and extramedullary mass, who received at least 24-month dasatinib treatment and had a sustained deep molecular response (defined as BCR-ABL1/ABL1 international scale </=0.0069% in at least four successive samples spanning a 12 month period) were enrolled. Other eligibility criteria were an age of 15 years or older, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0-2, and no primary organ dysfunction. The primary outcome was molecular relapse-free survival (also known as treatment-free remission) after discontinuation of dasatinib at 6 months and was analysed in all patients who completed the 12-month consolidation phase. Safety was assessed in all patients who received treatment. This study closed early due to accrual and is registered with the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000011099). FINDINGS: Between Sept 20, 2013 and July 12, 2016, 68 patients who had a deep molecular response after receiving first-line dasatinib for at least 24 months were enrolled and assigned to the consolidation phase. Nine patients were excluded during the consolidation phase and one patient was excluded after study completion because of meeting exclusion criteria. 58 patients discontinued dasatinib and were assessed. 32 (55%) of 58 patients had treatment-free remission at 6 months after dasatinib discontinuation, and median follow-up was 23.3 months (IQR 11.7-31.0). Treatment-free remission at 6 months was 55.2% (95% CI 43.7-69.6). No non-haematological adverse events worse than grade 2 occurred before dasatinib discontinuation. The most common haematological adverse event was anaemia (14 [21%] of 68 treated patients); three (4%) of 68 treated patients had grade 3 neutropenia and one (1%) had grade 4 lymphopenia.

In a randomized trial comparing standard vs high-dose induction (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00495287), we studied early peripheral blast cell clearance (PBC) as a rapid predictive assay of chemotherapy response to determine whether it correlates with the achievement of complete remission (CR), as well as postremission outcome, according to induction intensity. Individual leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) identified pretherapy by flow cytometry were validated and quantified centrally after 3 days of treatment, expressing PBC on a logarithmic scale as the ratio of absolute LAIP+ cells on day 1 and day 4. Of 178 patients, 151 (84.8%) were evaluable. Patients in CR exhibited significantly higher median PBC (2.3 log) compared with chemoresistant patients (1.0 log; P < .0001). PBC < 1.0 predicted the worst outcome (CR, 28%). With 1.5 log established as the most accurate cutoff predicting CR, 87.5% of patients with PBC >1.5 (PBChigh, n = 96) and 43.6% of patients with PBC </=1.5 (PBClow, n = 55) achieved CR after single-course induction (P < .0001). CR and PBChigh rates were increased in patients randomized to the high-dose induction arm (P = .04) and correlated strongly with genetic/cytogenetic risk. In multivariate analysis, PBC retained significant predictive power for CR, relapse risk, and survival. Thus, PBC analysis can provide a very early prediction of outcome, correlates with treatment intensity and disease subset, and may support studies of customized AML therapy.","['Gianfaldoni, Giacomo', 'Mannelli, Francesco', 'Intermesoli, Tamara', 'Bencini, Sara', 'Giupponi, Damiano', 'Farina, Giorgio', 'Cutini, Ilaria', 'Bonetti, Maria Ida', 'Masciulli, Arianna', 'Audisio, Ernesta', 'Ferrero, Dario', 'Pavoni, Chiara', 'Scattolin, Anna Maria', 'Bosi, Alberto', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Bassan, Renato']","['Gianfaldoni G', 'Mannelli F', 'Intermesoli T', 'Bencini S', 'Giupponi D', 'Farina G', 'Cutini I', 'Bonetti MI', 'Masciulli A', 'Audisio E', 'Ferrero D', 'Pavoni C', 'Scattolin AM', 'Bosi A', 'Rambaldi A', 'Bassan R']",,"['Struttura Organizzativa Dipartimentale (SOD) Ematologia, Universita di Firenze, and.', 'Struttura Organizzativa Dipartimentale (SOD) Ematologia, Universita di Firenze, and.', 'Centro Ricerca e Innovazione Malattie Mieloproliferative, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria (AOU) Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Unita Strutturale Complessa di Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Struttura Organizzativa Dipartimentale (SOD) Ematologia, Universita di Firenze, and.', 'Centro Diagnostico di Citofluorimetria e Immunoterapia, AOU Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Unita Strutturale Complessa di Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', ""Unita Operativa Laboratorio Analisi-Citofluorimetria, Ospedale dell'Angelo, Mestre-Venezia, Italy."", 'Struttura Organizzativa Dipartimentale (SOD) Ematologia, Universita di Firenze, and.', 'SOD Terapie Cellulari e Medicina Trasfusionale, AOU Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Struttura Organizzativa Dipartimentale (SOD) Ematologia, Universita di Firenze, and.', 'Unita Strutturale Complessa di Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Struttura Complessa di Ematologia, Ospedale Molinette, Turin, Italy.', 'Divisione di Ematologia, Universita di Torino, Azienda Ospedaliera S.

Suggestions for NGS panel choice or design.,e0227986,10.1371/journal.pone.0227986 [doi],"The diagnosis of myeloid neoplasms (MN) has significantly evolved through the last few decades. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is gradually becoming an essential tool to help clinicians with disease management. To this end, most specialized genetic laboratories have implemented NGS panels targeting a number of different genes relevant to MN. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the performance of four different targeted NGS gene panels based on their technical features and clinical utility. A total of 32 patient bone marrow samples were accrued and sequenced with 3 commercially available panels and 1 custom panel. Variants were classified by two geneticists based on their clinical relevance in MN. There was a difference in panel's depth of coverage. We found 11 discordant clinically relevant variants between panels, with a trend to miss long insertions. Our data show that there is a high risk of finding different mutations depending on the panel of choice, due both to the panel design and the data analysis method. Of note, CEBPA, CALR and FLT3 genes, remains challenging the use of NGS for diagnosis of MN in compliance with current guidelines. Therefore, conventional molecular testing might need to be kept in place for the correct diagnosis of MN for now.","['Aguilera-Diaz, Almudena', 'Vazquez, Iria', 'Ariceta, Benat', 'Manu, Amagoia', 'Blasco-Iturri, Zurine', 'Palomino-Echeverria, Sara', 'Larrayoz, Maria Jose', 'Garcia-Sanz, Ramon', 'Prieto-Conde, Maria Isabel', 'Del Carmen Chillon, Maria', 'Alfonso-Pierola, Ana', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Fernandez-Mercado, Marta', 'Calasanz, Maria Jose']","['Aguilera-Diaz A', 'Vazquez I', 'Ariceta B', 'Manu A', 'Blasco-Iturri Z', 'Palomino-Echeverria S', 'Larrayoz MJ', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'Prieto-Conde MI', 'Del Carmen Chillon M', 'Alfonso-Pierola A', 'Prosper F', 'Fernandez-Mercado M', 'Calasanz MJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1897-3914'],"['Advanced Genomics Laboratory, Hemato-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Navarra Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA), Pamplona, Spain.', 'Navarra Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA), Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hematological Diseases Laboratory, CIMA LAB Diagnostics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hematological Diseases Laboratory, CIMA LAB Diagnostics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hematological Diseases Laboratory, CIMA LAB Diagnostics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hematological Diseases Laboratory, CIMA LAB Diagnostics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hematological Diseases Laboratory, CIMA LAB Diagnostics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Navarra Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA), Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hematological Diseases Laboratory, CIMA LAB Diagnostics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital of Salamanca, IBSAL and CIBERONC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital of Salamanca, IBSAL and CIBERONC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital of Salamanca, IBSAL and CIBERONC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Clinica Universidad de Navarra (CUN), Pamplona, Spain.', 'Advanced Genomics Laboratory, Hemato-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Navarra Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA), Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Clinica Universidad de Navarra (CUN), Pamplona, Spain.', 'Advanced Genomics Laboratory, Hemato-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hematological Diseases Laboratory, CIMA LAB Diagnostics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Biomedical Engineering Department, School of Engineering, University of Navarra, San Sebastian, Spain.', 'Navarra Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA), Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hematological Diseases Laboratory, CIMA LAB Diagnostics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Scientific Co-Director of CIMA LAB Diagnostics, CIMA LAB Diagnostics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200124,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,"['Genes, Neoplasm', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Mutation/genetics']",,,2020/01/25 06:00,2020/04/15 06:00,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0227986 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-20399 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Jan 24;15(1):e0227986. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0227986. eCollection 2020.,PMC6980571,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective cohort study over 3 years was performed. Risk factors were determined and evaluated by a multivariable logistic regression analysis. Healthcare costs of CLABSI were analyzed in a matched case-control study. In total 610 patients got included with a CLABSI incidence of 10.6 cases per 1,000 CVC days. The use of more than one CVC per case, CVC insertion for conditioning for stem cell transplantation, acute myeloid leukemia, leukocytopenia (</= 1000/muL), carbapenem therapy and pulmonary diseases were independent risk factors for CLABSI.

However, the significance of ACAT-1 and cholesterol esters (CE) is relatively understudied in ovarian cancer. In this in vitro study, we assessed the expression and contribution of ACAT-1 in ovarian cancer progression. We observed a significant increase in the expression of ACAT-1 and CE levels in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines (OC-314, SKOV-3 and IGROV-1) compared to primary ovarian epithelial cells (normal controls). To confirm the tumor promoting capacity of ACAT-1, we inhibited ACAT-1 expression and activity by treating our cell lines with an ACAT inhibitor, avasimibe, or by stable transfection with ACAT-1 specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA). We observed significant suppression of cell proliferation, migration and invasion in ACAT-1 knockdown ovarian cancer cell lines compared to their respective controls (cell lines transfected with scrambled shRNA). ACAT-1 inhibition enhanced apoptosis with a concurrent increase in caspases 3/7 activity and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) coupled with increased expression of p53 may be the mechanism(s) underlying pro-apoptotic action of ACAT-1 inhibition. Additionally, ACAT-1 inhibited ovarian cancer cell lines displayed enhanced chemosensitivity to cisplatin treatment. These results suggest ACAT-1 may be a potential new target for the treatment of ovarian cancer.","['Ayyagari, Vijayalakshmi N', 'Wang, Xinjia', 'Diaz-Sylvester, Paula L', 'Groesch, Kathleen', 'Brard, Laurent']","['Ayyagari VN', 'Wang X', 'Diaz-Sylvester PL', 'Groesch K', 'Brard L']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1531-1958'],"['Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, United States America.', 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, United States America.', 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, United States America.', 'Center for Clinical Research, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, United States America.', 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, United States America.', 'Center for Clinical Research, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, United States America.', 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, United States America.', 'Simmons Cancer Institute at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, United States America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200124,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,"['Acetyl-CoA C-Acetyltransferase', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cholesterol Esters/metabolism', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', '*Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*enzymology/*pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sterol O-Acyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,,2020/01/25 06:00,2020/04/15 06:00,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0228024 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-16670 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Jan 24;15(1):e0228024. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0228024. eCollection 2020.,PMC6980601,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,"['0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.3.1.26 (Sterol O-Acyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.26 (sterol O-acyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.3.1.9 (ACAT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.9 (Acetyl-CoA C-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate clinical characteristics of non-MF/SS CLs. METHODS: A retrospective analysis evaluated patients with non-MF/SS CLs covering a period of 17 years. The records of 59 patients with non-MF/SS CLs were reviewed for demographic profiles, clinical features, and survival outcomes. RESULTS: Our series consisted of 38 non-MF/SS cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) and 21 cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (CBCLs). In the group of non-MF/SS CTCLs including 33 primary and five secondary cases, there were cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (15.3% of non-MF/SS CLs), extranodal natural killer/ T-cell lymphoma (13.5%), peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (13,5%), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (8.5%), subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (6.8%) and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (6.8%). In the group of CBCLs including nine primary and 12 secondary cases, there were cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (22.0%), mantle cell lymphoma (5.1%), extranodal marginal lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (3.4%), follicle center lymphoma (3.4%) and intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (1.7%). The overall survivals were 57 months for non-MF/SS CTCLs and 41.5 months for CBCLs. Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level, thrombocytopenia, multiple anatomical sites of skin involvement and lower albumin level may be associated with poor prognosis in non-MF/SS CTCLs, but the latter two were not in CBCLs. CONCLUSION: With this series, we hope to provide indigenous data and outcome of non-MF/SS CLs. The overall survival of non-MF/SS CTCLs was better than CBCLs.","['Liu, Kwei-Lan', 'Tsai, Wen-Chien', 'Lee, Chih-Hung']","['Liu KL', 'Tsai WC', 'Lee CH']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9185-5834'],"['Department of Dermatology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Huang PH Dermatology and Aesthetics, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20200124,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', '*Referral and Consultation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sezary Syndrome/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Taiwan', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/25 06:00,2020/04/15 06:00,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2019/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0228046 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-26813 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Jan 24;15(1):e0228046. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0228046. eCollection 2020.,PMC6980583,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed intraocular infiltration during the remission period. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 40-year-old man presented with hypopyon in his right eye. Three months later, extensive subretinal infiltration and the elevation of intraocular pressure were observed. Fourteen months prior to this, he had been diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL, and had received chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation that resulted in complete remission. DIAGNOSIS: The breakpoint cluster region-Ableson (BCR/ABL) chimera was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis in the patient's aqueous humor. Additionally, a high expression of WT1 (Wilms tumor gene) mRNA in the aqueous humor was discovered. A bone marrow examination yielded a high expression of BCR/ABL fusion gene, and it was determined the patient had experienced a relapse of ALL. INTERVENTIONS: The dasatinib was administered orally to the patient. OUTCOMES: The intraocular infiltration disappeared, and intraocular pressure was normalized. LESSONS: Intraocular infiltration in leukemia patients may be an indication of relapse regardless of systemic conditions. Analyzing mRNA expression of BCR/ABL and WT1 of ocular fluid in patients with hypopyon is beneficial in diagnosing topical relapses in leukemia.","['Hiraoka, Miki', 'Ohguro, Hiroshi', 'Ikeda, Hiroshi', 'Furuya, Daisuke', 'Takahashi, Satoshi']","['Hiraoka M', 'Ohguro H', 'Ikeda H', 'Furuya D', 'Takahashi S']",,"['Department of Ophthalmology.', 'Department of Ophthalmology.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology.', 'Department of Clinical Engineering, Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University of Science.', 'Department of Infection Control and Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aqueous Humor/diagnostic imaging/*metabolism', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Intraocular Pressure', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence', 'Uveitis']",,,2020/01/25 06:00,2020/02/01 06:00,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000018872 [doi]', '00005792-202001240-00049 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Jan;99(4):e18872. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000018872.,PMC7004763,,,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review focuses on achievements, current obstacles, and future directions in CAR-T research. A high complete remission rate of 68% to 93% could be achieved after anti-CD19 CAR-T treatment for B-ALL. Cytokine release syndrome and CAR-T-related neurotoxicity could be managed. In view of difficulties collecting autologous lymphocytes, universal CAR-T is a direction to explore. Regarding the high relapse rate after anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy, the main solutions have been developing new targets including CD22 CAR-T, or CD19/CD22 dual CAR-T. Additionally, some studies showed that bridging into transplant post-CAR-T could improve leukemia-free survival. Some patients who did not respond to CAR-T therapy were found to have an abnormal conformation of the CD19 exon or trogocytosis. Anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy for R/R B-ALL is effective. From individual to universal CAR-T, from one target to multi-targets, CAR-T-cell has a chance to be off the shelf in the future.","['Zhang, Xian', 'Li, Jing-Jing', 'Lu, Pei-Hua']","['Zhang X', 'Li JJ', 'Lu PH']",,"['Department of Hematology, Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, Hebei 065201, China.', 'Lu Daopei Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100176, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, Hebei 065201, China.', 'Lu Daopei Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100176, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, Hebei 065201, China.', 'Lu Daopei Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100176, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,,"['Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects/*methods', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology', 'Recurrence']",,,2020/01/25 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CM9.0000000000000638 [doi]', '00029330-202002200-00013 [pii]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2020 Feb 20;133(4):474-482. doi: 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000638.,PMC7046249,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relevance of the genetic basis of the disease has come to the forefront recently, with genome-wide studies that have provided a comprehensive view of structural variants, somatic mutations, and different layers of epigenetic changes. The mutational landscape is characterized by relatively common copy number alterations, a few mutated genes occurring in 10-15% of cases, and a large number of genes mutated in a small number of cases. The epigenomic profile has revealed a marked reprogramming of regulatory regions in tumor cells compared with normal B cells. All of these alterations are differentially distributed in clinical and biological subsets of the disease, indicating that they may underlie the heterogeneous evolution of the disease. These global studies are revealing the molecular complexity of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and provide new perspectives that have helped to understand its pathogenic mechanisms and improve the clinical management of patients.","['Nadeu, Ferran', 'Diaz-Navarro, Ander', 'Delgado, Julio', 'Puente, Xose S', 'Campo, Elias']","['Nadeu F', 'Diaz-Navarro A', 'Delgado J', 'Puente XS', 'Campo E']",,"[""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), 08036 Barcelona, Spain; email: nadeu@clinic.cat, jdelgado@clinic.cat, ecampo@clinic.cat."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain; email: diazander@uniovi.es, xspuente@uniovi.es.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain; email: diazander@uniovi.es, xspuente@uniovi.es.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia (IUOPA), Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), 08036 Barcelona, Spain; email: nadeu@clinic.cat, jdelgado@clinic.cat, ecampo@clinic.cat."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain; email: diazander@uniovi.es, xspuente@uniovi.es.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain; email: diazander@uniovi.es, xspuente@uniovi.es.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia (IUOPA), Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), 08036 Barcelona, Spain; email: nadeu@clinic.cat, jdelgado@clinic.cat, ecampo@clinic.cat."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain; email: diazander@uniovi.es, xspuente@uniovi.es.', 'Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Annu Rev Pathol,Annual review of pathology,101275111,IM,,"['DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*physiology', 'Epigenomics', 'Genome, Human/physiology', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation/*physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*cytogenetics', '*epigenomics', '*genomics', '*next-generation sequencing']",2020/01/25 06:00,2020/05/30 06:00,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1146/annurev-pathmechdis-012419-032810 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Pathol. 2020 Jan 24;15:149-177. doi: 10.1146/annurev-pathmechdis-012419-032810.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our purpose was to provide a benchmark for better understanding clinical trial enrollment feasibility and to assess relative levels of competition for patients by cancer diagnosis. METHODS: The Database for Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov, up to date as of September 3, 2017, was used to identify actively recruiting, interventional oncology trials with US sites. Observational studies were excluded because not all are registered. Trials were categorized through Medical Subject Headings or free-text condition terms and sorted by cancer diagnosis. Trials that included more than one cancer diagnosis were included in the overall cohort but excluded when evaluating enrollment by cancer type. Trial enrollment slot availability was estimated between September 1, 2017, and August 31, 2018. Availability was estimated from total anticipated enrollment and duration, assuming a constant recruitment rate. Estimates for studies with both foreign and domestic sites were then prorated to calculate available enrollment in the United States alone. Ratios of the number of newly diagnosed patients in the United States available per trial slot were estimated using the American Cancer Society cancer incidence estimates for 2017. RESULTS: A total of 4,598 interventional oncology trials were identified. Overall, the estimated ratio of newly diagnosed patients available per trial slot was 12.6. Estimated ratios of patients per trial slot for six cancer diagnoses with the highest potential of 12-month US enrollment were as follows: colorectal, 24.7; lung and bronchus, 20.1; prostate, 17.6; breast (female), 13.8; leukemia, 11.6; and brain and other nervous system, 6.0.

We investigated the significance of genetic factors in a large series of AML-MRC cases. METHODS: The morphologic findings, genetic data, and patient outcomes were assessed in 186 AML-MRC cases. RESULTS: The median overall survival (OS) was dismal in AML-MRC patients (median, 7.6 months; 95% confidence interval, 5-10.6 months). Karyotypically normal cases and cytogenetically abnormal cases without myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-related cytogenetic abnormalities showed similar OS, significantly better than cases carrying MDS-related cytogenetic abnormalities. MDS-related cytogenetic abnormalities, monosomal or complex karyotype, and history of MDS or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm were all associated with dismal outcome. CONCLUSIONS: AML-MRC predicts a poor prognosis. Our study supports the finding that the genetic profile plays a key role in determining prognosis in AML-MRC as defined according to the World Health Organization revised fourth edition (2017) diagnostic criteria.","['Fang, Hong', 'He, Rong', 'Chiu, April', 'Viswanatha, David S', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Patnaik, Mrinal S', 'Reichard, Kaaren K']","['Fang H', 'He R', 'Chiu A', 'Viswanatha DS', 'Ketterling RP', 'Patnaik MS', 'Reichard KK']",,"['Division of Hematopathology, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Laboratory Genetics, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Rochester, MN.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Genetics', '*Myelodysplasia-related changes']",2020/01/25 06:00,2020/07/30 06:00,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['5707437 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqz206 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2020 Apr 15;153(5):656-663. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqz206.,,,,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020.

Avadomide (CC-122) is a cereblon-modulating agent with immunomodulatory and direct antitumor activities. This phase 1 dose-expansion study assessed safety and clinical activity of avadomide monotherapy in patients with de novo R/R DLBCL and transformed lymphoma. Additionally, a novel gene expression classifier, which identifies tumors with a high immune cell infiltration, was shown to enrich for response to avadomide in R/R DLBCL. Ninety-seven patients with R/R DLBCL, including 12 patients with transformed lymphoma, received 3 to 5 mg avadomide administered on continuous or intermittent schedules until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or withdrawal. Eighty-two patients (85%) experienced >/=1 grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), most commonly neutropenia (51%), infections (24%), anemia (12%), and febrile neutropenia (10%). Discontinuations because of AEs occurred in 10% of patients. Introduction of an intermittent 5/7-day schedule improved tolerability and reduced frequency and severity of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and infections. Among 84 patients with de novo R/R DLBCL, overall response rate (ORR) was 29%, including 11% complete response (CR). Responses were cell-of-origin independent. Classifier-positive DLBCL patients (de novo) had an ORR of 44%, median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 6 months, and 16% CR vs an ORR of 19%, mPFS of 1.5 months, and 5% CR in classifier-negative patients (P = .0096).

The toxicity profile of the drug is unique and is not observed with any other chemotherapy agent. Furthermore, asparaginase is almost exclusively used in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which is a very rare cancer in adults. Currently, the long-acting pegylated form (pegasparaginase) is the only Escherichia coli-derived asparaginase available in the United States. The use of pediatric regimens is likely to lead to more adult patients receiving multiple doses of pegasparaginase. However, oncologists who treat adults may be reluctant to use pegasparaginase or may unnecessarily discontinue administering it because of certain adverse effects. As a result, the clinical benefit of multiple doses of pegasparaginase will be missed. Despite the fact that pegasparaginase is associated with unique toxicities, the majority are nonfatal, manageable, and reversible. Here, we describe real-life cases of adults with ALL who were treated with pediatric-inspired regimens that incorporated pegasparaginase to illustrate the management of several pegasparaginase-associated adverse effects and guide whether and how to continue the drug.","['Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Douer, Dan']","['Aldoss I', 'Douer D']",,"['Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA; and.', 'Jane Anne Nohl Division of Hematology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy']",,,2020/01/25 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2019/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)62150-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019002477 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Mar 26;135(13):987-995. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019002477.,,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Individuals with MNs due to germline predisposition exhibit increased risk for the development of MNs, mainly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Setting the diagnosis of MN with germline predisposition is of crucial clinical significance since it may tailor therapy, dictate the selection of donor for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), determine the conditioning regimen, enable relevant prophylactic measures and early intervention or contribute to avoid unnecessary or even harmful medication. Finally, it allows for genetic counseling and follow-up of at-risk family members. Identification of these patients in the clinical setting is challenging, as there is no consensus due to lack of evidence regarding the criteria defining the patients who should be tested for these conditions. In addition, even in cases with a strong suspicion of a MN with germline predisposition, no standard diagnostic algorithm is available.

At a median follow-up of 5 months, 43 (35.2%) patients were dead; the 1-year overall survival (OS) was 49.9%. In multivariate analysis, the response to ISV (OR: 0.103; CI: 0.041-0.262) and IFD refractoriness to previous antifungals (OR: 3.413; CI: 1.318-8.838) were statistically significant for OS. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 15/122 patients (12.3%); grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 5 (4%) and led to ISV discontinuation. Our study confirms the safety and tolerability of ISV, also in diseases other than acute leukemia. Phase of hematological disease, gender and refractoriness to previous antifungals are the main predictive factors for the aforementioned response and outcome.","['Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Busca, Alessandro', 'Gramegna, Doriana', 'Farina, Francesca', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Piedimonte, Monica', 'Fracchiolla, Nicola', 'Pagani, Chiara', 'Principe, Maria Ilaria Del', 'Tisi, Maria Chiara', 'Offidani, Massimo', 'Fanci, Rosa', 'Ballanti, Stelvio', 'Spolzino, Angelica', 'Criscuolo, Marianna', 'Marchesi, Francesco', 'Nadali, Gianpaolo', 'Delia, Mario', 'Picardi, Marco', 'Sciume, Margherita', 'Mancini, Valentina', 'Olivieri, Attilio', 'Tumbarello, Mario', 'Rossi, Giuseppe', 'Pagano, Livio']","['Cattaneo C', 'Busca A', 'Gramegna D', 'Farina F', 'Candoni A', 'Piedimonte M', 'Fracchiolla N', 'Pagani C', 'Principe MID', 'Tisi MC', 'Offidani M', 'Fanci R', 'Ballanti S', 'Spolzino A', 'Criscuolo M', 'Marchesi F', 'Nadali G', 'Delia M', 'Picardi M', 'Sciume M', 'Mancini V', 'Olivieri A', 'Tumbarello M', 'Rossi G', 'Pagano L']",,"['Hematology, ASST-Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Center, AOU Citta della Salute e Della Scienza, Torino, Italy.', 'Hematology, ASST-Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Dept of Hematology, San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Hematology, ""Sant\'Andrea"" Hospital-Sapienza, University of Rome, Roma, Italy.', ""Oncoematologia, IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico and University of Milan, Milan, Italy."", 'Hematology, ASST-Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of BioMedicine and Prevention, Tor Vergata University of Rome.', 'Cell Therapy and Hmatology, Ospedale San Bortolo, Vicenza, Italy.', 'Dept of Hematology, AOU Ospedali Riuniti di Ancona, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Careggi Hospital and University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Ospedale S.

A Report from the FRENCH ELAM02 Study Group.,e316,10.1097/HS9.0000000000000316 [doi],"The clinical and biological characteristics of children under 2 years (infants) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are different from those of older children. We aimed to describe the specific characteristics of this population and the potential factors that influence the prognosis. We analyzed data concerning 438 children with newly-diagnosed AML treated in the ELAM02 protocol between March 2005 and December 2011, of which 103 were under 2 years old at diagnosis. The evaluation criteria were overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of infants vs older children. The clinical and biological features were secondary criteria. Infants presented more frequent extra-medullary presentation than older children. They had a significantly higher proportion of skin lesions and central nervous system involvement (15% vs 3%, p < 0.0001 and 26% vs 12%, p = 0.0005, respectively). The global incidence of KMT2A rearrangements was nearly 55% for infants vs 11% for older children (p < 0.0001). Median 5-year OS was 70.4% for infants vs 71.4% for older children (p = 0.83). Five-year EFS was 67% for infants vs 58% for older children (p = 0.27). Infants with AML represent a cohort of patients with specific clinical and biological features. These remarkable differences had no significant impact on their outcome in the ELAM02 protocol.","['Blais, S', 'Boutroux, H', 'Pasquet, M', 'Leblanc, T', 'Fenneteau, O', 'Gandemer, V', 'Bertrand, Y', 'Ducassou, S', 'Michel, G', 'Nelken, B', 'Petit, A', 'Cuccuini, W', 'Gouache, E', 'Renaut, Marceau-A', 'Baruchel, A', 'Lapillonne, H', 'Leverger, G']","['Blais S', 'Boutroux H', 'Pasquet M', 'Leblanc T', 'Fenneteau O', 'Gandemer V', 'Bertrand Y', 'Ducassou S', 'Michel G', 'Nelken B', 'Petit A', 'Cuccuini W', 'Gouache E', 'Renaut MA', 'Baruchel A', 'Lapillonne H', 'Leverger G']",,"['Pediatric Department, Poissy Hospital, Poissy, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Trousseau Hospital (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Trousseau Hospital (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, Inserm, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine, CRSA, F-75012, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Hopital des Enfants, Toulouse, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology Department, Robert Debre Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Biological Hematology Department, Robert Debre Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Rennes, Rennes, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Timone Children Hospital and Research Unit, Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology Department, University Hospital of Lille, Lille, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Trousseau Hospital (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, Inserm, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine, CRSA, F-75012, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Saint-Louis Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Trousseau Hospital (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, Inserm, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine, CRSA, F-75012, Paris, France.', 'CHU Lille, Laboratory of Hematology, Lille, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology Department, Robert Debre Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Trousseau Hospital (AP-HP) Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Trousseau Hospital (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, Inserm, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine, CRSA, F-75012, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191030,United States,Hemasphere,HemaSphere,101740619,,,,,,2020/01/25 06:00,2020/01/25 06:01,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1097/HS9.0000000000000316 [doi]', 'HemaSphere-2019-0129 [pii]']",epublish,Hemasphere. 2019 Oct 30;3(6):e316. doi: 10.1097/HS9.0000000000000316. eCollection 2019 Dec.,PMC6924544,['The authors have no conflict of interest to disclose for this work.'],,,"['Copyright (c) 2019 the Author(s).

Most data on dampened immune responses in CLL come from studies investigating CLL and T cell interactions. Natural killer (NK) cells may be an attractive alternative source of effector cells in immunotherapy in CLL, provided that functionality is retained within the CLL micro-environment. Despite their important role in anti-tumor responses, NK cells are not extensively characterized in CLL. Here, we studied the expression of activating and inhibitory receptors on CLL-derived and healthy control (HC) NK cells, and their functional response towards several stimuli. NK cells from CLL patients have an increased maturation stage, with an expansion of NKG2C(+) NK cells in CMV seropositive individuals. The cytotoxicity receptor NKG2D is downregulated, and the killing capacity through this receptor was markedly reduced in CLL-derived NK cells. In contrast, activation via CD16 (FCgammaRIII) led to adequate activation and functional responses in CLL-derived NK cells. These findings indicate that NK cells in CLL are not intrinsically defect and still perform effector functions upon adequate activating signaling. Clinical relevance of this finding was shown by treatment with novel nanobody-Fc constructs, which induced cytotoxic responses in both CLL- and HC-derived NK cells via CD16. Our results show that NK cells, in contrast to the T cell compartment, retain their function within the CLL micro-environment, provided that they receive an adequate activating signal. These findings warrant future studies on NK cell mediated immunotherapeutic strategies in CLL.","['Hofland, Tom', 'Endstra, Sanne', 'Gomes, Calum K P', 'de Boer, Renate', 'de Weerdt, Iris', 'Bobkov, Vladimir', 'Riedl, Jurgen A', 'Heukers, Raimond', 'Smit, Martine J', 'Eldering, Eric', 'Levin, Mark-David', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Tonino, Sanne H']","['Hofland T', 'Endstra S', 'Gomes CKP', 'de Boer R', 'de Weerdt I', 'Bobkov V', 'Riedl JA', 'Heukers R', 'Smit MJ', 'Eldering E', 'Levin MD', 'Kater AP', 'Tonino SH']",,"['Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunology Institute, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunology Institute, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunology Institute, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunology Institute, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunology Institute, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunology Institute, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunology Institute, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunology Institute, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunology Institute, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunology Institute, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Institute for Molecules, Medicines and Systems (AIMMS), Division of Medicinal Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Result Laboratory, Dordrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Institute for Molecules, Medicines and Systems (AIMMS), Division of Medicinal Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Institute for Molecules, Medicines and Systems (AIMMS), Division of Medicinal Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunology Institute, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'LYMMCARE, Lymphoma and Myeloma Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Dordrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunology Institute, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunology Institute, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'LYMMCARE, Lymphoma and Myeloma Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunology Institute, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunology Institute, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'LYMMCARE, Lymphoma and Myeloma Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191030,United States,Hemasphere,HemaSphere,101740619,,,,,,2020/01/25 06:00,2020/01/25 06:01,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2019/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1097/HS9.0000000000000308 [doi]', 'HemaSphere-2019-0141 [pii]']",epublish,Hemasphere. 2019 Oct 30;3(6):e308. doi: 10.1097/HS9.0000000000000308. eCollection 2019 Dec.,PMC6924557,['The authors declare no conflicts of interests.'],,,"['Copyright (c) 2019 the Author(s).

This study was conducted to isolate L-asparaginase-producing endophytic fungi from medicinal plants of family Asteraceae. Seven healthy medicinal plants from family Asteraceae were selected for the isolation of endophytic fungi using standard surface sterilization techniques. A total of 837 isolates belonging to 84 species were comprised of the stem (55.6%), leaf (31.1%), root (10.6%) and flower (2.7%). Initial screening of L-asparaginase-producing endophytes was performed by qualitative plate assay on modified Czapex dox's agar medium. L-asparaginase activity of fungal endophytes was quantified by the nesslerization method. Identification of endophytic fungi was performed using both morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data including ribosomal DNA regions of ITS (Internal transcribed spacer) and LSU (partial large subunit rDNA), TEF1 (Translation Elongation Factor) and TUB (beta-tubulin). Of the 84 isolates, 38 were able to produce L-asparaginase and their L-asparaginase activities were between 0.019 and 0.492 unit/mL with Fusarium proliferatum being the most potent. L-asparaginase-producing endophytes were identified as species of Plectosphaerella, Fusarium, Stemphylium, Septoria, Alternaria, Didymella, Phoma, Chaetosphaeronema, Sarocladium, Nemania, Epicoccum, Ulocladium and Cladosporium. This study showed that endophytic fungi from Asteraceae members have a high L-asparaginase-producing potential and they can be used as an alternative source for production of anticancer enzymes.","['Hatamzadeh, Sareh', 'Rahnama, Kamran', 'Nasrollahnejad, Saeed', 'Fotouhifar, Khalil Berdi', 'Hemmati, Khodayar', 'White, James F', 'Taliei, Fakhtak']","['Hatamzadeh S', 'Rahnama K', 'Nasrollahnejad S', 'Fotouhifar KB', 'Hemmati K', 'White JF', 'Taliei F']",,"['Department of plant protection, Faculty of plant production, Gorgan University Of Agricultural Sciences And Natural Resources, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Department of plant protection, Faculty of plant production, Gorgan University Of Agricultural Sciences And Natural Resources, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Department of plant protection, Faculty of plant production, Gorgan University Of Agricultural Sciences And Natural Resources, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Department of plant protection, Faculty of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Horticulture, Faculty of Plant Production, Gorgan University Of Agricultural Sciences And Natural Resources, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Department of Plant Biology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, United States of America.', 'Department of Plant Production, Gonbad Kavous University, Gonbad Kavous, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200114,United States,PeerJ,PeerJ,101603425,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Asparaginase activity', 'Colonization frequency', 'Endophytic fungi', 'Fusariumproliferatum']",2020/01/25 06:00,2020/01/25 06:01,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2019/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7717/peerj.8309 [doi]', '8309 [pii]']",epublish,PeerJ. 2020 Jan 14;8:e8309. doi: 10.7717/peerj.8309. eCollection 2020.,PMC6968492,['The authors declare there are no competing interests.'],,,['(c)2020 Hatamzadeh et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MS is usually associated with the concurrent diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but can also present in the absence of bone marrow disease or at relapse of AML.

Central Nervous System (CNS) is the most frequently involved extramedullary location at diagnosis and at relapse. OBJECTIVE: To determine if Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings of optic nerves should contribute to early detection of CNS relapse in pediatric leukemia. METHODS: Twenty patients (10 boys, 10 girls; mean age 8,3 years, range 4-16 years) with proven CNS relapse of leukemia followed up between 2009 and 2017 in our institution were included. Orbital MRI exams performed before and during CNS relapse were reviewed retrospectively. Forty optic nerves with Optic Nerve Sheaths (ONS) and Optic Nerve Heads (ONH) were evaluated on fat-suppressed T2-weighted TSE axial MR images. ONS diameter was measured from the point 10 mm posterior to the globe. ONS distension and ONH configuration were graded as 0, 1 and 2. RESULTS: Before CNS relapse, right mean ONS diameter was 4.52 mm and left was 4.61 mm which were 5.68 mm and 5.66 mm respectively during CNS relapse showing a mean increase of 25% on right and 22% on left. During CNS relapse, ONS showed grade 0 distension in 15%, grade 1 in 60%, grade 2 in 25% and ONH demonstrated grade 0 configuration in 70%, grade 1 in 25% and grade 2 in 5% of the patients. CONCLUSION: MRI findings of optic nerves may contribute to diagnose CNS relapse by demonstrating elevated intracranial pressure in children with leukemia.","['Arpaci, Taner', 'Karagun, Barbaros S']","['Arpaci T', 'Karagun BS']",,"['Department of Radiology, Acibadem University, Acibadem Adana Hospital, Adana, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Haematology, Acibadem University, Acibadem Adana Hospital, Adana, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Imaging Rev,Current medical imaging reviews,101272516,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Early Detection of Cancer/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Male', '*Myelin Sheath', 'Optic Nerve/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Organ Size', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Recurrence']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Central nervous system', '*leukemia', '*magnetic resonance imaging', '*optic nerve', '*pediatric malignancy', '*relapse']",2020/01/25 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2018/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['CMIR-EPUB-94567 [pii]', '10.2174/1573405614666181115114310 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Imaging Rev. 2019;15(2):237-241. doi: 10.2174/1573405614666181115114310.,,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present a case of a 57-year-old Chinese male with myelodysplastic syndrome who manifested an anaphylactic transfusion reaction during the transfusion of platelets. The only abnormality detected during his reaction laboratory workup was an undetectable haptoglobin level in the absence of evidence of hemolysis. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was explored as a method to be able to detect the presence of anti-haptoglobin antibodies in serum. First, haptoglobin was immobilized to the surface of an SPR sensor chip. The patient's serum sample was injected, and the binding response was monitored in real time. Serum samples from five healthy volunteers were used as negative controls. Binding specificity was assessed in competition experiments using soluble haptoglobin. Anti-IgG, -IgA, -IgM, -IgD and -IgE antibodies were used to identify the antibody isotype. RESULTS: An IgG anti-haptoglobin antibody was detected in the patient's serum with SPR. CONCLUSION: SPR provided a rapid, readily available method for the detection of an IgG anti-haptoglobin antibody in an anhaptoglobinemic individual. This confirmed the underlying etiology of the anaphylactic nonhemolytic transfusion reaction and justified the necessity of stringently washed cellular products for all future transfusions and strong caution for future use of plasma-containing products.","['Thoren, Katie L', 'Avecilla, Scott T', 'Klimek, Virginia', 'Goss, Cheryl']","['Thoren KL', 'Avecilla ST', 'Klimek V', 'Goss C']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3435-175X'],"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200123,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,,"['Anaphylaxis/*etiology', 'Antibodies/*blood', 'Asians', 'Haptoglobins/*deficiency/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/therapy', 'Platelet Transfusion/adverse effects', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance/*methods', 'Transfusion Reaction/etiology']",,,2020/01/25 06:00,2020/09/09 06:00,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2019/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.15657 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2020 Apr;60(4):682-687. doi: 10.1111/trf.15657.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review and meta-analyze treatment responses to TKIs in patients with CML and GST gene polymorphisms, including GSTT1, GSTM1, and GSTP1. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched four medical databases, PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and Embase, by using keywords related to GST gene polymorphisms and clinical responses in CML patients receiving TKI treatment. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan version 5.3 and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 3.0. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to examine the association between GSTT1, GSTM1, and GSTP1 polymorphisms and TKI treatment responses in patients with CML. RESULTS: The null polymorphisms of GSTT1 and GSTM1 did not affect TKI treatment responses, while the GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism had a significant impact on responses to TKI. Patients who were GSTP1 variant allele carriers (AG + GG) had poor responses to TKI treatment compared to patients who were wild-type homozygote carriers (AA) (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.31-2.62; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of patients with CML showed that G allele carriers with GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism had significantly worse responses to TKI treatment than wild-type homozygote carriers.","['Lee, Nari', 'Park, Su Min', 'Yee, Jeong', 'Yoon, Ha Young', 'Han, Ji Min', 'Gwak, Hye Sun']","['Lee N', 'Park SM', 'Yee J', 'Yoon HY', 'Han JM', 'Gwak HS']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0278-2563'],"['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, 03760, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Ewha Womans University, 52 Ewhayeodae-gil, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03760, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, 03760, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, 03760, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, 03760, Republic of Korea. lutyp.jm@gmail.com.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, 03760, Republic of Korea. hsgwak@ewha.ac.kr.', 'College of Pharmacy, Ewha Womans University, 52 Ewhayeodae-gil, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03760, Republic of Korea. hsgwak@ewha.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",,France,Target Oncol,Targeted oncology,101270595,IM,,"['Female', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,,2020/01/25 06:00,2021/03/03 06:00,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11523-020-00696-z [doi]', '10.1007/s11523-020-00696-z [pii]']",ppublish,Target Oncol. 2020 Feb;15(1):47-54. doi: 10.1007/s11523-020-00696-z.,,,,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Recent genomic analyses have shown that MDS progression to AML is associated with clonal expansion and clonal evolution. Mutation profiles of MDS change during progression and new mutations in signaling genes and transcription factors emerge. AML transformation can be predicted by several parameters including International Prognostic Scoring System IPSS risk category and transfusion requirements. The prognostic relevance of the acquisition of some gene mutations (i.e., IDH1 and 2, CBL, FT3, RAS, NPM1, TP53, and ASXL1) has to be prospectively validated. The most effective preventive therapy for AML transformation is allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Little is known about the impact of bone marrow blasts in patients with adverse cytogenetics. In this retrospective study, we analyzed 536 patients with high-grade myelodysplastic syndrome to examine the differences in survival for patients with different percentages of bone marrow blasts. The median overall survival in patients with >/= 5% marrow blasts was not statistically different from that for patients with < 5% marrow blasts; however, the former group had a higher risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (p < 0.001). Therefore, cytogenetics is the most important factor in our prognostic tools to determine survival outcomes for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, and patients with high-risk disease have poor prognosis irrespective of their marrow blasts percentage.","['Alkharabsheh, Omar', 'Patnaik, Mrinal M', 'Gangat, Naseema', 'Begna, Kebede H', 'Alkhateeb, Hassan B', 'Shah, Mithun Vinod', 'Hogan, William J', 'He, Rong', 'Greipp, Patricia', 'Nguyen, Phuong L', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Al-Kali, Aref']","['Alkharabsheh O', 'Patnaik MM', 'Gangat N', 'Begna KH', 'Alkhateeb HB', 'Shah MV', 'Hogan WJ', 'He R', 'Greipp P', 'Nguyen PL', 'Litzow MR', 'Al-Kali A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0824-3715'],"['Division of Medical Oncology, University of South Alabama Mitchell Cancer Institute, Mobile, AL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA. alkali.aref@mayo.edu.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20200123,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Blast Crisis/metabolism/mortality/pathology', '*Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['Adverse cytogenetics', 'Marrow blast percentage', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome', 'Revised international prognostic scoring system']",2020/01/25 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2019/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-03917-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-03917-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Mar;99(3):513-518. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-03917-7.

It is difficult to achieve complete remission or longterm survival with conventional chemotherapy, partly due to decreased apoptosis. However, necroptosis can serve as an alternative pathway to induce cell death. The present study investigated whether the selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor chidamide exerted a therapeutic effect on TALL and explored the underlying mechanism. The results revealed that HDAC expression was increased in Jurkat and HUT78 cells treated compared with the control cell line (H9), and was accompanied by elevated cellular Fasassociated death domainlike interleukin1beta converting enzyme inhibitory protein long form (cFLIPL) levels. Chidamide treatment (2 micromol/l) also induced mitochondrial dysfunction, necroptosis and apoptosis in TALL cells in vitro. Furthermore, necroptosis was increased when apoptosis was blocked in TALL cells. Additionally, chidamide (2 micromol/l) downregulated cFLIPL, HDAC1 and HDAC3 expression, and increased receptorinteracting protein kinase 3 expression and the phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domainlike pseudokinase in Jurkat and HUT78 cells. The results obtained in the present study revealed that chidamide may induce necroptosis via regulation of cFLIPL expression when apoptosis is inhibited in Jurkat and HUT78 cells.","['Chi, Zuofei', 'Gao, Hongyu', 'Liu, Hui', 'Wu, Bin', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Gu, Min', 'Yang, Wei']","['Chi Z', 'Gao H', 'Liu H', 'Wu B', 'Zhang B', 'Gu M', 'Yang W']",,"['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110022, P.R.

Concomitant mutations in this gene in the remaining allele have been identified in 1/3 of CLL cases harboring del(11q), being the biallelic loss of ATM associated with adverse prognosis. Although the introduction of targeted BCR inhibition has significantly favored the outcomes of del(11q) patients, responses of patients harboring ATM functional loss through biallelic inactivation are unexplored, and the development of resistances to targeted therapies have been increasingly reported, urging the need to explore novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we generated isogenic CLL cell lines harboring del(11q) and ATM mutations through CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing. With these models, we uncovered a novel therapeutic vulnerability of del(11q)/ATM-mutated cells to dual BCR and PARP inhibition. Ex vivo studies in the presence of stromal stimulation on 38 CLL primary samples confirmed a synergistic action of the combination of olaparib and ibrutinib in del(11q)/ATM-mutated CLL patients. In addition, we showed that ibrutinib produced a homologous recombination repair impairment through RAD51 dysregulation, finding a synergistic link of both drugs in the DNA damage repair pathway. Our data provide a preclinical rationale for the use of this combination in CLL patients with this high-risk cytogenetic abnormality.","['Quijada-Alamo, Miguel', 'Hernandez-Sanchez, Maria',

To what degree failures are associated with pretransplant measurable residual disease (MRD)-a dominant adverse-risk factor-is unknown. We therefore studied 606 adults with intermediate- or adverse-risk AML in morphologic remission who underwent allogeneic HCT between 4/2006 and 1/2019. Sixty-eight (11%) patients had MK AML, the majority of whom with complex cytogenetics. Before HCT, MK AML patients more often tested MRD(pos) by multiparameter flow cytometry (49 vs. 18%; P < 0.001) and more likely had persistent cytogenetic abnormalities (44 vs. 13%; P < 0.001) than non-MK AML patients. Three-year relapse/overall survival estimates were 46%/43% and 72%/15% for MRD(neg) and MRD(pos) MK AML patients, respectively, contrasted to 20%/64% and 64%/38% for MRD(neg) and MRD(pos) non-MK AML patients, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, MRD(pos) remission status but not MK remained statistically significantly associated with shorter survival and higher relapse risk. Similar results were obtained in several patient subsets. In summary, while our study confirms higher relapse rates and shorter survival for MK-AML compared with non-MK AML patients, these outcomes are largely accounted for by the presence of other adverse prognostic factors, in particular higher likelihood of pre-HCT MRD.","['Morsink, Linde M', 'Othus, Megan', 'Bezerra, Evandro D', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Fang, Min', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Mielcarek, Marco', 'Schoch, Gary', 'Storb, Rainer', 'Deeg, H Joachim', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Walter, Roland B']","['Morsink LM', 'Othus M', 'Bezerra ED', 'Wood BL', 'Fang M', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Mielcarek M', 'Schoch G', 'Storb R', 'Deeg HJ', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Walter RB']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8176-6371', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5680-8688', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9343-4099', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9268-3341']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Public Health Science Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Residency Program, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA. rwalter@fredhutch.org.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. rwalter@fredhutch.org.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. rwalter@fredhutch.org.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. rwalter@fredhutch.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200123,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Abnormal Karyotype', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/25 06:00,2020/10/08 06:00,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2019/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0717-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0717-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Jun;34(6):1577-1587. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0717-0.

Alloreactive T cells and cancer cells share a similar metabolic phenotype to meet the bioenergetic demands necessary for cellular proliferation and effector functions. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential co-factor in energy metabolism and is constantly replenished by nicotinamide phosphoribosyl-transferase (Nampt), the rate-limiting enzyme in the NAD salvage pathway. Here we show, that Nampt blockage strongly ameliorates aGVHD and limits leukemic expansion. Nampt was highly elevated in serum of patients with gastrointestinal GVHD and was particularly abundant in human and mouse intestinal T cells. Therapeutic application of the Nampt small-molecule inhibitor, Fk866, strongly attenuated experimental GVHD and caused NAD depletion in T-cell subsets, which displayed differential susceptibility to NAD shortage. Fk866 robustly inhibited expansion of alloreactive but not memory T cells and promoted FoxP3-mediated lineage stability in regulatory T cells.

Ex vivo studies using lymphocytes from GVHD patients demonstrated potent antiproliferative properties of Fk866, suggesting potential clinical utility.

We performed genome-wide methylation profiling of CLL in an Asian cohort for the first time. Eight Korean patients without somatic immunoglobulin heavy chain gene hypermutations underwent methyl-CpG-binding domain sequencing (MBD-seq), as did five control subjects. Gene Ontology, pathway analysis, and network-based prioritization of differentially methylated genes were also performed. More regions were hypomethylated (2,062 windows) than were hypermethylated (777 windows). Promoters contained the highest proportion of differentially methylated regions (0.08%), while distal intergenic and intron regions contained the largest number of differentially methylated regions. Protein-coding genes were the most abundant, followed by long noncoding and short noncoding genes. The most significantly over-represented signalling pathways in the differentially methylated gene list included immune/cancer-related pathways and B-cell receptor signalling. Among the top 10 hub genes identified via network-based prioritization, four (UBC, GRB2, CREBBP, and GAB2) had no known relevance to CLL, while the other six (STAT3, PTPN6, SYK, STAT5B, XPO1, and ABL1) have previously been linked to CLL in Caucasians.

Genomic arrays offer high-resolution genome-wide detection of copy-number alterations (CNAs) and could therefore be well equipped to detect the presence of a CK. Current knowledge on genomic arrays in CLL is based on outcomes of single center studies, in which different cutoffs for CNA calling were used. To further determine the clinical utility of genomic arrays for CNA assessment in CLL diagnostics, we retrospectively analyzed 2293 arrays from 13 diagnostic laboratories according to established standards. CNAs were found outside regions captured by CLL FISH probes in 34% of patients, and several of them including gains of 8q, deletions of 9p and 18p (p<0.01) were linked to poor outcome after correction for multiple testing. Patients (n=972) could be divided in three distinct prognostic subgroups based on the number of CNAs. Only high genomic complexity (high-GC), defined as >/=5 CNAs emerged as an independent adverse prognosticator on multivariable analysis for time to first treatment (Hazard ratio: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.36-3.41; p=0.001) and overall survival (Hazard ratio: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.54-4.17; p<0.001; n=528). Lowering the size cutoff to 1 Mb in 647 patients did not significantly improve risk assessment. Genomic arrays detected more chromosomal abnormalities and performed at least as well in terms of risk stratification compared to simultaneous chromosome banding analysis as determined in 122 patients. Our findings highlight genomic array as an accurate tool for CLL risk stratification.","['Leeksma, Alexander C', 'Baliakas, Panagiotis', 'Moysiadis, Theodoros', 'Puiggros, Anna', 'Plevova, Karla', 'Van der Kevie-Kersemaekers, Anne-Marie', 'Posthuma, Hidde', 'Rodriguez-Vicente, Ana E', 'Tran, Anh Nhi', 'Barbany, Gisela', 'Mansouri, Larry', 'Gunnarsson, Rebeqa', 'Parker, Helen', 'Van den Berg, Eva', 'Bellido, Mar', 'Davis, Zadie', 'Wall, Meaghan', 'Scarpelli, Ilaria', 'Osterborg, Anders', 'Hansson, Lotta', 'Jarosova, Marie', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Poddighe, Pino', 'Espinet, Blanca', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Tam, Constantine', 'Ysebaert, Loic', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Oscier, David', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Schoumans, Jacqueline', 'Stevens-Kroef, Marian', 'Eldering, Eric', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Strefford, Jonathan C', 'Mellink, Clemens', 'Kater, Arnon P']","['Leeksma AC', 'Baliakas P', 'Moysiadis T', 'Puiggros A', 'Plevova K', 'Van der Kevie-Kersemaekers AM', 'Posthuma H', 'Rodriguez-Vicente AE', 'Tran AN', 'Barbany G', 'Mansouri L', 'Gunnarsson R', 'Parker H', 'Van den Berg E', 'Bellido M', 'Davis Z', 'Wall M', 'Scarpelli I', 'Osterborg A', 'Hansson L', 'Jarosova M', 'Ghia P', 'Poddighe P', 'Espinet B', 'Pospisilova S', 'Tam C', 'Ysebaert L', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Oscier D', 'Haferlach C', 'Schoumans J', 'Stevens-Kroef M', 'Eldering E', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Rosenquist R', 'Strefford JC', 'Mellink C', 'Kater AP']",,"['Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam.', 'Dept of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Sweden.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Hospital del Mar, Barcelona.', 'University Hospital Brno, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Dept of Clinical Genetics, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Univ of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dept of Clinical Genetics, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Univ of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Spain.', 'Dept of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Dept of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Dept of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Dept of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Cancer Genomics, Academic Unit of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Dept of Genetics, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Dept of Genetics, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Dept of Molecular Pathology, Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth, UK.', 'Cytogenetics department, St Vincent Hospital Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Oncogenomic laboratory, Dept of Hematology, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), Switzerland.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm.', 'University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Dept. of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Universita Vita-Salute, Milan.', 'Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratori de Citogenetica Molecular, Servei de Patologia, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CEITEC, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'St Vincent Hospital Melbourne, Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, University of Melbourne, Australia.', 'Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, APHP, Paris, France."", 'Dept of Molecular Pathology, Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth, UK.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Oncogenomic laboratory, Dept of Hematology, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), Switzerland.', 'Radboud University Medical Center, Dept of Human Genetics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Dept of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Cancer Genomics, Academic Unit of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton.', 'Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210101,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,['Haematologica. 2021 Jan 01;106(1):7-9.

These include STAT5, MyD88 and IkappaB kinase in macrophages, mast cells, and T cells. There is additional information about roles for STAP-2 in several types of malignant diseases including chronic myeloid leukemia, however, none have been reported concerning B lineage lymphocytes. We have now exploited gene targeted and transgenic mice to address this lack of knowledge, and demonstrated that STAP-2 is not required under normal, steady-state conditions. However, recovery of B cells following transplantation was augmented in the absence of STAP-2. This appeared to be restricted to cells of B cell lineage with myeloid rebound noted as unremarkable. Furthermore, all hematological parameters were observed to be normal once recovery from transplantation was complete. Furthermore, overexpression of STAP-2, specifically in lymphoid cells, resulted in reduced numbers of late-stage B cell progenitors within the bone marrow. While numbers of mature peripheral B and T cells were unaffected, recovery from sub-lethal irradiation or transplantation was dramatically reduced. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) normally suppresses B precursor expansion in response to interleukin 7, however, STAP-2 deficiency made these cells more resistant. Preliminary RNA-Seq analyses indicated multiple signaling pathways in B progenitors as STAP-2-dependent. These findings suggest that STAP-2 modulates formation of B lymphocytes in demand conditions. Further study of this adapter protein could reveal ways to speed recovery of humoral immunity following chemotherapy or transplantation.","['Ichii, Michiko', 'Oritani, Kenji', 'Toda, Jun', 'Saito, Hideaki', 'Shi, Henyun', 'Shibayama, Hirohiko', 'Motooka, Daisuke', 'Kitai, Yuichi', 'Muromoto, Ryuta', 'Kashiwakura, Jun-Ichi', 'Saitoh, Kodai', 'Okuzaki, Daisuke', 'Matsuda, Tadashi', 'Kanakura, Yuzuru']","['Ichii M', 'Oritani K', 'Toda J', 'Saito H', 'Shi H', 'Shibayama H', 'Motooka D', 'Kitai Y', 'Muromoto R', 'Kashiwakura JI', 'Saitoh K', 'Okuzaki D', 'Matsuda T', 'Kanakura Y']",,"['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, International University of Health and Welfare, Narita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Genome Information Research Center, Res Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Japan.', 'Dept of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Dept of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Dept of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Dept of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Genome Information Research Center, Res Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Japan.', 'Dept of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210201,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2020/01/25 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2019/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.225573 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.225573 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Feb 1;106(2):424-436. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.225573.,PMC7849758,,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (STAP2 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known regarding how various ISGs coordinate with one another in developing antitumor effects. Here, we report that the ISG UBA7 is a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. UBA7 encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the covalent conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein product of another ISG (ISG15) to cellular proteins in a process known as ""ISGylation."" ISGylation of other ISGs, including STAT1 and STAT2, synergistically facilitates production of chemokine-receptor ligands to attract cytotoxic T cells. These gene-activation events are further linked to clustering and nuclear relocalization of STAT1/2 within IFN-induced promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies. Importantly, this coordinated ISG-ISGylation network plays a central role in suppressing murine breast cancer growth and metastasis, which parallels improved survival in patients with breast cancer. These findings reveal a cooperative IFN-inducible gene network in orchestrating a tumor-suppressive microenvironment. SIGNIFICANCE: We report a highly cooperative ISG network, in which UBA7-mediated ISGylation facilitates clustering of transcription factors and activates an antitumor gene-expression program.

However, up-front resistance as well as relapse following initial response demonstrates the need for a deeper understanding of resistance mechanisms. In the present study, we report that responses to venetoclax +azacitidine in patients with AML correlate closely with developmental stage, where phenotypically primitive AML is sensitive, but monocytic AML is more resistant. Mechanistically, resistant monocytic AML has a distinct transcriptomic profile, loses expression of venetoclax target BCL2, and relies on MCL1 to mediate oxidative phosphorylation and survival. This differential sensitivity drives a selective process in patients which favors the outgrowth of monocytic subpopulations at relapse. Based on these findings, we conclude that resistance to venetoclax + azacitidine can arise due to biological properties intrinsic to monocytic differentiation. We propose that optimal AML therapies should be designed so as to independently target AML subclones that may arise at differing stages of pathogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE: Identifying characteristics of patients who respond poorly to venetoclax-based therapy and devising alternative therapeutic strategies for such patients are important topics in AML. We show that venetoclax resistance can arise due to intrinsic molecular/metabolic properties of monocytic AML cells and that such properties can potentially be targeted with alternative strategies.","['Pei, Shanshan', 'Pollyea, Daniel A', 'Gustafson, Annika', 'Stevens, Brett M', 'Minhajuddin, Mohammad', 'Fu, Rui', 'Riemondy, Kent A', 'Gillen, Austin E', 'Sheridan, Ryan M', 'Kim,

METHODS: The primary analysis included 890 patients with AL, 225 of whom were the immune PTR (25 %).They are patients in our center from induction to consolidation or transplantation in the past 10 years. Flow cytometry, karyotype characteristics and other basic information were compared between the immune PTR vs control (no-PTR) groups. We analyzed the treatment outcomes of immune PTR including matched platelets, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), increasing apheresis platelet does. RESULTS: Immune PTR is more likely to occur in patients with poor prognosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (P = 0.01).There is a relation between NPM1 mutation and occurrence of immune PTR (P = 0.029).The incidence of PTR at 35-59Y was higher than that at <35Y(OR = 0.68, 95 % CI = 0.48-0.96) and >/=60Y(OR = 0.49,95 % CI = 0.28-0.83), and the difference was statistically significant(P = 0.03, P = 0.01).The Platelet increment with 1 unit (u) was 47.12 %, 2 u increased to 71.14 %, and the matched 2 u (75.11 %) had the best effect. IVIG improved the Platelet increment, but there was no difference between 0.4 g/kg IVIG and 1 g/kg IVIG. Immune PTR is more likely to occur in the ages of 35-60 years. CONCLUSION: There are specific AL patient characteristics which predispose to the phenomenon of immune based PTR. Meanwhile, increasing the IVIG dose could not improve Platelet increment obviously.","['Zhou, Zhenhai', 'Gao, Yixin', 'Li, Xiaoyin', 'Ren, Jun', 'Liu, Yuxuan', 'Li, Juan']","['Zhou Z', 'Gao Y', 'Li X', 'Ren J', 'Liu Y', 'Li J']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 58 zhongshan er ave, Guangzhou, China.

Treatment with dasatinib significantly increased the melanin content and tyrosinase activity through the up-regulation of MITF and tyrosinase expressions. Consistently, dasatinib had clear stimulatory action in the pigmentation of ex vivo cultured skin. The molecular mechanism underlying the melanogenic effect of dasatinib was associated with the ERK-dependent phosphorylation of CREB. The ERK inhibitor PD98059 not only inhibited the phosphorylation of CREB but also abrogated dasatinib-induced melanocyte differentiation. These results demonstrate for the first time the capacity of dasatinib to induce differentiation in normal human melanocytes depending on the activation of ERK-CREB-MITF-tyrosinase signaling cascades.","['Kang, Bogyeong', 'Kim, Yeongeun', 'Park, Tae Jun', 'Kang, Hee Young']","['Kang B', 'Kim Y', 'Park TJ', 'Kang HY']",,"['Department of Dermatology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea; Department of Biomedical Science, The Graduate School, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea.', 'Department of Dermatology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea; Department of Biomedical Science, The Graduate School, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea; Department of Biomedical Science, The Graduate School, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea.

Primary GBM models that represent the true disease state are essential to better understand disease biology and for accurate preclinical therapy assessment. We have previously presented a comprehensive transcriptome characterisation of a panel (n = 12) of primary GBM models (Q-Cell). We have now generated a systematic, quantitative, and deep proteome abundance atlas of the Q-Cell models grown in 3D culture, representing 6167 human proteins. A recent study has highlighted the degree of functional heterogeneity that coexists within individual GBM tumours, describing four cellular states (MES-like, NPC-like, OPC-like and AC-like). We performed comparative proteomic analysis, confirming a good representation of each of the four cell-states across the 13 models examined. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis identified upregulation of a number of GBM-associated cancer pathway proteins.

We examined the anti-obesity and antiproliferative potentials of different fractions (hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, methanol) of N. abor-tristis flower extract for the first time using 3T3-L1 cells, primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from healthy and adult acute myeloid (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients, recombinant Jurkat T cells, and MCF7 cell lines. The in vitro hypoglycemic activity was evaluated using the inhibition of -amylase enzyme and glucose uptake by yeast cells. The percentage glucose uptake and -amylase inhibitory activity increased in a dose-dependent manner in the crude and the tested fractions (hexane and ethyl acetate). Inhibition of the 3T3-L1 cells' differentiation was observed in the ethyl acetate and chloroform fractions, followed by the hexane fraction. Antiproliferative analyses revealed that Nyctanthes exerted a high specific activity against anti-AML and anti-CLL PBMC cells, especially by the hexane and ethyl acetate fractions. The gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis indicated the presence of 1-heptacosanol (hexane fraction), 1-octadecene (hexane and chloroform fractions), and other organic compounds.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has been studied in different cancers, while the role of LIF in OSCC remains unclear. Methods: LIF expression was detected in 100 OSCC samples by immunohistochemistry. Effects of LIF on cell motility were evaluated in OSCC cell lines. High-throughput microarray analysis was also conducted. The correlation between LIF and the downstream effector was analyzed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Results: Patients with OSCC who had lymph node metastasis or advanced cancer stages showed high LIF expression. OSCC patients with higher LIF expression, advanced stage, large tumor size, or lymph node metastasis had significantly shorter overall survival. LIF regulated cancer cell motilities through outside-in signaling. The inhibin beta A subunit (INHBA) gene was identified as a crucial downstream effector of LIF-promoted OSCC progression and restored migration and invasion abilities in LIF knockdown transfectants. Conclusion: LIF enhances regional lymphatic spread, thus leading to an advanced cancer stage. Regulation of LIF downstream molecules such as INHBA inhibits the invasion or migration ability of cancer cells. Thus, LIF can be a potential target in preventing cancer metastasis and spread.","['Lin, Ting-An', 'Wu, Tai-Sheng', 'Li, Yue-Ju', 'Yang, Cheng-Ning', 'Illescas Ralda, Monica Maria', 'Chang, Hao-Hueng']","['Lin TA', 'Wu TS', 'Li YJ', 'Yang CN', 'Illescas Ralda MM', 'Chang HH']",,"['Graduate Institute of Oral Biology, School of Dentistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Dentistry, School of Dentistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Dentistry, School of Dentistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan.', 'Department of Surgery, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei 100, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Dentistry, School of Dentistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Dentistry, School of Dentistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Dentistry, School of Dentistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan.', 'Department of Dentistry, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei 100, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200121,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['INHBA', 'LIF', 'invasion', 'migration', 'oral cancer']",2020/01/25 06:00,2020/01/25 06:01,['2020/01/25 06:00'],"['2020/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/25 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9020295 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9020295 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Jan 21;9(2). pii: jcm9020295. doi: 10.3390/jcm9020295.,PMC7073607,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],['NSC-105-2314-B-002-080/National Science Council'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, the evidence suggests that the uterine-based system regulates embryo implantation and decidualization, while both the uterine- and placental-based systems regulate placentation. Uterine kisspeptin and KISS1R regulate embryo implantation by controlling the availability of endometrial glandular secretions, like leukemia inhibitory factor, which are essential for embryo adhesion to the uterine epithelium. As for decidualization, the data suggest that decidualized stromal cells express KISS1R and secrete kisspeptin-inhibiting decidual cell motility and thereby indirectly regulate embryo and placental invasion of the uterus. Similarly, for placentation, placental kisspeptin and KISS1R negatively regulate extravillous trophoblast migration and invasion and thereby directly control placental invasion of the uterus. Having recognized a significant role for the uterine- and placental-based kisspeptin/KISS1R signaling systems regulating pregnancy, the future looks promising for the development of kisspeptin and KISS1R as prognostic and diagnostic markers of pregnancy disorders and the use of kisspeptin as a therapeutic agent in the prevention and treatment of conditions such as recurring implantation failure, recurrent pregnancy loss, and preeclampsia.","['Radovick, Sally', 'Babwah, Andy V']","['Radovick S', 'Babwah AV']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Laboratory of Human Growth and Reproductive Development, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey.', 'Child Health Institute of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Laboratory of Human Growth and Reproductive Development, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey.', 'Child Health Institute of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200123,United States,Semin Reprod Med,Seminars in reproductive medicine,100909394,IM,,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kisspeptins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Placenta/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Kisspeptin-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",,,2020/01/24 06:00,2020/08/04 06:00,['2020/01/24 06:00'],"['2020/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0039-3400966 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Reprod Med. 2019 Jul;37(4):182-190. doi: 10.1055/s-0039-3400966.

METHODS: Retrospective review of pathology files from a 22-year period identified cases with intraocular lymphoma among all enucleation specimens. Patient demographics, clinical findings, laboratory results, radiographic studies, and indication for enucleation were abstracted from electronic health records; slides were reviewed. RESULTS: Four patients (three women and one man; age range, sixth through eighth decades of life) underwent enucleation with a final diagnosis of intraocular lymphoma. Two patients with primary vitreoretinal large B-cell lymphomas had been treated for refractory uveitis. Specimens showed retinal and subretinal infiltrates by atypical large B-lymphocytes and rare neoplastic cells in the vitreous. The remaining two patients had systemic lymphoproliferative disorders. One patient had chronic lymphocytic leukemia and floaters in his eye; vitreoretinal lymphoma developed, consistent with intraocular Richter transformation. The other had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in remission; however, blurred vision developed, she was treated for panuveitis without improvement, and was later found to have ocular involvement by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Our series details the unusual circumstances when an eye is removed for intraocular lymphoma.

It typically manifests as asymptomatic skin lesions and cytopenias, which result from bone marrow involvement. Less commonly, it will present in lymph nodes or visceral organs as well. Although rare, BPDCN has been discussed more frequently in recent years as new drugs have been developed that could be effective at treating this disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Until recently, treatment for BPDCN commonly included intensive chemotherapy regimens, which are generally reserved for management of acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, in 2018 tagraxofusp (SL-401) was approved as the only treatment specifically indicated for BPDCN. Additional clinical trials are ongoing evaluating the efficacy of newer agents, which could potentially further improve the long-term outcomes for patients with BPDCN.

Recurrently mutated AML genes have functional consequences beyond typical oncogene-driven growth and loss of tumor suppresser function. RECENT FINDINGS: Large-scale genomic sequencing efforts have mapped the complexity of AML and trials of mutation-based targeted therapy has led to several FDA-approved drugs for mutant-specific AML. However, many recurrent mutations have been identified across a spectrum from clonal hematopoiesis to myelodysplasia to overt AML, such as effectors of DNA methylation, chromatin modifiers, and spliceosomal machinery. The functional effects of these mutations are the basis for substantial discovery.

It is now under multiple clinical trials that investigate its anticancer effect against solid tumors and leukemia. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are membrane proteins that are involved in mediating multidrug resistance (MDR). In this article, we reveal that pevonedistat is a substrate of ABCG2 which decreases the therapeutic effect of pevonedistat. The cytotoxicity of pevonedistat was significantly weakened in ABCG2-overexpressing cells, and the drug resistance can be reversed by ABCG2 inhibitors. The ATPase assay suggested that pevonedistat can stimulate ABCG2 ATPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Pevonedistat showed little effect on the expression level or subcellular localization of ABCG2 after 72 h treatment.

Here, we demonstrate the transcriptional regulatory network driven by 2 oncogenic transcription factors, IRF4 and NF-kappaB, in ATL cells. Gene expression profiling of primary ATL samples demonstrated that the IRF4 gene was more highly expressed in ATL cells than in normal T cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis revealed that IRF4-bound regions were more frequently found in super-enhancers than in typical enhancers. NF-kappaB was found to co-occupy IRF4-bound regulatory elements and formed a coherent feed-forward loop to coordinately regulate genes involved in T-cell functions and development. Importantly, IRF4 and NF-kappaB regulated several cancer genes associated with super-enhancers in ATL cells, including MYC, CCR4, and BIRC3. Genetic inhibition of BIRC3 induced growth inhibition in ATL cells, implicating its role as a critical effector molecule downstream of the IRF4-NF-kappaB transcriptional network.","['Wong, Regina Wan Ju', 'Tan, Tze King', 'Amanda, Stella', 'Ngoc, Phuong Cao Thi', 'Leong, Wei Zhong', 'Tan, Shi Hao', 'Asamitsu, Kaori', 'Hibi, Yurina', 'Ueda, Ryuzo', 'Okamoto, Takashi', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Iida, Shinsuke', 'Sanda, Takaomi']","['Wong RWJ', 'Tan TK', 'Amanda S', 'Ngoc PCT', 'Leong WZ', 'Tan SH', 'Asamitsu K', 'Hibi Y', 'Ueda R', 'Okamoto T', 'Ishida T', 'Iida S', 'Sanda T']",,"['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Tumor Immunology, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,['Blood. 2020 Mar 19;135(12):887-889.

The distinction between sex (i.e., biological parameters) and gender (i.e., sociocultural and behavior) is not always taken into consideration in an exercise oncology context, despite its importance for the patient's care. A recent study showed that female survivors were more affected than males by low cardiorespiratory fitness several years after the end of their cancer treatments. This is all the more worrying considering that for a clinically equivalent level of moderate to vigorous physical activities, cardiorespiratory fitness is significantly lower in female survivors, compared with healthy females. Thus, the need for studies that help to better understand the physical deconditioning of female survivors after ALL is an essential aspect of exercise and oncology research. Because female survivors' cardiorespiratory fitness is directly impacted for many years, this article aims at discussing these aspects in an exercise and oncology context with sex and gender consideration.","['Caru, Maxime', 'Curnier, Daniel']","['Caru M', 'Curnier D']",,"['Laboratory of Pathophysiology of Exercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Laboratoire EA 4430-Clinique Psychanalyse Developpement (CliPsyD), University of Paris Nanterre, Nanterre, France.', 'Laboratory of Pathophysiology of Exercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200122,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,IM,,"['Exercise/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gender Identity', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/mortality', '*Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survivors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*exercise oncology', ""*female's cardiorespiratory fitness"", '*pediatric cancer survivorship', '*sex and gender']",2020/01/24 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2020/01/24 06:00'],"['2020/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jayao.2019.0137 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2020 Jun;9(3):441-444. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2019.0137.

Structure-based design was guided by several solved cocrystal structures with Mcl-1, leading to the development of compound 24, which binds both Mcl-1 and Bfl-1 with Ki values of 100 nM and shows appreciable selectivity over Bcl-2/Bcl-xL. The selective binding profile of 24 was translated to on-target cellular activity in model lymphoma cell lines.

With this artificial antibody, highly efficient capture of human hepatocarcinoma SMMC-7721 cells is achieved: as many as 90.3 +/- 1.4% (n = 3) cells are captured when 1 x 10(5) SMMC-7721 cells are incubated on a 4.5 cm(2) hydrogel, and 99% of these captured cells are subsequently released without any loss of proliferation ability. In the presence of 1000 times as many nontarget cells, namely, leukaemia Jurkat cells, the SMMC-7721 cells can be captured with an enrichment factor as high as 13.5 +/- 3.2 (n = 3), demonstrating the superior selectivity of the artificial antibody for the capture of the targeted CTCs.

To examine the clinical effects of NT5C2 mutations in relapsed ALL, we analyzed NT5C2 in 455 relapsed B-cell precursor ALL patients treated within the ALL-REZ BFM 2002 relapse trial using sequencing and sensitive allele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction. We detected 110 NT5C2 mutations in 75 (16.5%) of 455 B-cell precursor ALL relapses. Two-thirds of relapses harbored subclonal mutations and only one-third harbored clonal mutations. Event-free survival after relapse was inferior in patients with relapses with clonal and subclonal NT5C2 mutations compared with those without (19% and 25% vs 53%, P < .001). However, subclonal, but not clonal, NT5C2 mutations were associated with reduced event-free survival in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-2.69; P = .001) and with an increased rate of nonresponse to relapse treatment (subclonal 32%, clonal 12%, wild type 9%, P < .001). Nevertheless, 27 (82%) of 33 subclonal NT5C2 mutations became undetectable at the time of nonresponse or second relapse, and in 10 (71%) of 14 patients subclonal NT5C2 mutations were undetectable already after relapse induction treatment. These results show that subclonal NT5C2 mutations define relapses associated with high risk of treatment failure in patients and at the same time emphasize that their role in outcome is complex and goes beyond mutant NT5C2 acting as a targetable driver during relapse progression. Sensitive, prospective identification of NT5C2 mutations is warranted to improve the understanding and treatment of this aggressive ALL relapse subtype.","['Barz, Malwine J', 'Hof, Jana', 'Groeneveld-Krentz, Stefanie', 'Loh, Jui Wan', 'Szymansky, Annabell', 'Astrahantseff, Kathy', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Khiabanian, Hossein', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Kirschner-Schwabe, Renate']","['Barz MJ', 'Hof J', 'Groeneveld-Krentz S', 'Loh JW', 'Szymansky A', 'Astrahantseff K', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Khiabanian H', 'Ferrando AA', 'Eckert C', 'Kirschner-Schwabe R']",,"['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin-Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin-Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin-Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.', 'Graduate Program in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin-Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Biology, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin-Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin-Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.', 'Graduate Program in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.', 'Institute of Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY; and.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin-Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin-Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,['Blood. 2020 Mar 19;135(12):886-887.

The public list price is US $475000, or more than CaD $600000. Assessing the cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel is necessary to inform policy makers on the economic value of this treatment. Objective: To assess the value for money of tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard care for tisagenlecleucel-eligible pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia under unknown long-term effectiveness. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cost-utility analysis of tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard care using a Canadian population-based registry of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was performed. Results from 3 pooled single-arm tisagenlecleucel clinical trials and a provincial pediatric cancer registry were combined to create treatment and control arms, respectively. The population-based control arm consisted of patients meeting clinical trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, starting at second relapse. Multistate and individual-level simulation modeling were combined to predict patient lifetime health trajectories by treatment strategy. Tisagenlecleucel efficacy was modeled across long-term cure rates, from 10% to 40%, to account for limited information on its long-term effectiveness. Uncertainty was tested with 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Data were collected in September 2017, and analysis began in December 2017. Exposures: Tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard care for tisagenlecleucel-eligible patients. Main Outcomes and Measures: Relative health care costs, survival gains, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) between tisagenlecleucel and current standard care. Results: The treatment and control arms were modeled on 192 and 118 patients, respectively. The mean (SD) age of control individuals was 10 (4.25) years, and the mean (SD) age of the pooled clinical trial sample was 11 (6) years. The control individuals had 78 boys (66%), and the pooled clinical trial sample had 102 boys (53%). Treatment with tisagenlecleucel was associated with an additional 2.14 to 9.85 life years or 1.68 to 6.61 QALYs, compared with current care. The average additional cost of tisagenlecleucel was CaD $470013 (US $357031). Accounting for the total discounted cost over the patient lifetime resulted in an incremental cost of CaD $71000 (US $53933) to CaD $281000 (US $213453) per QALY gain. Conclusions and Relevance: To our knowledge, this study offers the first cost-effectiveness analysis of tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard care for pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia using a constructed population-based control arm. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150000/QALY, tisagenlecleucel had a 32% likelihood of being cost-effective. Tisagenlecleucel cost-effectiveness would fall below $50000/QALY with a long-term cure rate of over 0.40 or a price discount of 49% at its currently known effectiveness.","['Furzer, Jill', 'Gupta, Sumit', 'Nathan, Paul C', 'Schechter, Tal', 'Pole, Jason D', 'Krueger, Joerg', 'Pechlivanoglou, Petros']","['Furzer J', 'Gupta S', 'Nathan PC', 'Schechter T', 'Pole JD', 'Krueger J', 'Pechlivanoglou P']",,"['Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute of Health Policy, Management, and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute of Health Policy, Management, and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute of Health Policy, Management, and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Canada', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*economics', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*economics/therapy', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/24 06:00,2020/12/19 06:00,['2020/01/24 06:00'],"['2020/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['2758837 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2019.5909 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2020 Mar 1;6(3):393-401. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2019.5909.,PMC6990832,,,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'Q6C9WHR03O (tisagenlecleucel)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Landfills, especially if uncontrolled and located near human settlements, may cause an increase in cancer incidence and in various diseases. METHODS: The area of study is represented by the cities of Ghemme (population 6,139) and Cavaglio (population 2,216), in the province of Novara, northern Italy. A solid urban waste landfill is located between these two cities. We analysed mortality data from 1980 to 2013 among subjects residing in the two cities since at least 6 months, according to distance from the landfill. Mortality data was obtained from the National Statistics Institute ( ISTAT). RESULTS: A mortality increase was shown, according to Cox model, in residential areas closer to the landfill. In Cavaglio D'Agogna the total number of cancer deaths occurring in the 0-44 age group and the total death causes were relevant. A significant increase in leukemia cases was detected in Ghemme city. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows an increased risk of diseases (cancer and other diseases), with a possible environmental etiological link.","['Salerno, Christian', 'Palin, Lucio Antonio', 'Esposito, Aniello', 'Cenna, Rosita', 'Cagnazzo, Celeste', 'Cucciniello, Anna Carmela']","['Salerno C', 'Palin LA', 'Esposito A', 'Cenna R', 'Cagnazzo C', 'Cucciniello AC']",,"[""Translational Medicine Deparment, University of Eastern Piedmont 'Amedeo Avogadro', Novara, Italy."", ""Translational Medicine Deparment, University of Eastern Piedmont 'Amedeo Avogadro', Novara, Italy."", 'Local Health Authority of Novara, Italy.', ""Clinical Research and Development Unit, Pediatric Oncohematology, University Hospital 'Citta della Salute e della Scienza' Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, Turin, Italy."", ""Clinical Research and Development Unit, Pediatric Oncohematology, University Hospital 'Citta della Salute e della Scienza' Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, Turin, Italy."", ""Translational Medicine Deparment, University of Eastern Piedmont 'Amedeo Avogadro', Novara, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Ig Sanita Pubbl,Igiene e sanita pubblica,0373022,IM,,"['*Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Italy', '*Solid Waste', '*Waste Disposal Facilities']",,,2020/01/24 06:00,2020/01/29 06:00,['2020/01/24 06:00'],"['2020/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ig Sanita Pubbl. 2019 Sep-Oct;75(5):335-347.,,,,['0 (Solid Waste)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) immuno-oncology therapy with dual specificity for CD19 and CD3 that redirects patients' CD3-positive cytotoxic T cells to lyse malignant and normal B cells. We conducted an open-label, phase 1b/2 study to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and recommended dose of blinatumomab in Japanese adults with R/R B-precursor ALL. Patients received 9 mug/day blinatumomab during week 1 and 28 mug/day during weeks 2-4, with a 2-week treatment-free interval (6-week cycle); patients received 28 mug/day blinatumomab in subsequent cycles. Primary endpoints were the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) in phase 1b and complete remission (CR)/CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) within the first two cycles in phase 2. A total of 26 patients enrolled and 25 (96%) reported grade >/=3 adverse events (mostly cytopenias). There were no DLT. CR/CRh within two cycles was achieved by 4 of 5 patients (80%) in phase 1b and 8 of 21 patients (38%) in phase 2. Among patients with evaluable minimal residual disease, 4 (100%) in phase 1b and 3 (38%) in phase 2 had a complete MRD response. Median RFS for 8 patients who achieved CR/CRh in phase 2 was 5 (95% CI: 3.5-6.4) months; median OS was not estimable. There were no significant associations between maximum cytokine levels or percentage of specific cell types during cycle 1 and response. Consistent with global studies, blinatumomab appeared to be safe and efficacious in Japanese adults with R/R ALL.","['Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Morris, Joan D', 'Oh, Iekuni', 'Maeda, Yoshinobu', 'Minami, Hironobu', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Sakura, Toru', 'Iida, Hiroatsu', 'Tuglus, Catherine A', 'Chen, Yuqi', 'Dos Santos, Cedric', 'Kalabus, James', 'Anderson, Abraham', 'Hata, Tomoko', 'Nakashima, Yasuhiro', 'Kobayashi, Yukio']","['Kiyoi H', 'Morris JD', 'Oh I', 'Maeda Y', 'Minami H', 'Miyamoto T', 'Sakura T', 'Iida H', 'Tuglus CA', 'Chen Y', 'Dos Santos C', 'Kalabus J', 'Anderson A', 'Hata T', 'Nakashima Y', 'Kobayashi Y']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6382-9498', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8630-9145', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6533-1594', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2378-7865']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, California, USA.', 'Jichi Medical University, Tochigi-ken, Japan.', 'Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Medical Oncology/Hematology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine and Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.', 'National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, California, USA.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, California, USA.', 'Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'International University of Health and Welfare, Mita Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200211,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'CD3 Complex/genetics/immunology', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/blood', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Japan', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'blinatumomab', 'clinical study', 'phase 1b', 'refractory', 'relapsed']",2020/01/24 06:00,2020/04/23 06:00,['2020/01/24 06:00'],"['2019/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14322 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2020 Apr;111(4):1314-1323. doi: 10.1111/cas.14322.

However, the risk for noncutaneous second primary malignancies (SPMs) is not as well-understood. METHODS: An observational study utilizing data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was performed, assessing data from patients diagnosed with primary cutaneous MM to measure overall, as well as specific, tumor type and risk of SPM. RESULTS: Of the 132,438 patients recruited in the study population (mean age 55.5 years; 54% male), 23,794 SPMs were observed (O) (18% of patients at a mean age of 68.8 years), while 17,923 SPMs were expected (E) to occur (O : E 1.33, 95% CI 1.31-1.34). Excluding cutaneous MM occurring as a new primary malignancy, there was a significantly increased risk for SPMs among cutaneous MM survivors for each of the following tumor types: eye and orbit melanoma, tracheal, thyroid, salivary gland, retroperitoneum, small intestine, kidney, lymphoid and hematopoietic system, lymphoma overall, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lymphocytic leukemia overall, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, male genital system (including prostate), and breast. Certain gender-specific trends for SPMs were also detected. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with primary cutaneous MM are at increased risk for primary noncutaneous MM as well as noncutaneous SPMs that include numerous tumor types. Enhanced oncologic surveillance for a variety of tumor types in melanoma survivors is warranted.","['Vakharia, Paras P', 'Kelm, Ryan C', 'Orrell, Kelsey A', 'Patel, Kevin R', 'Singam, Vivek', 'Ali, Yasmeen', 'Rastogi, Supriya', 'Yousif, Rame', 'Rangel, Stephanie M', 'West, Dennis P', 'Nardone, Beatrice']","['Vakharia PP', 'Kelm RC', 'Orrell KA', 'Patel KR', 'Singam V', 'Ali Y', 'Rastogi S', 'Yousif R', 'Rangel SM', 'West DP', 'Nardone B']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1509-3791'],"['Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Robert H.

Aims: To investigate the prognostic role of pre-transplant cell-free DNA levels in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: A total of 177 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [median age: 36 (16-66) years; male/female: 111/66] with an initial diagnosis of acute leukemia were included in the study.

In terms of long-term complications, acute myeloid leukemia patients who experienced post-transplant relapse had significantly lower pre-transplant cell-free DNA levels (p=0.024). Overall survival was not statistically different between high- and low- cell-free DNA groups (45.2% vs 22.5; p=0.821). Conclusion: In general, low serum levels of pre-transplant cell-free DNA seem to be associated with transplant-related morbidities and may be considered an adverse prognostic factor for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.","['Yegin, Zeynep Arzu', 'Can, Ferda', 'Gokcen, Sanem', 'Sadioglu, Rezzan Eren', 'Ozkurt, Zubeyde Nur', 'Ilhan, Cigdem', 'Yagci, Munci']","['Yegin ZA', 'Can F', 'Gokcen S', 'Sadioglu RE', 'Ozkurt ZN', 'Ilhan C', 'Yagci M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0212-9663', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9899-1441', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3436-5086', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9761-0320', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9834-6058', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9196-0116', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0458-2920']","['Department of Hematology, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey', 'Department of Hematology, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey', 'Department of Hematology, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey', 'Department of Hematology, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey', 'Department of Hematology, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey', 'Department of Hematology, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200123,Turkey,Balkan Med J,Balkan medical journal,101571817,,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell-Free Nucleic Acids/*analysis/blood', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Graft Rejection/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/physiopathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods/*standards/statistics & numerical data']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*cell-free DNA']",2020/01/24 06:00,2021/04/21 06:00,['2020/01/24 06:00'],"['2020/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2020.2019.8.25 [doi]'],ppublish,Balkan Med J. 2020 Apr 10;37(3):138-143. doi: 10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2020.2019.8.25.

CD19 CAR treatment for B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia has achieved unprecedented remission rates. However, despite success in treating previously relapsed and refractory patients, CD19 CAR faces similar challenges as traditional chemotherapy, in that malignancy can adapt and overcome treatment. The emergence of both antigen positive and negative blasts after CAR treatment represents a need to bolster current CAR approaches. Here, we report on the anti-tumor activity of a CAR T cell possessing 2 discrete scFv domains against the leukemic antigens CD19 and CD123. We determined that the resulting compound CAR (cCAR) T cell possesses consistent, potent, and directed cytotoxicity against each target antigen population both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings indicate that targeting CD19 and CD123 on B-ALL cells may be an effective strategy for augmenting the response against leukemic blasts and reducing rates of relapse.","['Yan, Lulu E', 'Zhang, Hongyu', 'Wada, Masayuki', 'Fang, Liu', 'Feng, Jia', 'Zhang, Wenli', 'Chen, Qi', 'Cao, Yuanzhen', 'Pinz, Kevin G', 'Chen, Kevin H', 'Petrov, Jessica C', 'Chen, Xi', 'Leung, Lai-Han', 'Fan, Xing-Xing', 'Senzel, Lisa', 'Jiang, Xun', 'Ma, Yupo', 'Tse, William']","['Yan LE', 'Zhang H', 'Wada M', 'Fang L', 'Feng J', 'Zhang W', 'Chen Q', 'Cao Y', 'Pinz KG', 'Chen KH', 'Petrov JC', 'Chen X', 'Leung LH', 'Fan XX', 'Senzel L', 'Jiang X', 'Ma Y', 'Tse W']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2635-204X'],"['iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division Long Island High Technology Incubato, 25 Health Science Drive, Stony Brook, NY, 11790, USA.', ""Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China. zyiqu@outlook.com."", 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division Long Island High Technology Incubato, 25 Health Science Drive, Stony Brook, NY, 11790, USA.', ""Department of Hematology, Chengdu Military General Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China."", 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division Long Island High Technology Incubato, 25 Health Science Drive, Stony Brook, NY, 11790, USA.', 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division Long Island High Technology Incubato, 25 Health Science Drive, Stony Brook, NY, 11790, USA.', 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division Long Island High Technology Incubato, 25 Health Science Drive, Stony Brook, NY, 11790, USA.', 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division Long Island High Technology Incubato, 25 Health Science Drive, Stony Brook, NY, 11790, USA.', 'Macau Institute for Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China.', 'Macau Institute for Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China.', 'Macau Institute for Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China.', 'Department of Pathology Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, 11794, USA.', 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division Long Island High Technology Incubato, 25 Health Science Drive, Stony Brook, NY, 11790, USA.', 'iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Research & Development Division Long Island High Technology Incubato, 25 Health Science Drive, Stony Brook, NY, 11790, USA. yupo.ma@icellgene.com.', 'Macau Institute for Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China. yupo.ma@icellgene.com.', 'Department of Pathology Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, 11794, USA. yupo.ma@icellgene.com.', 'Division of Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA. william.tse@louisville.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Stem Cell Rev Rep,Stem cell reviews and reports,101752767,IM,,"['Alemtuzumab/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*immunology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Anti-CD19 CAR and anti-CD123 CAR T cells', '*CD19-CD123 cCAR T cells', '*Immunotherapy', '*Leukemia']",2020/01/24 06:00,2021/06/04 06:00,['2020/01/24 06:00'],"['2020/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12015-019-09948-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s12015-019-09948-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Stem Cell Rev Rep. 2020 Apr;16(2):385-396. doi: 10.1007/s12015-019-09948-6.,,,"['NA/iCell Gene Therapeutics, LLC/International']","['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the major clinical challenges is adequate diagnosis and treatment of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in this disease. Intriguingly, there is little solid evidence on the mechanisms sustaining CNS disease in ALL. Here, we present and discuss recent data on this topic, which are mainly derived from preclinical model systems. We thereby highlight sites and routes of leukemic CNS infiltration, cellular features promoting infiltration and survival of leukemic cells in a presumably hostile niche, and dormancy as a potential mechanism of survival and relapse in CNS leukemia. We also focus on the impact of ALL cytogenetic subtypes on features associated with a particular CNS tropism. Finally, we speculate on new perspectives in the treatment of ALL in the CNS, including ideas on the impact of novel immunotherapies.","['Lenk, Lennart', 'Alsadeq, Ameera', 'Schewe, Denis M']","['Lenk L', 'Alsadeq A', 'Schewe DM']",,"['Department of Pediatrics I, ALL-BFM Study Group, Christian-Albrechts University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics I, ALL-BFM Study Group, Christian-Albrechts University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany. denis.schewe@uksh.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,IM,,"['Central Nervous System/*pathology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Blood-brain-barrier', '*CNS involvement', '*Central nervous system', '*Immunotherapy', '*Tumor dormancy']",2020/01/24 06:00,2020/11/03 06:00,['2020/01/24 06:00'],"['2020/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10555-020-09848-z [doi]', '10.1007/s10555-020-09848-z [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2020 Mar;39(1):173-187. doi: 10.1007/s10555-020-09848-z.,PMC7098933,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study is to report an extremely rare case of a patient with an MS arising in the maxillofacial region before the onset of AML to serve as a guide on how to conduct the initial assessment and diagnosis of similar cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 29-year-old healthy man complained of a ""swelling on the head,"" which was rapidly increasing. He was asymptomatic and never had a previous AML. RESULTS: The patient presented a large mass on the left temporal region. The computed tomography showed a well-delimited lesion extending from the lateral pterygoid muscle and involving the zygomatic arch and lateral orbital rim. The mass was diagnosed as an MS arising before the onset of the AML. CONCLUSION: Masses of a rapid increase in the maxillofacial region should always raise suspicion of being an MS even in asymptomatic patients. Following a protocol of initial assessment and diagnosis will decrease the period between the initial appearance of the MS and effective treatment aimed to prevent or delay the manifestation of leukemia, improving the prognosis and survival of these patients.","['Slusarenko da Silva, Yuri', 'Naclerio-Homem, Maria da Graca']","['Slusarenko da Silva Y', 'Naclerio-Homem MDG']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8307-9134'],"['Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, Traumatology and Prosthesis, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Sao Paulo, Av Prof. Lineu Prestes 2227 Butanta, Sao Paulo, State of Sao Paulo, 05508-000, Brazil. yu.slu@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, Traumatology and Prosthesis, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Sao Paulo, Av Prof. Lineu Prestes 2227 Butanta, Sao Paulo, State of Sao Paulo, 05508-000, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200122,Germany,Oral Maxillofac Surg,Oral and maxillofacial surgery,101319632,IM,"['Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2020 Sep;24(3):381-382.

METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to compare MIDO and standard-of-care (SOC) to SOC alone in France. Per Haute Autorite de Sante (HAS) guidelines, a partitioned survival model with eight health states was used: diagnosis/induction, complete remission, relapse, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), HSCT recovery, post-HSCT recovery (stabilized after HSCT recovery), post-HSCT relapse, and mortality. A lifetime horizon was used beginning at diagnosis with a ""cure model,"", which assumed natural mortality after trial cut-off. Utility values were obtained from a systematic literature review and included disutilities. Resource utilization was based on HAS clinical guidelines and a survey of French physicians and included drugs and administration, adverse events, routine medical care, HSCT, and end-of-life care costs. RESULTS: In RATIFY and after extrapolation, MIDO improved survival compared to SOC, translating into MIDO-treated patients gaining 1.12 life years (LYs) and 1.23 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus SOC. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for MIDO versus SOC was euro68,781 per LY and euro62,305 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed consistency with base case findings. CONCLUSIONS: MIDO represents a clinically significant advancement in the management of newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML. In this analysis, MIDO add-on therapy showed gains in LYs and QALYs versus SOC alone and was found to be a cost-effective option at a euro100,000 per QALY threshold for end-of-life treatment.","['Tremblay, Gabriel', 'Cariou, Clemence', 'Recher, Christian', 'Dolph, Mike', 'Brandt, Patricia', 'Blanc, Anne-Sandrine', 'Forsythe, Anna']","['Tremblay G', 'Cariou C', 'Recher C', 'Dolph M', 'Brandt P', 'Blanc AS', 'Forsythe A']",,"['Purple Squirrel Economics, New York, USA.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Rueil-Malmaison, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole-Centre Hospitalier Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", 'Purple Squirrel Economics, New York, USA.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, USA.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Rueil-Malmaison, France.', 'Purple Squirrel Economics, New York, USA. annaforsythe@pshta.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200122,Germany,Eur J Health Econ,The European journal of health economics : HEPAC : health economics in prevention and care,101134867,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/economics/therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'France', 'Health Expenditures/statistics & numerical data', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Models, Econometric', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Staurosporine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/economics/therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis', 'FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3', 'Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio', 'Life years', 'Quality-adjusted life years']",2020/01/24 06:00,2021/03/10 06:00,['2020/01/24 06:00'],"['2019/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10198-019-01149-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s10198-019-01149-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Health Econ. 2020 Jun;21(4):543-555. doi: 10.1007/s10198-019-01149-9.

Since whole body vibration (WBV) is known to efficiently stimulate the neuromuscular system and enhance cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength in frail individuals, we hypothesized that WBV would maintain various physical and psychological capacities in patients during alloHCT. Seventy-one patients were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (IG) doing WBV or an active control group (CG) doing mobilization exercises five times per week. We determined peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and maximum power, maximum strength, functional performance, body composition, quality of life (QoL), and fatigue. Tests were carried out before conditioning therapy, at hospital discharge and at day +/- 180 (follow-up). As 18 patients did not participate in post-intervention assessment and follow-up data from 9 patients was not collectible, per-protocol (PP) analysis of 44 patients is presented. During hospitalization, WBV maintained maximum strength, height, and power output during jumping, as well as reported QoL, physical functioning, and fatigue level compared with mobilization.

Although many patients achieve remission with chemotherapy, relapse rates are high and the associated impact on survival devastating. Most patients receive chemotherapy and for those whose overall fitness supports it, the most effective treatment to date is allogeneic stem cell transplant that can improve overall survival rates in part due to a 'graft-versus-leukaemia' effect. However, due to the rarity of this disease, and the availability of mature B-cell antigens on the cell surface, few new cancer antigens have been identified in adult B-ALL that could act as targets to remove residual disease in first remission or provide alternative targets for escape variants if and when current immunotherapy strategies fail. We have used RT-PCR analysis, literature searches, antibody-specific profiling and gene expression microarray analysis to identify and prioritise antigens as novel targets for the treatment of adult B-ALL.","['Jordaens, Stephanie', 'Cooksey, Leah', 'Freire Boullosa, Laurie', 'Van Tendeloo, Viggo', 'Smits, Evelien', 'Mills, Ken I', 'Orchard, Kim H', 'Guinn, Barbara-Ann']","['Jordaens S', 'Cooksey L', 'Freire Boullosa L', 'Van Tendeloo V', 'Smits E', 'Mills KI', 'Orchard KH', 'Guinn BA']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6730-367X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6788-6211', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3217-9917', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9255-3435', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6362-4481', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2276-3925', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0639-4541']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Hull, Cottingham Road, Hardy Building, Room 111, Hull, HU7 6RX, UK.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Hull, Cottingham Road, Hardy Building, Room 111, Hull, HU7 6RX, UK.', 'Centre for Oncological Research, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Centre for Oncological Research, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queens University Belfast, Lisburn Road, Belfast, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust and University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Hull, Cottingham Road, Hardy Building, Room 111, Hull, HU7 6RX, UK.

Oral ulcerations were present on vestibular mucosa above teeth 21, 22, 25 and 26 and were 1 cm in diameter, and also around teeth 45 and 46. The patient had prolonged neutropenia due to therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome that progressed to therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia. Initially, the patient was successfully treated with polychemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Unfortunately, many toxic complications ensued, such as peripheral neuropathy, dilated cardiomyopathy and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia. The onset of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome was less than six months after initiation of chemotherapy treatment, which was rather early, but cytogenetic changes (monosomy 5 and 7) were consistent with the diagnosis. Upon admission to our Department, microbiological swabs were obtained and were all negative, while x-ray finding showed that ulcerations did not have dental cause. Biopsy was not obtained as the patient had severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. While viral and fungal swabs were negative, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was cultured from the oral cavity. Thus, differential diagnoses are listed in this report.

It also explores the association between the oral health status of children with leukaemia and their parental education, oral hygiene habits, treatment stage and type of leukaemia. A cross sectional hospital-based study was conducted at the Radiation and Isotope Center Khartoum, Khartoum State. A total of 87 children were included in this study. Data were collected by interviewer questionnaire and clinical examination. The oral health status revealed high prevalence of untreated dental caries (37.9%) and the majority (67.9%) of children had poor oral hygiene. Nearly, all children with leukaemia (93.1%) had never visited a dental health facility in their lives. Regarding the treatment stages of leukaemia, the severity of dental caries was found to be more significant in the maintenance phase, while oral mucositis was more significant in the induction phase.","['Ali, Moataz Hassan Mohammed', 'Nurelhuda, Nazik Mostafa']","['Ali MHM', 'Nurelhuda NM']",,"['Pediatric Dentistry Department.', 'Dental Public Health Unit, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Khartoum, Sudan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Sudan,Sudan J Paediatr,Sudanese journal of paediatrics,101670175,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Children', 'Khartoum', 'Leukaemia', 'Oral health status', 'Sudan', 'Treatment']",2020/01/24 06:00,2020/01/24 06:01,['2020/01/24 06:00'],"['2020/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.24911/SJP.106-1568288518 [doi]'],ppublish,Sudan J Paediatr. 2019;19(2):93-100. doi: 10.24911/SJP.106-1568288518.,PMC6962270,['None.'],,,['Copyright (c) Sudanese Association of Pediatricians.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dual-bromodomain BET inhibitors (DbBi) that bind with similar affinities to the first (BD1) and second (BD2) bromodomains of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDt have displayed modest clinical activity in monotherapy cancer trials. A reduced number of thrombocytes in the blood (thrombocytopenia) as well as symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity are dose-limiting adverse events for some types of DbBi(1-5). Given that similar haematological and gastrointestinal defects were observed after genetic silencing of Brd4 in mice(6), the platelet and gastrointestinal toxicities may represent on-target activities associated with BET inhibition. The two individual bromodomains in BET family proteins may have distinct functions(7-9) and different cellular phenotypes after pharmacological inhibition of one or both bromodomains have been reported(10,11), suggesting that selectively targeting one of the bromodomains may result in a different efficacy and tolerability profile compared with DbBi. Available compounds that are selective to individual domains lack sufficient potency and the pharmacokinetics properties that are required for in vivo efficacy and tolerability assessment(10-13). Here we carried out a medicinal chemistry campaign that led to the discovery of ABBV-744, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of the BD2 domain of BET family proteins with drug-like properties. In contrast to the broad range of cell growth inhibition induced by DbBi, the antiproliferative activity of ABBV-744 was largely, but not exclusively, restricted to cell lines of acute myeloid leukaemia and prostate cancer that expressed the full-length androgen receptor (AR). ABBV-744 retained robust activity in prostate cancer xenografts, and showed fewer platelet and gastrointestinal toxicities than the DbBi ABBV-075(14). Analyses of RNA expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed that ABBV-744 displaced BRD4 from AR-containing super-enhancers and inhibited AR-dependent transcription, with less impact on global transcription compared with ABBV-075. These results underscore the potential value of selectively targeting the BD2 domain of BET family proteins for cancer therapy.","['Faivre, Emily J', 'McDaniel, Keith F', 'Albert, Daniel H', 'Mantena, Srinivasa R', 'Plotnik, Joshua P', 'Wilcox, Denise', 'Zhang, Lu', 'Bui, Mai H', 'Sheppard, George S', 'Wang, Le', 'Sehgal, Vasudha', 'Lin, Xiaoyu', 'Huang, Xiaoli', 'Lu, Xin', 'Uziel, Tamar', 'Hessler, Paul', 'Lam, Lloyd T', 'Bellin, Richard J', 'Mehta, Gaurav', 'Fidanze, Steve', 'Pratt, John K', 'Liu, Dachun', 'Hasvold, Lisa A', 'Sun, Chaohong', 'Panchal, Sanjay C', 'Nicolette, John J', 'Fossey, Stacey L', 'Park, Chang H', 'Longenecker, Kenton', 'Bigelow, Lance', 'Torrent, Maricel', 'Rosenberg, Saul H', 'Kati, Warren M', 'Shen, Yu']","['Faivre EJ', 'McDaniel KF', 'Albert DH', 'Mantena SR', 'Plotnik JP', 'Wilcox D', 'Zhang L', 'Bui MH', 'Sheppard GS', 'Wang L', 'Sehgal V', 'Lin X', 'Huang X', 'Lu X', 'Uziel T', 'Hessler P', 'Lam LT', 'Bellin RJ', 'Mehta G', 'Fidanze S', 'Pratt JK', 'Liu D', 'Hasvold LA', 'Sun C', 'Panchal SC', 'Nicolette JJ', 'Fossey SL', 'Park CH', 'Longenecker K', 'Bigelow L', 'Torrent M', 'Rosenberg SH', 'Kati WM', 'Shen Y']",,"['Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Preclinical Safety, Development Sciences, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Preclinical Safety, Development Sciences, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Preclinical Safety, Development Sciences, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA. yu.shen@abbvie.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200122,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2020 Mar;19(3):166.

Clinically, follicular lymphoma is generally indolent, most often presenting as a painless peripheral lymphadenopathy; however, a leucocytosis at presentation is exceedingly rare. We present the case of a 63-year-old woman with follicular lymphoma with a presenting hyperleucocytosis at diagnosis of 1 327 000/muL demonstrated on laboratory analysis work while hospitalised for progressive weakness. fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) panel was consistent with follicular lymphoma, which was positive for B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 and negative for MYC Proto-Oncogene. Cytoreduction with rituximab-containing therapy was initiated, with the patient ultimately expiring. A leukaemic phase at presentation appears to be associated with poor outcome.

Improving outcomes by targeting mechanisms of drug resistance is a potential solution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report results investigating the epigenetic modulators decitabine and vorinostat with vincristine, dexamethasone, mitoxantrone, and PEG-asparaginase for pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Twenty-three patients, median age 12 years (range, 1-21) were treated in this trial. RESULTS: The most common grade 3-4 toxicities included hypokalemia (65%), anemia (78%), febrile neutropenia (57%), hypophosphatemia (43%), leukopenia (61%), hyperbilirubinemia (39%), thrombocytopenia (87%), neutropenia (91%), and hypocalcemia (39%). Three subjects experienced dose-limiting toxicities, which included cholestasis, steatosis, and hyperbilirubinemia (n = 1); seizure, somnolence, and delirium (n = 1); and pneumonitis, hypoxia, and hyperbilirubinemia (n = 1). Infectious complications were common with 17 of 23 (74%) subjects experiencing grade >/=3 infections including invasive fungal infections in 35% (8/23). Nine subjects (39%) achieved a complete response (CR + CR without platelet recovery + CR without neutrophil recovery) and five had stable disease (22%). Nine (39%) subjects were not evaluable for response, primarily due to treatment-related toxicities. Correlative pharmacodynamics demonstrated potent in vivo modulation of epigenetic marks, and modulation of biologic pathways associated with functional antileukemic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Despite encouraging response rates and pharmacodynamics, the combination of decitabine and vorinostat on this intensive chemotherapy backbone was determined not feasible in B-ALL due to the high incidence of significant infectious toxicities.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated the anti-MM activity of the fully human BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody JNJ-7957 in cell lines and bone marrow (BM) samples. The impact of several tumor- and host-related factors on sensitivity to JNJ-7957 therapy was also evaluated. RESULTS: We show that JNJ-7957 has potent activity against 4 MM cell lines, against tumor cells in 48 of 49 BM samples obtained from MM patients, and in 5 of 6 BM samples obtained from primary plasma cell leukemia patients. JNJ-7957 activity was significantly enhanced in patients with prior daratumumab treatment, which was partially due to enhanced killing capacity of daratumumab-exposed effector cells. BCMA expression did not affect activity of JNJ-7957. High T-cell frequencies and high effector:target ratios were associated with improved JNJ-7957-mediated lysis of MM cells. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis had a modest negative impact on JNJ-7957 activity against tumor cells from daratumumab-naive MM patients. Soluble BCMA impaired the ability of JNJ-7957 to kill MM cells, although higher concentrations were able to overcome this negative effect. CONCLUSIONS: JNJ-7957 effectively kills MM cells ex vivo, including those from heavily pretreated MM patients, whereby several components of the immunosuppressive BM microenvironment had only modest effects on its killing capacity. Our findings support the ongoing trial with JNJ-7957 as single agent and provide the preclinical rationale for evaluating JNJ-7957 in combination with daratumumab in MM.","['Frerichs, Kristine A', 'Broekmans, Marloes E C', 'Marin Soto, Jhon A', 'van Kessel, Berris', 'Heymans, Martijn W', 'Holthof, Lisa C', 'Verkleij, Christie P M', 'Boominathan, Rengasamy', 'Vaidya, Bhavesh', 'Sendecki, Jocelyn', 'Axel, Amy', 'Gaudet, Francois', 'Pillarisetti, Kodandaram', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Adams, Homer C 3rd', 'Mutis, Tuna', 'van de Donk, Niels W C J']","['Frerichs KA', 'Broekmans MEC', 'Marin Soto JA', 'van Kessel B', 'Heymans MW', 'Holthof LC', 'Verkleij CPM', 'Boominathan R', 'Vaidya B', 'Sendecki J', 'Axel A', 'Gaudet F', 'Pillarisetti K', 'Zweegman S', 'Adams HC 3rd', 'Mutis T', 'van de Donk NWCJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5011-1820', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0506-4591']","['Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Janssen Research and Development, LLC, Spring House, Pennsylvania.', 'Janssen Research and Development, LLC, Spring House, Pennsylvania.', 'Janssen Research and Development, LLC, Spring House, Pennsylvania.', 'Janssen Research and Development, LLC, Spring House, Pennsylvania.', 'Janssen Research and Development, LLC, Spring House, Pennsylvania.', 'Janssen Research and Development, LLC, Spring House, Pennsylvania.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Janssen Research and Development, LLC, Spring House, Pennsylvania.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. n.vandedonk@amsterdamumc.nl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200122,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'B-Cell Maturation Antigen/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2020/01/24 06:00,2021/02/07 06:00,['2020/01/24 06:00'],"['2019/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-19-2299 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-2299 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2020 May 1;26(9):2203-2215. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-2299.

It is now established that this phenotype is associated with enhanced PA smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) proliferation and suppressed apoptosis. This phenotype is sustained in part by the activation of several DNA repair pathways allowing PASMCs to survive despite the unfavorable environmental conditions. PIM1 (Moloney murine leukemia provirus integration site) is an oncoprotein upregulated in PAH and involved in many prosurvival pathways, including DNA repair. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the implication of PIM1 in the DNA damage response and the beneficial effect of its inhibition by pharmacological inhibitors in human PAH-PASMCs and in rat PAH models. Approach and Results: We found in vitro that PIM1 inhibition by either SGI-1776, TP-3654, siRNA (silencer RNA) decreased the phosphorylation of its newly identified direct target KU70 (lupus Ku autoantigen protein p70) resulting in the inhibition of double-strand break repair (Comet Assay) by the nonhomologous end-joining as well as reduction of PAH-PASMCs proliferation (Ki67-positive cells) and resistance to apoptosis (Annexin V positive cells) of PAH-PASMCs. In vivo, SGI-1776 and TP-3654 given 3x a week, improved significantly pulmonary hemodynamics (right heart catheterization) and vascular remodeling (Elastica van Gieson) in monocrotaline and Fawn-Hooded rat models of PAH. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that PIM1 phosphorylates KU70 and initiates DNA repair signaling in PAH-PASMCs and that PIM1 inhibitors represent a therapeutic option for patients with PAH.","['Lampron, Marie-Claude', 'Vitry, Geraldine', 'Nadeau, Valerie', 'Grobs, Yann', 'Paradis, Renee', 'Samson, Nolwenn', 'Tremblay, Eve', 'Boucherat, Olivier', 'Meloche, Jolyane', 'Bonnet, Sebastien', 'Provencher, Steeve', 'Potus, Francois', 'Paulin, Roxane']","['Lampron MC', 'Vitry G', 'Nadeau V', 'Grobs Y', 'Paradis R', 'Samson N', 'Tremblay E', 'Boucherat O', 'Meloche J', 'Bonnet S', 'Provencher S', 'Potus F', 'Paulin R']",,"['From the Department of Medicine, Pulmonary Hypertension and Vascular Biology Research Group, Heart and Lung Institute of Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (M.-C.L., G.V., V.N., Y.G., R.P., N.S., E.T., O.B., S.B., S.P., F.P., R.P.).', 'From the Department of Medicine, Pulmonary Hypertension and Vascular Biology Research Group, Heart and Lung Institute of Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (M.-C.L., G.V., V.N., Y.G., R.P., N.S., E.T., O.B., S.B., S.P., F.P., R.P.).', 'From the Department of Medicine, Pulmonary Hypertension and Vascular Biology Research Group, Heart and Lung Institute of Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (M.-C.L., G.V., V.N., Y.G., R.P., N.S., E.T., O.B., S.B., S.P., F.P., R.P.).', 'From the Department of Medicine, Pulmonary Hypertension and Vascular Biology Research Group, Heart and Lung Institute of Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (M.-C.L., G.V., V.N., Y.G., R.P., N.S., E.T., O.B., S.B., S.P., F.P., R.P.).', 'From the Department of Medicine, Pulmonary Hypertension and Vascular Biology Research Group, Heart and Lung Institute of Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (M.-C.L., G.V., V.N., Y.G., R.P., N.S., E.T., O.B., S.B., S.P., F.P., R.P.).', 'From the Department of Medicine, Pulmonary Hypertension and Vascular Biology Research Group, Heart and Lung Institute of Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (M.-C.L., G.V., V.N., Y.G., R.P., N.S., E.T., O.B., S.B., S.P., F.P., R.P.).', 'From the Department of Medicine, Pulmonary Hypertension and Vascular Biology Research Group, Heart and Lung Institute of Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (M.-C.L., G.V., V.N., Y.G., R.P., N.S., E.T., O.B., S.B., S.P., F.P., R.P.).', 'From the Department of Medicine, Pulmonary Hypertension and Vascular Biology Research Group, Heart and Lung Institute of Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (M.-C.L., G.V., V.N., Y.G., R.P., N.S., E.T., O.B., S.B., S.P., F.P., R.P.).', 'Department of Fundamental Sciences, Universite du Quebec a Chicoutimi, Saguenay, Quebec, Canada (J.M.).', 'From the Department of Medicine, Pulmonary Hypertension and Vascular Biology Research Group, Heart and Lung Institute of Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (M.-C.L., G.V., V.N., Y.G., R.P., N.S., E.T., O.B., S.B., S.P., F.P., R.P.).', 'From the Department of Medicine, Pulmonary Hypertension and Vascular Biology Research Group, Heart and Lung Institute of Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (M.-C.L., G.V., V.N., Y.G., R.P., N.S., E.T., O.B., S.B., S.P., F.P., R.P.).', 'From the Department of Medicine, Pulmonary Hypertension and Vascular Biology Research Group, Heart and Lung Institute of Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (M.-C.L., G.V., V.N., Y.G., R.P., N.S., E.T., O.B., S.B., S.P., F.P., R.P.).', 'From the Department of Medicine, Pulmonary Hypertension and Vascular Biology Research Group, Heart and Lung Institute of Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (M.-C.L., G.V., V.N., Y.G., R.P., N.S., E.T., O.B., S.B., S.P., F.P., R.P.).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200123,United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,IM,['Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2020 Mar;40(3):500-502.

We have previously shown how the combination of two redeployed drugs, the contraceptive steroid medroxyprogesterone and the lipid-regulating drug bezafibrate exert anti-leukaemic effects by producing ROS. Here we report a (13) C-tracer-based NMR metabolic study to understand how these drugs work in K562 leukaemia cells. Our study shows that [1,2-(13) C]glucose is incorporated into ribose sugars, indicating activity in oxidative and non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathways alongside lactate production. There is little label incorporation into the tricarboxylic acid cycle from glucose, but much greater incorporation arises from the use of [3-(13) C]glutamine. The combined medroxyprogesterone and bezafibrate treatment decreases label incorporation from both glucose and glutamine into alpha-ketoglutarate and increased that for succinate, which is consistent with ROS-mediated conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinate. Most interestingly, this combined treatment drastically reduced the production of several pyrimidine synthesis intermediates.","['Carrigan, John B', 'Reed, Michelle A C', 'Ludwig, Christian', 'Khanim, Farhat L', 'Bunce, Christopher M', 'Gunther, Ulrich L']","['Carrigan JB', 'Reed MAC', 'Ludwig C', 'Khanim FL', 'Bunce CM', 'Gunther UL']",,"['Institute of Cancer and Genomics Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomics Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Metabolism and Systems Biology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomics Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160322,Germany,Chempluschem,ChemPlusChem,101580948,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['NMR spectroscopy', 'cancer', 'isotopic tracers', 'leukaemia', 'metabolism']",2016/05/01 00:00,2016/05/01 00:01,['2020/01/24 06:00'],"['2015/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/cplu.201500549 [doi]'],ppublish,Chempluschem. 2016 May;81(5):453-459. doi: 10.1002/cplu.201500549.

Here, we present an unexpected role of VDR in normal hematopoiesis and in leukemogenesis. Limited VDR expression is associated with impaired myeloid progenitor differentiation and is a new prognostic factor in AML. In mice, the lack of Vdr results in increased numbers of hematopoietic and leukemia stem cells and quiescent hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, malignant transformation of Vdr(-/-) cells results in myeloid differentiation block and increases self-renewal. Vdr promoter is methylated in AML as in CD34(+) cells, and demethylating agents induce VDR expression. Association of VDR agonists with hypomethylating agents promotes leukemia stem cell exhaustion and decreases tumor burden in AML mouse models. Thus, Vdr functions as a regulator of stem cell homeostasis and leukemic propagation.","['Paubelle, Etienne', 'Zylbersztejn, Florence', 'Maciel, Thiago Trovati', 'Carvalho, Caroline', 'Mupo, Annalisa', 'Cheok, Meyling', 'Lieben, Liesbet', 'Sujobert, Pierre', 'Decroocq, Justine', 'Yokoyama, Akihiko', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Tamburini, Jerome', 'Bardet, Valerie', 'Castaigne, Sylvie', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Carmeliet, Geert', 'Bouscary, Didier', 'Ginzburg, Yelena Z', 'de The, Hughes', 'Benhamou, Marc', 'Monteiro, Renato C', 'Vassiliou, George S', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Moura, Ivan C']","['Paubelle E', 'Zylbersztejn F', 'Maciel TT', 'Carvalho C', 'Mupo A', 'Cheok M', 'Lieben L', 'Sujobert P', 'Decroocq J', 'Yokoyama A', 'Asnafi V', 'Macintyre E', 'Tamburini J', 'Bardet V', 'Castaigne S', 'Preudhomme C', 'Dombret H', 'Carmeliet G', 'Bouscary D', 'Ginzburg YZ', 'de The H', 'Benhamou M', 'Monteiro RC', 'Vassiliou GS', 'Hermine O', 'Moura IC']",,"['INSERM UMR 1163, Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Hematological Disorders and Therapeutical Implications, 75015 Paris, France; Paris Descartes - Sorbonne Paris Cite University, Imagine Institute, 75015 Paris, France; CNRS ERL 8254, Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Hematological Disorders and Therapeutical Implications, 75015 Paris, France; Department of Clinical Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Necker, 75015 Paris, France.

Our study groups consisted of 32 samples: 12 asymptomatic cows, 12 cows with lymphocytosis and 8 samples of tumor tissue of the abomasum and heart of cattle with lymphoma. We designed three pairs of primers to amplify the complete BLV env gene, and obtained a fragment of 1548 nucleotides in length with the sequenced products. According to the phylogenetic tree we constructed to identify the viral genotype, 96.87 % of the sequences grouped into genotype 1, while a single sample from a cow with lymphocytosis (3.13 %) was associated with genotype 3 sequences. The similarity between the Mexican BLV sequences ranged from 0.985-1.00. In addition, the proportion of non-synonymous and synonymous mutations indicated negative selection. We did not identify any conserved residues in the viral protein sequences that could be related to BLV infection stage in cattle. Proviral quantification was performed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and we used Mood s median test as statistical analysis. We found no significant association between proviral load and phase of infection. The sequences showed high similarity without any association between BLV surface glycoprotein and the different infection stages, nor differences in the proviral load. BLV genotype 1 was identified as prevalent in the studied samples, and for the first time in Mexico, we identified BLV genotype 3 in cattle.","['Ceron Tellez, Fernando', 'Gonzalez Mendez, Ana Silvia', 'Tortora Perez, Jorge Luis', 'Loza-Rubio, Elizabeth', 'Ramirez Alvarez, Hugo']","['Ceron Tellez F', 'Gonzalez Mendez AS', 'Tortora Perez JL', 'Loza-Rubio E', 'Ramirez Alvarez H']",,"['Virology, Genetics and Molecular Biology Laboratory, Faculty of Higher Education, Cuautitlan, Veterinary Medicine, Campus 4, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Km. 2.5 Carretera Cuautitlan-Teoloyucan San Sebastian Xhala, Cuautitlan Izcalli Estado de Mexico, C.P. 54714, Mexico.

METHODS: hBM-MSCs-Exo was isolated by ultra-centrifugation and administered into THP-1 cells to elucidate the effects of exosomes in THP-1 cells. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression of miR-222-3p, IRF2, and INPP4B were measured by qRT-PCR and western blot. The interaction between miR-222-3p and IRF2 was analyzed by luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: Lower cell viability rate, higher apoptosis ratio, higher miR-222-3p expression, and lower IRF1/INPP4B expression were observed in THP-1 cells exposed to BM-MSCs-Exo. The proliferation-inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of BM-MSCs-Exo on THP-1 cells were markedly compromised when miR-222-3p expression in BM-MSCs-Exo was inhibited. Furthermore, miR-222-3p directly targeted IRF2 and negatively regulated IRF2/INPP4B signaling in THP-1 cells. Moreover, overexpression of either IRF2 or INPP4B counteracted the proliferation-inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects mediated by BM-MSCs-Exo. CONCLUSION: BM-MSCs delivered miR-222-3p via exosomes to inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell apoptosis by targeting IRF2 and negatively regulating IRF2/INPP4B signaling in THP-1 cells.","['Zhang, Feng', 'Lu, Yaqin', 'Wang, Meng', 'Zhu, Junfeng', 'Li, Jiajia', 'Zhang, Pingping', 'Yuan, Yuan', 'Zhu, Fangbing']","['Zhang F', 'Lu Y', 'Wang M', 'Zhu J', 'Li J', 'Zhang P', 'Yuan Y', 'Zhu F']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, 233004, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, 233004, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, 233004, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, 233004, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, 233004, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, 233004, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, 233004, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, 233004, Anhui, China.

Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the immune environment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) bone marrow (BM) at diagnosis. We compared the immunologic landscape of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded BM trephine samples from AML (n = 69), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; n = 56), and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients (n = 52) at diagnosis to controls (n = 12) with 30 immunophenotype markers using multiplex immunohistochemistry and computerized image analysis. We identified distinct immunologic profiles specific for leukemia subtypes and controls enabling accurate classification of AML (area under the curve [AUC] = 1.0), CML (AUC = 0.99), B-ALL (AUC = 0.96), and control subjects (AUC = 1.0). Interestingly, 2 major immunologic AML clusters differing in age, T-cell receptor clonality, and survival were discovered. A low proportion of regulatory T cells and pSTAT1+cMAF- monocytes were identified as novel biomarkers of superior event-free survival in intensively treated AML patients. Moreover, we demonstrated that AML BM and peripheral blood samples are dissimilar in terms of immune cell phenotypes. To conclude, our study shows that the immunologic landscape considerably varies by leukemia subtype suggesting disease-specific immunoregulation. Furthermore, the association of the AML immune microenvironment with clinical parameters suggests a rationale for including immunologic parameters to improve disease classification or even patient risk stratification.","['Bruck, Oscar', 'Dufva, Olli', 'Hohtari, Helena', 'Blom, Sami', 'Turkki, Riku', 'Ilander, Mette', 'Kovanen, Panu', 'Pallaud, Celine', 'Ramos, Pedro Marques', 'Lahteenmaki, Hanna', 'Valimaki, Katja', 'El Missiry, Mohamed', 'Ribeiro, Antonio', 'Kallioniemi, Olli', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Pellinen, Teijo', 'Mustjoki, Satu']","['Bruck O', 'Dufva O', 'Hohtari H', 'Blom S', 'Turkki R', 'Ilander M', 'Kovanen P', 'Pallaud C', 'Ramos PM', 'Lahteenmaki H', 'Valimaki K', 'El Missiry M', 'Ribeiro A', 'Kallioniemi O', 'Porkka K', 'Pellinen T', 'Mustjoki S']",,"['Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'iCAN Digital Precision Cancer Medicine Flagship, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'iCAN Digital Precision Cancer Medicine Flagship, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Pathology, HUSLAB and Haartman Institute, Helsinki University Hospital, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden; and.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'iCAN Digital Precision Cancer Medicine Flagship, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'iCAN Digital Precision Cancer Medicine Flagship, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/23 06:00,2021/04/15 06:00,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31658-X [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000792 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Jan 28;4(2):274-286. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000792.,PMC6988390,,,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in the initial Phase I/II clinical trials, some patients without FLT3 mutations had transient responses to midostaurin, suggesting that this multi-targeted kinase inhibitor might benefit AML patients more broadly. Here, we demonstrate submicromolar efficacy of midostaurin in vitro and efficacy in vivo against wild-type (wt) FLT3-expressing AML cell lines and primary cells, and we compare its effectiveness with that of other FLT3 inhibitors currently in clinical trials. Midostaurin was found to synergize with standard chemotherapeutic drugs and some targeted agents against AML cells without mutations in FLT3. The mechanism may involve, in part, the unique kinase profile of midostaurin that includes proteins implicated in AML transformation, such as SYK or KIT, or inhibition of ERK pathway or proviability signalling. Our findings support further investigation of midostaurin as a chemosensitizing agent in AML patients without FLT3 mutations.","['Weisberg, Ellen', 'Meng, Chengcheng', 'Case, Abigail E', 'Tiv, Hong L', 'Gokhale, Prafulla C', 'Buhrlage, Sara J', 'Yang, Jing', 'Liu, Xiaoxi', 'Wang, Jinhua', 'Gray, Nathanael', 'Adamia, Sophia', 'Sattler, Martin', 'Stone, Richard', 'Griffin, James D']","['Weisberg E', 'Meng C', 'Case AE', 'Tiv HL', 'Gokhale PC', 'Buhrlage SJ', 'Yang J', 'Liu X', 'Wang J', 'Gray N', 'Adamia S', 'Sattler M', 'Stone R', 'Griffin JD']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5679-9531'],"['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Experimental Therapeutic Core, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Experimental Therapeutic Core, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200122,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,IM,,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation/drug effects', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Sorafenib/pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Syk Kinase/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*SYK', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*crenolanib', '*gilteritinib', '*midostaurin', '*non-mutant FLT3', '*quizartinib', '*sorafenib', '*synergy']",2020/01/23 06:00,2021/04/29 06:00,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.14927 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2020 Mar;24(5):2968-2980. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.14927.

Eleven agents have been categorized by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in Group 1, 3 in Group 2A and 4 in Group 2B. We previously estimated that the incidence of cancers associated with infectious agents accounted for the 8.5% of new cancer cases diagnosed in Italy in 2014. Methods: In the present study we evaluated the incidence of cancer in Italy and in the 20 Italian regions in 2018, based on the data of Cancer Registries, and calculated the fraction attributable to infectious agents. Results: Cancers of infectious origin contributed to the overall burden of cancer in Italy with more than 27,000 yearly cases, the 92% of which was attributable to Helicobacter pylori, human papillomaviruses, and hepatitis B and C viruses. With the exception of papillomavirus-related cancers, the incidence of cancers of infectious origin was higher in males (16,000 cases) than in females (11,000 cases). There were regional and geographical variations of cancers depending on the type of cancer and on the gender. Nevertheless, the overall figures were rather similar, the infection-related cancers accounting for the 7.2, 7.6, and 7.1% of all cancers in Northern, Central, and Southern Italy, respectively. Conclusions: The estimate of the incidence of cancers attributable to infectious agents in Italy in 2018 (7.3% of all cancer cases) is approximately half of the worldwide burden, which has been estimated by IARC to be the 15.4% of all cancer cases in 2012.","['DE Flora, S', 'LA Maestra, S', 'Crocetti, E', 'Mangone, L', 'Bianconi, F', 'Stracci, F', 'Buzzoni, C']","['DE Flora S', 'LA Maestra S', 'Crocetti E', 'Mangone L', 'Bianconi F', 'Stracci F', 'Buzzoni C']",,"['Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Romagna Cancer Registry, Romagna Cancer Institute (Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, IRST, IRCCS), Meldola, Forli, Italy.', 'Epidemiology Unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Independent Researcher, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of Public Health, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Oncological Network, Prevention and Research Institute (ISPRO), Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191220,Italy,J Prev Med Hyg,Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,9214440,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/complications', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Helicobacter Infections/complications', 'Helicobacter pylori', 'Hepatitis B/complications', 'Hepatitis C/complications', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infections/*complications', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/etiology', 'Liver Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/epidemiology/etiology', 'Malaria, Falciparum/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Papillomavirus Infections/complications', 'Penile Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/epidemiology/etiology', 'Sex Distribution', 'Stomach Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Vaginal Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Vulvar Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer incidence', 'Chronic infections and cancer', 'Infection-related cancers', 'Italy', 'Regional distribution']",2020/01/23 06:00,2020/07/04 06:00,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.15167/2421-4248/jpmh2019.60.4.1434 [doi]'],epublish,J Prev Med Hyg. 2019 Dec 20;60(4):E311-E326. doi: 10.15167/2421-4248/jpmh2019.60.4.1434. eCollection 2019 Dec.,PMC6953451,,,,"['(c)2019 Pacini Editore SRL, Pisa, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this widespread awareness, the diagnosis remains a continuous challenge, especially when a metastatic melanoma with rare morphology is examined. We report a case of a 64-year-old man with a lung mass and right-sided pleural effusion who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for pleural decortication. The history of melanoma was not reported to us. Microscopic examination revealed sheets of small round blue cells infiltrating into the adipose tissue in a lace-like pattern mimicking lymphoblastic lymphoma. Immunohistochemical stains for melanocytic markers, including S-100 protein, Mart-1, and HMB-45, highlighted the neoplastic cells. The tumor was also positive for CD56 and CD117, but negative for pancytokeratin, CD45, cytokeratin 8, TTF-1, WT1, CD34, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and neuron-specific enolase.

METHODS: We reported a HL patient after treatment that developed the second, third, and fourth malignancies (chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and gastric adenocarcinoma) in relatively short time (75 months). The diagnosis was confirmed by pathology, bone marrow morphology, flow cytometry, karyotype and fusion gene examination. RESULTS: He received surgery and chemotherapy. He achieved good response for triple malignancies. After diagnosis with gastric cancer, he orally administered compound tegafur capsule, apatinib and imatinib. CONCLUSION: The fourth malignancy of HL patient is extremely rare.

Surgical removing assisted with chemotherapy/radiotherapy was the major therapeutics regardless of high mortality. MLLT3 was one of the most common partners fused with mixed lineage leukemia gene and caused leukemia. But its role in osteosarcoma was not previously reported. In this study, we found that MLLT3 was expressed abundantly in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines including U-2OS, MG-63, Saos-2 and HOS. And by Kaplan-Meier analysis, MLLT3 expression was shown to be clinically correlated with survival of osteosarcoma patients. The 5-year survival rate was 64.3% for patients with low MLLT3 expression (n=14) while it was 36.4% for patients with high MLLT3 expression (n=11). The difference was significant (p=0.026). When MLLT3 was knocked-down, the proliferation ability decreased about 38% in HOS cells and 46% in MG-63 cells. But the migration as well as the invasive ability was not affected. In addition, the expression level of beta-catenin was comparable in HOS cells with/without knockdown of MLLT3. The specific inhibitor LGK-974 against Wnt/beta-catenin signaling showed little additive effect with MLLT3 knockdown on growth ability of HOS cells. But the level of c-Jun, BCL-2, Akt and c-Myc was significantly decreased in HOS cells with MLLT3 knockdown, which indicated that MLLT3 may at least partially regulate JNK signaling in HOS cells. In conclusion, we proved MLLT3 as an oncogene in osteosarcoma through partially regulating the JNK signaling pathway. And MLLT3 may be a promising target for treatment of patients with osteosarcoma.","['Sun, Junhua', 'Ren, Peng', 'Ye, Lan', 'Li, Na', 'Wang, Daoqing']","['Sun J', 'Ren P', 'Ye L', 'Li N', 'Wang D']",,"['Cancer Center, The Second Hospital of Shandong University Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Orthopaedics, The Second Hospital of Shandong University Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Cancer Center, The Second Hospital of Shandong University Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Cancer Center, The Second Hospital of Shandong University Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, The Second Hospital of Shandong University Jinan, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170901,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2', 'HOS cell', 'JNK signaling', 'MLLT3', 'Osteosarcoma', 'c-Myc']",2017/09/01 00:00,2017/09/01 00:01,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2017/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/01 00:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2017 Sep 1;10(9):9444-9451. eCollection 2017.,PMC6966015,['None.'],,,['IJCEP Copyright (c) 2017.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, several reports have suggested that Mcl-1 may play a role in tuberculosis infection. Therefore, we investigated the function of Mcl-1 in tuberculosis infection and the underlying regulatory mechanism. METHODS: Mcl-1-shRNA was used to down-regulate Mcl-1 expression in BCG-, H37Ra-, H37Rv- and XJ-MTB-infected mouse peritoneal macrophages. TUNEL staining detected macrophage apoptosis. The colony-forming units (CFUs) were determined to assess the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) clearance after down-regulating Mcl-1. Immunohistochemical analysis of Mcl-1 expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages was performed. Haematoxylin and eosin staining detected pathologic damage of the liver, spleen, lung, and kidney in mice. Real-time PCR and Western blotting determined the expression of cytochrome-c in Mcl-1-shRNA-treated mouse peritoneal macrophages infected with MTB strains that differ in virulence. RESULTS: Mcl-1-shRNA significantly promoted host macrophage apoptosis and cytochrome-c induction, and the apoptotic induction of the XJ-MTB and H37Rv strains was stronger than the H37Ra and BCG strains (P<0.05). Apoptotic protein cytochrome-c levels continued to increase in mouse peritoneal macrophages infected MTB before and after treatment, Caspase-8 levels only slightly increased after Mcl-1-shRNA-treated (P<0.05), but the increase of Cytochrome-c have no significant differences compared with Caspase-8 levels (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Mcl-1-shRNA intervention effectively down-regulated Mcl-1 expression, significantly increased host macrophage apoptosis, and induced cytochrome-c expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages infected with MTB strains of different virulence, and these changes were influenced by the virulence of the MTB strains. The mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway play an important role before Mcl-1-shRNA-trated, and then with the extrinsic apoptotic pathway co-regulate host macrophage apoptosis.","['Wang, Xiaofang', 'Wang, Xinmin', 'Zhang, Le', 'Zhang, Yuqing', 'Wang, Feiyu', 'Wang, Chan', 'Lu, Yang', 'Wu, Fang', 'Zhang, Wanjiang', 'Wu, Jiangdong']","['Wang X', 'Wang X', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang F', 'Wang C', 'Lu Y', 'Wu F', 'Zhang W', 'Wu J']",,"['Medical College of Shihezi University Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Department of Pathophysiology Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Medical College of Shihezi University Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Department of Urinary Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shihezi University Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Department of Pathophysiology Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Medical College of Shihezi University Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Department of Pathophysiology Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Medical College of Shihezi University Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Department of Pathophysiology Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Medical College of Shihezi University Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Department of Pathophysiology Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Medical College of Shihezi University Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Department of Pathophysiology Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Medical College of Shihezi University Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Department of Pathophysiology Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Medical College of Shihezi University Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Department of Pathophysiology Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Medical College of Shihezi University Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Department of Pathophysiology Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Medical College of Shihezi University Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Department of Pathophysiology Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170701,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MTB', 'Mcl-1', 'cytochrome-c', 'macrophage apoptosis']",2017/07/01 00:00,2017/07/01 00:01,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2017/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 00:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2017 Jul 1;10(7):7565-7577. eCollection 2017.,PMC6965215,['None.'],,,['IJCEP Copyright (c) 2017.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Expression of CAT104, miR-182, and ZEB1 in K562 and HL60 cell lines was respectively or synchronously altered by transfection. Expressions of CAT104, miR-182 and ZEB1 in cell were then analyzed by qRT-PCR. Cell viability, migration, invasion and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT, transwell assays and flow cytometry, respectively. Protein expressions of ZEB1 and factors related with apoptosis and two signal pathways (Wnt/beta-catenin and JNK) were detected by western blot. RESULTS: CAT104 expressed highly in K562 and HL60 cells compared to embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 (P < 0.001). Knockdown of CAT104 inhibited cell viability, migration and invasion, but increased cell apoptosis of K562 and HL60 cells through inhibitionof miR-182 (P < 0.05). miR-182 promoted cell survival, migration and invasion through upregulatingthe expression of ZEB1 (P < 0.05). miR-182 silence deactivated Wnt/beta-catenin and JNK signal pathways by downregulating the expression of ZEB1 in K562 and HL60 cells. CONCLUSION: LncRNA-CAT104 expressed highly in leukemia cells and its silence inhibited cell survival, migration and invasion by downregulating miR-182 expression. miR-182 functioned as an oncogene by upregulating ZEB1 via which miR-182 silence deactivated Wnt/beta-catenin and JNK signal pathways in leukemia cells.","['Zhang, Chengfang', 'Song, Guanli', 'Song, Guanbo', 'Li, Ruolei', 'Gao, Min', 'Zhang, Haiguo']","['Zhang C', 'Song G', 'Song G', 'Li R', 'Gao M', 'Zhang H']",,"[""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Jining No. 1 People's Hospital Jining 272011, Shandong, China."", ""Department of Preventive and Health Care, Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100053, China."", 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Jining Chinese Medicine Hospital Jining 272000, Shandong, China.', ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Jining No. 1 People's Hospital Jining 272011, Shandong, China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Jining No. 1 People's Hospital Jining 272011, Shandong, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Jining No. 1 People's Hospital Jining 272011, Shandong, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171201,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CAT104', 'JNK', 'Wnt/beta-catenin', 'ZEB1', 'miR-182']",2017/12/01 00:00,2017/12/01 00:01,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2017/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/01 00:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2017 Dec 1;10(12):11393-11404. eCollection 2017.,PMC6966021,['None.'],,,['IJCEP Copyright (c) 2017.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We downloaded the microRNA expression dataset GSE35320 from Gene Expression Omnibus database and selected expression chips from bone marrow of 71 pediatric AML samples and 6 adulthood AML samples. Differentially expressed microRNAs were identified by Wilcox test. The target genes of these microRNAs were predicted using an integrative method and their functional enrichment analysis was performed using DAVID. Finally, STRING database and Cytoscape software was used to construct and analyze the interaction network. RESULTS: A total of 7 differentially expressed microRNAs were identified and the remarkably up-regulated and down-regulated microRNAs were miR-16 and miR-142-5p which included 323 and 22 predicted target genes, respectively. The target genes of 7 microRNAs were most associated with regulation of cell cycle, p53 signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway and neurotrophin signaling pathway. The interaction network of miR-16 target genes was constructed among 354 high confidence interaction pairs. The core genes of the network, such as TP53, BCL2, VEGFA, had a role in prognosis of children with AML. CONCLUSIONS: The featured microRNAs and their target genes are significant in the occurrence and development of pediatric AML, which is likely to be important for the identification of therapeutic targets and biomarkers for these patients.","['Liu, Jing', 'Zhou, Lei', 'Fu, Xiaomin', 'Xu, Chen', 'Huang, Sai', 'Li, Yan', 'Gao, Honghao', 'Guan, Wei', 'Yang, Lan', 'Lv, Na']","['Liu J', 'Zhou L', 'Fu X', 'Xu C', 'Huang S', 'Li Y', 'Gao H', 'Guan W', 'Yang L', 'Lv N']",,"['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Geriatric Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, The Affiliated Hospital to Military Medical Sciences Beijing 100071, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital Beijing 100853, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171001,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Pediatric acute myeloid leukemia', 'differential expression', 'interaction network', 'miRNA-targeted therapy', 'microRNA']",2017/10/01 00:00,2017/10/01 00:01,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2016/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/01 00:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2017 Oct 1;10(10):10576-10583. eCollection 2017.,PMC6965806,['None.'],,,['IJCEP Copyright (c) 2017.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although HSCT is still widely adopted as part of salvage therapy for relapsed patients, there is no general consensus about the optimal transplant type (autologous [auto-HSCT] or allogeneic HSCT [allo-HSCT]). PROCEDURES: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 95 childhood APL patients who underwent their first HSCT between 1990 and 2014. Of the 95 patients, 40 (42%), 41 (43%), and 3 (3%) underwent HSCT procedures after achieving their first complete remission (CR1), CR2, and CR3, respectively, and 11 (12%) underwent HSCT while in a non-CR state. RESULTS: The non-CR group exhibited significantly worse five-year overall survival (5yOS) and disease-free survival (5yDFS) (5yOS: 46%; 5yDFS: 46%) than the CR1 (5yOS: 80%; 5yDFS: 78%) and CR2 + CR3 groups (5yOS: 81%; 5yDFS: 76%) (P = 0.013 and P < 0.01, respectively). Of the patients treated in CR2, no significant differences in 5yOS or the five-year cumulative incidence of relapse (5yRI) were detected between the auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT groups (5yOS: 85%, vs 78%, P = 0.648; 5yRI: 9%, vs 11%, P = 0.828). Among the patients who underwent allo-HSCT in CR2, those with matched sibling donors displayed a significantly higher 5yRI (33%) than those with other types of donors (0%, P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Even after relapsing, childhood APL can be cured with HSCT if CR is achieved. These findings demonstrate that achieving CR followed by HSCT is the preferred strategy for treating children with relapsed or refractory APL.","['Yamamoto, Shohei', 'Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Kudo, Kazuko', 'Hasegawa, Daiichiro', 'Taga, Takashi', 'Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Kondo, Tadakazu', 'Nakazawa, Yozo', 'Eto, Tetsuya', 'Inoue, Masami', 'Kato, Koji', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Ishida, Hiroyuki']","['Yamamoto S', 'Tomizawa D', 'Kudo K', 'Hasegawa D', 'Taga T', 'Yanada M', 'Kondo T', 'Nakazawa Y', 'Eto T', 'Inoue M', 'Kato K', 'Atsuta Y', 'Ishida H']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1582-7062', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1520-7007', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2245-6554', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0525-4766', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0793-815X']","['Department of Pediatrics, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamanomachi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health, Izumi, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan."", 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto City Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200121,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Allografts', 'Autografts', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan/epidemiology', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Male', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute promyelocytic leukemia', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*pediatric', '*relapse']",2020/01/23 06:00,2020/07/15 06:00,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28181 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 May;67(5):e28181. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28181.

However, further reliable markers are urgently needed to improve risk stratification in AML. CD318 (CDCP1) is a transmembrane protein which in solid tumors promotes formation of metastasis and correlates with poor survival. Despite its broad expression on hematological precursor cells, its prognostic significance in hematological malignancies so far remains unclear. Here, we evaluated the role of CD318 as novel prognostic marker in AML by immunophenotyping of leukemic blasts. Flow cytometric evaluation of CD318 on leukemic cells in 70 AML patients revealed a substantial expression in 40/70 (57%) of all cases. CD318 surface levels were significantly correlated with overall survival in patients receiving anthracycline-based induction therapy or best available alternative therapy. Using receiver-operating characteristics, we established a cut-off value to define CD318(lo) and CD318(hi) expression in both cohorts. Notably, high CD318 expression correlated inversely as prognostic marker in both treatment cohorts: as poor prognostic marker in patients receiving intense therapy, whereas upon palliative care it correlated with better outcome. In conclusion, FACS-based determination of CD318 expression may serve as novel prognostic factor depending on implemented therapy in AML patients.","['Heitmann, Jonas S', 'Hagelstein, Ilona', 'Hinterleitner, Clemens', 'Roerden, Malte', 'Jung, Gundram', 'Salih, Helmut R', 'Marklin, Melanie', 'Kauer, Joseph']","['Heitmann JS', 'Hagelstein I', 'Hinterleitner C', 'Roerden M', 'Jung G', 'Salih HR', 'Marklin M', 'Kauer J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2920-3894'],"['Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', ""DFG Cluster of Excellence 2180 'Image-guided and Functional Instructed Tumor Therapy' (IFIT), University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', ""DFG Cluster of Excellence 2180 'Image-guided and Functional Instructed Tumor Therapy' (IFIT), University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", ""DFG Cluster of Excellence 2180 'Image-guided and Functional Instructed Tumor Therapy' (IFIT), University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", 'Department of Internal Medicine VIII, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'University Hospital Tubingen, Department of Oncology, Haematology and Immunology, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Interfaculty Institute for Cell Biology, University of Tubingen, Partner Site Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', ""DFG Cluster of Excellence 2180 'Image-guided and Functional Instructed Tumor Therapy' (IFIT), University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany. melanie.maerklin@med.uni-tuebingen.de.', ""DFG Cluster of Excellence 2180 'Image-guided and Functional Instructed Tumor Therapy' (IFIT), University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany. melanie.maerklin@med.uni-tuebingen.de."", 'Department of Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Interfaculty Institute for Cell Biology, University of Tubingen, Partner Site Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200121,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', '*Blast Crisis/blood/mortality/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*blood', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CD318', 'CDCP1', 'Prognosis', 'Risk stratification']",2020/01/23 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-03907-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-03907-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Mar;99(3):477-486. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-03907-9.

Effective biomarkers for identifying patients most likely to respond to venetoclax-based treatment are of clinical utility. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of venetoclax-based therapy in a total 40 R/R AML patients and identify the potentially predictive factors for response. Overall response rate was 50%, including 9 (22.5%) complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery of either neutrophil or platelet counts (CRi). Median time to best response was 1.4 months and the median overall survival (OS) was 6.6 months. Presence of intermediate-risk cytogenetics predicted better OS compared to unfavorable-risk cytogenetics. Patients harboring NPM1, RUNX1, or SRSF2 mutations seemed to have higher CR/CRi rates and median OS was significantly longer in RUNX1-mutated patients. On the contrary, patients with FLT3-ITD, TP53, or DNMT3A mutations did not reach any objective response and had worse OS. No laboratory or clinical tumor lysis syndrome was observed and the most common adverse events were prolonged cytopenias which resulted in 67.5% of febrile neutropenia. Patients with concurrent use of azole antifungals had similar incidence of cytopenias compared with those without azole antifungals. In summary, we demonstrate that venetoclax is an effective and well-tolerated salvage option for R/R AML patients. Survival benefits were particularly remarkable in patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics or RUNX1 mutations. In contrast, TP53, NRAS, and DNMT3A mutations as well as FLT3-ITD conferred negative impact on survival.","['Wang, Yu-Wen', 'Tsai, Cheng-Hong', 'Lin, Chien-Chin', 'Tien, Feng-Ming', 'Chen, Yu-Wen', 'Lin, Hsing-Yu', 'Yao, Ming', 'Lin, Yun-Chu', 'Lin, Chien-Ting', 'Cheng, Chieh-Lung', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Wang YW', 'Tsai CH', 'Lin CC', 'Tien FM', 'Chen YW', 'Lin HY', 'Yao M', 'Lin YC', 'Lin CT', 'Cheng CL', 'Tang JL', 'Chou WC', 'Hou HA', 'Tien HF']",,"['Department of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'National Taiwan University Cancer Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'National Taiwan University Cancer Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Tai-Cheng Stem Cell Therapy Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'National Taiwan University Cancer Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'National Taiwan University Cancer Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Tai-Cheng Stem Cell Therapy Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. hsinanhou@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20200121,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytogenetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Febrile Neutropenia/chemically induced/genetics/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Mutations', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Venetoclax']",2020/01/23 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-03911-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-03911-z [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Mar;99(3):501-511. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-03911-z.

To elucidate the differential roles of gene mutations in typical MDS, we used targeted sequencing to investigate clonal patterns from 563 patients and focused on cases (199/563 cases) with initial mutations (ASXL1, DNMT3A and TET2) at MDS diagnosis. The consistency of frequency and distribution in patients with or without aberrant chromosomes suggested early events of these initial mutations. Some additional driver mutations (SF3B1, U2AF1 or RUNX1) played roles to keep the basic disease features, or give rise to different phenotypes (BCOR, EZH2 or TP53) in individual patients. Notably, analysis in paired samples before and after MDS progression showed that the mutations identified as last events (involving active signaling, myeloid transcription or tumor suppressor) seemed necessary for MDS development to be AML. Last mutations can exist at MDS diagnosis, or emerge at AML transformation, and involve a small group of genes. Single-allele CEBPA mutations and diverse TP53 mutations were checked as the most common last event mutations. Considering the necessity of last event mutations and limited gene involvement in AML transformations, it is possible to validate a small group of last events involved mutations to develop some new strategies to block MDS progression.","['Li, Xiao', 'Xu, Feng', 'Wu, Ling-Yun', 'Zhao, You-Shan', 'Guo, Juan', 'He, Qi', 'Zhang, Zheng', 'Chang, Chun-Kang', 'Wu, Dong']","['Li X', 'Xu F', 'Wu LY', 'Zhao YS', 'Guo J', 'He Q', 'Zhang Z', 'Chang CK', 'Wu D']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3363-4766'],"[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China. lixiao3326@163.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200121,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",,,2020/01/23 06:00,2020/11/25 06:00,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-55540-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-55540-w [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Jan 21;10(1):826. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-55540-w.,PMC6972820,,,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, cf-mRNA composition and its potential clinical applications remain largely unexplored. Here we show, using Next Generation Sequencing-based profiling, that cf-mRNA is enriched in transcripts derived from the bone marrow compared to circulating cells. Further, longitudinal studies involving bone marrow ablation followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia patients indicate that cf-mRNA levels reflect the transcriptional activity of bone marrow-resident hematopoietic lineages during bone marrow reconstitution. Mechanistically, stimulation of specific bone marrow cell populations in vivo using growth factor pharmacotherapy show that cf-mRNA reflects dynamic functional changes over time associated with cellular activity. Our results shed light on the biology of the circulating transcriptome and highlight the potential utility of cf-mRNA to non-invasively monitor bone marrow involved pathologies.","['Ibarra, Arkaitz', 'Zhuang, Jiali', 'Zhao, Yue', 'Salathia, Neeraj S', 'Huang, Vera', 'Acosta, Alexander D', 'Aballi, Jonathan', 'Toden, Shusuke', 'Karns, Amy P', 'Purnajo, Intan', 'Parks, Julianna R', 'Guo, Lucy', 'Mason, James', 'Sigal, Darren', 'Nova, Tina S', 'Quake, Stephen R', 'Nerenberg, Michael']","['Ibarra A', 'Zhuang J', 'Zhao Y', 'Salathia NS', 'Huang V', 'Acosta AD', 'Aballi J', 'Toden S', 'Karns AP', 'Purnajo I', 'Parks JR', 'Guo L', 'Mason J', 'Sigal D', 'Nova TS', 'Quake SR', 'Nerenberg M']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1882-9522', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9391-9870', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9381-5644']","['Molecular Stethoscope, Inc., 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA. aibarra@molecularstethoscope.com.', 'Molecular Stethoscope, Inc., 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Molecular Stethoscope, Inc., 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Molecular Stethoscope, Inc., 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Molecular Stethoscope, Inc., 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Molecular Stethoscope, Inc., 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Molecular Stethoscope, Inc., 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Molecular Stethoscope, Inc., 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Molecular Stethoscope, Inc., 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Molecular Stethoscope, Inc., 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Molecular Stethoscope, Inc., 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Molecular Stethoscope, Inc., 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Scripps Clinic Medical Group, Scripps Green Hospital, 10666 N Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA, 92037, USA.', 'Scripps Clinic Medical Group, Scripps Green Hospital, 10666 N Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA, 92037, USA.', 'Molecular Stethoscope, Inc., 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University and Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, 318 Campus Drive, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Molecular Stethoscope, Inc., 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA. mnerenberg@molecularstethoscope.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200121,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*pathology', 'Cell-Free Nucleic Acids/blood/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/*diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'RNA, Messenger/blood/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/23 06:00,2020/05/12 06:00,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-019-14253-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-019-14253-4 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2020 Jan 21;11(1):400. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-14253-4.,PMC6972916,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell-Free Nucleic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcription factor regulatory networks control the lineage programming and maturation of thymic precursor cells. Whether extrathymic antigenic events, such as the microbial colonization of the mucosal tract also shape the thymic T cell repertoire is unclear. We show here that intestinal microbes influence the thymic homeostasis of PLZF-expressing cells in early life. Impaired thymic development of PLZF(+) innate lymphocytes in germ-free (GF) neonatal mice is restored by colonization with a human commensal, Bacteroides fragilis, but not with a polysaccharide A (PSA) deficient isogenic strain. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells influenced by microbes migrate from the colon to the thymus in early life to regulate PLZF(+) cell homeostasis. Importantly, perturbations in thymic PLZF(+) cells brought about by alterations in early gut microbiota persist into adulthood and are associated with increased susceptibility to experimental colitis. Our studies identify a pathway of communication between intestinal microbes and thymic lymphocytes in the neonatal period that can modulate host susceptibility to immune-mediated diseases later in life.","['Ennamorati, Maria', 'Vasudevan, Chithirachelvi', 'Clerkin, Kara', 'Halvorsen, Stefan', 'Verma, Smriti', 'Ibrahim, Samira', 'Prosper, Shaniah', 'Porter, Caryn', 'Yeliseyev, Vladimir', 'Kim, Margot', 'Gardecki, Joseph', 'Sassi, Slim', 'Tearney, Guillermo', 'Cherayil, Bobby J', 'Bry, Lynn', 'Seed, Brian', 'Jain, Nitya']","['Ennamorati M', 'Vasudevan C', 'Clerkin K', 'Halvorsen S', 'Verma S', 'Ibrahim S', 'Prosper S', 'Porter C', 'Yeliseyev V', 'Kim M', 'Gardecki J', 'Sassi S', 'Tearney G', 'Cherayil BJ', 'Bry L', 'Seed B', 'Jain N']",,"['Mucosal Immunology and Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Charlestown, MA 02129.', 'Mucosal Immunology and Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Charlestown, MA 02129.', 'Mucosal Immunology and Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Charlestown, MA 02129.', 'Center for Computational and Integrative Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114.', 'Mucosal Immunology and Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Charlestown, MA 02129.', 'Mucosal Immunology and Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Charlestown, MA 02129.', 'Mucosal Immunology and Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Charlestown, MA 02129.', 'Center for Computational and Integrative Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114.', ""Massachusetts Host-Microbiome Center, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115."", 'Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114.', 'Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114.', 'Center for Computational and Integrative Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.', 'Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114.', 'Mucosal Immunology and Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Charlestown, MA 02129.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.', ""Massachusetts Host-Microbiome Center, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115."", 'Center for Computational and Integrative Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114.', 'Mucosal Immunology and Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Charlestown, MA 02129; njain@ccib.mgh.harvard.edu.', 'Center for Computational and Integrative Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200121,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['Animals', 'Bacteria/classification/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Bacteroides fragilis/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Colitis/genetics/immunology/microbiology', 'Colon/microbiology', '*Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/genetics/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*growth & development/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*early-life immunity', '*mucosal immunity', '*thymic lymphocyte development']",2020/01/23 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['1915047117 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1915047117 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020 Feb 4;117(5):2570-2578. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1915047117.

Tryptophan residue number 38 of chNHE1 (W38) in the extracellular portion of this molecule is a critical amino acid for virus entry. We describe a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of W38 in chicken primordial germ cells and the successful production of the gene-edited birds. The resistance to ALV-J was examined both in vitro and in vivo, and the DeltaW38 homozygous chickens tested ALV-J-resistant, in contrast to DeltaW38 heterozygotes and wild-type birds, which were ALV-J-susceptible. Deletion of W38 did not manifest any visible side effect. Our data clearly demonstrate the antiviral resistance conferred by precise CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in the chicken. Furthermore, our highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in primordial germ cells represents a substantial addition to genotechnology in the chicken, an important food source and research model.","['Koslova, Anna', 'Trefil, Pavel', 'Mucksova, Jitka', 'Reinisova, Marketa', 'Plachy, Jiri', 'Kalina, Jiri', 'Kucerova, Dana', 'Geryk, Josef', 'Krchlikova, Veronika', 'Lejckova, Barbora', 'Hejnar, Jiri']","['Koslova A', 'Trefil P', 'Mucksova J', 'Reinisova M', 'Plachy J', 'Kalina J', 'Kucerova D', 'Geryk J', 'Krchlikova V', 'Lejckova B', 'Hejnar J']",,"['Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czech Academy of Sciences, 14220 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'BIOPHARM, Research Institute of Biopharmacy and Veterinary Drugs, 254 49 Jilove u Prahy, Czech Republic.', 'BIOPHARM, Research Institute of Biopharmacy and Veterinary Drugs, 254 49 Jilove u Prahy, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czech Academy of Sciences, 14220 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czech Academy of Sciences, 14220 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'BIOPHARM, Research Institute of Biopharmacy and Veterinary Drugs, 254 49 Jilove u Prahy, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czech Academy of Sciences, 14220 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czech Academy of Sciences, 14220 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czech Academy of Sciences, 14220 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'BIOPHARM, Research Institute of Biopharmacy and Veterinary Drugs, 254 49 Jilove u Prahy, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czech Academy of Sciences, 14220 Prague, Czech Republic; hejnar@img.cas.cz.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200121,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified/genetics/immunology/virology', 'Avian Leukosis/genetics/*immunology/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/*genetics/physiology', 'Avian Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Chickens', 'Disease Resistance', 'Female', 'Gene Editing', 'Male', 'Poultry Diseases/genetics/*immunology/virology', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger 1/*genetics/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in chicken', '*Na+/H+ exchanger type 1', '*avian leukosis virus subgroup J', '*disease resilience in poultry', '*primordial germ cells']",2020/01/23 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['1913827117 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1913827117 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020 Jan 28;117(4):2108-2112. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1913827117.

We report results from patients with progressive disease (PD) after ofatumumab who crossed over to duvelisib in the DUO trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with radiographically confirmed PD after ofatumumab received duvelisib 25 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles until PD, intolerance, death, or study withdrawal. The primary endpoint was ORR per investigator. Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), PFS, and safety. RESULTS: As of December 14, 2018, 90 ofatumumab-treated patients in the DUO trial prior to crossover had an ORR of 29%, mDOR of 10.4 months, and mPFS of 9.4 months. After crossover, 77% of patients (69/90) achieved a response, with an mDOR of 14.9 months and mPFS of 15.7 months. Patients with del(17p) and/or TP53 mutations had similar outcomes [ORR, 77% (20/26); mPFS, 14.7 months]. Notably, 73% of patients (47/64) with disease previously refractory to ofatumumab achieved a response. The most frequent any-grade/grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhea (47%/23%), neutropenia (26%/23%), pyrexia (24%/4%), cutaneous reactions (23%/4%), and thrombocytopenia (10%/6%). CONCLUSIONS: Duvelisib demonstrated high response rates with good durability and a manageable safety profile in patients with R/R CLL/SLL who progressed on ofatumumab, including patients with high-risk disease and disease previously refractory to ofatumumab.","['Davids, Matthew S', 'Kuss, Bryone J', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Montillo, Marco', 'Moreno, Carol', 'Essell, James', 'Lamanna, Nicole', 'Nagy, Zsolt', 'Tam, Constantine S', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Delgado, Julio', 'Lustgarten, Stephanie', 'Weaver, David T', 'Youssoufian, Hagop', 'Jager, Ulrich']","['Davids MS', 'Kuss BJ', 'Hillmen P', 'Montillo M', 'Moreno C', 'Essell J', 'Lamanna N', 'Nagy Z', 'Tam CS', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Ghia P', 'Delgado J', 'Lustgarten S', 'Weaver DT', 'Youssoufian H', 'Jager U']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5617-4403', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3750-7342']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts. matthew_davids@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Department of Haematology, Flinders Medical Centre and Flinders University, Bedford Park, South Australia, Australia.', ""St James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom."", 'Hematology, Niguarda Cancer Center, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milan, Italy.', 'Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Oncology/Hematology Care, Cincinnati, Ohio.', 'Hematology/Oncology Division, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.', '1st Department of Internal Medicine, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', ""St Vincent's Hospital and University of Melbourne, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, and Department of Internal Medicine I, Saarland University, Homburg, Germany.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele and IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Verastem Oncology, Needham, Massachusetts.', 'Verastem Oncology, Needham, Massachusetts.', 'Verastem Oncology, Needham, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200121,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Class Ib Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/metabolism', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Purines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate']",,,2020/01/23 06:00,2021/02/07 06:00,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-19-3061 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-3061 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2020 May 1;26(9):2096-2103. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-3061.

IFITM3, when present in virus-producing cells, reduces the fusion potential of HIV-1 virions, but the mechanism is poorly understood. To define the breadth and mechanistic basis for the antiviral activity of IFITM3, we took advantage of a murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based pseudotyping system. By carefully controlling amounts of IFITM3 and envelope protein (Env) in virus-producing cells, we found that IFITM3 potently inhibits MLV infectivity when Env levels are limiting. Loss of infectivity was associated with defective proteolytic processing of Env and lysosomal degradation of the Env precursor. Ecotropic and xenotropic variants of MLV Env, as well as HIV-1 Env and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G), are sensitive to IFITM3, whereas Ebola glycoprotein is resistant, suggesting that IFITM3 selectively inactivates certain viral glycoproteins. Furthermore, endogenous IFITM3 in human and murine cells negatively regulates MLV Env abundance. However, we found that the negative impact of IFITM3 on virion infectivity is greater than its impact on decreasing Env incorporation, suggesting that IFITM3 may impair Env function, as well as reduce the amount of Env in virions. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of virion infectivity mediated by IFITM3 is reversed by the expression of glycoGag, a murine retrovirus accessory protein previously shown to antagonize the antiviral activity of SERINC proteins. Overall, we show that IFITM3 impairs virion infectivity by regulating Env quantity and function but that enhanced Env expression and glycoGag confer viral resistance to IFITM3.IMPORTANCE The viral envelope glycoprotein, known as ""Env"" in Retroviridae, is found on the virion surface and facilitates virus entry into cells by mediating cell attachment and fusion. Env is a major structural component of retroviruses and is targeted by all arms of the immune response, including adaptive and innate immunity. Less is known about how cell-intrinsic immunity prevents retrovirus replication at the level of individual cells. Here, we show that cellular IFITM3 and IFITM2 inhibit the fusion potential of retroviral virions by inhibiting Env protein via a two-pronged mechanism. IFITM proteins inhibit Env abundance in cells and also impair its function when levels are low. The posttranslational block of retroviral Env function by IFITM proteins is likely to impede both exogenous and endogenous retrovirus replication. In support of a relevant role for IFITM3 in retrovirus control, the retroviral accessory protein glycoGag counteracts IFITM3 function to promote virus infectivity.","['Ahi, Yadvinder S', 'Yimer, Diborah', 'Shi, Guoli', 'Majdoul, Saliha', 'Rahman, Kazi', 'Rein, Alan', 'Compton, Alex A']","['Ahi YS', 'Yimer D', 'Shi G', 'Majdoul S', 'Rahman K', 'Rein A', 'Compton AA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8273-546X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7508-4953']","['HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA alex.compton@nih.gov.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200121,United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,IM,,"['Animals', 'HIV-1/physiology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/physiology', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Proteolysis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*metabolism/*virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Env', '*IFITM', '*fusion', '*innate immunity', '*retroviruses', '*viral glycoprotein']",2020/01/23 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.03088-19 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.03088-19 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2020 Jan 21;11(1). pii: mBio.03088-19. doi: 10.1128/mBio.03088-19.,PMC6974572,,,"['0 (IFITM3 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It affects bone marrow cells especially lymphoid cell precursor. Leukemia is treated mainly by chemotherapy. Doxorubicin is a well-established chemotherapeutic agent included in treatment protocols of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Its efficacy is often limited by its cardiotoxic side effects. Many studies are directed to overcome this problem. Black seed oil was found to have a potent cardioprotective effect.Aim of the study: To assess the protective role of black seed oil against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study was carried out on 40 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia including 20 patients under doxorubicin therapy and black seed oil 80 mg/kg/dose divided into 3 doses starting at the same moment of beginning of doxorubicin infusion therapy and continued for 1 week after each doxorubicin dose [group I] and 20 patients under doxorubicin and placebo for 1 week after each doxorubicin dose [group II]. They underwent conventional echo-Doppler measures of left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions and pulsed wave tissue Doppler of lateral mitral annulus. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in parameters of electrocardiograph including S-T segment and Q-T interval either before or after doxorubicin therapy. No significant differences in echocardiographic parameters were found between group I and group II before therapy. Non-significant changes in parameters of diastolic function [E/A ratio or e/a ratio] were found after doxorubicin therapy in group I and II, but there were significant reduction in parameters of systolic function [EF, FS and s wave] after doxorubicin therapy more in group II than group I.Conclusion and recommendation: From this study, we concluded that: Black seed oil improves some cardiac side effects of doxorubicin as shown by better systolic functions in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were treated with Doxorubicin and black seed (group I) than in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were treated with doxorubicin alone with no black seeds (group II), and therefore multi center studies is recommended to be done before we can recommend the use of black seed oil as an adjuvant therapy in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia under doxorubicin-based treatment protocol.","['Hagag, Adel A', 'Badraia, Ibrahim M', 'El-Shehaby, Walid A', 'Mabrouk, Maaly M']","['Hagag AA', 'Badraia IM', 'El-Shehaby WA', 'Mabrouk MM']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7952-0089'],"['Pediatric Department, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Department, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Department, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Department, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20200121,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cardiotoxicity/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Plant Oils/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['Black seeds', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'doxorubicin cardiotoxicity']",2020/01/23 06:00,2020/12/02 06:00,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155219897294 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2020 Sep;26(6):1397-1406. doi: 10.1177/1078155219897294.

Mutations in IDH2 have a role in diagnosis and as a minimal residue disease marker. Often the variant allele frequency during follow up is less than 20%, which represents the limit of detection of Sanger sequencing. Therefore, the development of sensitive methodologies to identify IDH2 mutations might help to monitor patients' response to therapy. We compared three different methods to identify and monitor IDH2 mutations in patients' specimens. METHODS: Performances of PNA-PCR clamping, droplet digital PCR and Sanger for IDH2 status identification were evaluated and compared in 96 DNA patients' specimens. RESULTS: In contrast with Sanger sequencing, our results highlighted the concordance between PNA clamping and digital PCR. Furthermore, PNA-PCR clamping was able to detect more mutated DNA with respect to Sanger sequencing that showed several false negatives independently from the allelic frequency. CONCLUSIONS: We found that PNA-PCR clamping and digital PCR identified IDH2 mutations in DNA samples with comparable results in a percentage significantly higher compared to Sanger sequencing. PNA-PCR clamping can be used even in laboratories not equipped for sophisticated analyses, decreasing cost and time for IDH2 characterization.","['Petiti, Jessica', 'Rosso, Valentina', 'Croce, Eleonora', 'Franceschi, Vanessa', 'Andreani, Giacomo', 'Dragani, Matteo', 'De Gobbi, Marco', 'Lunghi, Monia', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Fava, Carmen', 'Lo Iacono, Marco', 'Cilloni, Daniela']","['Petiti J', 'Rosso V', 'Croce E', 'Franceschi V', 'Andreani G', 'Dragani M', 'De Gobbi M', 'Lunghi M', 'Saglio G', 'Fava C', 'Lo Iacono M', 'Cilloni D']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8640-2462', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4877-3929', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6346-4791']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 10043 Orbassano (Turin), Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 10043 Orbassano (Turin), Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 10043 Orbassano (Turin), Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 10043 Orbassano (Turin), Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 10043 Orbassano (Turin), Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 10043 Orbassano (Turin), Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 10043 Orbassano (Turin), Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale, Corso Giuseppe Mazzini, 18, 28100 Novara, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 10043 Orbassano (Turin), Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 10043 Orbassano (Turin), Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 10043 Orbassano (Turin), Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 10043 Orbassano (Turin), Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200119,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'IDH2 R140Q', 'IDH2 R172K', 'PNA-PCR clamping', 'diagnostic assay', 'droplet digital PCR']",2020/01/23 06:00,2020/01/23 06:01,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/23 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9010271 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9010271 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Jan 19;9(1). pii: jcm9010271. doi: 10.3390/jcm9010271.,PMC7019902,,['10005/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parvifloron D (ParvD) is an abietane diterpenoid, isolated in high amounts from Plectranthus ecklonii Benth. Previous reports have suggested potential therapeutic properties for ParvD. ParvD has shown pro-apoptotic and cytotoxic effects in leukemia and melanoma cell lines. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models. TNBC is a breast cancer subtype characterized by an aggressive behavior with poor clinical outcomes and weak overall therapeutic responses to the current treatment options. This work aimed at evaluating the anticancer effect of ParvD in MDA-MB-231 cells, a model of human TNBC. To obtain sufficient amounts of purified ParvD the efficiency of several extraction methods was compared. ParvD (0.1-10 microM) decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment with ParvD (5 microM) significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic nuclei and exposure to 3 microM ParvD increased the sub-G1 population. Since altered cell adherence, migration, and invasion are determinant processes for the formation of metastases, the effect of ParvD on these cellular processes was tested. Although treatment with ParvD (1 microM) had no effect on cell-substrate attachment, ParvD (1 microM) significantly reduced cell chemotaxis and invasion. This is the first report describing the proapoptotic effect of ParvD in TNBC cells. Moreover, for the first time we have shown that ParvD reduces cell motility, unraveling potential anti-metastatic properties.","['Saraiva, Nuno', 'Costa, Joao G', 'Reis, Catarina', 'Almeida, Nuno', 'Rijo, Patricia', 'Fernandes, Ana Sofia']","['Saraiva N', 'Costa JG', 'Reis C', 'Almeida N', 'Rijo P', 'Fernandes AS']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1333-9137', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5604-6142', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1046-4031', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7768-244X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7992-8343', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6350-0641']","['CBIOS, Universidade Lusofona Research Center for Biosciences & Health Technologies, Campo Grande 376, 1749-024 Lisboa, Portugal.', 'CBIOS, Universidade Lusofona Research Center for Biosciences & Health Technologies, Campo Grande 376, 1749-024 Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Research Institute for Medicines (iMed.ULisboa), Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade de Lisboa, Av.

The aim of our study was to investigate the levels of circulating monocyte subsets in allotransplant recipients. Materials and Methods: The levels of the classical, intermediate, and nonclassical monocyte subsets were determined by flow cytometry. Sixteen patients and 18 healthy controls were included, and the levels were analyzed during pretransplant remission (n = 13), early posttransplant during cytopenia (n = 9), and early reconstitution (n = 9). Results: Most patients in remission showed a majority of classical monocytes. The patients showed severe early posttransplant monocytopenia, but the total peripheral blood monocyte counts normalized very early on, and before neutrophil and platelet counts. During the first 7-10 days posttransplant (i.e., during cytopenia) a majority of the circulating monocytes showed a nonclassical phenotype, but later (i.e., 12-28 days posttransplant) the majority showed a classical phenotype. However, the variation range of classical monocytes was wider for patients in remission and during regeneration than for healthy controls. Conclusions: The total peripheral blood monocyte levels normalize at the very early stages and before neutrophil reconstitution after stem cell transplantation, and a dominance of classical monocytes is reached within 2-4 weeks posttransplant.","['Rundgren, Ida Marie', 'Ersvaer, Elisabeth', 'Ahmed, Aymen Bushra', 'Ryningen, Anita', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Rundgren IM', 'Ersvaer E', 'Ahmed AB', 'Ryningen A', 'Bruserud O']",,"['Department of Biomedical Laboratory Scientist Education and Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, 5020 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Biomedical Laboratory Scientist Education and Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, 5020 Bergen, Norway.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Biomedical Laboratory Scientist Education and Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, 5020 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen, Norway.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200118,Switzerland,Medicina (Kaunas),"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",9425208,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*blood/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immune Reconstitution', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monocytes', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Remission Induction', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['flow cytometry', 'hematology', 'leukemia', 'monocytes', 'stem cell transplantation']",2020/01/23 06:00,2020/10/10 06:00,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['medicina56010036 [pii]', '10.3390/medicina56010036 [doi]']",epublish,Medicina (Kaunas). 2020 Jan 18;56(1). pii: medicina56010036. doi: 10.3390/medicina56010036.,PMC7023283,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such diversity implies an intricate network of different cell types and interactions that are dependently interconnected. The processes by which different cell types differentiate from progenitors, mature, and finally exert their function requires an orchestrated succession of molecular processes that determine cell phenotype and function. The acquisition of these phenotypes is highly dependent on the establishment of unique epigenetic profiles that confer identity and function on the various types of effector cells. These epigenetic mechanisms integrate microenvironmental cues into the genome to establish specific transcriptional programs. Epigenetic modifications bridge environment and genome regulation and play a role in human diseases by their ability to modulate physiological programs through external stimuli. DNA methylation is one of the most ubiquitous, stable, and widely studied epigenetic modifications. Recent technological advances have facilitated the generation of a vast amount of genome-wide DNA methylation data, providing profound insights into the roles of DNA methylation in health and disease. This review considers the relevance of DNA methylation to immune system cellular development and function, as well as the participation of DNA methylation defects in immune-mediated pathologies, illustrated by selected paradigmatic diseases.","['Calle-Fabregat, Carlos de la', 'Morante-Palacios, Octavio', 'Ballestar, Esteban']","['Calle-Fabregat C', 'Morante-Palacios O', 'Ballestar E']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3026-3069', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1400-2440']","['Epigenetics and Immune Disease Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), 08916 Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Epigenetics and Immune Disease Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), 08916 Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Epigenetics and Immune Disease Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), 08916 Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200118,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,IM,,"['DNA/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Disease/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Genome/genetics', 'Genome-Wide Association Study/methods', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*metabolism', 'Phenotype']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B cells', '*DNA methylation', '*Familial Mediterranean Fever', '*NK cells', '*T cells', '*cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndrome', '*epigenetics', '*granulocytes', '*immune system', '*innate immune deficiencies', '*innate lymphoid cells', '*monocytes', '*primary immunodeficiencies', '*rheumatoid arthritis', '*systemic lupus erythematosus']",2020/01/23 06:00,2020/09/30 06:00,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['genes11010110 [pii]', '10.3390/genes11010110 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2020 Jan 18;11(1). pii: genes11010110. doi: 10.3390/genes11010110.,PMC7017047,,,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CHIP is associated with an overall increased risk of transformation to a hematological malignancy, especially myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic neoplasms (MPN, MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), of approximately 0.5% to 1% per year. However, it is becoming increasingly possible to identify individuals at greatest risk, based on CHIP mutational characteristics. CHIP, and particularly TET2-mutant CHIP, is also a novel, significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, related in part to hyper-inflammatory, progeny macrophages carrying TET2 mutations. Therefore, somatic TET2 mutations contribute to myeloid expansion and innate immune dysregulation with age and contribute to prevalent diseases in the developed world-cancer and cardiovascular disease. Herein, we describe the impact of detecting TET2 mutations in the clinical setting.

In this study, we establish an infection model in which four-week-old SPF chickens are infected with ALV-J strain CHN06, after which the host immune response is detected. We found that the expression of two antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Mx1 and IFIT5) were increased in ALV-J infected peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). A significant CD8(+) T cell response induced by ALV-J appeared as early as seven days post-infection (DPI), and humoral immunity starting from 21 DPI differed greatly in the time scale of induction level. Meanwhile, the ALV-J viremia was significantly decreased before antibody production at 14 DPI, and eliminated at 21 DPI under a very low antibody level. The up-regulated CD8(+) T cell in the thymus (14DPI) and PBL (7 DPI and 21 DPI) was detected, indicating that the thymus may provide the output of CD8(+) T cell to PBL, which was related to virus clearance. Besides, up-regulated chemokine CXCLi1 at 7 DPI in PBL was observed, which may be related to the migration of the CD8(+) T cell from the thymus to PBL. More importantly, the CD8 (high+) T cell response of the CD8alphabeta phenotype may produce granzyme K, NK lysin, or IFN-gamma for clearing viruses. These findings provide novel insights and direction for developing effective ALV-J vaccines.","['Dai, Manman', 'Li, Shibing', 'Shi, Keyi', 'Liao, Jiayu', 'Sun, Hui', 'Liao, Ming']","['Dai M', 'Li S', 'Shi K', 'Liao J', 'Sun H', 'Liao M']",,"['College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.', 'National and Regional Joint Engineering Laboratory for Medicament of Zoonosis Prevention and Control, Guangzhou 510642, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.', 'National and Regional Joint Engineering Laboratory for Medicament of Zoonosis Prevention and Control, Guangzhou 510642, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200116,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Avian Leukosis/*immunology/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Chemokine CXCL1/immunology', 'Chickens/immunology/virology', 'Host Microbial Interactions/*immunology', 'Immunity, Humoral', 'Interferons/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/*virology', 'Myxovirus Resistance Proteins/genetics', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Viremia/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ALV-J', '*CD8+ T cell response', '*PBL', '*chicken', '*phenotype']",2020/01/23 06:00,2021/02/18 06:00,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['v12010114 [pii]', '10.3390/v12010114 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2020 Jan 16;12(1). pii: v12010114. doi: 10.3390/v12010114.,PMC7019883,"['The authors declare no conflict of interest.

We show in this study that petromurin C, which was isolated from the culture extract of the marine-derived fungus Aspergillus candidus KUFA0062, isolated from the marine sponge Epipolasis sp., induces early autophagy followed by apoptotic cell death via activation of the intrinsic cell death pathway concomitant with mitochondrial stress and downregulation of Mcl-1 in FLT3-ITD mutated MV4-11 cells. Moreover, petromurin C synergized with the clinically-used FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib at sub-toxic concentrations.

A battery of self-reported questionnaires was administered during hospitalisation or day hospital admissions post 6 months and post 12 months from the diagnosis. Younger patients (aged 8-13 years) were more at risk than older ones in their problems' intensity and psychological symptoms; females and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia patients reported lower current life satisfaction perceptions; hope was associated with lower depression symptoms and mood problems. Healthy peers have a better perception of current life, but reported a lower hope score, more anxiety symptoms and more cognitive problems than patients. The first 6 months were more critical for patients' psychological health. Basing on these empirical data, the inclusion of mental health care professionals or supportive psychotherapy into the treatment is recognized as extremely useful.","['Tremolada, Marta', 'Taverna, Livia', 'Chiavetta, Ilaria Tamara', 'Bonichini, Sabrina', 'Putti, Maria Caterina', 'Biffi, Alessandra']","['Tremolada M', 'Taverna L', 'Chiavetta IT', 'Bonichini S', 'Putti MC', 'Biffi A']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0392-4332'],"['Department of Development and Social Psychology, University of Padua, 35131 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Child and Woman Health, University of Padua, 35127 Padua, Italy.', 'Faculty of Education, Free University of Bolzano-Bozen, 39042 Brixen, Italy.', 'Department of Development and Social Psychology, University of Padua, 35131 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Development and Social Psychology, University of Padua, 35131 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Child and Woman Health, University of Padua, 35127 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Child and Woman Health, University of Padua, 35127 Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200116,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Anxiety/*psychology', 'Child', 'Depression/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Sex Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*adolescents', '*children', '*cognitive problems', '*healthy peers', '*hope', '*in treatment', '*leukaemia', '*life perceptions', '*psychological wellbeing']",2020/01/23 06:00,2020/08/04 06:00,['2020/01/23 06:00'],"['2019/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph17020567 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph17020567 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2020 Jan 16;17(2). pii: ijerph17020567. doi: 10.3390/ijerph17020567.,PMC7014127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These enzymes (notably SRPK1 and SRPK2) have been found dysregulated in a variety of cancers, which suggests them as promising drug targets in oncology. SRPK2 has been related to leukemia cells proliferation and found preferentially overexpressed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Previously, synergistic combination between vincristine and SRPK inhibitors has been observed in leukemia cells in vitro. Herein we sought to evaluate the in vitro combinatory effects of inhibiting SRPK and multiple other kinase targets from the EGFR pathway in T-ALL, a hematological malignancy with a still poor prognosis. We found that the combined SRPK and AKT pharmacological inhibition is synergistic in Jurkat, CCRF-CEM, and TALL-1 (all T-ALL) but not in HL60, an acute myelogenous leukemia cell lineage. Combined treatments also impaired SR proteins phosphorylation in accordance with an improved suppression of SRPK activity. Furthermore, the synergism of treatments seemed associated with apoptosis triggering, as revealed by flow cytometry analyses. Taken together, these results suggest the therapeutic potential of the combined SRPK and AKT pharmacological inhibition against T-ALL.","['Siqueira, Raoni Pais', 'Caetano, Monica Maria Magalhaes', 'de Souza, Luciana Angelo', 'Dos Passos, Patricia Maria Siqueira', 'Simaroli, Natalia Borges', 'Barros, Marcus Vinicius de Andrade', 'de Souza, Ana Paula Martins', 'de Oliveira, Leandro Licursi', 'Silva-Junior, Abelardo', 'Fietto, Juliana Lopes Rangel', 'Teixeira, Robson Ricardo', 'Teixeira, Felipe Roberti', 'Bressan, Gustavo Costa']","['Siqueira RP', 'Caetano MMM', 'de Souza LA', 'Dos Passos PMS', 'Simaroli NB', 'Barros MVA', 'de Souza APM', 'de Oliveira LL', 'Silva-Junior A', 'Fietto JLR', 'Teixeira RR', 'Teixeira FR', 'Bressan GC']",,"['Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.

We describe characteristics, outcome, reinduction, and transplantation approaches and evaluate risk factors among children with progression of a BL/B-AL included in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster studies between 1986 and 2016. Treatment recommendation was reinduction including rituximab from the early 2000s followed by blood stem cell transplantation. The 3-year survival of the 157 children was 18.5 +/- 3%. Survival significantly improved from 11 +/- 3% before to 27 +/- 5% after 2000 (P < .001), allowing for risk factor analyses among the latter 75 patients. Survival of 14 patients with relapse after initial therapy for low-risk disease (R1/R2) was 50 +/- 13% compared with 21 +/- 5% for 61 patients progressing after R3/R4 therapy (P < .02). A total of 25 of 28 patients with progression during first-line therapy, 31 of 32 with progression during reinduction, 15 of 16 not reaching a complete remission (CR) before transplantation, 9 of 10 treated with rituximab front-line, and all 13 patients not receiving rituximab during reinduction died. Forty-six patients received stem cell transplantation (20 autologous, 26 allogeneic). Survival after a regimen combining rituximab with continuous-infusion chemotherapy followed by allogeneic transplantation was 67 +/- 12% compared with 18 +/- 5% for all other regimen and transplantations (P = .003). Patients with relapsed BL/B-AL have a poor chance to survive after current effective front-line therapies. Progression during initial or reinduction chemotherapy and initial high-risk disease are risk factors in relapse. Time-condensed continuous-infusion reinduction followed by stem cell transplantation forms the basis for testing new drugs.","['Woessmann, Wilhelm', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Meinhardt, Andrea', 'Muller, Stephanie', 'Hauch, Holger', 'Knorr, Fabian', 'Oschlies, Ilske', 'Klapper, Wolfram', 'Niggli, Felix', 'Kabickova, Edita', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Reiter, Alfred', 'Burkhardt, Birgit']","['Woessmann W', 'Zimmermann M', 'Meinhardt A', 'Muller S', 'Hauch H', 'Knorr F', 'Oschlies I', 'Klapper W', 'Niggli F', 'Kabickova E', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Reiter A', 'Burkhardt B']",,"[""Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (NHL-BFM) Study Center and Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Justus-Liebig-University, Giessen, Germany.', 'NHL-BFM Study Center and Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Justus-Liebig-University, Giessen, Germany.', ""Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (NHL-BFM) Study Center and Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Section and Lymph Node Registry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel/Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Section and Lymph Node Registry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel/Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic; and.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, St. Anna Children s Hospital, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Justus-Liebig-University, Giessen, Germany.', 'NHL-BFM Study Center and Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,['Blood. 2020 Apr 2;135(14):1078-1080.

We conducted RNA and targeted DNA sequencing of 8 ATLLs from Japanese patients <50 years of age and identified 3 (37.5%) with both CTLA4-CD28 and inducible costimulator (ICOS)-CD28 fusions. Mutations of PLCG1, PRKCB, and STAT3, which were frequent in other ATLL-sequencing studies, were not identified. Differential expression analysis identified the negative checkpoint molecule LAG3 as the most downregulated gene among cases with the fusions. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated expression of CD80 and CD86, the ligands for CTLA4 and CD28, on ATLL cells and tumor-associated macrophages, respectively. Expression of CTLA4-CD28 in Ba/F3 cells conferred cytokine-independent growth when cocultured with Raji cells that express CD80 and CD86. Growth was associated with recruitment of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to CTLA4-CD28 and phosphorylation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. A CTLA4-blocking antibody reduced cytokine-independent growth in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these results suggest that young Japanese ATLL cases have a unique biology dependent on cell-nonautonomous interactions that drive CD28 signaling. Assessment for CD28 fusions and treatment with CTLA4 blockade should be considered in younger patients with relapsed/refractory ATLL.","['Yoshida, Noriaki', 'Shigemori, Kay', 'Donaldson, Nicholas', 'Trevisani, Christopher', 'Cordero, Nicolas A', 'Stevenson, Kristen E', 'Bu, Xia', 'Arakawa, Fumiko', 'Takeuchi, Mai', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Yoda, Akinori', 'Ng, Samuel Y', 'Weinstock, David M']","['Yoshida N', 'Shigemori K', 'Donaldson N', 'Trevisani C', 'Cordero NA', 'Stevenson KE', 'Bu X', 'Arakawa F', 'Takeuchi M', 'Ohshima K', 'Yoda A', 'Ng SY', 'Weinstock DM']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Clinical Studies, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,['Blood. 2020 Apr 23;135(17):1415-1416.

The synthetic approach involved a Michael addition reaction of in-situ-generated acryloylcymantrene, acryloylcyrhetrene and acryloylferrocene with the canonical nucleobases thymine, uracil and adenine. The mechanism of these reactions was investigated by means of density functional theory calculations. The products were characterised by spectroscopic and electrochemical methods. The molecular structure of one cymantrene-adenine conjugate in the solid state was determined by single-crystal X-ray structure analysis, confirming the N9-substitution of the adenine moiety. It was found that the molecule adopts a bent conformation with the adenine and cyclopentadienyl planes in almost perpendicular orientation. The cymantrenyl nucleobases showed an irreversible redox behaviour, which is associated with ligand-exchange reactions of the radical cationic species. The newly synthesised compounds were also tested for their activity against the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei and human myeloid leukaemia HL-60 cells. Some compounds showed promising antitrypanosomal activity, and most of them were non-toxic to HL-60 cells. It was also found that cymantrene and cyrhetrene ketone nucleobases were more active than their alcohol congeners. These findings indicate the potential of cymantrenyl and cyrhetrenyl nucleobase conjugates as possible lead compounds for future antitrypanosomal drug development.","['Kowalski, Konrad', 'Szczupak, Lukasz', 'Saloman, Sebastian', 'Steverding, Dietmar', 'Jablonski, Artur', 'Vrcek, Valerije', 'Hildebrandt, Alexander', 'Lang, Heinrich', 'Rybarczyk-Pirek, Agnieszka']","['Kowalski K', 'Szczupak L', 'Saloman S', 'Steverding D', 'Jablonski A', 'Vrcek V', 'Hildebrandt A', 'Lang H', 'Rybarczyk-Pirek A']",,"['Faculty of Chemistry, Department of Organic Chemistry, University of Lodz, Tamka 12, 91403, Lodz, Poland.', 'Faculty of Chemistry, Department of Organic Chemistry, University of Lodz, Tamka 12, 91403, Lodz, Poland.', 'Technische Universitat Chemnitz, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Institute of Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, 09107, Chemnitz, Germany.', 'Bob Champion Research & Education Building, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7UQ, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Chemistry, Department of Organic Chemistry, University of Lodz, Tamka 12, 91403, Lodz, Poland.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Zagreb, Ante Kovacica 1, 10000, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Technische Universitat Chemnitz, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Institute of Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, 09107, Chemnitz, Germany.', 'Technische Universitat Chemnitz, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Institute of Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, 09107, Chemnitz, Germany.', 'Faculty of Chemistry, Department of Theoretical and Structural Chemistry, University of Lodz, Pomorska 163/165, 90236, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161021,Germany,Chempluschem,ChemPlusChem,101580948,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['antiprotozoal agents', 'bioorganometallic chemistry', 'electrochemistry', 'ferrocene', 'nucleobases']",2017/02/01 00:00,2017/02/01 00:01,['2020/01/22 06:00'],"['2016/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/cplu.201600462 [doi]'],ppublish,Chempluschem. 2017 Feb;82(2):303-314. doi: 10.1002/cplu.201600462.

To quantify the impact of CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir on venetoclax disposition and P-gp inhibition by venetoclax on digoxin pharmacokinetics, two semimechanistic drug-drug interaction (DDI) models of venetoclax were developed using clinical data from healthy volunteers who received subtherapeutic doses of venetoclax with ritonavir 50-100 mg or digoxin 0.5 mg. These models were then used to assess the magnitude of interaction at therapeutic venetoclax doses and to explore various clinical dosing strategies that maintain venetoclax and digoxin concentrations within their respective therapeutic windows. Simulations demonstrated that venetoclax dose reductions of at least 75% are needed when venetoclax is coadministered with ritonavir and administering digoxin at least 2 hours before venetoclax would minimize DDI. Semimechanistic modeling leveraging clinical data is a plausible approach to predict DDI and propose dose adjustments, and administration time of interacting drugs.","['Alhadab, Ali A', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed', 'Freise, Kevin J']","['Alhadab AA', 'Salem AH', 'Freise KJ']",,"['Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200313,United States,Clin Transl Sci,Clinical and translational science,101474067,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Digoxin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Ritonavir/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics']",,,2020/01/22 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2020/01/22 06:00'],"['2019/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cts.12739 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Transl Sci. 2020 May;13(3):555-562. doi: 10.1111/cts.12739.

Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) have studied in recent years that could be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to explore the novel lncRNAs in AML. Microarray analysis was performed to determine the differentially expressed lncRNAs between mononuclear cells of AML and normal samples. The biological function of lncRNA on cell proliferation and migration was measured in vitro. The predicted downstream target of lncRNA was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down, and rescue experiments. The tumor formation and metastasis study were conducted in vivo. The expression of lncRNA in clinical samples was determined by a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. LINC00449 was one of the most differentially expressed lncRNA which is mainly located in the cytoplasm. We found that overexpression of LINC00449 could inhibit the cell proliferation and invasion of AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Besides, miR-150 was identified as the downstream target gene that was negatively regulated by LINC00449 and FOXD3 was targeted by miR-150. The results were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down, rescue experiments, and in vivo assays. Patients with AML with high expression of LINC0049 may characterize a favorable survival. All the above-mentioned findings indicated that the LINC00449/miR-150/FOXD3 signaling pathway might represent a novel prognostic biomarker or therapeutic target for the treatment of AML.","['Shi, Yuan', 'Zhu, Yuandong', 'Zheng, Xiao', 'Zheng, Zhuojun']","['Shi Y', 'Zhu Y', 'Zheng X', 'Zheng Z']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3277-9998'],"['Laboratory of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Tumor Biological Treatment, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Cancer Immunotherapy Engineering Research Center of Jiangsu Province, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Institute of Cell Therapy, Soochow University, Soochow, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Tumor Biological Treatment, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Cancer Immunotherapy Engineering Research Center of Jiangsu Province, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Institute of Cell Therapy, Soochow University, Soochow, Jiangsu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200121,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'THP-1 Cells', 'U937 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*FOXD3', '*LINC00449', '*invasion', '*miR-150']",2020/01/22 06:00,2021/03/05 06:00,['2020/01/22 06:00'],"['2019/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.29487 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2020 Oct;235(10):6536-6547. doi: 10.1002/jcp.29487.

This work identified E35, a novel Emodin derivative, which strongly inhibited growth and enhanced apoptosis of AL stem cell lines, and primary stem and progenitor cells from AL cases, while sparing normal hematopoietic cells. Furthermore, functional assays in cultured cells and animals suggested that E35 preferentially ablated primitive leukemia cell populations without impairing their normal counterparts. Moreover, molecular studies showed that E35 remarkably downregulated drug-resistant gene and dramatically inhibited the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. Notably, the in vivo anti-LSC activity of E35 was further confirmed in murine xenotransplantation models.

The OCT4 transcription factor is expressed highly in pluripotent cells and is a central transcriptional regulator of the pluripotent state. Here, we describe a protocol to culture ES cells in LIF-independent and serum-free media using an inducible OCT4 (iOCT4) ES cell model system. This protocol is sufficient to sustain ES cell self-renewal in vitro in defined conditions in the absence of external signals. LIF-independent iOCT4 ES cells are fully capable of differentiating following deactivation of the inducible OCT4 transgene.","['Kidder, Benjamin L']",['Kidder BL'],,"['Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.

However, its expression and function in breast cancer remain unknown. This study was performed to investigate the expression of lncRNA TCL6 in breast cancer and its clinical significance. METHODS: The survival and clinical molecular roles of TCL6 in breast cancer were analyzed. The underlying mechanism modulated by TCL6 and its correlation with immune-infiltrating cells were investigated. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets were further used to confirm the prognostic role of TCL6. RESULTS: TCL6 low expression was not correlated with age, clinical stage, T stage, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, human epidermal growth factor 2 status, but was associated with estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (PR) status and was an independent factor for worse survival (HR 1.876, P = 0.016). Specifically, low TCL6 expression correlated with worse prognosis in PR-negative patients. TCL6 could predict worse survival in luminal B breast cancer based on intrinsic subtypes. Immune-related pathways such as Janus kinase-signal transducer of activators of transcription were regulated by TCL6. Further finding revealed that TCL6 correlated with immune infiltrating cells such as B cells (r = 0.25, P < 0.001), CD8+ T cells (r = 0.23, P < 0.001), CD4+ T cells (r = 0.25, P < 0.001), neutrophils (r = 0.21, P < 0.001), and dendritic cells (r = 0.27, P < 0.001). TCL6 was also positively correlated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes infiltration and PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, and CTLA-4 immune checkpoint molecules (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that lncRNA TCL6 correlates with immune infiltration and may act as a useful prognostic molecular marker in breast cancer.","['Zhang, Yaqiong', 'Li, Zhaoyun', 'Chen, Meifang', 'Chen, Hanjun', 'Zhong, Qianyi', 'Liang, Lingzhi', 'Li, Bo']","['Zhang Y', 'Li Z', 'Chen M', 'Chen H', 'Zhong Q', 'Liang L', 'Li B']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4429-1033'],"['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Taizhou Central Hospital Affiliated to Taizhou College, No. 999 Donghai Road, Jiaojiang District, Taizhou, 318000, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Taizhou Central Hospital Affiliated to Taizhou College, No. 999 Donghai Road, Jiaojiang District, Taizhou, 318000, Zhejiang, China.', 'Taizhou Hospital, Taizhou, 318000, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Taizhou Central Hospital Affiliated to Taizhou College, No. 999 Donghai Road, Jiaojiang District, Taizhou, 318000, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Taizhou Central Hospital Affiliated to Taizhou College, No. 999 Donghai Road, Jiaojiang District, Taizhou, 318000, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Taizhou Central Hospital Affiliated to Taizhou College, No. 999 Donghai Road, Jiaojiang District, Taizhou, 318000, Zhejiang, China. lianglz7963@tzzxyy.com.', 'Department of Ultrasound, Taizhou Municipal Hospital Affiliated to Medical College of Taizhou University, No. 381 Zhongshan East Road, Jiaojiang District, Taizhou, 318000, Zhejiang, China. pipi780123@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200120,Japan,Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer (Tokyo, Japan)",100888201,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Breast/immunology/pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Breast cancer', 'Immune', 'Prognosis', 'TCL6', 'lncRNA']",2020/01/22 06:00,2021/01/12 06:00,['2020/01/22 06:00'],"['2019/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12282-020-01048-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12282-020-01048-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Breast Cancer. 2020 Jul;27(4):573-585. doi: 10.1007/s12282-020-01048-5.

METHODS: Childhood leukaemia age-specific incidence rates overall and by sub-cohorts defined by age (0-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-19 years), sex (male, female) and nationality (Kuwaiti, non-Kuwaiti) were computed and age-standardized. Joinpoint regression models were used to evaluate trends in childhood leukaemia ASIRs. Average annual percent change (AAPC) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to interpret the observed trends. RESULTS: During the study period, 1077 childhood leukaemia cases of 32.3 million person-years were diagnosed. From 1980 to 2014, the average annual childhood leukaemia ASIR was 53.1 (95% CI 20.9, 85.2). Overall childhood leukaemia ASIRs significantly decreased on average by 6.8% per year (AAPC = -6.8; 95% CI -12.1, -1.1; p = 0.02) from 1980 to 1993, but a marginally significant increase in ASIRs from 1993 to 2014 was recorded (AAPC = 2.5; 95% CI -0.5, 5.5; p = 0.10). During the entire period, childhood leukaemia ASIRs trends significantly (p < 0.05) increased among 6 of 16 sub-cohorts, which was more pronounced among females and 10-14-year-old children. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ASIRs significantly increased from 1993 to 2014, which specifically seems to be driven by an increase in ASIRs among females and 10-14 -year-old children. These increasing trends underscore the potential involvement of a range of exposures. Future studies on unravelling such factors may help develop preventive measures to minimize childhood leukaemia risk in this and similar settings in the region.","['Akhtar, Saeed', 'Al-Abkal, Jarrah', 'Al-Shammari, Ahmad']","['Akhtar S', 'Al-Abkal J', 'Al-Shammari A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1261-788X'],"['Department of Community Medicine and Behavioural Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kuwait, PO Box 24923, 13110, Safat, Kuwait. saeed.akhtar@hsc.edu.kw.', 'Department of Surgery, Farwaniya Hospital, PO Box 33978, 7346, Al Rawdha, Kuwait.', 'Department of Surgery, Al-Adan Hospital, PO Box 288, 44403, Sabah Al Salem, Kuwait.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200120,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Kuwait/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood leukaemia', 'Incidence rates', 'Joinpoint regression', 'Sub-cohort analysis', 'Trends']",2020/01/22 06:00,2020/07/22 06:00,['2020/01/22 06:00'],"['2019/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10552-020-01267-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s10552-020-01267-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2020 Mar;31(3):231-240. doi: 10.1007/s10552-020-01267-3.

Here, we use genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening to establish that a T cell receptor (TCR) recognized and killed most human cancer types via the monomorphic MHC class I-related protein, MR1, while remaining inert to noncancerous cells. Unlike mucosal-associated invariant T cells, recognition of target cells by the TCR was independent of bacterial loading. Furthermore, concentration-dependent addition of vitamin B-related metabolite ligands of MR1 reduced TCR recognition of cancer cells, suggesting that recognition occurred via sensing of the cancer metabolome. An MR1-restricted T cell clone mediated in vivo regression of leukemia and conferred enhanced survival of NSG mice. TCR transfer to T cells of patients enabled killing of autologous and nonautologous melanoma. These findings offer opportunities for HLA-independent, pan-cancer, pan-population immunotherapies.","['Crowther, Michael D', 'Dolton, Garry', 'Legut, Mateusz', 'Caillaud, Marine E', 'Lloyd, Angharad', 'Attaf, Meriem', 'Galloway, Sarah A E', 'Rius, Cristina', 'Farrell, Colin P', 'Szomolay, Barbara', 'Ager, Ann', 'Parker, Alan L', 'Fuller, Anna', 'Donia, Marco', 'McCluskey, James', 'Rossjohn, Jamie', 'Svane, Inge Marie', 'Phillips, John D', 'Sewell, Andrew K']","['Crowther MD', 'Dolton G', 'Legut M', 'Caillaud ME', 'Lloyd A', 'Attaf M', 'Galloway SAE', 'Rius C', 'Farrell CP', 'Szomolay B', 'Ager A', 'Parker AL', 'Fuller A', 'Donia M', 'McCluskey J', 'Rossjohn J', 'Svane IM', 'Phillips JD', 'Sewell AK']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9302-1761', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4966-9752', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8597-815X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2020-7522', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3194-3135']","['Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.', 'Systems Immunity Research Institute, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.', 'Systems Immunity Research Institute, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.', 'Center for Cancer Immune Therapy, Herlev Hospital, Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.', 'Systems Immunity Research Institute, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.', 'Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Advanced Molecular Imaging, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.', 'Infection and Immunity Program & Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.', 'Center for Cancer Immune Therapy, Herlev Hospital, Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK. sewellak@cardiff.ac.uk.', 'Systems Immunity Research Institute, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK. sewellak@cardiff.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200120,United States,Nat Immunol,Nature immunology,100941354,IM,"['Nat Immunol. 2020 Feb;21(2):108-110.

We identified >6,000 protein phosphorylation sites that can be used to infer >1,500 kinase-kinase interactions and devised algorithms that can reconstruct kinase network topologies from these phosphoproteomics data. Application of our methods to primary acute myeloid leukemia and breast cancer tumors quantified the relationship between kinase expression and activity, and enabled the identification of hitherto unknown kinase network topologies associated with drug-resistant phenotypes or specific genetic mutations. Using orthogonal methods we validated that PIK3CA wild-type cells adopt MAPK-dependent circuitries in breast cancer cells and that the kinase TTK is important in acute myeloid leukemia.

In this retrospective cross-sectional analysis, neurocognitive testing and 3 T brain MRI's were obtained in 101 survivors treated with cranial radiation. Small focal intracerebral hemorrhages only visible on exquisitely sensitive MRI sequences were identified and localized using susceptibility weighted imaging. Modified Poisson regression was used to assess the effect of cranial radiation on cumulative number and location of microbleeds in each brain region, and multiple linear regression was used to evaluate microbleeds on neurocognitive outcomes, adjusting for age at diagnosis and sex. At least one microbleed was present in 85% of survivors, occurring more frequently in frontal lobes. Radiation dose of 24 Gy conveyed a 5-fold greater risk (95% CI 2.57-10.32) of having multiple microbleeds compared to a dose of 18 Gy. No significant difference was found in neurocognitive scores with either the absence or presence of microbleeds or their location. Greater prevalence of microbleeds in our study compared to prior reports is likely related to longer time since treatment, better sensitivity of SWI for detection of microbleeds and the use of a 3 T MRI platform.","['Phillips, Nicholas S', 'Hillenbrand, Claudia M', 'Mitrea, Bogdan G', 'Yan, Jason', 'Li, Chenghong', 'Scoggins, Matthew A', 'Merchant, Thomas E', 'Armstrong, Gregory T', 'Srivastava, Deokumar', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Krull, Kevin R', 'Sabin, Noah D']","['Phillips NS', 'Hillenbrand CM', 'Mitrea BG', 'Yan J', 'Li C', 'Scoggins MA', 'Merchant TE', 'Armstrong GT', 'Srivastava D', 'Pui CH', 'Robison LL', 'Hudson MM', 'Krull KR', 'Sabin ND']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2021-4036', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1586-4085', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0303-5658']","['Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'Department of Diagnostic Imaging, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'Department of Diagnostic Imaging, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine, Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'Department of Diagnostic Imaging, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, Memphis, TN, USA. kevin.krull@stjude.org.', ""Department of Psychology St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. kevin.krull@stjude.org."", 'Department of Diagnostic Imaging, Memphis, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200120,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,,"['Adult', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/*diagnostic imaging/etiology/psychology', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Frontal Lobe/diagnostic imaging/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Male', 'Mental Status and Dementia Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2020/01/22 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/01/22 06:00'],"['2019/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-57682-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-57682-8 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Jan 20;10(1):692. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-57682-8.,PMC6971068,,"['T32 CA225590/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA023944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138998/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AA016647/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-dose Ara-C used for induction regimens has also been reported to be associated with increased treatment-related mortality (TRM). Few data are available about intermediate-dose Ara-C serving as induction therapy. The aim of our study was to compare the tolerance and outcomes of standard- and intermediate-dose levels of Ara-C as induction in CBF AML and to analyse the clinical heterogeneity of the two AML entities under these induction settings. We retrospectively investigated the outcomes in adults with CBF AML induced with regimens based on standard-dose Ara-C at 100 to 200 mg/m(2) or intermediate-dose Ara-C at 1,000 mg/m(2). In total, 152 patients with t(8; 21) and 54 patients with inv(16) AML were administered an induction regimen containing anthracyclines plus either standard- or intermediate-dose Ara-C. After a single course of induction, the complete remission (CR) rate in the inv(16) cohort was 52/52 (100%), higher than the 127/147 (86.4%) in the t(8; 21) cohort (P = 0.005). Intermediate-dose Ara-C (HR = 9.931 [2.135-46.188], P = 0.003) and negative KITmut (HR = 0.304 [0.106-0.874], P = 0.027) independently produced an increased CR rate in the t(8; 21) cohort. Positive CD19 expression (HR = 0.133 [0.045-0.387], P = 0.000) and sex (male) (HR = 0.238 [0.085-0.667], P = 0.006) were associated with superior leukaemia-free survival (LFS) in the t(8; 21) cohort independently of KITmut status or the induction regimen. We conclude that intermediate-dose Ara-C is superior to standard-dose Ara-C for induction of remission in t(8; 21) AML, and CD19 status and sex independently confer prognostic significance for LFS. The KITmut status alone does not have an independent effect on survival in t(8; 21) AML. More intensive induction therapy is unnecessary in inv(16) AML.","['Wang, Biao', 'Zhang, Jihong', 'Hua, Xiaoying', 'Li, Haiqian', 'Wang, Zhilin', 'Yang, Bin']","['Wang B', 'Zhang J', 'Hua X', 'Li H', 'Wang Z', 'Yang B']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1557-5045'],"[""Changzhou First People's Hospital, Department of Hematology, Changzhou, 213000, China."", 'Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Blood Research Laboratory, Shenyang, 110000, China.', ""Changzhou First People's Hospital, Department of Hematology, Changzhou, 213000, China."", ""Changzhou First People's Hospital, Department of Hematology, Changzhou, 213000, China."", ""Changzhou First People's Hospital, Department of Hematology, Changzhou, 213000, China."", ""Changzhou First People's Hospital, Department of Hematology, Changzhou, 213000, China. yangbinwang@sohu.com.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20200120,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anthracyclines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Dosage Calculations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/22 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/01/22 06:00'],"['2019/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-57414-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-57414-y [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Jan 20;10(1):685. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-57414-y.,PMC6971028,,,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (KIT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although two copies of CXC motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) genes are generally identified in teleosts, the function of teleost CXCR4 genes in HSPCs is less known. In this study, we identified two CXCR4 genes from a teleost, ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis), named PaCXCR4a and PaCXCR4b. PaCXCR4b was constitutively expressed in ayu HSPCs, whereas PaCXCR4a was induced by LPS treatment. The stromal-derived factor-1-binding activity of CXCR4b was significantly higher than that of CXCR4a, whereas the LPS-binding activity of CXCR4a was significantly higher than that of CXCR4b in the teleosts ayu, large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), and tiger puffer (Takifugu rubripes). CXCR4a(+) HSPCs were mobilized into blood by LPS, whereas CXCR4b(+) HSPCs were mobilized by leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin-2. PaSDF-1 and PaCXCR4b, but not PaCXCR4a, inhibited HSPC proliferation by regulating reactive oxygen species levels. Compared with PaCXCR4b(+) HSPCs, PaCXCR4a(+) HSPCs preferentially differentiated into myeloid cells in ayu by maintaining high stem cell leukemia expression. These data suggest that the two copies of CXCR4s achieve a division of labor in the regulation of teleost HSPC homeostasis, supporting the concept that subfunctionalization after gene duplication in teleosts may stabilize the immune system.","['Lu, Xin-Jiang', 'Zhu, Kai', 'Shen, Hong-Xia', 'Nie, Li', 'Chen, Jiong']","['Lu XJ', 'Zhu K', 'Shen HX', 'Nie L', 'Chen J']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7796-4401'],"[""State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China; Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Marine Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, People's Republic of China; and Key Laboratory of Applied Marine Biotechnology of Ministry of Education, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China; Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Marine Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, People's Republic of China; and Key Laboratory of Applied Marine Biotechnology of Ministry of Education, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China; Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Marine Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, People's Republic of China; and Key Laboratory of Applied Marine Biotechnology of Ministry of Education, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China; Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Marine Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, People's Republic of China; and Key Laboratory of Applied Marine Biotechnology of Ministry of Education, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China; Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Marine Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, People's Republic of China; and Key Laboratory of Applied Marine Biotechnology of Ministry of Education, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China jchen1975@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200120,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/*physiology', 'Fish Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Homeostasis/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Perciformes/genetics/*immunology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/immunology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/*immunology', 'Species Specificity', 'Tetraodontiformes/genetics/immunology']",,,2020/01/22 06:00,2020/09/09 06:00,['2020/01/22 06:00'],"['2019/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1901100 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1901100 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2020 Mar 1;204(5):1225-1241. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1901100.

Using population-based data from Utah, we examined the risk of inpatient hospitalizations among AYA cancer survivors compared with their siblings and the general population. METHODS: Survivors of AYA cancer who were >/=2 years from diagnosis and diagnosed from 1994 to 2015 (N = 6,330), their siblings (N = 12,924), and an age- and sex-matched comparison cohort (N = 18,171) were identified using the Utah Population Database (UPDB). Hospitalizations from 1996 to 2017 were identified from statewide discharge records in the UPDB. We estimated multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for first hospitalization and rate ratios (RR) for total hospitalizations for survivors relative to the matched comparison cohort and siblings. RESULTS: Overall, the risk of a first hospitalization was higher among AYA cancer survivors than the matched population-based cohort [HR = 1.93; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.81-2.06]. Risk was most elevated for survivors of leukemia (HR = 4.76), central nervous system tumors (HR = 3.45), colorectal cancers (HR = 2.83), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HR = 2.76), and breast cancer (HR = 2.37). The rate of total hospitalizations was also increased among survivors relative to the comparison cohort (RR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.95-2.14). Patterns were generally similar in analyses comparing survivors to their siblings. CONCLUSIONS: AYA cancer survivors have a higher burden of inpatient hospitalization than their siblings and the general population. IMPACT: Results indicate the importance of long-term, risk-based follow-up care to prevent and treat severe morbidities after cancer treatment.","['Anderson, Chelsea', 'Kaddas, Heydon K', 'Ou, Judy Y', 'Ramsay, Joemy M', 'Trogdon, Justin G', 'Kirchhoff, Anne C', 'Nichols, Hazel B']","['Anderson C', 'Kaddas HK', 'Ou JY', 'Ramsay JM', 'Trogdon JG', 'Kirchhoff AC', 'Nichols HB']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6535-481X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7326-067X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6057-5696']","['Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

Specifications for these acidic isoforms were set with an extremely limited data set, and with further manufacturing experience, it can now be demonstrated that they were set too tightly. Here, we consider the ability of the manufacturing process to meet the current acidic isoforms specifications, as well as clinical outcomes from drug product containing a higher proportion of isoforms. Compared with the historical clinical experience with the drug, there appeared to be no difference in the rate of adverse event reporting (e.g., hypersensitivity or other events) when drug product with relatively higher acidic isoforms was administered. ErA acidic isoforms comprise part of the ErA product and appear to have no clinical relevance, so a realignment of process capability and specification may be warranted.

The estimated incidence rate of childhood leukemia in Colombia is one of the highest in America and little is known about its spatial distribution. PURPOSE: To explore the presence of space-time clustering of childhood leukemia in Colombia. METHODS: We included children less than 15 years of age with confirmed diagnosis of acute leukemia reported to the national surveillance system for cancer between 2009 and 2017. Kulldorff's spatio-temporal scan statistics were used with municipality and year of diagnosis as units for spatial and temporal analysis. RESULTS: There were 3846 cases of childhood leukemia between 2009 and 2017 with a specific mean incidence rate of 33 cases per million person-years in children aged 0-14 years. We identified five spatial clusters of childhood leukemia in different regions of the country and specific time clustering during the study period. CONCLUSION: Childhood leukemia seems to cluster in space and time in some regions of Colombia suggesting a common etiologic factor or conditions to be studied.,"['Rodriguez-Villamizar, Laura Andrea', 'Rojas Diaz, Marcela Pilar', 'Acuna Merchan, Lizbeth Alexandra', 'Moreno-Corzo, Feisar Enrique', 'Ramirez-Barbosa, Paula']","['Rodriguez-Villamizar LA', 'Rojas Diaz MP', 'Acuna Merchan LA', 'Moreno-Corzo FE', 'Ramirez-Barbosa P']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5551-2586'],"['Carrera 32 29-31 Of. 301 Facultad de Salud, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia. laurovi@uis.edu.co.', 'Instituto Nacional de Salud, Avenida 26 51-120, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Ministerio de Salud y Proteccion Social, Cuenta de Alto Costo- Fondo Colombiano de Enfermedades de Alto Costo, Avenida 45 103-34 Of. 802, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Observatorio de Salud Publica de Santander, Fundacion Oftalmologica de Santander, Avenida El Bosque 23-60, Floridablanca, Colombia.', 'Ministerio de Salud y Proteccion Social, Cuenta de Alto Costo- Fondo Colombiano de Enfermedades de Alto Costo, Avenida 45 103-34 Of. 802, Bogota, Colombia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200120,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colombia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Space-Time Clustering']",['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood', 'Cluster analysis', 'Colombia', 'Epidemiology', 'Leukemia']",2020/01/22 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2020/01/22 06:00'],"['2019/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-020-6531-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-020-6531-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2020 Jan 20;20(1):48. doi: 10.1186/s12885-020-6531-2.,PMC6971926,,['789-2017/COLCIENCIAS COLOMBIA'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, cases with PML-RARalpha generated by occult t(15;17) which are negative by both cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), are difficult to diagnose, leading to impaired treatment effectiveness. In the present study, we reported a case of a 66-year-old male patient, and bone marrow morphology, flow cytometry and cytogenetics did not support the diagnosis of APL. Molecular techniques, such as reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), showed the existence of a cryptic PML-RARalpha fusion gene, and sequence analysis revealed a new variable isoform. Hotspot gene mutation analysis showed a biallelic CEBPA mutation. He received IA chemotherapy and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment, and finally achieved complete remission. This case report provided valuable insights into the relevance of the correct identification of atypical PML-RARalpha fusion gene and biallelic CEBPA mutation. Moreover, combination of IA chemotherapy and ATRA treatment suggested a good clinical effect in this atypical PML-RARalpha.","['Zhang, Zhanglin', 'Xu, Yawen', 'Jiang, Mei', 'Kong, Fancong', 'Chen, Zhiwei', 'Liu, Shuyuan', 'Li, Fei']","['Zhang Z', 'Xu Y', 'Jiang M', 'Kong F', 'Chen Z', 'Liu S', 'Li F']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8712-0264'],"['Department of Clinical Laboratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200120,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,IM,,"['Aged', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['*APL', '*Biallelic CEBPA mutation', '*Cryptic PML-RARalpha', '*Cytogenetics', '*FISH', '*RT-PCR']",2020/01/22 06:00,2021/07/06 06:00,['2020/01/22 06:00'],"['2020/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384047.2019.1702398 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2020 Apr 2;21(4):309-314. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2019.1702398.

However, the degree to which VNC-evoked neuropathic pain persists throughout adulthood has yet to be examined. It also remains unclear if pediatric VNC exposure can 'prime' developing nociceptive pathways and thereby exacerbate chronic pain following subsequent trauma later in life. To address these issues, rats received five total doses of VNC (60mug/kg; or vehicle) on postnatal days (P) 11, 13, 17, 19 and 21 followed by a hindpaw surgical incision during adulthood. In addition, in order to model the clinical scenario where cancer relapse necessitates another round of chemotherapy, separate groups of rats that had been treated with VNC (or vehicle) as neonates were subsequently administered VNC as adults (five injections at 100mug/kg). Intraepidermal nerve fiber density and baseline mechanical pain sensitivity were similar between the neonatal VNC and vehicle-treated littermate controls at 13-15 weeks of age, suggesting that the peripheral neuropathy, and resulting chronic pain, had resolved by adulthood. Importantly, there was no significant overall effect of early life VNC on the severity of post-operative pain following adult incision. Similarly, prior VNC exposure did not significantly influence the degree of mechanical pain hypersensitivity produced by adult VNC treatment. Collectively, these findings suggest that early life VNC administration does not increase the susceptibility to develop chronic pain as adults.","['Styczynski, Lauren M', 'Schappacher, Katie A', 'Baccei, Mark L']","['Styczynski LM', 'Schappacher KA', 'Baccei ML']",,"['Medical Sciences Program, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, 231 Albert Sabin Way, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA; Pain Research Center, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, 231 Albert Sabin Way, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Systems Physiology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, 231 Albert Sabin Way, Cincinnati OH 45267, USA; Pain Research Center, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, 231 Albert Sabin Way, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA.', 'Pain Research Center, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, 231 Albert Sabin Way, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA.

In this trial of anti-thymocyte globulin, we measured treatment-independence at a long-term timepoint as the primary endpoint. METHODS: This was a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial done at ten centres in Canada and one in Australia. Eligible patients had a haematological malignancy (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or lymphoma), were between 16 and 70 years of age, eligible for transplantation with a Karnofsky score of at least 60, and received an unrelated donor (fully matched or one-locus mismatched at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, or DRB1 loci) graft following myeloablative or non-myeloablative-reduced intensity conditioning. Patients were randomly assigned to receive anti-thymocyte globulin 4.5 mg/kg plus standard GVHD prophylaxis (cyclosporine or tacrolimus plus methotrexate or mycophenolate) or standard GVHD prophylaxis alone. The primary endpoint, freedom from immunosuppressive therapy without resumption at 12 months, was previously reported. Here we report on the prespecified 24-month analysis. Analyses were per-protocol, excluding those patients who did not proceed to transplantation. This trial is registered as ISRCTN 29899028 and NCT01217723, status completed. FINDINGS: Between June 9, 2010, and July 8, 2013, we recruited and randomly assigned 203 eligible patients to receive anti-thymocyte globulin (n=101) or no additional treatment (n=102) along with standard GVHD prophylaxis. 7 (3%) patients did not receive a transplant and were excluded from the analysis. 38 (38%) of 99 evaluable patients in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group were free from immunosuppressive therapy at 24 months compared with 18 (19%) of 97 patients in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.49 [95% CI 1.60-7.60]; p=0.0016). At 24 months, the cumulative incidence of relapse was 16.3% (95% CI 8.9-23.7) in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group compared with 17.5 (9.9-25.1) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p=0.73) and non-relapse mortality was 21.2% (95% CI 13.2-29.2) versus 31.3% (21.9-40.7; p=0.15). The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 24 months was 26.3% (95% CI 17.5-35.1) in the anti-thymocyte globulin group and 41.3% (31.3-51.3) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p=0.032). Overall survival at 24 months was 70.6% (95% CI 60.6-78.6) in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group compared with 53.3% (42.8-62.8) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% CI [0.35-0.90]; p=0.017). Symptoms of chronic GVHD by the Lee Scale were more prevalent in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, with scores of 13.27 (SD 10.94) in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group and 20.38 (SD 14.68) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p=0.040). Depressive symptoms were more prominent in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, the mean Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D) scores were 10.40 (SD 9.88) in the anti-thymocyte globulin group and 14.62 (SD 12.26) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p=0.034). Serious adverse events (CTCAE grade 4 or 5) occurred in 38 (38%) patients in the anti-thymocyte globulin group and in 49 (51%) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, the most common being infection and GVHD. One patient in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group died of Epstein-Barr virus hepatitis, but no deaths were attributable to anti-thymocyte globulin. INTERPRETATION: The results of this prespecified 24-month analysis suggest that pretreatment with anti-thymocyte globulin provides clinically meaningful benefits when added to standard GVHD prophylaxis in patients undergoing unrelated donor transplantation, including decreases in use of immunosuppressive therapy, chronic GVHD and its symptoms, depressive symptoms, and improved overall survival. Anti-thymocyte globulin should be included in the preparative regimens of patients with haematological malignancies selected for unrelated donor transplantation.

In leukaemia, such malignancy is thought to invade leptomeninges via the vascular route. In brain tumours, dissemination from the primary tumour, before or after surgery, via CSF pathways is assumed; however, evidence exists to support the vascular route of dissemination. Success in treating leptomeningeal malignancy represents a rate-limiting step to cure, which has been successfully overcome in leukaemia with intensified systemic therapy combined with intra-CSF therapy, which replaced cranial radiotherapy for many patients. This de-escalated CNS-directed therapy is still associated with some neurotoxicity. The balanced benefit justifies exploration of ways to further de-escalate CNS-directed therapy. For primary brain tumours, standard therapy is craniospinal radiotherapy, but attendant risk of acute and delayed brain injury and endocrine deficiencies compounds post-radiation impairment of spinal growth. Alternative ways of treating leptomeninges by intensifying drug therapy delivered to CSF are being investigated-preliminary evidence suggests improved outcomes. This Review seeks to describe methods of intra-CSF drug delivery and drugs in use, and consider how the technique could be modified and additional drugs might be selected for this route of administration.","['Walker, David A', 'Meijer, Lisethe', 'Coyle, Beth', 'Halsey, Christina']","['Walker DA', 'Meijer L', 'Coyle B', 'Halsey C']",,"[""Children's Brain Tumour Research Centre, University of Nottingham, School of Medicine, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, UK.

METHODS: Here we present the results of the first feasibility testing of the ESMO-MCBS v1.1 for haematological malignancies based on the grading of 80 contemporary studies for acute leukaemia, chronic leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes. The aims were (1) to evaluate the scorability of data, (2) to evaluate the reasonableness of the generated grades for clinical benefit using the current version and (3) to identify shortcomings in the ESMO-MCBS v1.1 that require amendments to improve the efficacy and validity of the scale in grading new treatments in the management of haematological malignancies. RESULTS: In general, the ESMO-MCBS v1.1 was found to be widely applicable to studies in haematological malignancies, generating scores that were judged as reasonable by European Hematology Association (EHA) experts. A small number of studies could either not be graded or were not appropriately graded. The reasons, related to the differences between haematological and solid tumour malignancies, are identified and described. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of this study, ESMO and EHA are committed to develop a version of the ESMO-MCBS that is validated for haematological malignancies. This development process will incorporate all of the usual stringencies for accountability of reasonableness that have characterised the development of the ESMO-MCBS including field testing, statistical modelling, evaluation for reasonableness and openness to appeal and revision. Applying such a scale will support future public policy decision-making regarding the value of new treatments for haematological malignancies and will provide insights that could be helpful in the design of future clinical trials.","['Kiesewetter, Barbara', 'Cherny, Nathan I', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Cerisoli, Francesco', 'Dafni, Urania', 'de Vries, Elisabeth G E', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Gokbuget,

Resveratrol possesses anti-ATC activities but encounters resistance in some cases due to certain unknown reason(s). OBJECTIVE: Because signal transducer and activator of transcription/STAT3 signaling is critical for ATC cell survival and the main molecular target of resveratrol, its roles in determining the fates of resveratrol-treated ATC cells were investigated here. METHODS: Human THJ-11T, THJ-16 and THJ-21T ATC cell lines were treated by 100 muM resveratrol and their growth, statuses of STAT3 signaling and STAT3-related gene expression were examined. The relevance of STAT3 activation with resveratrol resistance was elucidated using STAT selective inhibitor AG490. Leukemia inhibitory factor/LIF expression and phosphorylated-STAT3/p-STAT3 nuclear translocation in ATC tissues were immunohistochemically analyzed. RESULTS: Resveratrol inhibited proliferation, p-STAT3 nuclear translocation as well as LIF and STAT3 expression of THJ-16T and THJ-21T but not THJ-21T cells which showed LIF upregulation and more frequent p-STAT3 nuclear translocation. AG490 significantly prevent p-STAT3 nuclear translocation, and reversed the resveratrol tolerance of THJ-11T cells. Immonohistochemical staining revealed 14.3% (4/28) of LIF and 3.6% (1/28) of p-STAT3 detection in noncancerous ATC-surrounding tissues, which increased to 89.5% (17/19) and 52.6% (10/19) respectively among ATC specimens. The correlative analysis indicated the relevance of LIF expression and STAT3 activation (r= 0.825; P< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The status of STAT3 activation and LIF expression are closely correlated with the therapeutic effect of resveratrol on ATCs. Frequent LIF upregulation and STAT3 activation are the unfavorable factors of ATCs and the potential targets of anti-ATC therapy.","['Wu, Jiao', 'Li, Yi-Tian', 'Tian, Xiao-Ting', 'Liu, Yu-Si', 'Wu, Mo-Li', 'Li, Pei-Nan', 'Liu, Jia']","['Wu J', 'Li YT', 'Tian XT', 'Liu YS', 'Wu ML', 'Li PN', 'Liu J']",,"['Liaoning Laboratory of Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics and Department of Cell Biology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'Liaoning Laboratory of Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics and Department of Cell Biology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'Liaoning Laboratory of Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics and Department of Cell Biology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'Liaoning Laboratory of Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics and Department of Cell Biology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'Liaoning Laboratory of Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics and Department of Cell Biology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'Liaoning Laboratory of Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics and Department of Cell Biology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,IM,,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Resveratrol/*pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thyroid Carcinoma, Anaplastic/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Anaplastic thyroid cancer', 'STAT3 signaling', 'drug resistance', 'resveratrol']",2020/01/21 06:00,2020/12/02 06:00,['2020/01/21 06:00'],"['2020/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['CBM191010 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-191010 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2020;27(4):461-469. doi: 10.3233/CBM-191010.,,,,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An epithelial cellular adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antibody was immobilized on the surface of MNPs (EpCAM-MNPs) to introduce the specificity of MNPs to leukemia cells. The viability of THP1 cells (human monocytic leukemia cells) was decreased to 40.8% of that in control samples by hyperthermia using EpCAM-MNPs. In AKR mice, an animal model of lymphoblastic leukemia, the number of leukemia cells was measured following the intravenous injection of EpCAM-MNPs and subsequent whole-body hyperthermia treatment. The result showed that the leukemia cell number was also decreased to 43.8% of that without the treatment of hyperthermia, determined by Leishman staining of leukemia cells. To support the results, simulation analysis of heat transfer from MNPs to leukemia cells was performed using COMSOL Multiphysics simulation software. The surface temperature of leukemia cells adhered to EpCAM-MNPs was predicted to be increased to 82 degrees C, whereas the temperature of free cells without adhered MNPs was predicted to be 38 degrees C. Taken together, leukemia cells were selectively removed by magnetic hyperthermia from the bloodstream, because EpCAM-modified magnetic particles were specifically attached to leukemia cell surfaces. This approach has the potential to remove metastatic cancer cells, and pathogenic bacteria and viruses floating in the bloodstream.","['Al Faruque, Hasan', 'Choi, Eun-Sook', 'Lee, Hyo-Ryong', 'Kim, Jung-Hee', 'Park, Sukho', 'Kim, Eunjoo']","['Al Faruque H', 'Choi ES', 'Lee HR', 'Kim JH', 'Park S', 'Kim E']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5003-7053', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5328-1182']","['Companion Diagnostics and Medical Technology Research Group, Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST), Daegu, 42988, Republic of Korea. cell84@dgist.ac.kr ejkim@dgist.ac.kr.', 'Companion Diagnostics and Medical Technology Research Group, Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST), Daegu, 42988, Republic of Korea. cell84@dgist.ac.kr ejkim@dgist.ac.kr.', 'Department of Robotics Engineering, Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST), Daegu, 42988, Republic of Korea. shpark12@dgist.ac.kr.', 'Companion Diagnostics and Medical Technology Research Group, Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST), Daegu, 42988, Republic of Korea. cell84@dgist.ac.kr ejkim@dgist.ac.kr.', 'Department of Robotics Engineering, Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST), Daegu, 42988, Republic of Korea. shpark12@dgist.ac.kr.', 'Companion Diagnostics and Medical Technology Research Group, Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST), Daegu, 42988, Republic of Korea. cell84@dgist.ac.kr ejkim@dgist.ac.kr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200120,England,Nanoscale,Nanoscale,101525249,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Immobilized/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyperthermia, Induced/*methods', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Magnetite Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology/*therapy']",,,2020/01/21 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/01/21 06:00'],"['2020/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c9nr06730b [doi]'],ppublish,Nanoscale. 2020 Jan 28;12(4):2773-2786. doi: 10.1039/c9nr06730b.

However, the role of lncRNAs in cardiac hypertrophy is yet to be fully elucidated. METHODS: A mouse lncRNA microarray was used to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs in the mouse hearts following transverse aortic constriction-induced pressure overload comparing to the sham-operated samples. The direct impact of one lncRNA, Ahit, on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was characterized in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in response to phenylephrine by targeted knockdown and overexpression. The in vivo function of Ahit was analyzed in mouse hearts by using cardiac-specific adeno-associated virus, serotype 9-short hairpin RNA to knockdown Ahit in combination with transverse aortic constriction. Using catRAPID program, an interaction between Ahit and SUZ12 (suppressor of zeste 12 protein homolog) was predicted and validated by RNA immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting following RNA pull-down. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to determine SUZ12 or H3K27me3 occupancy on the MEF2A (myocyte enhancer factor 2A) promoter. Finally, the expression of human Ahit (leukemia-associated noncoding IGF1R activator RNA 1 [LUNAR1]) in the serum samples from patients of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was tested by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A previously unannotated lncRNA, antihypertrophic interrelated transcript (Ahit), was identified to be upregulated in the mouse hearts after transverse aortic constriction. Inhibition of Ahit induced cardiac hypertrophy, both in vitro and in vivo, associated with increased expression of MEF2A, a critical transcriptional factor involved in cardiac hypertrophy. In contrast, overexpression of Ahit significantly attenuated stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vitro. Furthermore, Ahit was significantly upregulated in serum samples of patients diagnosed with hypertensive heart disease versus nonhypertrophic hearts (1.46+/-0.17 fold, P=0.0325). Mechanistically, Ahit directly bound and recruited SUZ12, a core PRC2 (polycomb repressive complex 2) protein, to the promoter of MEF2A, triggering its trimethylation on H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) residues and mediating the downregulation of MEF2A, thereby preventing cardiac hypertrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Ahit is a lncRNA with a significant role in cardiac hypertrophy regulation through epigenomic modulation. Ahit is a potential therapeutic target of cardiac hypertrophy.","['Yu, Junyi', 'Yang, Yang', 'Xu, Zaicheng', 'Lan, Cong', 'Chen, Caiyu', 'Li, Chuanwei', 'Chen, Zhi', 'Yu, Cheng', 'Xia, Xuewei', 'Liao, Qiao', 'Jose, Pedro A', 'Zeng, Chunyu', 'Wu, Gengze']","['Yu J', 'Yang Y', 'Xu Z', 'Lan C', 'Chen C', 'Li C', 'Chen Z', 'Yu C', 'Xia X', 'Liao Q', 'Jose PA', 'Zeng C', 'Wu G']",,"['Department of Cardiology, Chongqing Institute of Cardiology, Chongqing Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center, Daping Hospital, The Third Military Medical University, P.R.

The LIM and SH3 domain protein 1 (LASP1) has recently been identified as a novel BCR-ABL substrate and is associated with proliferation, migration, tumorigenesis and chemoresistance in several cancers. Furthermore, LASP1 was shown to bind to the chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), thought to be involved in mechanisms of relapse. In order to identify potential LASP1-mediated pathways and related factors that may help to further eradicate minimal residual disease (MRD), the effect of LASP1 on processes involved in progression and maintenance of CML was investigated. The present data indicate that not only overexpression of CXCR4, but also knockout of LASP1 contributes to proliferation, reduced apoptosis and migration as well as increased adhesive potential of K562 CML cells. Furthermore, LASP1 depletion in K562 CML cells leads to decreased cytokine release and reduced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity towards CML cells. Taken together, these results indicate that in CML, reduced levels of LASP1 alone and in combination with high CXCR4 expression may contribute to TKI resistance.","['Herrmann, Andreas B', 'Muller, Martha-Lena', 'Orth, Martin F', 'Muller, Jorg P', 'Zernecke, Alma', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Ernst, Thomas', 'Butt, Elke', 'Frietsch, Jochen J']","['Herrmann AB', 'Muller ML', 'Orth MF', 'Muller JP', 'Zernecke A', 'Hochhaus A', 'Ernst T', 'Butt E', 'Frietsch JJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3633-9535', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1476-8059']","['Institut fur Experimentelle Biomedizin II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Rudolf-Virchow-Zentrum fur Experimentelle Biomedizin I, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Labor fur Padiatrische Sarkombiologie, Medizinische Fakultat, Pathologisches Institut, LMU Munchen, Munchen, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Institut fur Molekulare Zellbiologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Institut fur Experimentelle Biomedizin II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Abteilung fur Hamatologie und internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung fur Hamatologie und internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Institut fur Experimentelle Biomedizin II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Abteilung fur Hamatologie und internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200119,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL', '*CML', '*CXCR4', '*LASP1', '*nilotinib', '*precursor cells']",2020/01/21 06:00,2021/04/24 06:00,['2020/01/21 06:00'],"['2019/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.14910 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2020 Mar;24(5):2942-2955. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.14910.

METHODS: Forty-seven patients with 10 mg/kg ATG (ATG group; median age 53 years) and 33 without ATG (no-ATG group; median age 43, P < .0001) were compared. RESULTS: Median time to engraftment was similar. Two-year cumulative incidence of moderate-to-severe chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was significantly lower in the ATG group (15% vs 55%, P < .0001), while that of acute GVHD was similar compared with the no-ATG group. After a median follow-up of 60 months (range, 14-184), the 3-year cumulative incidences of non-relapse mortality and relapse were 9% and 21% for ATG group and 15% and 19% for no-ATG group (P = .408 and P = .717), respectively, leading to a significantly better 3-year GVHD-free and relapse-free survival (GRFS) in the ATG group (55% vs 19%, P = .006): The 3-year overall and disease-free survival were similar. Infectious complication occurred with similar frequencies in both groups. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ATG can be safely used to decrease moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD with improved GRFS for patients with MDS receiving MSD-HSCT in RIC setting.","['Yahng, Seung-Ah', 'Min, Gi-June', 'Park, Sung-Soo', 'Park, Silvia', 'Jeon, Young-Woo', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Shin, Seung-Hwan', 'Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Eom, Ki-Seong', 'Lee, Seok', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Lee, Jong-Wook', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin']","['Yahng SA', 'Min GJ', 'Park SS', 'Park S', 'Jeon YW', 'Yoon JH', 'Shin SH', 'Lee SE', 'Cho BS', 'Eom KS', 'Lee S', 'Min CK', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee JW', 'Kim YJ']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3044-3991', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8826-4136', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2145-9131', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9810-2050']","[""Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Incheon, Korea."", ""Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Yeoido St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Eunpyung St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200309,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/etiology/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Palliative Care/methods', '*Preoperative Care/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Siblings', '*Transplantation Conditioning/methods', '*Transplantation, Haploidentical/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['ATG', 'MDS', 'matched sibling donor', 'reduced intensity conditioning']",2020/01/21 06:00,2021/01/20 06:00,['2020/01/21 06:00'],"['2019/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13386 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2020 May;104(5):459-468. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13386.

Objectives: To analyze demographic data, type, and pattern of pediatric cancers in Bihar by retrospective clinical audit. Materials and Methods: All individual consecutive patients between ages 0 and 18 years registered in the Department of Medical and Pediatric Oncology from January 1, 2018 till December 31, 2018, were enrolled in this study. Data pertaining to age, sex, and type of cancer were retrieved from clinical database by retrospective audit and stratified into hematolymphoid and solid pediatric cancer cohorts. Frequency distribution and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data using SPSS version 17.0. Results: A total of 247 pediatric cancers were registered, of which 142/247 (57%) and 15/247 (43%) were pediatric hematolymphoid and solid cancers, respectively. The median age was 9 years, while male-to-female ratio was 2.26. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 76/247 (31%) was the most common pediatric cancer overall. Hodgkin's lymphoma, 27/142 (19%) was the second most common hematolymphoid malignancy, after ALL was 76/142 (54%). Among solid tumors, Wilms' tumor was the most common, 28/105 (27%) followed by Ewing's sarcoma, 16/105 (15%), and germ cell tumor, 15/105 (14%). Central nervous system malignancies were among the least common solid tumor cancers, 3/105 (3%). Conclusion: ALL and Hodgkin's lymphoma are the most common pediatric cancers. Among solid malignancies, Wilms tumor, Ewing's sarcoma, and Germ cell tumor are predominant.","['Pandey, Avinash', 'Singh, Anjana', 'Kumar, Vijendra', 'Prakash, Jayant', 'Runu, Ritesh', 'Thakur, Vinit', 'Gupta, Anand Kumar', 'Singh, Shivkant']","['Pandey A', 'Singh A', 'Kumar V', 'Prakash J', 'Runu R', 'Thakur V', 'Gupta AK', 'Singh S']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, State Cancer Institute, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, Bihar, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, State Cancer Institute, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, Bihar, India.', 'Department of Paediatric Surgery, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, Bihar, India.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, Bihar, India.', 'Department of Orthopaedics, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, Bihar, India.', 'Department of Paediatric Surgery, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, Bihar, India.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, Bihar, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, State Cancer Institute, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, Bihar, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,South Asian J Cancer,South Asian journal of cancer,101618774,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Bihar', 'childhood', 'pediatric cancer']",2020/01/21 06:00,2020/01/21 06:01,['2020/01/21 06:00'],"['2020/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/sajc.sajc_48_19 [doi]', 'SAJC-9-53 [pii]']",ppublish,South Asian J Cancer. 2020 Jan-Mar;9(1):53-55. doi: 10.4103/sajc.sajc_48_19.,PMC6956576,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,['Copyright: (c) 2019 The South Asian Journal of Cancer.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) generally participates in development and progression of human cancers. Therefore, we examined the STAT3 cascade in nicotine regulation of Mcl-1 transcription in human lung cancer cells. Methods: The effects of nicotine on the expression of STAT3 and Mcl-1 were determined using western blot. The sub-cellular localization was tested using immunofluorescence. The activity of STAT3 promoter was checked using dual luciferase reporter assay. Results: STAT3 was constitutively activated (i.e., tyrosine-phosphorylated, serine-phosphorylated and nuclear translocation), meanwhile the expression and transcriptional activity of Mcl-1 were up-regulated in lung cancer cells following treatment with nicotine. Transfection with siRNA targeting STAT3 or treatment with STAT3 inhibitor JSI-124 diminished Mcl-1 protein levels. Deleted mutagenesis of a putative STAT3 consensus binding sequence decreased Mcl-1 promoter activity and eliminated the increase of Mcl-1 promoter activity induced by nicotine. Abnormally, JAK (Jannus kinase) inhibitor AG490 can't induce the downregulation of Mcl-1 or inhibit the tyrosine-phosphorylation of STAT3. In addition, deactivated mutagenesis of STAT3 the tyrosine 705 site had no effect on the aggregation of STAT3 into nucleus induced by nicotine. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that nicotine induces up-regulation of Mcl-1 through STAT3, which process may be independent on JAKs and not only dependent on the phosphorylation of Y705. Downregulation of Mcl-1 transcription by inhibiting STAT3 cascade may be a potential strategy for the treatment of this cancer.","['Zhou, Maojun', 'Zhao, Jinfeng', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Jin, Xin', 'Liao, Mingmei', 'Zhang, Lihua', 'Wang, Jiwei', 'Yang, Manyi']","['Zhou M', 'Zhao J', 'Zhang Q', 'Jin X', 'Liao M', 'Zhang L', 'Wang J', 'Yang M']",,"[""Key Laboratory of Cancer Proteomics of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha, Hunan, 410008, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Nanobiological Technology of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha, Hunan, 410008, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', ""Key Laboratory of Nanobiological Technology of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha, Hunan, 410008, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Nanobiological Technology of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha, Hunan, 410008, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Nanobiological Technology of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha, Hunan, 410008, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Nanobiological Technology of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha, Hunan, 410008, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Nanobiological Technology of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha, Hunan, 410008, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200101,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mcl-1', 'STAT3', 'lung cancer', 'nicotine']",2020/01/21 06:00,2020/01/21 06:01,['2020/01/21 06:00'],"['2019/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.35453 [doi]', 'jcav11p1270 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2020 Jan 1;11(5):1270-1276. doi: 10.7150/jca.35453. eCollection 2020.,PMC6959082,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,['(c) The author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TKI resistance is mediated by secondary FLT3-ITD mutations only in a minority of cases. We hypothesize that the cytokine CCL5 protects AML cells from TKI-mediated cell death and contributes to treatment resistance. We generated PKC412- and sorafenib-resistant MOLM-13 cell lines as an in vitro model to study TKI resistance in AML. Increased CCL5 levels were detected in supernatants from PKC412-resistant cell lines compared to TKI-sensitive cells. Moreover, CCL5 treatment of TKI-sensitive cells induced resistance to PKC412. In resistant cell lines with high CCL5 release, we observed a significant downregulation of the CCL5-receptor CCR5 and CXCR4. In these cell lines, TKI resistance could be partly overcome by addition of the CXCR4-receptor antagonist plerixafor. Microarray and intracellular flow cytometry analyses revealed increased p-Akt or p-Stat5 levels in PKC412-resistant cell lines releasing high amounts of CCL5. Treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor, alphaCCL5, or CCR5-targeting siRNA led to a decrease of p-Akt-positive cells. Transient transfection of sensitive MOLM-13 cells with a CCL5-encoding vector mediated resistance against PKC412 and led to an increase in p-Akt-positive and p-Stat5-positive cells. Isolated AML blasts from patients treated with PKC412 revealed that CCL5 transcript levels increase significantly at relapse. Taken together, our findings indicate that CCL5 mediates resistance to FLT3-TKIs in FLT3-ITD-mutated AML and could possibly serve as a biomarker to predict drug resistance.","['Waldeck, Silvia', 'Rassner, Michael', 'Keye, Philip', 'Follo, Marie', 'Herchenbach, Dieter', 'Endres, Cornelia', 'Charlet, Anne', 'Andrieux, Geoffroy', 'Salzer, Ulrich', 'Boerries, Melanie', 'Duyster, Justus', 'von Bubnoff, Nikolas']","['Waldeck S', 'Rassner M', 'Keye P', 'Follo M', 'Herchenbach D', 'Endres C', 'Charlet A', 'Andrieux G', 'Salzer U', 'Boerries M', 'Duyster J', 'von Bubnoff N']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0964-9511', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9593-8947']","['Department of Medicine I (Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation), Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) partner site Freiburg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I (Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation), Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I (Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation), Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I (Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation), Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I (Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation), Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) partner site Freiburg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I (Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation), Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) partner site Freiburg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Bioinformatics and Systems Medicine, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) partner site Freiburg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Bioinformatics and Systems Medicine, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I (Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation), Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) partner site Freiburg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I (Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation), Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) partner site Freiburg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Center, University of Schleswig Holstein, Lubeck, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200213,United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,IM,,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL5/*genetics/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CCL5/RANTES', '*FLT3-ITD', '*PKC412', '*TKI resistance']",2020/01/20 06:00,2021/02/02 06:00,['2020/01/20 06:00'],"['2019/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1878-0261.12640 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2020 Apr;14(4):779-794. doi: 10.1002/1878-0261.12640.

First-line therapy for CML consists of treatment with imatinib mesylate, which selectively inhibits the BCR-ABL protein by competing for its ATP-binding site. Adenine nucleotide signaling is modulated by the ectonucleotidases and this pathway is related to tumorigenic processes. Considering the relationship between ATP and cancer, we aimed to evaluate the influence of imatinib mesylate on the expressions and functions of the NTPDase and ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) enzymes in imatinib-sensitive and -resistant K-562 cell lines. mRNA analysis showed that K-562 cells express all ENTPDs and NT5E. However, when treated with imatinib mesylate for 24 h, the expression of ENTPD1, -2, -3 and -5 increased, leading to a higher nucleotides hydrolysis rate. HPLC analysis identified increased ATP degradation in cells after 24 h of treatment, with consequent ADP and AMP formation, corroborating the increase in gene and protein expression of ectonucleotidases as observed in previous results. On the other hand, we observed that imatinib-resistant K-562 cells presented a decrease in nucleotide hydrolysis and expressions of ENTPD1 and -5. These results suggest an involvement of imatinib in modulating ectonucleotidases in CML that will need further investigation. Since these ectonucleotidases have important catalytic activities in the tumor microenvironment, their modulation in CML cells may represent an important therapeutic approach to regulate levels of extracellular adenine nucleotides.","['Willig, Julia Biz', 'Vianna, Debora Renz Barreto', 'Beckenkamp, Aline', 'Beckenkamp, Liziane Raquel', 'Sevigny, Jean', 'Wink, Marcia Rosangela', 'Buffon, Andreia', 'Pilger, Diogo Andre']","['Willig JB', 'Vianna DRB', 'Beckenkamp A', 'Beckenkamp LR', 'Sevigny J', 'Wink MR', 'Buffon A', 'Pilger DA']",,"['Faculty of Farmacy, Program for Post-graduation in Pharmaceutical Science, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Biochemical and Cytological Analyses, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Av.

People living with HIV are at markedly increased risk of developing Burkitt lymphoma (BL), which is characterized by the MYC translocation. There is a paucity of survival data of HIV-associated Burkitt lymphoma/leukaemia (HIV-BL) cases from SA, and the relationship between karyotype and outcomes has not been widely reported. Here we report the clinico-pathological characteristics of a cohort of cytogenetically confirmed HIV-BL cases. A retrospective, descriptive review was conducted of clinico-pathological features of HIV-BL patients newly diagnosed and treated between 2005 and 2014 at our tertiary academic institution in Cape Town. Only HIV-BL patients with cytogenetic evidence of a MYC translocation were included for analysis. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model assessed the impact of variables on overall survival (OS). Forty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Their median age was 37 years (IQR 30-43 years) and 57% (n = 28) were females. Their median CD4 count was 240 cells/mul (IQR 103-423 cells/mul). The majority, 61% (n = 30), had leukaemic presentation, and 20% (n = 10) had a complex karyotype on conventional karyotyping. Seventy-seven percent (n = 36) received various protocols of combination intensive chemotherapy, excluding rituximab. Their OS was 64% (95% CI 45-77%) at 6 months, and 34% (95% CI 17-51%) at 5 years. Leukaemic presentation and a complex karyotype gave a 2.7-fold (95% CI 1.0-6.7) and 2.6-fold (95% CI 1.1-6.6) increased risk of mortality respectively, which were statistical significant (p < 0.05). We report 49 newly diagnosed, cytogenetically confirmed HIV-BL patients at our institution over a 10-year period. There was a high proportion of complex karyotypes and leukaemic presentation, which both independently adversely affected survival. This may be due to differences in the pathobiology of HIV-BL that requires further study and could lead to therapeutic advances in this patient group.","['Opie, Jessica', 'Antel, Katherine', 'Koller, Ania', 'Novitzky, Nicolas']","['Opie J', 'Antel K', 'Koller A', 'Novitzky N']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1408-2604'],"['Division of Haematology, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town and National Health Laboratory Service, Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. jessica.opie@uct.ac.za.', 'Division of Clinical Haematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town and Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town and National Health Laboratory Service, Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town and National Health Laboratory Service, Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20200118,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['*Abnormal Karyotype', 'Adult', '*Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*HIV Infections/complications/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', '*HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['Burkitt leukaemia', 'Burkitt lymphoma', 'Complex karyotype', 'Cytogenetics', 'HIV', 'MYC translocation', 'South Africa', 'Survival']",2020/01/20 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2020/01/20 06:00'],"['2019/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-03908-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-03908-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Mar;99(3):571-578. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-03908-8.

A case is presented of pulmonary histoplasmosis associated with altered mental state and hypercalcemia following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CASE REPORT A 75-year-old man with a five-day history of AML treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, presented with weakness, fatigue, and slow mentation. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations showed serum albumin of 2.9 g/dL, calcium of 11.6 mg/dL, ionized calcium of 1.55 mmol/L, parathyroid hormone (PTH) <6.3 pg/mL, and 25-hydroxy vitamin D of 14.4 ng/mL. Treatment began with intravenous cefepime 1 gm bid, normal saline, and the bisphosphonate, pamidronate, administered as a single dose. Three days later, his clinical status declined. He developed a dry productive cough, his oxygen saturation (O(2) Sat) was 90%, and his mental status worsened. Chest CT showed diffuse bilateral lung infiltrates with ground glass opacities. Bronchioalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy were negative for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP). The CMV rival load was 195 IU/mL. Urinalysis for Histoplasma antigen and the Fungitell(R) assay were positive. Treatment commenced with intravenous voriconazole (250 mg, bid) and ganciclovir (5 mg/kg, bid). A left lower lobe transbronchial lung biopsy was positive for Histoplasma capsulatum and negative for CMV. CONCLUSIONS This case report has highlighted the need for awareness of the diagnosis of histoplasmosis in patients with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation who present with an altered mental state in the setting of hypercalcemia.","['Rodriguez, Jose A', 'Ivancic, Stipe', 'Eckardt, Paula A', 'Lemos-Ramirez, Juan C', 'Niu, Jianli']","['Rodriguez JA', 'Ivancic S', 'Eckardt PA', 'Lemos-Ramirez JC', 'Niu J']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Memorial Hospital West, Memorial Healthcare System, Pembroke Pines, FL, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Memorial Hospital West, Memorial Healthcare System, Pembroke Pines, FL, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Disease, Memorial Regional Hospital, Memorial Healthcare System, Hollywood, FL, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Disease, Memorial Regional Hospital, Memorial Healthcare System, Hollywood, FL, USA.', 'Office of Human Research, Memorial Healthcare System, Hollywood, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200119,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,IM,,"['Aged', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histoplasma', 'Histoplasmosis/*microbiology', 'Humans', '*Hypercalcemia', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*microbiology']",,,2020/01/20 06:00,2020/07/16 06:00,['2020/01/20 06:00'],"['2020/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['919724 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.919724 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2020 Jan 19;21:e919724. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.919724.,PMC6993276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation, higher gammadelta T cell count predicted better prognosis. The impact of PD-1 and TIM-3 expression on the function of Vdelta2 T cells is yet unclear. In this study, we showed that the frequencies of PD-1(+)TIM-3(-) Vdelta2 T cells were comparable between healthy controls and AML patients, but the frequencies of PD-1(-)TIM-3(+) Vdelta2 T cells and of PD-1(+)TIM-3(+) Vdelta2 T cells were significantly higher in AML patients than in healthy controls. Both PD-1 and TIM-3 were upregulated upon phosphoantigen + IL-2 activation, but the relative differences in the frequencies of various PD-1 vs. TIM-3 subsets between AML patients and healthy controls remained. Interestingly, among all PD-1 vs. TIM-3 subsets, the PD-1(+)TIM-3(-) subset presented the highest TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma expression, while the PD-1(+)TIM-3(+) subset presented the lowest TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma expression. Anti-PD-1 inhibition did not significantly affect the production of TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma, but anti-TIM-3 inhibition and anti-PD-1/TIM-3 dual inhibition significantly elevated the production of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Interestingly, anti-PD-1 blocking antibodies had significantly increased the frequency of TIM-3(+) cells in Vdelta2 T cells, suggesting a compensatory TIM-3 upregulation. In addition, the levels of PD-L1 and HMGB-1 were significantly higher in AML patients than in healthy subjects. In summary, this study provides knowledge on the cytokine expression patterns by PD-1 and/or TIM-3-expressing Vdelta2 T cells in AML patients, and indicates that the upregulation of PD-1 alone is insufficient to indicate functional impairment, and Vdelta2 T cells may require anti-TIM-3 inhibition for functional revival.","['Wu, Kangni', 'Feng, Juan', 'Xiu, Yanghui', 'Li, Zhifeng', 'Lin, Zhijuan', 'Zhao, Haijun', 'Zeng, Hanyan', 'Xia, Weilin', 'Yu, Lian', 'Xu, Bing']","['Wu K', 'Feng J', 'Xiu Y', 'Li Z', 'Lin Z', 'Zhao H', 'Zeng H', 'Xia W', 'Yu L', 'Xu B']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Eye Institute and Xiamen Eye Center Affiliated to Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Jieyang People's Hospital (JieYang Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University), Jieyang, Guangdong, China."", 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Longyan First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Longyan, Fujian, China.

METHODS: Children age< = 19, born in Denmark and diagnosed with leukemia, central nervous system (CNS) cancers and likely prenatally initiated cancers [hepatoblastoma, medulloblastoma, Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma), neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma and acute lymphoid leukemia] n = 4268 were identified using Danish registries. We randomly selected twenty-five controls per case matched on birth year and sex. Parents and their employment histories were extracted from nationwide registries. We examined occupational dust exposures perinatally and postnatally in both parents. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) were estimated using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Maternal wood dust exposure from birth to diagnosis was associated with increased risks of leukemia (OR 1.44, 95 % CI 1.08-1.94) and acute myeloid leukemia (OR 2.14, 95 % CI 1.13-4.03); exposure to paper dust was associated with CNS cancer (OR 2.28, 95 % CI 1.22-4.2).. Paternal exposure to wood dust was associated with astrocytoma in both periods (OR 1.43, 95 % CI 1.05-1.96 and 1.42, 1.09-1.86, respectively) and CNS cancer (OR 1.24, 95 % CI 1.00-1.53) in the perinatal period. The increased risk observed for potentially prenatally-initiated cancers in relation to wood was driven by ORs for neuroblastoma (1.54, 95 % CI 1.03-2.29) and hepatoblastoma (2.41, 95 % CI 0.99-5.88). An OR of 2.58 (95 % CI 1.10-6.05) for CNS cancer was associated with both parents working in textile industries postnatally.

The aim of the study is to add to understanding of the reasons for deaths shortly after date of diagnosis. METHODS: Using data of the population-based German Childhood Cancer Registry (cancer below 15 years of age diagnosed between 1980 and 2016), we compared characteristics of 671 children with cancer who died within 30 days of diagnosis to 53,649 patients with childhood cancer who survived longer. In addition to a descriptive analysis, we used logistic regression with multivariable fractional polynomials to describe the relationship between early death with age at diagnosis and year of diagnosis. RESULTS: The number of early death cases and the risk of early death have decreased considerably since 1980 (2.6% of study population in 1980-89 to 0.6% in 2010-16). Children under one year of age were at highest early death risk (odds ratio = 4.10, 95% confidence interval: 3.32-5.05 compared to 7-year-old patients). These results are similar to results from other studies. Moreover, children with acute myeloid leukemia and hepatic tumors had a higher early death risk, children with acute lymphoid leukemia a lower risk compared to patients with central nervous system tumors used as a reference group. CONCLUSION: Even though the risk for early death has declined overall with advances in diagnosis and therapy, special attention needs to be paid to infants and children with AML and hepatic tumors, who are especially at risk.","['Becker, Cornelia', 'Graf, Norbert', 'Grabow, Desiree', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Weyer-Elberich, Veronika', 'Spix, Claudia', 'Kaatsch, Peter']","['Becker C', 'Graf N', 'Grabow D', 'Creutzig U', 'Reinhardt D', 'Weyer-Elberich V', 'Spix C', 'Kaatsch P']",,"['German Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI), University Medical Centre of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, 55101, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Saarland University Medical Center and Saarland University Faculty of Medicine, 66421, Homburg, Germany.', 'German Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI), University Medical Centre of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, 55101, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Pediatrics III, University Hospital of Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI), University Medical Centre Mainz, 55101, Mainz, Germany.', 'German Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI), University Medical Centre of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, 55101, Mainz, Germany.', 'German Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI), University Medical Centre of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, 55101, Mainz, Germany.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of prazosin on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the underlying relevant mechanisms. METHODS: AML cell lines U937 and HL60 were treated with different concentration of prazosin (5, 10 and 15 muM), CCK8 and flow cytometry assays were performed to examine the effects of prazosin on cell viability, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. Western blot assay was used to detect the expression of related proteins. RESULTS: We observed that prazosin inhibited cell viability of U937 and HL60 cells and induced the rate of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, as well as induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. The activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway was significantly suppressed by prazosin via reducing the phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR. Moreover, by RNA-seq analysis, we found that the expression of tensin 1 (TNS1) was down-regulated by prazosin, and down-regulation of TNS1 could inhibit cell viability of U937 and HL60 cells, as well as induced cell apoptosis. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway was also suppressed by depletion of TNS1. Furthermore, up-regulation of TNS1 could reverse the effects of prazosin on viability and apoptosis in U937 and HL-60 cells, as well as the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: These results highlight an anti-cancer activity of prazosin on AML by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and targeting TNS1.","['Sun, Xiaogang', 'Yang, Shuping', 'Song, Wei']","['Sun X', 'Yang S', 'Song W']",,"[""Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, 250021, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, 250021, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, 250021, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China.

It is still unclear whether PKM2 is involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cytotoxicity in gastrointestinal cancer, and what mechanisms are involved. One duodenal (AZ521) and two gastric (NUGC and SCM-1) cancer cell lines were treated with an indole-3-carbinol derivative OSU-A9, which caused cytotoxicity in acute myeloid leukemia through ROS generation. OSU-A9 caused a dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity and induced apoptosis in duodenal and gastric cancer cells through ROS generation. Pretreatment with ROS scavengers rescued cancer cells from apoptosis and concomitant poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, implying a key role of ROS in OSU-A9-induced cell death. Moreover, OSU-A9-induced ROS generation decreased protein levels of p(Tyr105)-PKM2, and this effect was rescued by pretreatment with ROS scavengers. Interestingly, p(Tyr105)-PKM2 protein levels decreased in the cell nucleus rather than in the cytoplasm. PKM2 overexpression partially rescued the survival of duodenal and gastric cancer cells treated with OSU-A9. Furthermore, the anticancer activity of OSU-A9 extended in vivo, as OSU-A9 administered by oral gavage suppressed the growth of AZ521 xenograft tumors in nude mice without obvious toxicity. In conclusion, OSU-A9 inhibited duodenal and gastric cancer cell proliferation through ROS generation and caused a subsequent decrease in nuclear p(Tyr105)-PKM2 protein. These findings provide evidence for the non-canonical activity of PKM2 in cancer cell survival. Furthermore, they highlight the potential role of PKM2 as a future therapeutic target for duodenal and gastric cancer.","['Chiu, Chang-Fang', 'Weng, Jing-Ru', 'Lee, Shou-Lun', 'Wu, Chia-Yung', 'Chu, Po-Chen', 'Shan, Yan-Shen', 'Yang, Horng-Ren', 'Bai, Li-Yuan']","['Chiu CF', 'Weng JR', 'Lee SL', 'Wu CY', 'Chu PC', 'Shan YS', 'Yang HR', 'Bai LY']",,"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan; Cancer Center, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan; College of Medicine, School of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Marine Biotechnology and Resources, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Natural Products, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Cosmeceutics and Graduate Institute of Cosmeceutics, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Surgery, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan; Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Surgery, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan; College of Medicine, School of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.

We reviewed the clinical course of pediatric oncology patients with pancreatic pseudocysts. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients treated over a 15-year period was performed. Variables evaluated included cancer type, medications administered, clinical and imaging characteristics of the pancreatic pseudocysts, treatment and outcome. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients with a median age of 13 (IQR, 9-17) years were identified with pancreatitis. Thirty-one (23.5%) patients developed a pancreatic pseudocyst, of which 84% were associated with PEG-asparaginase treatment. The median pseudocyst size was 7.6 (IQR, 4.4-9.9) cm with 59% being greater than 6cm. Twenty-two (71%) patients with a pancreatic pseudocyst underwent successful conservative management, while only 9 (29%) required procedural intervention including six percutaneous drainage, one of whom recurred and required surgical cyst-enteric drainage. Two other patients had primary surgical cyst-enteric drainage and one patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stenting. The indication for intervention was worsening pain rather than pseudocyst imaging characteristics, size or serum amylase/lipase. CONCLUSION: Most medication-induced pancreatic pseudocysts in children being treated for cancer, regardless of pseudocyst size, can be managed non-operatively or with transgastric percutaneous drainage. The need for intervention can be safely dictated by patient symptoms.

This property of l-asparaginase inhibits the protein synthesis in cancer cells, making l-asparaginase a mainstay of pediatric chemotherapy practices to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. l-Asparaginase is also recognized as one of the important food processing agent. The removal of asparagine by l-asparaginase leads to the reduction of acrylamide formation in fried food items. l-Asparaginase is produced by various organisms including animals, plants, and microorganisms, however, only microorganisms that produce a substantial amount of this enzyme are of commercial significance. The commercial l-asparaginase for healthcare applications is chiefly derived from Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi. A high rate of hypersensitivity and adverse reactions limits the long-term clinical use of l-asparaginase. Present review provides thorough information on microbial l-asparaginase bioprocess optimization including submerged fermentation and solid-state fermentation for l-asparaginase production, downstream purification, its characterization, and issues related to the clinical application including toxicity and hypersensitivity.

PLCbeta enzymes are involved in cell cycle progression of hematopoietic, MDS/AML and immune cells, through activation of PKC or calcium signalling.

LEF1 expression has not been systematically studied in CD5-positive marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs), lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas (LPLs), and follicular lymphomas (FLs). We evaluated whether these cases lacked LEF1, helping to distinguish them from CLL/SLL. METHODS: MZLs, LPLs, and FLs expressing CD5 were retrospectively studied for expression of LEF1 by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: LEF1 was absent in 17 of 18 CD5-positive lymphomas including 13 MZLs (2 nodal, 3 splenic, and 8 mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas), 3 LPLs, and 1 of 2 FLs. One grade 3A CD5-positive FL expressed LEF1 in a majority of tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: LEF1 is not expressed in most CD5-positive MZLs and LPLs; therefore, it is a reliable marker for distinguishing them from CLL/SLL. LEF1 may be expressed in CD5-positive FLs.","['Patel, Nisha', 'Durkin, Lisa', 'Bodo, Juraj', 'Hsi, Eric D']","['Patel N', 'Durkin L', 'Bodo J', 'Hsi ED']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CD5 positive', '*Follicular lymphoma', '*LEF1', '*Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma', '*Marginal zone lymphoma']",2020/01/19 06:00,2020/07/30 06:00,['2020/01/19 06:00'],"['2020/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['5709530 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqz207 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2020 Apr 15;153(5):646-655. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqz207.,,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)']","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020.

Autophagy contributes to tumourigenesis and cancer cell survival. The purpose of this study was to investigate the regulatory role and mechanism of UCA1 in AML cell viability by its effect on autophagy. The expression of UCA1, miR-96-5p, and ATG7 was determined by qRT-PCR and western blot. Cell proliferation was examined by MTT assay. The autophagy level was assessed by green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 immunofluorescence and western blot. The interaction between UCA1 and miR-96-5p or ATG7 was analyzed by luciferase reporter activity. The results showed that UCA1 promoted AML cell proliferation by inducing autophagy. Mechanistically, UCA1 acted as a sponge of miR-96-5p by binding to miR-96-5p. ATG7 was a direct target of miR-96-5p and positively regulated by UCA1. Further results showed that the miR-96-5p mimic effectively counteracted the UCA1 overexpression-mediated induction of the ATG7/autophagy pathway. Collectively, UCA1 functions as a sponge of miR-96-5p to upregulate its target ATG7, thereby resulting in autophagy induction. Our findings reveal a UCA1-mediated molecular mechanism responsible for autophagy induction in AML and help to improve the understanding of the molecular mechanism of AML progression.","['Li, Jia Jia', 'Chen, Xiao Feng', 'Wang, Meng', 'Zhang, Ping Ping', 'Zhang, Feng', 'Zhang, Jing Jing']","['Li JJ', 'Chen XF', 'Wang M', 'Zhang PP', 'Zhang F', 'Zhang JJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9949-8923'],"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200213,Australia,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,0425076,IM,,"['*Autophagy', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 7/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'U937 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ATG7', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*autophagy', '*miR-96-5p', '*urothelial carcinoma-associated 1']",2020/01/19 06:00,2021/07/14 06:00,['2020/01/19 06:00'],"['2019/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/1440-1681.13259 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 2020 May;47(5):877-885. doi: 10.1111/1440-1681.13259.

However, the macrophage phenotype and its distribution in the bone marrow biopsies (BMB) samples of human acute leukemia (AL) remain poorly understood. In this study, 97 BMB samples of patients with acute leukemia and 30 iron-deficiency anemias (IDA) as control group were evaluated with immunohistochemistry. In comparison with controls, the counts of CD68(+), CD163(+), and CD206(+)macrophages were remarkably increased in BMB samples of acute leukemia (P < 0.01), as well as their infiltration density was roaring up-regulation (P < 0.01). The expression levels of CD68(+), CD163(+), and CD206(+)macrophages were decreased in patients with complete remission, but there still existed statistically significant contrast to the control group (P < 0.01). The ratios of the CD163-positive cells or CD206-positive cells to CD68-positive cells were most prevalent in the BMB samples of human acute leukemia compared with the control group (P < 0.01), which support that macrophages were polarized to M2 macrophages.","['Song, Jian-Xin', 'Wen, Yan', 'Li, Rui-Wei', 'Dong, Ting', 'Tang, Yi-Fei', 'Zhang, Juan-Juan', 'Sa, Ya-Lian']","['Song JX', 'Wen Y', 'Li RW', 'Dong T', 'Tang YF', 'Zhang JJ', 'Sa YL']",,"[""Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, 650032, Yunnan, China."", ""Institute of Clinical and Basic Medical Sciences (Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Clinical Virology; Key Laboratory for Birth Defects and Genetic Diseases), The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, 650032, Yunnan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, 650032, Yunnan, China."", ""Institute of Clinical and Basic Medical Sciences (Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Clinical Virology; Key Laboratory for Birth Defects and Genetic Diseases), The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, 650032, Yunnan, China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, 650032, Yunnan, China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, 650032, Yunnan, China."", ""Institute of Clinical and Basic Medical Sciences (Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Clinical Virology; Key Laboratory for Birth Defects and Genetic Diseases), The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, 650032, Yunnan, China."", ""Institute of Clinical and Basic Medical Sciences (Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Clinical Virology; Key Laboratory for Birth Defects and Genetic Diseases), The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, 650032, Yunnan, China. sayalian@126.com.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20200118,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism', 'Biopsy', '*Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', '*Macrophages/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Bone marrow of biopsy', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Macrophage', 'Phenotype']",2020/01/19 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2020/01/19 06:00'],"['2019/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-03912-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-03912-y [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Mar;99(3):539-547. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-03912-y.

To examine this possibility, we conducted extensive investigations on the droplet formation of p53 in vitro. First, p53 itself was found to form liquid-like droplets at neutral and slightly acidic pH and at low salt concentrations. Truncated p53 mutants modulated droplet formation, suggesting the importance of multivalent electrostatic interactions among the N-terminal and C-terminal domains. Second, FRET efficiency measurements for the dimer mutants of p53 revealed that distances between the core domains and between the C-terminal domains were modulated in an opposite manner within the droplets. Third, the molecular crowding agents were found to promote droplet formation, whereas ssDNA, dsDNA, and ATP, to suppress it. Finally, the p53 mutant mimicking posttranslational phosphorylation did not form the droplets. We conclude that p53 itself has a potential to form droplets that can be controlled by cellular molecules and by posttranslational modifications, suggesting that LLPS might be involved in p53 function.","['Kamagata, Kiyoto', 'Kanbayashi, Saori', 'Honda, Masaya', 'Itoh, Yuji', 'Takahashi, Hiroto', 'Kameda, Tomoshi', 'Nagatsugi, Fumi', 'Takahashi, Satoshi']","['Kamagata K', 'Kanbayashi S', 'Honda M', 'Itoh Y', 'Takahashi H', 'Kameda T', 'Nagatsugi F', 'Takahashi S']",,"['Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials, Tohoku University, Katahira 2-1-1, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8577, Japan. kiyoto.kamagata.e8@tohoku.ac.jp.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, 980-8578, Japan. kiyoto.kamagata.e8@tohoku.ac.jp.', 'Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials, Tohoku University, Katahira 2-1-1, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8577, Japan.', 'Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials, Tohoku University, Katahira 2-1-1, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8577, Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, 980-8578, Japan.', 'Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials, Tohoku University, Katahira 2-1-1, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8577, Japan.', 'Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials, Tohoku University, Katahira 2-1-1, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8577, Japan.', 'Artificial Intelligence Research Center, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Koto, Tokyo, 135-0064, Japan.', 'Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials, Tohoku University, Katahira 2-1-1, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8577, Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, 980-8578, Japan.', 'Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials, Tohoku University, Katahira 2-1-1, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8577, Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, 980-8578, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200117,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,,"['Humans', 'Models, Molecular', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Unfolding', 'Static Electricity', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2020/01/19 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/01/19 06:00'],"['2019/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-57521-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-57521-w [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Jan 17;10(1):580. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-57521-w.,PMC6969132,,['JP16K07313/MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI/International'],"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that tumor cell pyroptosis triggers CRS during CAR T cell therapy. We find that CAR T cells rapidly activate caspase 3 in target cells through release of granzyme B. The latter cleaves gasdermin E (GSDME), a pore-forming protein highly expressed in B leukemic and other target cells, which results in extensive pyroptosis. Consequently, pyroptosis-released factors activate caspase 1 for GSDMD cleavage in macrophages, which results in the release of cytokines and subsequent CRS. Knocking out GSDME, depleting macrophages, or inhibiting caspase 1 eliminates CRS occurrence in mouse models. In patients, GSDME and lactate dehydrogenase levels are correlated with the severity of CRS. Notably, we find that the quantity of perforin/granzyme B used by CAR T cells rather than existing CD8(+) T cells is critical for CAR T cells to induce target cell pyroptosis.","['Liu, Yuying', 'Fang,

CML is associated with significantly high granulocyte numbers in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study conducted at the Hematology Unit of King Saud University Medical City aimed to evaluate the incidence and characteristics of CML and the various treatments in Saudi Arabia. We have evaluated the demographic, clinical, and hematological data of 56 consecutive patients who visited the hospital from Jan 2012 to Jan 2018. RESULTS: The diagnosis and stage of CML were determined based on the World Health Organization criteria, following polymerase chain reaction analysis of bone marrow aspirates. Our study group had equal numbers of genders with a age mean of 43.3+18.1 years. The predominance of younger patients and equal incidence in males and females could be due to the racial and socioeconomic disparities among our patients compared to those in previous studies. While the most predominant symptom was fatigue and bone pain, the most common clinical sign was hepato-splenomegaly, followed by remarkable weight loss, and epistaxis. CONCLUSION: A patient with an increased WBC count, abdominal pain, left side distension, and hepato-splenomegaly should clearly be evaluated for CML.","['Algahtani, Farjah H', 'Alqahtany, Fatmah S']","['Algahtani FH', 'Alqahtany FS']",,"['Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology/Hematology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Kind Saud University Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

However, the downstream target genes activated by STAT5 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells remain largely unclear. Here, we investigated the mechanistic functional relationship between STAT5A-regulated microRNA and CML cell apoptosis. METHODS: The expression of USP15, Caspase-6, STAT5A-regulated miR-202-5p and STAT5A was detected by qRT-PCR and Western blotting in CML cell lines and PBMCs of CML patients. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry. Both gain- and loss-of-function experiments were used to investigate the roles of USP15, miR-202-5p and STAT5A in CML. Luciferase reporter assay detected the effect of miR-202-5p on USP15 expression. Xenograft animal model was used to test the effect of anti-miR-202-5p and pimozide on K562 cell xenograft growth. RESULTS: USP15 expression was significantly downregulated in CML cell lines and PBMCs of CML patients. Depletion of USP15 increased, whereas overexpression of USP15 reduced the resistance of CML cells to Imatinib. Further, decreased deubiquitinating activity of USP15 by USP15 downregulation led to reduced caspase-6 level, thus attenuating CML cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, miR-202-5p was upregulated in K562G cells and negatively regulated USP15 expression by directly targeting USP15 3'-UTR. Correspondingly, upregulation of miR-202-5p enhanced the resistance of CML cells to Imatinib by inhibiting cell apoptosis. Importantly, STAT5A was upregulated in CML cells and directly activated miR-202-5p transcription by binding to the pre-miR-202 promoter. Pimozide induced CML cell apoptosis and significantly reduced K562 cell xenograft growth in vivo by blocking STAT5A/miR-202-5p/USP15/Caspase-6 regulatory axis. CONCLUSIONS: we provide the first evidence that de-regulated STAT5A/miR-202-5p/USP15/Caspase-6 regulatory axis suppresses the apoptosis of CML cells, targeting this pathway might be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of CML.","['Nie, Zi-Yuan', 'Yao, Min', 'Yang, Zhan', 'Yang, Lin', 'Liu, Xiao-Jun', 'Yu, Jing', 'Ma, Ying', 'Zhang, Nan', 'Zhang, Xiao-Yan', 'Liu, Meng-Han', 'Jiang, Ling-Ling', 'Luo, Jian-Min']","['Nie ZY', 'Yao M', 'Yang Z', 'Yang L', 'Liu XJ', 'Yu J', 'Ma Y', 'Zhang N', 'Zhang XY', 'Liu MH', 'Jiang LL', 'Luo JM']",,"['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Heping W Rd, Shijiazhuang, 050000, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Key Laboratory of Neural and Vascular Biology, Ministry of Education of China, Hebei Medical University, No. 361 Zhongshan E Rd, Shijiazhuang, 050017, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Key Laboratory of Neural and Vascular Biology, Ministry of Education of China, Hebei Medical University, No. 361 Zhongshan E Rd, Shijiazhuang, 050017, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Heping W Rd, Shijiazhuang, 050000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Heping W Rd, Shijiazhuang, 050000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Heping W Rd, Shijiazhuang, 050000, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Key Laboratory of Neural and Vascular Biology, Ministry of Education of China, Hebei Medical University, No. 361 Zhongshan E Rd, Shijiazhuang, 050017, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Key Laboratory of Neural and Vascular Biology, Ministry of Education of China, Hebei Medical University, No. 361 Zhongshan E Rd, Shijiazhuang, 050017, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Key Laboratory of Neural and Vascular Biology, Ministry of Education of China, Hebei Medical University, No. 361 Zhongshan E Rd, Shijiazhuang, 050017, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Heping W Rd, Shijiazhuang, 050000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Heping W Rd, Shijiazhuang, 050000, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Key Laboratory of Neural and Vascular Biology, Ministry of Education of China, Hebei Medical University, No. 361 Zhongshan E Rd, Shijiazhuang, 050017, China. jianglinglinghebmu@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 215 Heping W Rd, Shijiazhuang, 050000, China. luojianmin1960@126.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200117,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caspase 6/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases/biosynthesis/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'Caspase-6', 'STAT5A', 'USP15', 'miRNA']",2020/01/19 06:00,2020/10/29 06:00,['2020/01/19 06:00'],"['2019/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-019-1502-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-019-1502-7 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2020 Jan 17;39(1):17. doi: 10.1186/s13046-019-1502-7.,PMC6969434,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MIRN202 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP15 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 6)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data from relevant articles published on the Pubmed database between January 2007 and January 2020 have been included.Expert opinion: The results from the majority of TKI discontinuation studies show a consistent picture with approximately half of eligible patients achieving treatment free remission (TFR). However, reliable clinical predictors or biomarkers for the outcome of TKI discontinuation remain elusive and the mechanisms to explain the diversity of discontinuation success are not completely understood.

Droplet-based microfluidics has been widely used in the past decade to achieve high-throughput single-cell analysis. However, to maximize the proportion of single-cell emulsification is challenging due to cell sedimentation and aggregation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of single-cell encapsulation and incubation through the use of neutral buoyancy. As a proof of concept, OptiPrep was used to create neutrally buoyant cell suspensions of THP-1, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, for single-cell encapsulation and incubation. We found that using a neutrally buoyant suspension greatly increased the efficiency of single-cell encapsulation in microdroplets and eliminated unnecessary cell loss. Moreover, the presence of OptiPrep was shown to not affect cellular viability. This method significantly improved the effectiveness of single-cell study in a non-toxic environment and is expected to broadly facilitate single-cell analysis.","['Liu, Hangrui', 'Li, Ming', 'Wang, Yan', 'Piper, Jim', 'Jiang, Lianmei']","['Liu H', 'Li M', 'Wang Y', 'Piper J', 'Jiang L']",,"['ARC Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.', 'School of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW 2122, Australia.', 'ARC Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.', 'ARC Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.', 'ARC Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics, Department of Molecular Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200115,Switzerland,Micromachines (Basel),Micromachines,101640903,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['OptiPrep', 'droplet microfluidics', 'encapsulation efficiency', 'neutral buoyancy', 'single-cell analysis']",2020/01/19 06:00,2020/01/19 06:01,['2020/01/19 06:00'],"['2019/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/19 06:01 [medline]']","['mi11010094 [pii]', '10.3390/mi11010094 [doi]']",epublish,Micromachines (Basel). 2020 Jan 15;11(1). pii: mi11010094. doi: 10.3390/mi11010094.,PMC7019761,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],['CE140100003/Australian Research Council (ARC)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The implication of the fusion protein in leukemogenesis seems to be clear. However, its role in the maintenance of the disease continues to be controversial. METHODS: Generation of an in vitro ETV6/RUNX1 knock out model using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system. Functional characterization by RNA sequencing, proliferation assays, apoptosis and pharmacologic studies, and generation of edited-cell xenograft model. RESULTS: The expression of ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene was completely eliminated, thus generating a powerful model on which to study the role of the fusion gene in leukemic cells. The loss of fusion gene expression led to the deregulation of biological processes affecting survival such as apoptosis resistance and cell proliferation capacity. Tumour cells showed higher levels of apoptosis, lower proliferation rate and a greater sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors in vitro along as a decrease in tumour growth in xenografts models after ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene abrogation. CONCLUSIONS: ETV6/RUNX1 fusion protein seems to play an important role in the maintenance of the leukemic phenotype and could thus become a potential therapeutic target.","['Montano, Adrian', 'Ordonez, Jose Luis', 'Alonso-Perez, Veronica', 'Hernandez-Sanchez, Jesus', 'Santos, Sandra', 'Gonzalez, Teresa', 'Benito, Rocio', 'Garcia-Tunon, Ignacio', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus Maria']","['Montano A', 'Ordonez JL', 'Alonso-Perez V', 'Hernandez-Sanchez J', 'Santos S', 'Gonzalez T', 'Benito R', 'Garcia-Tunon I', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM']",,"['IBSAL, IBMCC, Cancer Research Center, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Cancer Research Center, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Dept of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Salamanca, Campus Unamuno s/n, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Cancer Research Center, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Cancer Research Center, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Cancer Research Center, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Cancer Research Center, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Cancer Research Center, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Cancer Research Center, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Cancer Research Center, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, Universidad de Salamanca and CIBERONC, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200115,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,,"['CRISPR-Associated Protein 9/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Editing', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CRISPR/Cas9', '*ETV6/RUNX1', '*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*genome edition']",2020/01/19 06:00,2021/03/11 06:00,['2020/01/19 06:00'],"['2019/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9010215 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9010215 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Jan 15;9(1). pii: cells9010215. doi: 10.3390/cells9010215.,PMC7017301,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (CRISPR-Associated Protein 9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against BCR-ABL represent the standard therapeutic option for CML, resistances to TKIs can be a serious problem. Thus, the search for novel therapeutic approaches is still needed. CML cells show an increased ROS production, which is required for maintaining the BCR-ABL signaling cascade active. In line with that, reducing ROS levels could be an interesting therapeutic strategy for the clinical management of resistant CML. To analyze the therapeutic potential of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) in CML, we tested the effect of XOR inhibitor allopurinol. Here, we show for the first time the therapeutic potential of allopurinol against BCR-ABL-positive CML cells. Allopurinol reduces the proliferation and clonogenic ability of the CML model cell lines K562 and KCL22. More importantly, the combination of allopurinol with imatinib or nilotinib reduced cell proliferation in a synergistic manner. Moreover, the co-treatment arms hampered cell clonogenic capacity and induced cell death more strongly than each single-agent arm. The reduction of intracellular ROS levels and the attenuation of the BCR-ABL signaling cascade may explain these effects. Finally, the self-renewal potential of primary bone marrow cells from CML patients was also severely reduced especially by the combination of allopurinol with TKIs. In summary, here we show that XOR inhibition is an interesting therapeutic option for CML, which can enhance the effectiveness of the TKIs currently used in clinics.","['Romo-Gonzalez, Marta', 'Moreno-Paz, Sara', 'Garcia-Hernandez, Violeta', 'Sanchez-Guijo, Fermin', 'Hernandez-Hernandez, Angel']","['Romo-Gonzalez M', 'Moreno-Paz S', 'Garcia-Hernandez V', 'Sanchez-Guijo F', 'Hernandez-Hernandez A']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Universidad de Salamanca, Plaza Doctores de la Reina, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL (Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Universidad de Salamanca, Plaza Doctores de la Reina, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Universidad de Salamanca, Plaza Doctores de la Reina, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL (Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL (Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital of Salamanca, Paseo de San Vicente, 139, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Universidad de Salamanca, Plaza Doctores de la Reina, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL (Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200115,Switzerland,Antioxidants (Basel),"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",101668981,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', 'allopurinol', 'imatinib', 'nilotinib', 'reactive oxygen species (ROS)', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)', 'xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR)']",2020/01/19 06:00,2020/01/19 06:01,['2020/01/19 06:00'],"['2019/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/19 06:01 [medline]']","['antiox9010074 [pii]', '10.3390/antiox9010074 [doi]']",epublish,Antioxidants (Basel). 2020 Jan 15;9(1). pii: antiox9010074. doi: 10.3390/antiox9010074.,PMC7022995,"['F.S.-G. has received consultancy honoraria from Novartis, Bristol-Myers-Squibb,', 'Incyte, Pfizer and Gilead, research support from Novartis, and lecturing', 'honoraria from all the companies indicated before and also from Amgen and Roche.', 'The remaining authors declare no conflict of interest.']","['BFU2014-56490-R/Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades', 'CIV17A2822/Fundacion Ramon Areces']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main goal of this study is to quantitatively evaluate the interaction between imatinib mesylate (IMT) and alpha-1 glycoprotein to characterize the nature and forces underlying the formation of a molecular complex. Relaxation experiments provide quantitative information about the relationship between the binding affinity and structure of IMT. Thus, association constant was determined as Ka = 873.36 M(-)(1).

Single-cell sequencing analysis illustrates inherent heterogeneity of the c-Kit(+)/Cd41(+) population and demonstrates that MLL1 induction shifts its composition toward multilineage hematopoietic identities. Surprisingly, this does not occur through increasing Hox or other canonical MLL1 targets but through an enhanced Rac/Rho/integrin signaling state, which increases responsiveness to Vla4 ligands and enhances hematopoietic commitment.

Mexico City has one of the highest incidence rates of childhood leukemia worldwide with 49.5 cases per million children under the age of 15 which is similar to that reported for Hispanic populations living in the United States. In addition, it has been noted a dismal prognosis in Mexican and Hispanic ALL pediatric population. Although ALL, like cancer in general, has its origins in endogenous, exogenous, and genetic factors, several studies have shown that the immune system also plays a deterministic role in cancer development. Among various elements of the immune system, T lymphocytes and NK cells seem to dominate the immune response against leukemia. The aim of the present study was to perform a phenotypic and functional characterization of NK cells in ALL Mexican children at the moment of diagnosis and before treatment initiation. A case-control study was conducted by the Mexican Interinstitutional Group for the Identification of the Causes of Childhood Leukemia (MIGICCL). 41 cases were incident ALL children younger than 17 years old and residents of Mexico City. 14 controls were children without leukemia, matched by age and sex with cases. NK cell function was evaluated by degranulation assays towards K562 cells and SLAM-associated protein (SAP) expression was measured by intracellular staining. All assays were performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from controls and patients. The results indicate that NK mediated cytotoxicity, measured by CD107a degranulation assays in response to K562 cells, was reduced in ALL patients compared to controls. Interestingly, an impaired NK cell killing of target cells was not equally distributed among ALL patients. In contrast to patients classified as high-risk, standard-risk patients did not display a significant reduction in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover, patients presenting a leukocyte count >/= 50,000xmm3 displayed a reduction in NK-cell mediated cytotoxicity and a reduction in SAP expression, indicating a positive correlation between a reduced SAP expression and an impaired NK cell-mediated citotoxicity. In the present study it was observed that unlike patients with standard-risk, NK cells from children presenting high-risk ALL, harbor an impaired cytotoxicity towards K562 at diagnosis. In addition, NK cell function was observed to be compromised in patients with a leukocyte count >/=50,000xmm3, where also it was noticed a decreased expression of SAP compared to patients with a leukocyte count <50,000xmm3. These data indicate NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is not equally affected in ALL patients, nevertheless a positive correlation between low SAP expression and decreased NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity was observed in ALL patients with a leukocyte count >/=50,000xmm3. Finally, an abnormal NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity may represent a prognostic factor for high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Valenzuela-Vazquez, Lucero', 'Nunez-Enriquez, Juan Carlos',

However, current CAR T cell engineering methods use viral delivery vectors, which induce permanent CAR expression and could lead to severe adverse effects. Messenger RNA (mRNA) has been explored as a promising strategy for inducing transient CAR expression in T cells to mitigate the adverse effects associated with viral vectors, but it most commonly requires electroporation for T cell mRNA delivery, which can be cytotoxic. Here, ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were designed for ex vivo mRNA delivery to human T cells. A library of 24 ionizable lipids was synthesized, formulated into LNPs, and screened for luciferase mRNA delivery to Jurkat cells, revealing seven formulations capable of enhanced mRNA delivery over lipofectamine. The top-performing LNP formulation, C14-4, was selected for CAR mRNA delivery to primary human T cells. This platform induced CAR expression at levels equivalent to electroporation, with substantially reduced cytotoxicity. CAR T cells engineered via C14-4 LNP treatment were then compared to electroporated CAR T cells in a coculture assay with Nalm-6 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, and both CAR T cell engineering methods elicited potent cancer-killing activity. These results demonstrate the ability of LNPs to deliver mRNA to primary human T cells to induce functional protein expression, and indicate the potential of LNPs to enhance mRNA-based CAR T cell engineering methods.","['Billingsley, Margaret M', 'Singh, Nathan', 'Ravikumar, Pranali', 'Zhang, Rui', 'June, Carl H', 'Mitchell, Michael J']","['Billingsley MM', 'Singh N', 'Ravikumar P', 'Zhang R', 'June CH', 'Mitchell MJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3628-2244'],"['Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States.', 'Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, United States.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States.', 'Institute for Immunology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States.', 'Cardiovascular Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States.', 'Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200205,United States,Nano Lett,Nano letters,101088070,IM,,"['*Cell Engineering', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', '*Lipids/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', '*RNA, Messenger/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR T', '*Lipid nanoparticles', '*T cell engineering', '*mRNA delivery']",2020/01/18 06:00,2021/01/21 06:00,['2020/01/18 06:00'],"['2020/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b04246 [doi]'],ppublish,Nano Lett. 2020 Mar 11;20(3):1578-1589. doi: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b04246.

In pharmaceutical industry, L-glutaminase can be used as anti-oxidant and anti-cancer agent to treat Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia (ALL). Whereas, in the food industry, L-glutaminase is used for acrylamide degradation, theanine production, flavour enhancer, soy sauce and many. The other applications include nitrogen metabolism and its use as biosensor in hybridoma technology. Both intra-cellular and extra-cellular L-glutaminases from wide range of sources were identified. Because of its diverse applications, there is a need to improve the production of L-glutaminase by enzyme engineering technology.

Yet, the underlying mechanism dictating synergistic efficacy of combination chemotherapy remains largely unknown. The dNTPase SAMHD1, which regulates dNTP homoeostasis antagonistically to ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), limits ara-C efficacy by hydrolysing the active triphosphate metabolite ara-CTP. Here, we report that clinically used inhibitors of RNR, such as gemcitabine and hydroxyurea, overcome the SAMHD1-mediated barrier to ara-C efficacy in primary blasts and mouse models of AML, displaying SAMHD1-dependent synergy with ara-C. We present evidence that this is mediated by dNTP pool imbalances leading to allosteric reduction of SAMHD1 ara-CTPase activity. Thus, SAMHD1 constitutes a novel biomarker for combination therapies of ara-C and RNR inhibitors with immediate consequences for clinical practice to improve treatment of AML.","['Rudd, Sean G',

Here we extend our previous observation that, in human NK cells, the sustained CD16 ligation by obinutuzumab-opsonized targets leads to a markedly enhanced IFN-gamma production upon a subsequent cytokine re-stimulation. The increased IFN-gamma competence in response to IL-2 or IL-15 is attributable to post-transcriptional regulation, as it does not correlate with the upregulation of IFN-gamma mRNA levels. Different from the reference molecule rituximab, we observe that the stimulation with obinutuzumab promotes the upregulation of microRNA (miR)-155 expression. A similar trend was also observed in NK cells from untreated CLL patients stimulated with obinutuzumab-opsonized autologous leukemia. miR-155 upregulation associates with reduced levels of SHIP-1 inositol phosphatase, which acts in constraining PI3K-dependent signals, by virtue of its ability to mediate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) de-phosphorylation. Downstream of PI3K, the phosphorylation status of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) effector molecule, S6, results in amplified response to IL-2 or IL-15 stimulation in obinutuzumab-experienced cells. Importantly, NK cell treatment with the PI3K or mTOR inhibitors, idelalisib and rapamycin, respectively, prevents the enhanced cytokine responsiveness, thus, highlighting the relevance of the PI3K/mTOR axis in CD16-dependent priming. The enhanced IFN-gamma competence may be envisaged to potentiate the immunoregulatory role of NK cells in a therapeutic setting.","['Capuano, Cristina', 'Pighi, Chiara', 'Maggio, Roberta', 'Battella, Simone', 'Morrone, Stefania', 'Palmieri, Gabriella', 'Santoni, Angela', 'Klein, Christian', 'Galandrini, Ricciarda']","['Capuano C', 'Pighi C', 'Maggio R', 'Battella S', 'Morrone S', 'Palmieri G', 'Santoni A', 'Klein C', 'Galandrini R']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6747-3836', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6163-0135', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8319-4418', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1882-1451', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2441-9749', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1467-1417', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1206-7731', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2660-1456']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Viale Regina Elena, 324, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Viale Regina Elena, 324, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Viale Regina Elena, 324, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Clinical Cancer Research, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Viale Regina Elena, 324, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Viale Regina Elena, 324, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Viale Regina Elena, 324, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratorio Pasteur Italia Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Italy.', 'Roche Pharmaceutical Research and Early Development Roche Innovation Center Zurich, Schlieren, Switzerland.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Viale Regina Elena, 324, 00161, Rome, Italy. ricciarda.galandrini@uniroma1.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200116,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-12/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases/genetics/metabolism', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones/pharmacology', 'Receptors, IgG/*metabolism', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD16', 'IFN-gamma', 'Natural killer cells', 'Obinutuzumab', 'PI3K/mTOR', 'miR-155']",2020/01/18 06:00,2020/04/21 06:00,['2020/01/18 06:00'],"['2019/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00262-020-02482-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-020-02482-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2020 Apr;69(4):501-512. doi: 10.1007/s00262-020-02482-2.

Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT imaging with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) showed a significant uptake inmesenteric regional mass (7.6 cm x 4.1 cm) and jejunum wall. The patient underwent a laparotomy, and the involved part of the small intestine along with the mesentery was resected. Histological examination and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining determined the pathological diagnosis was MS. Clinical laboratory tests and a bone marrow biopsy were used to rule out systemic AML. The patient had been treated with a combination of pirarubicin and cytarabine. A follow-up CT scan and necessary clinical laboratory tests were performed after the surgery and no abnormalities were found. To date, the patient continues to be in complete remission. In conclusion, primary MS is a rare disease, yet the diagnosis of MS should be considered when any mass with diffusely infiltrating tumor cells is observed.","['He, Tao', 'Guo, Yun', 'Wang, Chao', 'Yan, Jun', 'Zhang, Meiying', 'Xu, Wei', 'He, Xuan', 'Zheng, Shufang']","['He T', 'Guo Y', 'Wang C', 'Yan J', 'Zhang M', 'Xu W', 'He X', 'Zheng S']",,"[""Department of Pathology, The Affiliated Hospital of Logistics University of Chinese People's Armed Police Force Tianjin 300162, China."", ""Department of Endocrinology and Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Logistics University of Chinese People's Armed Police Force Tianjin 300162, China."", ""Department of Surgical Oncology, The Affiliated Hospital of Logistics University of Chinese People's Armed Police Force Tianjin 300162, China."", 'Department of Pathology, First Center Hospital Tianjin 300192, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Chinese PLA General Hospital # 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing 100853, China.', ""Department of Pathology, The Affiliated Hospital of Logistics University of Chinese People's Armed Police Force Tianjin 300162, China."", ""Department of Pathology, The Affiliated Hospital of Logistics University of Chinese People's Armed Police Force Tianjin 300162, China."", ""Department of Pathology, The Affiliated Hospital of Logistics University of Chinese People's Armed Police Force Tianjin 300162, China.""]",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20180801,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Myeloid sarcoma', 'extramedullary', 'granulocytic sarcoma', 'small intestine']",2018/08/01 00:00,2018/08/01 00:01,['2020/01/18 06:00'],"['2018/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/01 00:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2018 Aug 1;11(8):4158-4162. eCollection 2018.,PMC6962778,['None.'],,,['IJCEP Copyright (c) 2018.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The biological characteristics, including cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and cell cycle, were analyzed in Molt4 cells. Results: ChIP results revealed that miR-149* expression in Jurkat cells transfected with overexpression TAL1 plasmid was higher than that in Jurkat cells alone, while miR-149* expression in Molt-4 cells transfected with knockdown TAL1 plasmid was lower than that in Molt-4 cells alone, suggesting that TAL1 might direct target miR-149*. This was further confirmed by a luciferase activity report assay. Finally, biological functions, such as cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis of TAL1 and miR-149* were measured by MTT and flow cytometry, respectively. It was uncovered that enhanced TAL1 and miR-149* expression promoted cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, and inhibited apoptosis in Molt-4 cells. In contrast, decreased TAL1 and miR-149* expression suppressed cell proliferation, abolished cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, and accelerated apoptosis in Molt-4 cells.

The role of MLF1 in hematologic cancers is well established; however, its role in lung adenocarcinoma is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of MLF1 in lung adenocarcinoma using a variety of cell lines along with patient samples to determine whether MLF1 plays a significant role in this devastating disease. Lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1975, HCC827, and NCI-H460) and primary lung tissue were used to assess the relative levels of MLF1 in lung adenocarcinoma. The lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 was infected with a lentivirus to knockdown MLF1, and successful knockdown was confirmed by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Cell proliferation was assessed through fluorescence imaging and MTT assays. Cell cycle analysis was performed utilizing flow cytometry and formation of cell colonies evaluated microscopically. Proliferation of A549 cells was significantly inhibited in cells where MLF1 was silenced compared to controls. Cell cycle analysis indicated that cell cycle phases were not significantly changed upon the silencing of MLF1 in lung adenocarcinoma cells. A significant increase in apoptosis was observed in MLF1-knockdown cells, while a significant decrease in the number of cell colonies formed was observed in MLF1-knockdown cells compared to controls. In most, but not all, human lung adenocarcinoma tissue samples, MLF1 was upregulated. The results show that MLF1 promotes the proliferation and colony forming abilities of lung adenocarcinoma cells and significantly decreases apoptosis while having no impact on the cell cycle. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed 1) to conclude whether human lung adenocarcinoma upregulates MLF1, 2) to reveal the mechanism of action for MLF1 in lung carcinogenesis and 3) to investigate MLF1 gene therapy for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma.","['Li, Xiaojun', 'Min, Shengping', 'Wang, Hongtao', 'Shen, Yuanbing', 'Li, Wei', 'Chen, Yuqing', 'Wang, Xiaojing']","['Li X', 'Min S', 'Wang H', 'Shen Y', 'Li W', 'Chen Y', 'Wang X']",,"['Department of Thoracic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, Bengbu Medical College Bengbu, Anhui China.', 'Department of Respiration, Anhui Clinical and Preclinical Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, First Affiliated Hospital, Bengbu Medical College Bengbu, Anhui China.', 'Department of Immunology, Bengbu Medical College Bengbu, Anhui China.', 'Department of Respiration, Anhui Clinical and Preclinical Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, First Affiliated Hospital, Bengbu Medical College Bengbu, Anhui China.', 'Department of Respiration, Anhui Clinical and Preclinical Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, First Affiliated Hospital, Bengbu Medical College Bengbu, Anhui China.', 'Department of Respiration, Anhui Clinical and Preclinical Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, First Affiliated Hospital, Bengbu Medical College Bengbu, Anhui China.', 'Department of Respiration, Anhui Clinical and Preclinical Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, First Affiliated Hospital, Bengbu Medical College Bengbu, Anhui China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180701,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Lung cancer', 'gene therapy', 'myeloid leukemia factor 1']",2018/07/01 00:00,2018/07/01 00:01,['2020/01/18 06:00'],"['2018/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/01 00:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2018 Jul 1;11(7):3533-3541. eCollection 2018.,PMC6962855,['None.'],,,['IJCEP Copyright (c) 2018.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The regulatory processes of S100A10 are complicated. S100A10 participates in the regulation of a variety of tumor and non-tumor diseases through cascade reactions with multitudinous signaling molecules. In malignant tumors, such as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and lung cancer, S100A10 is likely involved in their progression, including invasion and metastasis through the regulation of plasmin production and subsequent plasmin-dependent stimulation of other proteases, such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9. Both the plasmin and MMPs are capable of inducing degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membrane, which is a critical step for tumor progression. In non-tumor diseases, the distribution of S100A10 in the brain and its interaction with 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B (5-HT1B) receptor, an important mediator in the central nervous system that maintains a dynamic balance of the neurotransmitters, correlates with depression-like behavior. S100A10 also participates in inflammatory responses through the regulation of peripheral macrophage migration to the inflammatory sites, which depends on the generation of plasmin and other proteinases at the surface of macrophages. Considerable attention should be paid to understand the significant role of S100A10 in the modulation of malignant tumor and non-tumor diseases.","['Li, Chunyuan', 'Ma, Yi', 'Fei, Fei', 'Zheng, Minying', 'Li, Zugui', 'Zhao, Qi', 'Du, Jiaxing', 'Liu, Kai', 'Lu, Rui', 'Zhang, Shiwu']","['Li C', 'Ma Y', 'Fei F', 'Zheng M', 'Li Z', 'Zhao Q', 'Du J', 'Liu K', 'Lu R', 'Zhang S']",,"['Department of Pathology, Tianjin Union Medical Center, Tianjin, P.R.

However, the mechanism is poorly understood. Metabolomics provides an overall understanding of metabolic mechanisms to illustrate celastrol's mechanism of action. We treated both nude mice bearing HL-60 cell xenografts in vivo and HL-60 cells as well as NB-4 cells in vitro with celastrol. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used for metabolomics analysis of HL-60 cells in vivo and for targeted L-cysteine analysis in HL-60 and NB-4 cells in vitro. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to assess mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species and apoptosis. Western blotting was conducted to detect the p53, Bax, cleaved caspase 9 and cleaved caspase 3 proteins. Celastrol inhibited tumour growth, induced apoptosis, and upregulated pro-apoptotic proteins in the xenograft tumour mouse model. Metabolomics showed that cysteine metabolism was the key metabolic alteration after celastrol treatment in HL-60 cells in vivo. Celastrol decreased L-cysteine in HL-60 cells. Acetylcysteine supplementation reversed reactive oxygen species accumulation and apoptosis induced by celastrol and reversed the dramatic decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential and upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins in HL-60 cells. In NB-4 cells, celastrol decreased L-cysteine, and acetylcysteine reversed celastrol-induced reactive oxygen species accumulation and apoptosis. We are the first to identify the involvement of a cysteine metabolism/reactive oxygen species/p53/Bax/caspase 9/caspase 3 pathway in celastrol-triggered mitochondrial apoptosis in HL-60 and NB-4 cells, providing a novel underlying mechanism through which celastrol could be used to treat acute myeloid leukaemia, especially acute promyelocytic leukaemia.","['Chen, Minjian', 'Yang, Jing', 'Li, Lei', 'Hu, Yanhui', 'Lu, Xiaomei', 'Sun, Rongli', 'Wang, Yubang', 'Wang, Xinru', 'Zhang, Xiaoling']","['Chen M', 'Yang J', 'Li L', 'Hu Y', 'Lu X', 'Sun R', 'Wang Y', 'Wang X', 'Zhang X']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology of Ministry of Education, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China.', 'Wuxi Maternal and Child Health Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214002, China.', 'Experiment Center for Teaching and Learning, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 201203, China.', 'Department of Hygienic Analysis and Detection, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology of Ministry of Education, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China.', 'Safety Assessment and Research Center for Drug, Pesticide, and Veterinary Drug of Jiangsu Province, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China.', 'Department of Hygienic Analysis and Detection, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology of Ministry of Education, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China.', 'Safety Assessment and Research Center for Drug, Pesticide, and Veterinary Drug of Jiangsu Province, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology of Ministry of Education, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China.', 'Department of Hygienic Analysis and Detection, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China. zhangxl3@njmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200116,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cysteine/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Metabolome/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Pentacyclic Triterpenes', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2020/01/18 06:00,2020/11/13 06:00,['2020/01/18 06:00'],"['2019/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-57312-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-57312-y [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Jan 16;10(1):471. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-57312-y.,PMC6965619,,,"['0 (Pentacyclic Triterpenes)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Triterpenes)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'L8GG98663L (celastrol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 86 AML children aged <17 years. According to the treatment regimen, these children were divided into a conventional chemotherapy group and a dasatinib chemotherapy group. The 57 children in the conventional chemotherapy group were given conventional chemotherapy drugs without tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and the 29 children in the dasatinib chemotherapy group were given conventional chemotherapy drugs and dasatinib. The two groups were compared in terms of height standard deviation score (HtSDS) at the beginning of treatment and after treatment, as well as the change in HtSDS after 1 and 2 years of treatment. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in HtSDS between the conventional and dasatinib chemotherapy groups before treatment. Within the first two years of treatment, the dasatinib chemotherapy group had a similar change trend of HtSDS as the conventional chemotherapy group. Four children in the dasatinib chemotherapy group reached the final adult height during follow-up, which was significantly lower than the target height (P=0.044). In the conventional chemotherapy group, there was no significant difference between final adult height and target height. In the dasatinib chemotherapy group, the children in adolescence had a significant change in HtSDS after treatment (P=0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib treatment may affect the final height of children with AML, and the use of dasatinib after the beginning of adolescence may lead to growth disorder, but dasatinib treatment has little effect on body height in the short-term treatment.","['Zheng, Fang-Yuan', 'Lu, Ai-Dong', 'Zhang, Le-Ping', 'Zuo, Ying-Xi', 'Jia, Yue-Ping', 'Wu, Jun']","['Zheng FY', 'Lu AD', 'Zhang LP', 'Zuo YX', 'Jia YP', 'Wu J']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China. zhangleping@pkuph.edu.cn.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,IM,,"['Adolescent', '*Body Height', 'Child', 'Dasatinib/*therapeutic use', 'Growth Disorders', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2020/01/18 06:00,2020/01/24 06:00,['2020/01/18 06:00'],"['2020/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2020.01.010 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2020 Jan;22(1):47-52.,PMC7389709,,,['RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This rodent model has been shown to emulate many aspects of the natural killer (NK) variant of human LGL leukemia. Previous transplantation of leukemic material into young F344 rats resulted in several strains of rat NK (RNK) primary leukemic cells. One strain, RNK-16, was adapted into the RNK-16 cell line and established as an aggressive NK-LGL leukemia model. Whole genome sequencing of the RNK-16 cell line identified 255,838 locations where the RNK16 had an alternate allele that was different from F334, including a mutation in Jak1. Functional studies showed Jak1 Y1034C to be a somatic activating mutation that mediated increased STAT signaling, as assessed by phosphoprotein levels. Sanger sequencing of Jak1 in RNK-1, -3, -7, and -16 found only RNK-16 to harbor the Y1034C Jak1 mutation. In vivo studies revealed that rats engrafted with RNK-16 primary material developed leukemia more rapidly than those engrafted with RNK-1, -3, and -7. Additionally, ex vivo RNK-16 spleen cells from leukemic rats exhibited increased STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 phosphorylation compared to other RNK strains. Therefore, we report and characterize a novel gain-of-function Jak1 mutation in a spontaneous LGL leukemia model that results in increased downstream STAT signaling.","['Wang, T Tiffany', 'Yang, Jun', 'Dighe, Shubha', 'Schmachtenberg, Matthew W', 'Leigh, Nathan T', 'Farber, Emily', 'Onengut-Gumuscu, Suna', 'Feith, David J', 'Ratan, Aakrosh', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr', 'Olson, Thomas L']","['Wang TT', 'Yang J', 'Dighe S', 'Schmachtenberg MW', 'Leigh NT', 'Farber E', 'Onengut-Gumuscu S', 'Feith DJ', 'Ratan A', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Olson TL']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4981-1691', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0782-3056']","['Department of Medicine and University of Virginia Cancer Center, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and University of Virginia Cancer Center, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and University of Virginia Cancer Center, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and University of Virginia Cancer Center, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and University of Virginia Cancer Center, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Center for Public Health Genomics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Center for Public Health Genomics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and University of Virginia Cancer Center, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Center for Public Health Genomics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and University of Virginia Cancer Center, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and University of Virginia Cancer Center, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200103,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['F344', 'JAK/STAT', 'NK cells', 'RNK-16', 'activation', 'leukemia', 'mutation']",2020/01/18 06:00,2020/01/18 06:01,['2020/01/18 06:00'],"['2019/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/18 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12010126 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12010126 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jan 3;12(1). pii: cancers12010126. doi: 10.3390/cancers12010126.,PMC7017127,,"['R25 CA206972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA178393/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA044579/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first two clinical trials conducted in sarcoma and neuroblastoma patients showed clinical benefits of CAR T-cells, yet multiple obstacles still hold us back from having accessible and efficient therapy. Why did such an effective treatment for relapsed and refractory hematological malignancies demonstrate only relatively modest efficiency in the context of solid tumors? Is it due to the lucky selection of the ""magic"" CD19 antigen, which might be one of a kind? Or do lymphomas lack the immunosuppressive features of solid tumors? Here we review the existing knowledge in the field of CAR T-cell therapy and address the heterogeneity of solid tumors and their diverse strategies of immunoevasion.

Beneficial therapeutic effects have been postulated in leukemia, prostate, breast, liver and in synovial sarcoma models. In those indications, MLL1 recruitment by menin was described to critically regulate the expression of disease associated genes. However, most findings so far rely on single study reports. Here we independently evaluated the pathogenic functions of the menin-MLL interaction in a large set of different cancer models with a potent and selective probe inhibitor BAY-155. We characterized the inhibition of the menin-MLL interaction for anti-proliferation, gene transcription effects, and for efficacy in several in vivo xenografted tumor models. We found a specific therapeutic activity of BAY-155 primarily in AML/ALL models. In solid tumors, we observed anti-proliferative effects of BAY-155 in a surprisingly limited fraction of cell line models. These findings were further validated in vivo. Overall, our study using a novel, highly selective and potent inhibitor, shows that the menin-MLL interaction is not essential for the survival of most solid cancer models. We can confirm that disrupting the menin-MLL complex has a selective therapeutic benefit in MLL-fused leukemia. In solid cancers, effects are restricted to single models and more limited than previously claimed.","['Brzezinka, Krzysztof', 'Nevedomskaya, Ekaterina', 'Lesche, Ralf', 'Haegebarth, Andrea', 'Ter Laak, Antonius', 'Fernandez-Montalvan, Amaury E', 'Eberspaecher, Uwe', 'Werbeck, Nicolas D', 'Moenning, Ursula', 'Siegel, Stephan', 'Haendler, Bernard', 'Eheim, Ashley L', 'Stresemann, Carlo']","['Brzezinka K', 'Nevedomskaya E', 'Lesche R', 'Haegebarth A', 'Ter Laak A', 'Fernandez-Montalvan AE', 'Eberspaecher U', 'Werbeck ND', 'Moenning U', 'Siegel S', 'Haendler B', 'Eheim AL', 'Stresemann C']",,"['Bayer AG, Innovation Campus Berlin, Research & Development, Pharmaceuticals, Muellerstrasse 178, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Research & Development, Pharmaceuticals, Muellerstrasse 178, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Innovation Campus Berlin, Research & Development, Pharmaceuticals, Muellerstrasse 178, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Research & Development, Pharmaceuticals, Muellerstrasse 178, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Research & Development, Pharmaceuticals, Muellerstrasse 178, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Innovation Campus Berlin, Research & Development, Pharmaceuticals, Muellerstrasse 178, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Innovation Campus Berlin, Research & Development, Pharmaceuticals, Muellerstrasse 178, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Innovation Campus Berlin, Research & Development, Pharmaceuticals, Muellerstrasse 178, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Innovation Campus Berlin, Research & Development, Pharmaceuticals, Muellerstrasse 178, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Research & Development, Pharmaceuticals, Muellerstrasse 178, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Research & Development, Pharmaceuticals, Muellerstrasse 178, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Research & Development, Pharmaceuticals, Muellerstrasse 178, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Innovation Campus Berlin, Research & Development, Pharmaceuticals, Muellerstrasse 178, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200114,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'chemical probe', 'menin-MLL', 'solid tumor', 'target validation']",2020/01/18 06:00,2020/01/18 06:01,['2020/01/18 06:00'],"['2019/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/18 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12010201 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12010201 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jan 14;12(1). pii: cancers12010201. doi: 10.3390/cancers12010201.,PMC7016952,"['Except A.E.F.-M all authors are employees of Bayer AG.

The overexpression of drug-efflux pumps, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), is a major cause of MDR. Importantly, different studies have shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs) participate in the communication between MDR cells and drug-sensitive counterparts, promoting dissemination of the MDR phenotype. In the present work, we aimed to identify RNA species present in MDR cells and in EVs released by those cells, which may be associated with the MDR phenotype. The RNA content from two pairs (leukemia and lung cancer) of MDR (P-gp overexpressing) cells and their drug-sensitive counterparts, as well as from their EVs, was analyzed by deep sequencing. Our results showed distinctive transcripts for MDR cells and their EVs, when compared with their drug-sensitive counterparts. Remarkably, two pseudogenes (a novel pseudogene and RNA 5.8S ribosomal pseudogene 2) were found to be increased in EVs released by MDR cells in both leukemia and lung cancer models. Moreover, six miRs (miR-204-5p, miR-139-5p, miR-29c-5p, miR-551b-3p, miR-29b-2-5p, and miR-204-3p) exhibited altered levels in lung cancer MDR cells and their EVs.

However, the challenges of accurate and consistent forecasting lie in the high variability of the disease outcomes and the complexity of the multiple clinical measurements available over the course of the treatment. In order to capture the multi-dimensional and longitudinal aspect of these comprehensive clinical parameters, we utilize an attention-based bi-directional long shortterm memory (Att-BLSTM) network to predict AML patient's survival and relapse. Specifically, we gather a 10-year worth of real patient's clinical data including blood test, medication, HSCT status, and gene mutation information.

The current best clinical practice relies heavily on Flow Cytometry (FC) examination. However, the current FC diagnostic examination requires trained physicians to perform lengthy manual interpretation on high-dimensional FC data measurements of each specimen. The difficulty in handling idiosyncrasy between interpreters along with the time-consuming diagnostic process has become one of the major bottlenecks in advancing the treatment of hematological diseases. In this work, we develop an automatic MRD classifications (AML, MDS, normal) algorithm based on learning a deep phenotype representation from a large cohort of retrospective clinical data with over 2000 real patients' FC samples. We propose to learn a cytometric deep embedding through cell-level autoencoder combined with specimen-level latent Fisher-scoring vectorization. Our method achieves an average AUC of 0.943 across four different hematological malignancies classification tasks, and our analysis further reveals that with only half of the FC markers would be sufficient in obtaining these high recognition accuracies.","['Li, Jeng-Lin', 'Wang, Yu-Fen', 'Ko, Bor-Sheng', 'Li, Chi-Cheng', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Lee, Chi-Chun']","['Li JL', 'Wang YF', 'Ko BS', 'Li CC', 'Tang JL', 'Lee CC']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

While infections are a frequent and potentially severe complication while on treatment, less is known about the risk for infections following therapy completion. In this article, we propose that leukemia survivors might be at increased risk of infections following therapy completion than the general population, independently of potential confounders such as age, sex and Down syndrome. This association is conceivably due to several factors. First, therapy-induced immune dysfunction of both the humoral and cellular compartments appears to last for several years following anti-cancer therapy and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Second, clinical and epidemiological research has shown leukemia survivors are disproportionally affected by comorbidities related to leukemia treatment and its complications, such as diabetes and obesity, which may induce secondary immunodeficiency and infections. Last, differences in health-related behaviors between leukemia survivors and the general population (such as re-vaccination practices) may affect the baseline risk of infections. Although under-represented in the epidemiological literature as a possible late effect of childhood leukemia and its treatment, it is plausible that leukemia survivors are at increased risk of infections for several years when compared to the general population and their siblings. Further research is needed to empirically test these hypotheses.","['Pelland-Marcotte, Marie-Claude', 'Pole, Jason D', 'Sutradhar, Rinku', 'Nathan, Paul C', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Pelland-Marcotte MC', 'Pole JD', 'Sutradhar R', 'Nathan PC', 'Sung L']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, CHU de Quebec, 2705 Boulevard Laurier, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada; Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the interactions of PMP with platelets and explore the involvement of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4). METHODS: PMP were separated by ultracentrifugation of expired platelet concentrates and added to: i) washed platelets, to confirm uptake, by flow cytometry and confocal and transmission electron microscopy, ii) platelet rich plasma (PRP), to assess changes in platelet function due to uptake by aggregometry in response to ADP; and iii) whole blood, to evaluate heterotypic aggregate (HA) formation by flow cytometry. Moreover, whole blood previously enriched with platelets with internalized PMP was used to explore modifications in thromboelastometry parameters (ROTEM). The inhibitory action of anti-TLR-4 was investigated. RESULTS: Confocal and ultrastructural microscopy studies revealed PMP internalization by platelets. Flow cytometry showed PMP-platelet association (p < 0.01 vs controls, at different PMP dilutions). PMP, at 1/20 dilution, increased HA (p < 0.05 vs controls), the percentage of maximal platelet aggregation to ADP (p < 0.05 vs controls), and accelerated clotting and clot formation times (p < 0.05 vs controls). Incubation of platelets with anti-TLR-4 prior to exposure to PMP reduced PMP-platelet association (p < 0.05 vs absence of the antibody), prevented HA formation, reduced maximal platelet aggregation and normalized ROTEM parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Platelets exhibit internalization ability towards their own PMP, a process that potentiates their thrombogenicity and is partially mediated by the innate immunity receptor TLR-4.","['Jerez-Dolz, Didac', 'Torramade-Moix, Sergi', 'Palomo, Marta', 'Moreno-Castano, Ana', 'Lopez-Vilchez, Irene', 'Hernandez, Rosa', 'Badimon, Juan Jose', 'Zafar, M Urooj', 'Diaz-Ricart, Maribel', 'Escolar, Gines']","['Jerez-Dolz D', 'Torramade-Moix S', 'Palomo M', 'Moreno-Castano A', 'Lopez-Vilchez I', 'Hernandez R', 'Badimon JJ', 'Zafar MU', 'Diaz-Ricart M', 'Escolar G']",,"['Hematopathology, Pathological Anatomy, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Biomedical Diagnosis Centre (CDB), Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology, Pathological Anatomy, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Biomedical Diagnosis Centre (CDB), Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology, Pathological Anatomy, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Biomedical Diagnosis Centre (CDB), Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Hospital Clinic/University of Barcelona Campus, Barcelona, Spain; Barcelona Endothelium Team, Hospital Clinic/University of Barcelona Campus, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology, Pathological Anatomy, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Biomedical Diagnosis Centre (CDB), Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology, Pathological Anatomy, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Biomedical Diagnosis Centre (CDB), Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology, Pathological Anatomy, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Biomedical Diagnosis Centre (CDB), Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Atherothrombosis Research Unit, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA.', 'Atherothrombosis Research Unit, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA.', 'Hematopathology, Pathological Anatomy, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Biomedical Diagnosis Centre (CDB), Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Barcelona Endothelium Team, Hospital Clinic/University of Barcelona Campus, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology, Pathological Anatomy, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Biomedical Diagnosis Centre (CDB), Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Atherothrombosis Research Unit, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA.

Individual prognosis is typically based on the presence of chromosomal and genetic lesions. Nevertheless, these classifications often lack a priori information about response to therapy. Since the protein expression landscape reflects the functional activity state of cells, we hypothesize that analyzing this can be used for the identification of protein activity markers to provide better risk stratification as well as may provide targeted therapeutic guidance in AML.Areas covered: Herein, we review recently new adopted drugs in the treatment for AML and discuss how quantitative proteomic techniques may contribute to better therapeutic selection in AML.Expert commentary: The net functional state of the cell is defined by the activity of protein within all the pathways that are active in the cell. Recognition of the proteomic profile of the leukemic blast could, therefore, complement current classification systems by providing a better a priori description of what pathways are important within a cell as a guide to the selection of therapy for the patient.","['van Dijk, Anneke D', 'de Bont, Eveline S J M', 'Kornblau, Steven M']","['van Dijk AD', 'de Bont ESJM', 'Kornblau SM']",,"['Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200123,England,Expert Rev Proteomics,Expert review of proteomics,101223548,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Proteome/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Translational Research, Biomedical/methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Proteomics', '*RPPA', '*acute leukemia', '*reverse-phase protein arrays', '*targeted therapy']",2020/01/17 06:00,2021/07/07 06:00,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14789450.2020.1717951 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Proteomics. 2020 Jan;17(1):1-10. doi: 10.1080/14789450.2020.1717951.

Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are novel intercellular communication structures transporting different cargos with potential implications in therapy resistance. Here, we have investigated TNTs in CML cells and following treatment with the highly effective CML therapeutics tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and interferon-alpha (IFNalpha). CML cells from chronic phase CML patients as well as the blast crisis phase cell lines, Kcl-22 and K562, formed few or no TNTs. Treatment with imatinib increased TNT formation in both Kcl-22 and K562 cells, while nilotinib or IFNalpha increased TNTs in Kcl-22 cells only where the TNT increase was associated with adherence to fibronectin-coated surfaces, altered morphology, and reduced movement involving beta1integrin. Ex vivo treated cells from chronic phase CML patients showed limited changes in TNT formation similarly to bone marrow cells from healthy individuals. Interestingly, in vivo nilotinib treatment in a Kcl-22 subcutaneous mouse model resulted in morphological changes and TNT-like structures in the tumor-derived Kcl-22 cells. Our results demonstrate that CML cells express low levels of TNTs, but CML therapeutics increase TNT formation in designated cell models indicating TNT functionality in bone marrow derived malignancies and their microenvironment.","['Omsland, Maria', 'Andresen, Vibeke', 'Gullaksen, Stein-Erik', 'Ayuda-Duran, Pilar', 'Popa, Mihaela', 'Hovland, Randi', 'Brendehaug, Atle', 'Enserink, Jorrit', 'McCormack, Emmet', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore']","['Omsland M', 'Andresen V', 'Gullaksen SE', 'Ayuda-Duran P', 'Popa M', 'Hovland R', 'Brendehaug A', 'Enserink J', 'McCormack E', 'Gjertsen BT']",,"['Centre for Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Centre for Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Centre for Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute for Cancer Research, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'KinN Therapeutics, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute for Cancer Research, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Centre for Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Centre for Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200116,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/*drug effects', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Integrin beta1/metabolism', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*cell adhesion', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*interferon-alpha', '*tunneling nanotubes', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2020/01/17 06:00,2021/01/26 06:00,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2018/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fj.201802061RR [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 2020 Mar;34(3):3773-3791. doi: 10.1096/fj.201802061RR.

However, little is known about the role of ZAP in the antiviral immune response. We now show that ZAP participates in the antiviral immune response by activating T cells. Overexpression of ZAP significantly inhibited avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) replication and reduced the associated inflammatory damage in vivo. In this study, we found that ZAP tended to be expressed in T lymphocytes, especially after ALV-J infection. T lymphocyte proliferation proceeded as usual in response to ALV-J infection in the presence of ZAP, indicating that ZAP endows T lymphocytes with resistance to the immunosuppression caused by ALV-J. Furthermore, ZAP activated cytokine secretion by T lymphocytes by contributing to nuclear translocation of nuclear factors of activated T cells and indirectly promoted anti-ALV-J antibody generation. Together, our findings show that ZAP, acting as an immunomodulatory factor, is involved in the antiviral immune response via T lymphocyte activation.","['Zhu, Mingjun', 'Zhou, Jing', 'Liang, Yanfei', 'Nair, Venugopal', 'Yao, Yongxiu', 'Cheng, Ziqiang']","['Zhu M', 'Zhou J', 'Liang Y', 'Nair V', 'Yao Y', 'Cheng Z']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4323-2541'],"[""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an City, Shandong, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an City, Shandong, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an City, Shandong, China."", 'The Pirbright Institute & UK-China Centre of Excellence on Avian Disease Research, Pirbright, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom.', 'The Pirbright Institute & UK-China Centre of Excellence on Avian Disease Research, Pirbright, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom.', ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an City, Shandong, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200116,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*metabolism', 'Avian Leukosis/*immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/immunology', 'Avian Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Chickens', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Marek Disease/*immunology/metabolism/virology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Replication', 'Zinc Fingers']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Avian leukosis virus subgroup J', '*CCCH-type zinc finger antiviral protein', '*NFAT', '*T lymphocytes', '*activation']",2020/01/17 06:00,2020/07/02 06:00,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/JLB.1AB1119-314RRR [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2020 Feb;107(2):299-307. doi: 10.1002/JLB.1AB1119-314RRR.

To examine the prognostic and biologic significance of circRNA expression in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML), we conducted whole-transcriptome profiling in 365 younger adults (age 18-60 years) with CN-AML. We applied a novel pipeline, called Massive Scan for circRNA, to identify and quantify circRNA expression. We validated the high sensitivity and specificity of our pipeline by performing RNase R treatment and RNA sequencing in samples of AML patients and cell lines. Unsupervised clustering analyses identified 3 distinct circRNA expression-based clusters with different frequencies of clinical and molecular features. After dividing our cohort into training and validation data sets, we identified 4 circRNAs (circCFLAR, circKLHL8, circSMC1A, and circFCHO2) that were prognostic in both data sets; high expression of each prognostic circRNA was associated with longer disease-free, overall, and event-free survival. In multivariable analyses, high circKLHL8 and high circFCHO2 expression were independently associated with better clinical outcome of CN-AML patients, after adjusting for other covariates. To examine the biologic relevance of circRNA expression, we performed knockdown screening experiments in a subset of prognostic and gene mutation-related candidate circRNAs. We identified circFBXW7, but not its linear messenger RNA, as a regulator of the proliferative capacity of AML blasts. In summary, our findings underscore the molecular associations, prognostic significance, and functional relevance of circRNA expression in CN-AML.","['Papaioannou, Dimitrios', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Nicolet, Deedra', 'Swierniak, Michal', 'Petri, Andreas', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Bill, Marius', 'Pepe, Felice', 'Walker, Christopher J', 'Walker, Allison E', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Eisfeld, Ann-Kathrin', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Uy, Geoffrey L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Kauppinen, Sakari', 'Dorrance, Adrienne', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Byrd, John C', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Garzon, Ramiro']","['Papaioannou D', 'Volinia S', 'Nicolet D', 'Swierniak M', 'Petri A', 'Mrozek K', 'Bill M', 'Pepe F', 'Walker CJ', 'Walker AE', 'Carroll AJ', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Eisfeld AK', 'Powell BL', 'Uy GL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Wang ES', 'Kauppinen S', 'Dorrance A', 'Stone RM', 'Byrd JC', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Garzon R']",,"['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Alliance Statistics and Data Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Center for RNA Medicine, Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Alliance Statistics and Data Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'The Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Monter Cancer Center, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Lake Success, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY; and.', 'Center for RNA Medicine, Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard University, Boston, MA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cytogenetics/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Circular/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/17 06:00,2021/04/15 06:00,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31653-0 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000568 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Jan 28;4(2):239-251. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000568.,PMC6988408,,"['UG1 CA233331/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180850/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233191/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180861/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA196171/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (RNA, Circular)']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,['Blood Adv. 2020 Jun 23;4(12):2577.

The addition of new markers can improve the accuracy and applicability of MFC-based MRD assay further. Herein, we evaluated the utility of a new marker, CD304/neuropilin-1, in the assessment of MFC-based MRD. METHODS: Expression patterns of CD304 were studied in leukemic blasts from BCP-ALL patients and in normal precursor B cells (NPBC) from uninvolved non-BCP-ALL bone marrow samples using 10-color MFC. MRD was monitored at end-of-induction (EOI; Days 35-40) and end-of-consolidation (Day 78-80) time points. RESULTS: We studied CD304 expression in 300 pediatric BCP-ALL patients and found it positive in BCP-ALL blasts in 41.7% of diagnostic samples. It was significantly associated with ETV6-RUNX1 (p < .001) as well as BCR-ABL1 (p = .019) and inversely associated with TCF3-PBX1 fusion gene (p = .0012). It was found clearly negative in NPBC. EOI-MRD was detectable in 152/300 (50.7%; >/=0.01% in 35.33% and <0.01% in 15.33%) samples, in which CD304 was positive in 72/152 (47.4%) diagnostic and 63/152 (41.4%) MRD samples. It was positive in 45.7% (21/46) of low-level (<0.01%) MRD samples. In comparison with diagnostic samples, its expression was retained in 68.06% (49/72), lost in 31.94% (23/72), and gained in 14/80 (17.5%) of EOI-MRD samples. CONCLUSIONS: CD304 is commonly expressed in leukemic blasts of BCP-ALL. It is very useful in distinguishing residual disease from hematogones and is a fairly dependable marker. Hence, it is a valuable addition for enhancing the sensitivity and applicability of MFC-based MRD assay in BCP-ALL.","['Gudapati, Pratyusha', 'Khanka, Twinkle', 'Chatterjee, Gaurav', 'Ghogale, Sitaram', 'Badrinath, Yajamanam', 'Deshpande, Nilesh', 'Patil, Jagruti', 'Narula, Gaurav', 'Shetty, Dhanalaxmi', 'Banavali, Shripad', 'Patkar, Nikhil V', 'Gujral, Sumeet', 'Subramanian, Papagudi G', 'Tembhare, Prashant R']","['Gudapati P', 'Khanka T', 'Chatterjee G', 'Ghogale S', 'Badrinath Y', 'Deshpande N', 'Patil J', 'Narula G', 'Shetty D', 'Banavali S', 'Patkar NV', 'Gujral S', 'Subramanian PG', 'Tembhare PR']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9030-0415'],"['Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Tata Memorial Center, Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, Mumbai, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra.', 'Department of Cancer Cytogenetics, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Tata Memorial Center, Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, Mumbai, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Center, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200116,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

A phase 2 study further evaluated efficacy. PROCEDURE: This international, multicenter, phase 2 study enrolled children with relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor ALL who received moxetumomab pasudotox 40 microg/kg intravenously every other day, for six doses per 21-day cycle. The primary objective was to evaluate the complete response (CR) rate. Secondary objectives included safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity evaluations. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (median age, 10 years) were enrolled at 16 sites; 30 received study drug and were evaluable for safety; 28 were evaluable for response. The objective response rate was 28.6%, with three patients (10.7%) achieving morphologic CR, and five patients (17.9%) achieving partial response. Disease progression occurred in 11 patients (39.3%). Ten patients (33.3%) experienced at least one treatment-related serious adverse event, including capillary leak syndrome (CLS; n = 6), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS; n = 4), and treatment-related death (n = 1) from pulmonary edema. No differences were observed in inflammatory markers in patients who did or did not develop CLS or HUS. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a signal for clinical activity, this phase 2 study was terminated at interim analysis for a CR rate that did not reach the stage 1 target. Preclinical data suggest enhanced efficacy of moxetumomab pasudotox via continuous infusion or in combination regimens; thus, further studies designed to optimize the efficacy and safety of moxetumomab pasudotox in pediatric ALL may be warranted.","['Shah, Nirali N', 'Bhojwani, Deepa', 'August, Keith', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Boklan, Jessica', 'Dalla-Pozza, Luciano', 'Dennis, Robyn', 'Hijiya, Nobuko', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Martin, Paul L', 'Mechinaud, Francoise', 'Moppett, John', 'Rheingold, Susan R', 'Schmitt, Claudine', 'Trippett, Tanya M', 'Liang, Meina', 'Balic, Kemal', 'Li, Xia', 'Vainshtein, Inna', 'Yao, Nai Shun', 'Pastan, Ira', 'Wayne, Alan S']","['Shah NN', 'Bhojwani D', 'August K', 'Baruchel A', 'Bertrand Y', 'Boklan J', 'Dalla-Pozza L', 'Dennis R', 'Hijiya N', 'Locatelli F', 'Martin PL', 'Mechinaud F', 'Moppett J', 'Rheingold SR', 'Schmitt C', 'Trippett TM', 'Liang M', 'Balic K', 'Li X', 'Vainshtein I', 'Yao NS', 'Pastan I', 'Wayne AS']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8474-9080', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5690-0855']","['National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', ""Children's Hospital Los Angeles, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California."", ""Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, Missouri."", 'Robert Debre Hospital (APHP and University Paris Diderot), Paris, France.', ""CHU Institut d'Hematologie et Oncologie Pediatrique, Lyon, France."", ""Phoenix Children's Hospital, Phoenix, Arizona."", ""The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, Australia."", ""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", ""Ann & Robert H.

METHODS: Patients (>/=2 years) treated according to the Dutch ALL-11 protocol were included. Sleep was measured using parent-reports and self-reports (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire; CSHQ) and actigraphy. Parental sleep (Medical Outcome Study Sleep Scale) and distress and parenting problems (Distress Thermometer for Parents) were assessed with questionnaires. Z-scores were calculated for total CSHQ scores using age-appropriate scores of healthy Dutch children. The prevalence of sleep problems (defined as a Z-score > 1) in patients with ALL was compared to healthy children (chi-square tests). Actigraphic sleep estimates were collected in healthy Dutch children (n = 86, 2-18 years) for comparison with patients (linear regression). Determinants of parent-reported child sleep (total CSHQ Z-score) were identified with regression models. RESULTS: Responses were collected for 124 patients (response rate 67%), comprising 123 parent-reports, 34 self-reports, and 69 actigraphy assessments. Parents reported sleep problems in 38.0% of the patients compared to 15.2% in healthy children (P < .001). Patients reported fewer sleep problems themselves: 12.1% compared to 15.8% in healthy children (P = .33). Total time in bed (B (95% CI): 22.89 (9.55-36.22)) and total sleep time (B (95% CI):16.30 (1.40-31.19)), as derived from actigraphy, were significantly longer in patients. More parent-reported child sleep problems were predicted by parenting problems, more parental sleep problems, bedroom sharing, and child's sleep medication use (explained variance: 27.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Systematic monitoring of child and parental sleep and implementation of effective interventions may be a gateway to improve quality of survival in pediatric ALL.","['Steur, Lindsay M H', 'Grootenhuis, Martha A', 'Van Someren, Eus J W', 'Van Eijkelenburg, Natasha K A', 'Van der Sluis, Inge M', 'Dors, Natasja', 'Van den Bos, Cor', 'Tissing, Wim J E', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Van Litsenburg, Raphaele R L']","['Steur LMH', 'Grootenhuis MA', 'Van Someren EJW', 'Van Eijkelenburg NKA', 'Van der Sluis IM', 'Dors N', 'Van den Bos C', 'Tissing WJE', 'Kaspers GJL', 'Van Litsenburg RRL']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5177-030X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9970-8791', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0526-3737', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5822-7668', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6175-6077', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9101-507X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7716-8475', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1779-6159']","[""Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Sleep and Cognition, Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (An institute of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Integrative Neurophysiology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Center for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research (CNCR), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Psychiatry, Amterdam Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Sophia Children's Hospital, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Amalia Children's Hospital, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', ""Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200115,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', '*Parents', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Prevalence', '*Sleep Wake Disorders/chemically induced/epidemiology/physiopathology', '*Surveys and Questionnaires']",['NOTNLM'],"['*actigraphy', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*parenting', '*pediatric', '*questionnaires', '*sleep']",2020/01/17 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28165 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Apr;67(4):e28165. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28165.

However, secondary liver cancer is rare, and ICC following HCT has never been reported in the literature. Secondary solid cancers typically have a long latency period, and cholangiocarcinoma is classically a malignancy occurring in older individuals. Here, we report the first case of secondary ICC, which presented just 3 years after HCT in a young adult with a history of childhood ALL. A 26-year-old male with history of precursor B-cell ALL presented with asymptomatic elevated liver function tests 3 years after HCT. Laboratories were indicative of biliary obstruction. ERCP showed focal biliary stricturing of the common and left hepatic ducts. MRCP revealed left intrahepatic duct dilatation, suggestive of intrahepatic obstructing mass. Additional workup lead to a clinical diagnosis of ICC. The patient underwent left hepatectomy with extrahepatic bile duct resection and portal lymphadenectomy. Surgical pathology was consistent with moderately differentiated cholangiocarcinoma. Our case illustrates a rare SMN following HCT for ALL. It is the first case report of ICC occurring as a secondary cancer in this patient population. Although cholangiocarcinoma is characteristically diagnosed in the older population, it must remain on the differential for biliary obstruction in post-HCT patients.","['Good, Meghan L', 'Malekzadeh, Parisa', 'Kriley, Isaac R', 'Shah, Nirali N', 'Kleiner, David E', 'Calvo, Katherine', 'Hernandez, Jonathan M', 'Davis, Jeremy L']","['Good ML', 'Malekzadeh P', 'Kriley IR', 'Shah NN', 'Kleiner DE', 'Calvo K', 'Hernandez JM', 'Davis JL']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3988-1365', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8474-9080']","['Surgical Oncology Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Surgical Oncology Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Surgical Oncology Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Surgical Oncology Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Surgical Oncology Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200116,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,IM,,"['Adult', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', '*Hepatic Duct, Common', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*bone marrow transplant', '*case report', '*cholangiocarcinoma', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplant', '*secondary malignancy']",2020/01/17 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13653 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2020 Mar;24(2):e13653. doi: 10.1111/petr.13653.

Thirteen pediatric patients with severe BKV-HC from December 2013 to December 2015 were treated with MSCs. The number of MSCs transfused in each session was 1 x 10(6) /kg once a week until the symptoms improved. The median follow-up time was 1432 (89-2080) days. The median frequency of MSC infusion was 2 (1-3), with eight cured cases and five effective cases; the total efficacy rate was 100%. The copy number of urine BKV DNA was 4.43 (0.36-56.9) x10(8) /mL before MSC infusion and 2.67 (0-56.3) x10(8) /mL after MSC infusion; the difference was not significant (P = .219). There were no significant differences in the overall survival, disease-free survival, and the incidence of relapse and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease between the MSC infusion group and non-MSC infusion group. There was also no significant difference in the cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and fungal and bacterial infection rates between the two groups. Although umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs do not reduce the number of BKV DNA copies in the urine, the cells have a high efficacy rate and minimal side effects in treating severe BKV-HC after UCBT among pediatric patients. MSCs do not affect the rates of relapse, long-term infection, or survival of patients with leukemia.","['Tong, Juan', 'Liu, HuiLan', 'Zheng, ChangCheng', 'Zhu, XiaoYu', 'Tang, BaoLin', 'Wan, Xiang', 'Yao, Wen', 'Song, KaiDi', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Zhang, XuHan', 'Sun, ZiMin']","['Tong J', 'Liu H', 'Zheng C', 'Zhu X', 'Tang B', 'Wan X', 'Yao W', 'Song K', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang X', 'Sun Z']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1567-3625'],"['Department of Hematology of Anhui Provincial Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology of Anhui Provincial Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology of Anhui Provincial Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology of Anhui Provincial Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology of Anhui Provincial Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology of Anhui Provincial Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology of Anhui Provincial Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology of Anhui Provincial Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology of Anhui Provincial Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology of Anhui Provincial Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology of Anhui Provincial Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200116,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,IM,,"['Adolescent', '*BK Virus', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cystitis/diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemorrhage/diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Polyomavirus Infections/diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Virus Infections/diagnosis/etiology/*therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BK virus', '*hemorrhagic cystitis', '*mesenchymal stromal cells', '*unrelated cord blood transplantation']",2020/01/17 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13618 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2020 Mar;24(2):e13618. doi: 10.1111/petr.13618.

Thus, we sought to quantify metal values in untreated patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and controls and determine the impact of metal values on AML patients' survival. Serum samples from patients with untreated AML and controls at Hospices Civils de Lyon were analyzed and compared for trace metals and copper isotopic abundance ratios with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Survival analysis was performed as a function of metal values, and a multi-metal score was developed for patients with AML. Serum samples were collected from 67 patients with untreated AML and 94 controls. Most patients had intermediate-risk cytogenetics (63.1%) without FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutations (75.6%) or NPM1 mutations (68.1%). Most metal values differed significantly between AML and control groups. Patients with lower magnesium and higher cadmium values had the worst survival rates, with only 36% surviving at 6 months (P = .001). The adverse prognostic effect of this combination was maintained on multivariate analysis. Based on this, we developed a novel metal score, which accounts for multiple relative abnormalities in the values of five toxic and five essential metals. Patients with a higher metal score had significantly worse survival, which was maintained on multivariate analysis (P = .03). This baseline metal scoring system was also prognostic when we applied it to a separate population of front-line AML patients.","['Ohanian, Maro', 'Telouk, Philippe', 'Kornblau, Steven', 'Albarede, Francis', 'Ruvolo, Peter', 'Tidwell, Rebecca S S', 'Plesa, Adriana', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Matera, Eva-Laure', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Carson, Arch', 'Dumontet, Charles']","['Ohanian M', 'Telouk P', 'Kornblau S', 'Albarede F', 'Ruvolo P', 'Tidwell RSS', 'Plesa A', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Matera EL', 'Cortes J', 'Carson A', 'Dumontet C']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1689-4470', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3041-8582', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7829-5249']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Geosciences, Ecole Normal Superieure de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Geosciences, Ecole Normal Superieure de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'CRCL, INSERM 1052/CNRS 5286, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'CRCL, INSERM 1052/CNRS 5286, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, Georgia.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Human Genetics and Environmental Sciences, The University of Texas School of Public Health, Houston, Texas.', 'CRCL, INSERM 1052/CNRS 5286, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20200304,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metals, Heavy/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', '*Severity of Illness Index', 'Trace Elements/blood', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,2020/01/17 06:00,2021/04/20 06:00,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25731 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Apr;95(4):422-434. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25731.

Objective: To determine whether dasatinib given at a daily dosage of 80 mg/m2 is more effective than imatinib mesylate at a daily dosage of 300 mg/m2 to improve event-free survival of children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL in the context of intensive chemotherapy without prophylactic cranial irradiation. Design, Setting, and Participants: This open-label, phase 3 randomized clinical trial was conducted at 20 hospitals in China. Enrollment occurred from January 1, 2015, through September 18, 2018, and randomization was stopped on October 4, 2018, when the early stopping criterion of the trial was met. Patients aged 0 to 18 years were recruited. Of the 225 patients with the diagnosis, 35 declined participation and 1 died before treatment, leaving 189 patients available for analysis. Data were analyzed from January 1 through August 4, 2019. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive daily dasatinib (n = 92) or imatinib (n = 97) continuously for the entire duration of ALL therapy from the time of diagnosis made during remission induction to the end of continuation therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was event-free survival, analyzed based on intention to treat. The secondary outcomes were relapse, death due to toxic effects, and overall survival. Results: Among the 189 participants (136 male [72.0%]; median age, 7.8 [interquartile range (IQR), 5.2-11.3] years) and a median follow-up of 26.4 (IQR, 16.3-34.1) months, the 4-year event-free survival and overall survival rates were 71.0% (95% CI, 56.2%-89.6%) and 88.4% (95% CI, 81.3%-96.1%), respectively, in the dasatinib group and 48.9% (95% CI, 32.0%-74.5%; P = .005, log-rank test) and 69.2% (95% CI, 55.6%-86.2%; P = .04, log-rank test), respectively, in the imatinib group. The 4-year cumulative risk of any relapse was 19.8% (95% CI, 4.2%-35.4%) in the dasatinib group and 34.4% (95% CI, 15.6%-53.2%) in the imatinib group (P = .01, Gray test), whereas the 4-year cumulative risk of an isolated central nervous system relapse was 2.7% (95% CI, 0.0%-8.1%) in the dasatinib group and 8.4% (95% CI, 1.2%-15.6%) in the imatinib group (P = .06, Gray test). There were no significant differences in the frequency of severe toxic effects between the 2 treatment groups. Conclusions and Relevance: Intensive chemotherapy including dasatinib at a dosage of 80 mg/m2 per day yielded superior results in the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL compared with imatinib mesylate at a dosage of 300 mg/m2 per day and provided excellent control of central nervous system leukemia without the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation.

Small-molecule inhibitors targeting FLT3 that are currently approved or still undergoing clinical trials are subject to drug resistance due to FLT3 mutations. How these mutations lead to drug resistance is hitherto poorly understood. Herein, we studied the molecular mechanism of the drug resistance mutations D835N, Y842S and M664I, which confer resistance against the most advanced inhibitors, quizartinib and PLX3397 (pexidartinib), using enzyme kinetics and computer simulations. In vitro kinase assays were performed to measure the comparative catalytic activity of the native protein and the mutants, using a bacterial expression system developed to this aim. Our results reveal that the differential drug sensitivity profiles can be rationalised by the dynamics of the protein-drug interactions and perturbation of the intraprotein contacts upon mutations. Drug binding induced a single conformation in the native protein, whereas multiple conformations were observed otherwise (in the mutants or in the absence of drugs). The end-point kinetics measurements indicated that the three resistant mutants conferred catalytic activity that is at least as high as that of the reference without such mutations. Overall, our calculations and measurements suggest that the structural dynamics of the drug-resistant mutants that affect the active state and the increased conformational freedom of the remaining inactive drug-bound population are the two major factors that contribute to drug resistance in FLT3 harbouring cancer cells. Our results explain the mechanism of drug resistance mutations and can aid to the design of more effective tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Georgoulia, Panagiota S', 'Bjelic, Sinisa', 'Friedman, Ran']","['Georgoulia PS', 'Bjelic S', 'Friedman R']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4573-8052', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9300-614X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8696-3104']","['Department of Chemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Linnaeus University, Kalmar, Sweden.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Linnaeus University, Kalmar, Sweden.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Linnaeus University, Kalmar, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200128,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,IM,,"['Aminopyridines/*pharmacology', 'Benzothiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*FLT3', '*enzyme kinetics', '*kinase inhibitors', '*leukaemia', '*molecular dynamics']",2020/01/17 06:00,2021/05/14 06:00,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/febs.15209 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2020 Aug;287(15):3200-3220. doi: 10.1111/febs.15209.

In murine systems, these mutations are associated with cytokine-independent proliferation, thought to result from the activation of hematopoietic growth receptors, including FLT3 and KIT. Using cell lines and primary patient cells, we compared the activity of a panel of FLT3 inhibitors currently being used or tested in AML patients and also evaluated the effects of inhibition of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, SYK. We show that FLT3 inhibitors ranging from promiscuous to highly targeted are potent inhibitors of growth of leukaemia cells expressing mutant CBL in vitro, and we demonstrate in vivo efficacy of midostaurin using mouse models of mutant CBL. Potentiation of effects of targeted FLT3 inhibition by SYK inhibition has been demonstrated in models of mutant FLT3-positive AML and AML characterized by hyperactivated SYK. Here, we show that targeted SYK inhibition similarly enhances the effects of midostaurin and other FLT3 inhibitors against mutant CBL-positive leukaemia. Taken together, our results support the notion that mutant CBL-expressing myeloid leukaemias are highly sensitive to available FLT3 inhibitors and that this effect can be significantly augmented by optimum inhibition of SYK kinase.","['Weisberg, Ellen', 'Meng, Chengcheng', 'Case, Abigail E', 'Tiv, Hong L', 'Gokhale, Prafulla C', 'Toure, Anthia A', 'Buhrlage, Sara', 'Liu, Xiaoxi', 'Wang, Jinhua', 'Gray, Nathanael', 'Stone, Richard', 'Adamia, Sophia', 'Winer, Eric', 'Sattler, Martin', 'Griffin, James D']","['Weisberg E', 'Meng C', 'Case AE', 'Tiv HL', 'Gokhale PC', 'Toure AA', 'Buhrlage S', 'Liu X', 'Wang J', 'Gray N', 'Stone R', 'Adamia S', 'Winer E', 'Sattler M', 'Griffin JD']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5679-9531'],"['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Experimental Therapeutics Core and Belfer Center for Applied Cancer Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Experimental Therapeutics Core and Belfer Center for Applied Cancer Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200114,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Syk Kinase/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*FLT3', '*leukaemia', '*mutant CBL', '*tyrosine kinase']",2020/01/17 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.14820 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2020 Feb;24(3):2145-2156. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.14820.

Therefore, novel therapies are urgently required to improve AML clinical outcome. Here, we aim to study the dysregulation of a particular transcription factor, E2F4, and its role in the progression of AML. In this study, human clinical data from the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) revealed that increased E2F4 expression was associated with poor prognosis in AML patients. Moreover, the experimental results showed that E2F4 was aberrantly overexpressed in human AML patients and cell lines. Depletion of E2F4 inhibited the proliferation, induced the differentiation and suppressed the growth of AML cells in a nude mouse model. By contrast, overexpression of E2F4 promoted the proliferation and inhibited the differentiation of AML cells in vitro. Additionally, E2F4 expression not only is positively correlated with EZH2 but also can bind to EZH2. RNA microarray results also showed that E2F4 can regulate MAPK signalling pathway. EZH2 can reverse the inhibitory effect of E2F4 silencing on MAPK signaling pathway. In summary, our data suggest that E2F4 may be a potential therapeutic target for AML therapy.","['Feng, Yubin', 'Li, Lanlan', 'Du, Yan', 'Peng, Xiaoqing', 'Chen, Feihu']","['Feng Y', 'Li L', 'Du Y', 'Peng X', 'Chen F']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6778-8363'],"['The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200114,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'E2F4 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'THP-1 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['*E2F4', '*EZH2', '*MAPK pathway', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*differentiation', '*proliferation']",2020/01/17 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.14853 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2020 Feb;24(3):2157-2168. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.14853.

Therefore, it was hypothesized that acidic chelator drugs could have a genuine potential as antiproliferative agents. Based on their pKa, the selected 15 acidic drugs of eight classes-namely sulfonylureas, proton pump inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, thiazolidinediones, thienopyridines, statins, and nicotinic acid-were assayed for anticancer HTS against the lung A549, skin A375, breast MCF7 and T47D, pancreatic PANC1, cervical HeLa, and leukemia K562 cancer cell lines and normal fibroblasts. Lipopolysaccharide-prompted inflammation in RAW264.7 macrophages was the potential anticancer mechanism. Atorvastatin exerted remarkably superior cytotoxicity against A375.2S (IC50 value 0.02 muM p < .001 vs. cisplatin 0.07 muM IC50 value). Atorvastatin exhibited an equipotency to cisplatin's T47D growth inhibition (34.6 muM vs. 34.59 muM; p > .05). Levofloxacin as well as ciprofloxacin superbly superseded the antineoplastic cisplatin activity against the K562 cell line (respective IC50 values [muM] 10.4 and 19.5 vs. 29.3; p < .05-<.01). Gemifloxacin and lansoprazole had comparable antiproliferation in K562 to cisplatin's (respective IC50 values [muM] 34.9 and 36.3 vs. 29.3; p > .05). The selected agents lacked cytotoxicity in the panel of MCF7, HeLa, A549, or Panc1 cancer cells. Most notably, LPS prompted RAW264.7 macrophages, atorvastatin, piroxicam, clopidogrel, esomeprazole, and lansoprazole were of higher anti-inflammation potency than indomethacin (p < .01-.001). Evidently, omeprazole, pioglitazone, gemifloxacin, and indomethacin were of comparable anti-inflammation potencies (p > .05). Collectively, this work reveals acidic chelator drugs (atorvastatin, gemifloxacin, and lansoprazole with dual anti-inflammation and antiproliferation propensities) as authentic agents for the repurposing approach in anticancer chemotherapy/prevention.","['AlKhalil, Mthanna', 'Al-Hiari, Yusuf', 'Kasabri, Violet', 'Arabiyat, Shereen', 'Al-Zweiri, Muhammad', 'Mamdooh, Noor', 'Telfah, Ahmad']","['AlKhalil M', 'Al-Hiari Y', 'Kasabri V', 'Arabiyat S', 'Al-Zweiri M', 'Mamdooh N', 'Telfah A']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1927-0193', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1478-8620']","['School of Pharmacy, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan.', 'Dept. of Pharmacology, Salt College, Al-Balqa Applied University, Salt, Jordan.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan.', 'Leibniz-Institut fur Analytische Wissenschaften - ISAS, Dortmund, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200114,United States,Drug Dev Res,Drug development research,8204468,IM,,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Repositioning', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Macrophages/drug effects/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'RAW 264.7 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['*anti-inflammation', '*antiproliferation', '*commercial agents']",2020/01/17 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ddr.21640 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Dev Res. 2020 Jun;81(4):470-490. doi: 10.1002/ddr.21640.

We aimed to assess the impact of childhood cancer on parental working status and income and to identify determinants of adverse changes after the child's cancer diagnosis by calendar period. We conducted a nationwide cohort study using Danish registry data. Parents of children diagnosed with cancer in 1982-2014 (n = 12,418) were matched with comparison parents of cancer-free children (n = 125,014). We analysed annual working status (working/not working) and annual disposable income (lowest quintile/not lowest quintile) of case and comparison parents over a period of 10 years after diagnosis by calendar period (1982-1999 vs. 2000-2014). Logistic regression models were used to identify determinants of adverse changes after diagnosis. Mothers of children diagnosed in 1982-1999 were more likely not working or having a low income than comparison mothers up to 10 years after diagnosis. This risk of not working or low income was lower in mothers of children diagnosed in 2000-2014 compared to 1982-1999 in the first years after diagnosis (pinteraction < 0.05). We observed no consistent patterns among fathers. Low parental education, diagnosis of lymphoid leukaemia and younger age of the child at diagnosis were the main determinants of adverse changes in working status or income after diagnosis. Childhood cancer adversely interfered with parents' socioeconomic situation in the earlier calendar period, particularly among mothers. The absence of such an effect in more recent years emphasises the supportive role of a countries' welfare system alongside the general advances in childhood cancer treatment.","['Mader, Luzius', 'Hargreave, Marie', 'Bidstrup, Pernille E', 'Kjaer, Susanne K', 'Nielsen, Thomas T', 'Kroyer, Anja', 'Winther, Jeanette F', 'Erdmann, Friederike']","['Mader L', 'Hargreave M', 'Bidstrup PE', 'Kjaer SK', 'Nielsen TT', 'Kroyer A', 'Winther JF', 'Erdmann F']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5613-4356', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6821-9242']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Virus, Lifestyle and Genes, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Survivorship Unit, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Virus, Lifestyle and Genes, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Gynaecology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Childhood Cancer Research Group, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Childhood Cancer Research Group, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Childhood Cancer Research Group, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health, Aarhus University and University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Childhood Cancer Research Group, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200131,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Denmark', 'Employment/economics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Income/*statistics & numerical data', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*therapy', '*Parents', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', '*Socioeconomic Factors', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood cancer', '*cohort', '*employment', '*income: temporal patterns', '*parents', '*registry']",2020/01/17 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.32867 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2020 Aug 15;147(4):1006-1017. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32867.

Therefore, it is essential to determine the mechanisms underlying the supportive role of MSCs in the survival of leukaemia cells. Through in silico analyses, we identified a total of 271 aberrantly expressed genes in the MSCs derived from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients that were associated with adipogenic differentiation, of which aldo-keto reductase 1C1 (AKR1C1) was significantly upregulated in the AML-MSCs. Knockdown of AKR1C1 in the MSCs suppressed adipogenesis and promoted osteogenesis, and inhibited the growth of co-cultured AML cell lines compared to the situation in wild- type AML-derived MSCs. Introduction of recombinant human AKR1C1 in the MSCs partially alleviated the effects of AKR1C1 knockdown. In addition, the absence of AKR1C1 reduced secretion of cytokines such as MCP-1, IL-6 and G-CSF from the MSCs, along with inactivation of STAT3 and ERK1/2 in the co-cultured AML cells.

With longer progression-free survival and more frequently observed deep remissions there is an emerging need for sensitive methods quantitating residual disease after therapy. Over the last decade, assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) has increasingly been implemented in CLL trials. The predictive value of MRD status on survival outcomes has repeatedly been proven in the context of chemoimmunotherapy and cellular therapies. Recent data suggests a similar correlation for Bcl-2 inhibitor-based therapy. While the relevance of MRD assessment as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials is largely undisputed, its role in routine clinical practice has not yet been well defined. This review outlines current methods of MRD detection in CLL and summarizes MRD data from relevant trials. The significance of MRD testing in clinical studies and in routine patient care is assessed and new MRD-guided treatment strategies are discussed.","['Furstenau, Moritz', 'De Silva, Nisha', 'Eichhorst, Barbara', 'Hallek, Michael']","['Furstenau M', 'De Silva N', 'Eichhorst B', 'Hallek M']",,"['Department I of Internal Medicine and Center of Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Dusseldorf, German CLL Study Group, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Center of Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Dusseldorf, German CLL Study Group, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Center of Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Dusseldorf, German CLL Study Group, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine and Center of Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Dusseldorf, German CLL Study Group, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Cologne Cluster of Excellence in Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-associated Disease (CECAD), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190809,United States,Hemasphere,HemaSphere,101740619,,,,,,2020/01/17 06:00,2020/01/17 06:01,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1097/HS9.0000000000000287 [doi]', 'HemaSphere-2019-0066 [pii]']",epublish,Hemasphere. 2019 Aug 9;3(5):e287. doi: 10.1097/HS9.0000000000000287. eCollection 2019 Oct.,PMC6919470,['Moritz Furstenau and Nisha De Silva declare no conflict of interest.'],,,"['Copyright (c) 2019 the Author(s).

Comorbidities can lead to complications and graft loss, including that due to hematoma. In this case, a bilayer collagen matrix was used as a temporary wound dressing in a 25-year-old woman with active chronic myelogenous leukemia. She presented with a bleeding diathesis and spontaneous intramuscular and intracompartmental hematomas of the right leg. She experienced ongoing high-volume blood loss from her fasciotomy wounds, requiring wound care to be performed in the operating room under general anesthesia, and requiring multiple blood and platelet transfusions. Instead of immediate STSG, a bilayer collagen matrix was placed to reduce the bleeding and further prepare the wound bed over a 9-week period while she underwent medical optimization. Once stabilized from a hematologic standpoint, STSG was performed with total graft take. Both uncontrolled chronic myelogenous leukemia and its therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have a risk of hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. Bilayer collagen matrix serves as an adjunct in the limb salvage algorithm that can reduce transfusion needs whereas a temporary bleeding diathesis is medically corrected before the application of an autologous skin graft.","['Lo, Alexis L', 'Tyrell, Richard O', 'Golarz, Scott R', 'Jones, Christine M']","['Lo AL', 'Tyrell RO', 'Golarz SR', 'Jones CM']",,"['Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pa.', 'Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pa.', 'Division of Vascular Surgery, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pa.', 'Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pa.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20191127,United States,Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

Some studies have recently reported that FAS can serve as an oncogene that promotes tumor proliferation and maintains the stemness of tumor cells. Hence, its prognostic value in malignancies remains controversial. Methods: we assessed the prognostic value of FAS mRNA in several types of tumors by online platforms including Kaplan-Meier Plotter and SurvExpress. Results: FAS mRNA was associated with better overall survival (OS) in breast cancer (Hazard ratio (HR): 0.59 [0.47, 0.73]; p=1.5e-06), gastric cancer (HR: 0.65 [0.54, 0.77]; p=8e-07) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (HR: 0.78 [0.69, 0.89]; p=0.00016), especially in lung adenocarcinoma (HR: 0.64 [0.51, 0.81], p=1.7e-04), female lung cancer (HR:0.72 [0.57, 0.9], p=0.0049) and patients who have never smoked (HR: 0.39 [0.21, 0.7], p=0.0012). However, a high level of FAS mRNA expression indicated poorer OS in pancreatic cancer (HR: 1.33 [1.06, 1.66]; p=0.01) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (HR: 1.57 [1.02, 2.41], p=0.04). Additionally, FAS showed no prognostic value in renal carcinoma, head and neck carcinoma, hepatic cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer or glioblastoma. The results from the Cell Miner tool revealed that FAS expression was associated with the sensitivity of tumor cells to cabozantinib and erlotinib. Conclusions: In summary, the dominant function of FAS may vary in different malignancies. FAS mRNA expression was correlated with better OS in breast cancer, gastric cancer and lung cancer, but worse OS in pancreatic cancer and AML. We also suggested that FAS mRNA expression could be a potential biomarker for cabozantinib and erlotinib.","['Chen, Zhigang', 'Wu, Jun', 'Xu, Hailin', 'Yu, Xiuyan', 'Wang, Ke']","['Chen Z', 'Wu J', 'Xu H', 'Yu X', 'Wang K']",,"['Department of Surgical Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Immune Therapy of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', ""Department of General surgery, the First People's Hospital of Jiande, HangZhou, China."", 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Immune Therapy of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Immune Therapy of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200101,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FAS', 'biomarker', 'prognosis']",2020/01/17 06:00,2020/01/17 06:01,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.35614 [doi]', 'jcav11p0542 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2020 Jan 1;11(3):542-550. doi: 10.7150/jca.35614. eCollection 2020.,PMC6959050,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,['(c) The author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reactive eosinophils in allergic and inflammatory conditions are transient and recruited from the circulation in response to various stimuli, whereas neoplastic eosinophils of leukemias and hematological malignancies are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. The differentiation of reactive from neoplastic eosinophils has a serious implication on the treatment and prognosis of diseases. However, both these types of eosinophils display variation in morphology and staining characteristics in routine histopathology leading to a diagnostic dilemma. Aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of special stains for the demonstration of eosinophils in normal/reactive lesions and leukemias. Methodology: A retrospective study comprising twenty histologically diagnosed cases each of reactive oral lesions and leukemias were obtained from institutional archives. These tissue sections were subjected to staining with routine and special stains - Carbol chromotrope, Congo red, Leishman's stain, Periodic Acid-Schiff-papanicolaou (PAS-PAP) and PAS. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson's Chi-square test to compare the various parameters in the evaluation of the staining efficacy. Results: Carbol chromotrope and Congo red staining showed increased staining efficacy in normal/reactive eosinophils while PAS-PAP followed by PAS and Leishman's stain showed enhanced features such as homogenicity, specificity, increased staining intensity, enhanced nuclear and cytoplasmic details in leukemic eosinophils.

Here we analysed the therapeutic potential of an innovative biohybrid consisting of the tumor-associated peptide somatostatin and the photosensitizer ruthenium in AML cell lines and primary AML patient samples. Selective toxicity was analyzed by using CD34 enriched cord blood cells as control. Treatment of OCI AML3, HL60 and THP1 resulted in a 92, and 99 and 97% decrease in clonogenic growth compared to the controls. Primary AML cells demonstrated a major response with a 74 to 99% reduction in clonogenicity in 5 of 6 patient samples. In contrast, treatment of CD34(+) CB cells resulted in substantially less reduction in colony numbers. Subcellular localization assays of RU-SST in OCI-AML3 cells confirmed strong co-localization of RU-SST in the lysosomes compared to the other cellular organelles. Our data demonstrate that conjugation of a Ruthenium complex with somatostatin is efficiently eradicating LSC candidates of patients with AML. This indicates that receptor mediated lysosomal accumulation of photodynamic metal complexes is a highly attractive approach for targeting AML cells.","['Vegi, Naidu M', 'Chakrabortty, Sabyasachi', 'Zegota, Maksymilian M', 'Kuan, Seah Ling', 'Stumper, Anne', 'Rawat, Vijay P S', 'Sieste, Stefanie', 'Buske, Christian', 'Rau, Sven', 'Weil, Tanja', 'Feuring-Buske, Michaela']","['Vegi NM', 'Chakrabortty S', 'Zegota MM', 'Kuan SL', 'Stumper A', 'Rawat VPS', 'Sieste S', 'Buske C', 'Rau S', 'Weil T', 'Feuring-Buske M']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2759-2208', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3945-4491', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9635-6009']","['Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Centre, University Hospital Ulm, D-89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry, SRM University, AP - Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh, 522502, India.', 'Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, D-55128, Mainz, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, D-55128, Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry I, Ulm University, D-89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, D-55128, Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry I, Ulm University, D-89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry I, Ulm University, D-89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Centre, University Hospital Ulm, D-89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, D-55128, Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry I, Ulm University, D-89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Centre, University Hospital Ulm, D-89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry I, Ulm University, D-89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, D-55128, Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry I, Ulm University, D-89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Centre, University Hospital Ulm, D-89081, Ulm, Germany. michaela.feuring-buske@uni-ulm.de.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, D-89081, Ulm, Germany. michaela.feuring-buske@uni-ulm.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200115,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Stability', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, Somatostatin/*metabolism', 'Ruthenium/*therapeutic use', 'Somatostatin/*therapeutic use']",,,2020/01/17 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-57172-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-57172-6 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Jan 15;10(1):371. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-57172-6.,PMC6962389,,,"['0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Somatostatin)', '51110-01-1 (Somatostatin)', '7UI0TKC3U5 (Ruthenium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple pathological mechanisms (e.g., circulating cytokines and genetic alterations, such as JAKV617F mutation) have been implicated in the etiology of MF, but the molecular mechanism causing resistance to JAK2V617F inhibitor therapy remains unknown. Among MF patients who were treated with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, we compared noncoding RNA profiles of ruxolitinib therapy responders versus nonresponders and found miR-543 was significantly upregulated in nonresponders. We validated these findings by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. in this same cohort, in 2 additional independent MF patient cohorts from the United States and Romania, and in a JAK2V617F mouse model of MF. Both in vitro and in vivo models were used to determine the underlying molecular mechanism of miR-543 in MF. Here, we demonstrate that miR-543 targets the dioxygenases ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) and 2 (TET2) in patients and in vitro, causing increased levels of global 5-methylcytosine, while decreasing the acetylation of histone 3, STAT3, and tumor protein p53. Mechanistically, we found that activation of STAT3 by JAKs epigenetically controls miR-543 expression via binding the promoter region of miR-543. Furthermore, miR-543 upregulation promotes the expression of genes related to drug metabolism, including CYP3A4, which is involved in ruxolitinib metabolism. Our findings suggest miR-543 as a potentially novel biomarker for the prognosis of MF patients with a high risk of treatment resistance and as a potentially new target for the development of new treatment options.","['Fuentes-Mattei, Enrique', 'Bayraktar, Recep', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Silva, Andreia M', 'Ivan, Cristina', 'Gulei, Diana', 'Fabris, Linda', 'Soares do Amaral, Nayra', 'Mur, Pilar',

Determining the regions within SERINC5 that provide restrictive activity or Nef sensitivity should inform mechanistic models of the SERINC5/HIV-1 relationship. Here, we report that deletion of the conserved sequence EDTEE, which is located within a cytoplasmic loop of SERINC5 and which is reminiscent of an acidic-cluster membrane trafficking signal, increases the sensitivity of SERINC5 to antagonism by Nef, while it has no effect on the intrinsic activity of the protein as an inhibitor of infectivity. These effects correlated with enhanced removal of the DeltaEDTEE mutant relative to that of wild-type SERINC5 from the cell surface and with enhanced exclusion of the mutant protein from virions by Nef. Mutational analysis indicated that the acidic residues, but not the threonine, within the EDTEE motif are important for the relative resistance to Nef. Deletion of the EDTEE sequence did not increase the sensitivity of SERINC5 to antagonism by the glycoGag protein of MLV, suggesting that its virologic role is Nef specific. These results are consistent with the reported mapping of the cytoplasmic loop that contains the EDTEE sequence as a general determinant of Nef responsiveness, but they further indicate that sequences inhibitory to as well as supportive of Nef activity reside in this region. We speculate that the EDTEE motif might have evolved to mediate resistance against retroviruses that use Nef-like proteins to antagonize SERINC5.IMPORTANCE Cellular membrane proteins in the SERINC family, especially SERINC5, inhibit the infectivity of retroviral virions. This inhibition is counteracted by retroviral proteins, specifically, HIV-1 Nef, MLV glycoGag, and EIAV S2. One consequence of such a host-pathogen ""arms race"" is a compensatory change in the host antiviral protein as it evolves to escape the effects of viral antagonists. This is often reflected in a genetic signature, positive selection, which is conspicuously missing in SERINC5 Here we show that despite this lack of genetic evidence, a sequence in SERINC5 nonetheless provides relative resistance to antagonism by HIV-1 Nef.","['Stoneham, Charlotte A', 'Ramirez, Peter W', 'Singh, Rajendra', 'Suarez, Marissa', 'Debray, Andrew', 'Lim, Christopher', 'Jia, Xiaofei', 'Xiong, Yong', 'Guatelli, John']","['Stoneham CA', 'Ramirez PW', 'Singh R', 'Suarez M', 'Debray A', 'Lim C', 'Jia X', 'Xiong Y', 'Guatelli J']",,"['Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'The VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, California, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'The VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, California, USA.', 'The VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, California, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, Dartmouth, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA jguatelli@ucsd.edu.', 'The VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200317,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Glycosylation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV-1', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Infectious Anemia Virus, Equine/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Proteins/*chemistry', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Protein Domains', 'nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HIV-1', '*Nef', '*SERINC']",2020/01/17 06:00,2020/09/15 06:00,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01554-19 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01554-19 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2020 Mar 17;94(7). pii: JVI.01554-19. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01554-19.

Under these conditions, we observe an initial Ca(2+) mobilization from the ER associated with the mitochondrial accumulation of the cation, which is followed by Ca(2+)-dependent mitochondrial O2 (-.) (mitoO2 (-.)) formation. These events, which were barely detectable after 3 hours, were better appreciated at 6 hours. We found that markedly shorter exposure to arsenite and lower concentrations of arsenite are required to induce extensive O2 (-) formation in cells supplemented with inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) or ryanodine receptor (RyR) agonists. Indeed, nanomolar arsenite induced maximal O2 (-.) formation after only 10 minutes of exposure, and this response was uniquely dependent on the enforced mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation. The dramatic anticipation of and sensitization to the effects of arsenite caused by the IP3R or RyR agonists were accompanied by a parallel significant genotoxic response in the absence of detectable mitochondrial dysfunction and cytotoxicity. We conclude that the prolonged, low-micromolar arsenite exposure paradigm resulting in mitoO2 (-.) formation is necessary to affect Ca(2+) homeostasis and accumulate the cation in mitochondria. The arsenite requirements to promote mitoO2 (-.) formation in the presence of sufficient mitochondrial Ca(2+) were instead remarkably lower in terms of both concentration and time of exposure. These conditions were associated with the induction of extensive DNA strand scission in the absence of detectable signs of toxicity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In respiration-proficient cells, arsenite causes mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation and Ca(2+)-dependent mitochondrial superoxide formation. We now report that the second event requires remarkably lower concentrations of and time of exposure to the metalloid than the former. Indeed, a brief exposure to nanomolar levels of arsenite produced maximal effects under conditions in which the mitochondrial Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]m) was increased by inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor or ryanodine receptor agonists. Hence, specific substances or conditions enhancing the [Ca(2+)]m may potentiate the deleterious effects of arsenite by selectively increasing mitochondrial superoxide formation.","['Guidarelli, Andrea', 'Cerioni, Liana', 'Fiorani, Mara', 'Catalani, Alessia', 'Cantoni, Orazio']","['Guidarelli A', 'Cerioni L', 'Fiorani M', 'Catalani A', 'Cantoni O']",,"['Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino (PU), Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino (PU), Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino (PU), Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino (PU), Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino (PU), Italy orazio.cantoni@uniurb.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200115,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,IM,,"['Arsenites/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Metalloids/*toxicity', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', '*Superoxides/metabolism', 'Teratogens/*toxicity', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",,,2020/01/17 06:00,2020/09/09 06:00,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.119.262469 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.119.262469 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2020 Apr;373(1):62-71. doi: 10.1124/jpet.119.262469.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 27 institutions participating in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. PARTICIPANTS: 23 462 five year survivors (6193 (26.4%) treated in the 1970s, 9363 (39.9%) treated in the 1980s, and 7906 (33.6%) treated in the 1990s) of leukemia, brain cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, renal tumors, neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcomas, and bone sarcomas diagnosed prior to age 21 years between 1 January 1970 and 31 December 1999. Median age at diagnosis was 6.1 years (range 0-20.9) and 27.7 years (8.2-58.3) at last follow-up. A comparison group of 5057 siblings of cancer survivors were also included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidence and 95% confidence intervals of reported heart failure, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, pericardial disease, and arrhythmias by treatment decade. Events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Multivariable subdistribution hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios by decade, and mediation analysis examined risks with and without exposure to cardiotoxic treatments. RESULTS: The 20 year cumulative incidence of heart failure (0.69% for those treated in the 1970s, 0.74% for those treated in the 1980s, 0.54% for those treated in the 1990s) and coronary artery disease (0.38%, 0.24%, 0.19%, respectively), decreased in more recent eras (P<0.01), though not for valvular disease (0.06%, 0.06%, 0.05%), pericardial disease (0.04%, 0.02%, 0.03%), or arrhythmias (0.08%, 0.09%, 0.13%). Compared with survivors with a diagnosis in the 1970s, the risk of heart failure, coronary artery disease, and valvular heart disease decreased in the 1980s and 1990s but only significantly for coronary artery disease (hazard ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.92 and 0.53, 0.36 to 0.77, respectively). The overall risk of coronary artery disease was attenuated by adjustment for cardiac radiation (0.90, 0.78 to 1.05), particularly among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (unadjusted for radiation: 0.77, 0.66 to 0.89; adjusted for radiation: 0.87, 0.69 to 1.10). CONCLUSIONS: Historical reductions in exposure to cardiac radiation have been associated with a reduced risk of coronary artery disease among adult survivors of childhood cancer. Additional follow-up is needed to investigate risk reductions for other cardiac outcomes.

The clinical presentation is widely variable, and therefore challenging. If the underlying malignancy is not clinically apparent, PLR could be mistaken for myeloproliferative neoplasms, altering the patient's management. CSTs are highly aggressive tumours associated with a poor prognosis due to multiple mechanisms. Localising and treating the underlying malignancy is the mainstay of treatment. Both the treating clinician and the pathologist should keep a high level of suspicion for this entity in patients having unexplained leukocytosis. We herein discuss the underlying mechanisms, clinical presentation, pathological features, differential diagnosis and prognosis of this rare entity. An emphasis on the role of the pathologist is provided since the lack of knowledge on this entity can lead to dramatic effects on the patient, including unnecessary diagnostic testing and treatments.","['Abukhiran, Ibrahim A', 'Jasser, Judy', 'Syrbu, Sergei']","['Abukhiran IA', 'Jasser J', 'Syrbu S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1271-4110'],"['Department of Pathology, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa, USA ibrahim-abukhiran@uiowa.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200115,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,,"['Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukemoid Reaction/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukocytes/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Prognosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'cytokines', 'leukocytes']",2020/01/17 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2020/01/17 06:00'],"['2019/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['jclinpath-2019-206340 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2019-206340 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2020 Jun;73(6):310-313. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2019-206340.

The aptamer was previously used for the covalent coupling with fluorescent and magnetic nanoparticles, as well as for the fabrication of aptamer-based biosensors. Among commonly used fluorescent tags, lanthanide nanoparticles offer stable luminescence with narrow, well-resolved emission peaks and the absence of photoblinking.

NF1 patients are predisposed to formation of several type solid tumors as well as to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Loss of NF1 results in dysregulation of MAPK, PI3K and other signaling cascades, to promote cell proliferation and to inhibit cell apoptosis. The RUNX1 gene is associated with stem cell function in many tissues, and plays a key role in the fate of stem cells. Aberrant RUNX1 expression leads to context-dependent tumor development, in which RUNX1 may serve as a tumor suppressor or an oncogene in specific tissue contexts. The co-occurrence of mutation of NF1 and RUNX1 is detected rarely in several cancers and signaling downstream of RAS-MAPK can alter RUNX1 function. Whether aberrant RUNX1 expression contributes to NF1-related tumorigenesis is not fully understood. This review focuses on the role of RUNX1 in NF1-related tumors and blood disorders, and in sporadic cancers.","['Na, Youjin', 'Huang, Gang', 'Wu, Jianqiang']","['Na Y', 'Huang G', 'Wu J']",,"[""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", ""Division of Pathology, Cancer & Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,IM,,"['Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Hematologic Diseases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['RUNX1', 'cancer', 'mutation', 'neurofibromatosis type 1', 'tumor driver']",2020/01/17 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2020/01/16 06:00'],"['2019/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['molcells.2019.0295 [pii]', '10.14348/molcells.2019.0295 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cells. 2020 Feb 29;43(2):153-159. doi: 10.14348/molcells.2019.0295.,PMC7057834,,['R01 NS097233/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) and cytotoxicity (ADCC) are major mechanisms of action of the mAb trastuzumab. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), such as valproic acid (VPA) or vorinostat (SAHA), exert several immunostimulatory properties, which contribute at least in part to their anticancer effect. However, the impact of HDACi-induced immunostimulatory effects on trastuzumab-mediated anti-tumor immune response is not well characterized. METHODS: We analyzed the ADCP and ADCC activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from age and gender-matched healthy volunteers (n=5) against HDACi-treated HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells (SKBR3), using a well-established in vitro three-color imaging flow cytometry and flow cytometry approach. RESULTS: VPA and SAHA enhanced trastuzumab-mediated ADCP and trastuzumab-independent cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, VPA upregulated the activating antibody-binding receptor Fc-gamma receptor (FcgammaR) IIA (CD32A) on monocytes (CD14+). Moreover, VPA and SAHA downregulated the anti-apoptotic protein myeloid leukemia cell differentiation 1 (MCL1) in breast cancer cells. Additionally, VPA and SAHA induced an immunogenic cell death, characterized by the exposure of calreticulin (CALR), as well as decreased the ""do not eat me"" signal CD47 on tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: HDACi VPA and SAHA increase trastuzumab-mediated phagocytosis and trastuzumab-independent cytotoxicity. The immunomodulatory activities of those HDACi support a rationale combined treatment approach with mAb for cancer treatment.","['Laengle, Johannes', 'Kabiljo, Julijan', 'Hunter, Leah', 'Homola, Jakob', 'Prodinger, Sophie', 'Egger, Gerda', 'Bergmann, Michael']","['Laengle J', 'Kabiljo J', 'Hunter L', 'Homola J', 'Prodinger S', 'Egger G', 'Bergmann M']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4771-1398', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2489-155X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8529-1166']","['Division of General Surgery, Department of Surgery, Comprehensive Cancer Center Vienna, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute Applied Diagnostics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of General Surgery, Department of Surgery, Comprehensive Cancer Center Vienna, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of General Surgery, Department of Surgery, Comprehensive Cancer Center Vienna, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of General Surgery, Department of Surgery, Comprehensive Cancer Center Vienna, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of General Surgery, Department of Surgery, Comprehensive Cancer Center Vienna, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute Applied Diagnostics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pathology, Comprehensive Cancer Center Vienna, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of General Surgery, Department of Surgery, Comprehensive Cancer Center Vienna, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria michael.bergmann@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute Applied Diagnostics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200102,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,IM,,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism', 'Trastuzumab/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Valproic Acid/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Vorinostat/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*immunology', '*medicine', '*oncology', '*tumours']",2020/01/16 06:00,2020/11/03 06:00,['2020/01/16 06:00'],"['2019/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['jitc-2019-000195 [pii]', '10.1136/jitc-2019-000195 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2020 Jan;8(1). pii: jitc-2019-000195. doi: 10.1136/jitc-2019-000195.

However, little is known about how genetic alterations of PRC-interacting molecules such as the core binding factor (CBF) complex influence polycomb activity. We report that the acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-associated CBFbeta-SMMHC fusion oncoprotein physically interacts with the PRC1 complex and that these factors co-localize across the AML genome in an apparently PRC2-independent manner. Depletion of CBFbeta-SMMHC caused substantial increases in genome-wide PRC1 binding and marked changes in the association between PRC1 and the CBF DNA-binding subunit RUNX1. PRC1 was more likely to be associated with actively transcribed genes in CBFbeta-SMMHC-expressing cells. CBFbeta-SMMHC depletion had heterogeneous effects on gene expression, including significant reductions in transcription of ribosomal loci occupied by PRC1. Our results provide evidence that CBFbeta-SMMHC markedly and diversely affects polycomb recruitment and transcriptional regulation across the AML genome.","['Cordonnier, Gaelle', 'Mandoli, Amit', 'Cagnard, Nicolas', 'Hypolite, Guillaume', 'Lhermitte, Ludovic', 'Verhoeyen, Els', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Dillon, Niall', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Martens, Joost H A', 'Bond, Jonathan']","['Cordonnier G', 'Mandoli A', 'Cagnard N', 'Hypolite G', 'Lhermitte L', 'Verhoeyen E', 'Asnafi V', 'Dillon N', 'Macintyre E', 'Martens JHA', 'Bond J']",,"['Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut National de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, Paris, France; Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Sorbonne Universites, Universite Paris Descartes, Bioinformatics Platform, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut National de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, Paris, France; Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut National de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, Paris, France; Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', ""CIRI, International Center for Infectiology Research, EVIR Team, Universite de Lyon, INSERM U1111, Lyon, France; Universite Cote d'Azur, INSERM, C3M, 06204 Nice, France."", 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut National de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, Paris, France; Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Gene Regulation and Chromatin Group, MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut National de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, Paris, France; Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', ""Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Cite, Institut Necker Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut National de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1151, Paris, France; Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France; Systems Biology Ireland, School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; National Children's Research Centre, Children's Health Ireland at Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland.

Biopsy-proven LC cases diagnosed in patients with leukemia were analyzed for a variety of clinical characteristics and prognosis; 46 patients met inclusion criteria. Leukemia cutis most commonly presented in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), though lesions were seen in several other leukemia types. Most LC lesions were identified at initial presentation of underlying leukemia but also occurred with leukemia relapse and at other stages of treatment. Most patients died within 1 year of LC diagnosis. The clinical presentation of LC is highly variable. Lesions occur in different anatomic regions; can present as papules, nodules, or plaques; and have different associated colors and symptoms. Duration between diagnosis of leukemia and death in patients who develop LC, and between LC diagnosis and death, are highly variable. Early detection of lesions might help provide a diagnosis in patients with leukemia and potentially improve prognosis if doing so results in earlier initiation of chemotherapy.","['Haidari, Wasim', 'Strowd, Lindsay C']","['Haidari W', 'Strowd LC']",,"['Center for Dermatology Research, Department of Dermatology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.', 'Center for Dermatology Research, Department of Dermatology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cutis,Cutis,0006440,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*etiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/16 06:00,2020/06/25 06:00,['2020/01/16 06:00'],"['2020/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/25 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Cutis. 2019 Dec;104(6):326-330;E3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to construct a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and risk score system for GC. The GSE62254 (training set) and GSE26253 (validation set 2) datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Furthermore, the gene expression profile of GC (validation set 1) was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between recurrent and nonrecurrent samples were determined using the limma package. The feature genes were selected using the Caret package, and an SVM classifier was built using the e1071 package. Using the penalized package, the optimal predictive genes for constructing a risk score system were screened. Finally, stratification analysis of clinical factors and pathway enrichment analysis were performed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. A total of 239 DEGs were identified in GSE62254, among which 114 DEGs were significantly associated with both recurrencefree survival and overall survival. Subsequently, 21 feature genes were screened from the 114 DEGs, and an SVM classifier was built. A risk score system for survival prediction was constructed, following the selection of 10 optimal genes, including Akinase anchoring protein 12, angiopoietinlike protein 1, cysteinerich sequence 1, myeloid/lymphoid or mixedlineage leukemia, translocated to chromosome 11, neuron navigator 3, neurobeachin, nephroblastoma overexpressed, pleiotrophin, tumor suppressor candidate 3 and zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 18. The stratification analysis revealed that pathological stage was an independent prognostic clinical factor in the highrisk group. Additionally, eight significant pathways were associated with the 10gene signature. The SVM classifier and risk score system may be applied for classifying and predicting the prognosis of patients with GC, respectively.","['Jiang, Hui', 'Gu, Jiming', 'Du, Jun', 'Qi, Xiaowei', 'Qian, Chengjia', 'Fei, Bojian']","['Jiang H', 'Gu J', 'Du J', 'Qi X', 'Qian C', 'Fei B']",,"['Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214062, P.R.

However, the application of decitabine in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not been fully examined. Thus, our study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of decitabine in treating such patients. Materials and Methods: Clinical data of MDS or AML patients treated with decitabine were retrospectively analyzed. All the patients were regularly followed up, and the risk factors affecting clinical efficacy were also detected. Results: A total of 36 patients (MDS, n = 27; AML, n = 9) were included in the study. The response rate of MDS patients was 55%, and there were three cases (15%) of complete remission (CR), three cases (15%) of marrow CR, and five cases (15%) of hematologic improvement. It was about three cycles to achieve the best efficiencies. Gender, age, percentage of blasts in bone marrow, International Prognostic Scoring System risk group, and cytogenetic factors were not associated with response rate. The median overall survival of MDS patients was 8 (1-44) months. Agranulocytosis (P = 0.037) and severe anemia (P = 0.044) were the independent factors for prognosis. The complete response rate of AML was 33.3%. From the investigation, infection was the most common complication in our cohort, especially lung infection with the incidence of 27.8%.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all adult patients admitted to the University of Michigan Health System for AML over a 3-year period from 2010 to 2013. We determined comorbidities, hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) status, antifungal prophylaxis, proven and probable IFI, and outcomes at 12 weeks after initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy. RESULTS: Of 333 patients in our cohort, 116 of whom had received a HCT, 98 (29%) developed an IFI. Of the 30 (9%) patients who had a proven or probable IFI, 18 had breakthrough infection while on micafungin (n = 5), voriconazole (n = 4), posaconazole (n = 5), or fluconazole (n = 4). Breakthrough IFIs were due to Aspergillus species (n = 11), other molds (n = 4), and Candida species (n = 3). Factors associated with breakthrough IFI were prolonged severe neutropenia (p = .05) and having received tacrolimus (p = .04). Antifungal therapy was successful in 7 of the 18 (39%) patients with breakthrough IFI and 8 of the 12 (67%) patients with non-breakthrough IFI, p = .13. Mortality at 12 weeks was 27%, 5 with breakthrough IFI and 3 with non-breakthrough IFI and was associated with prolonged severe neutropenia, p = .04. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AML remain at risk for IFI despite the use of several different antifungal agents for prophylaxis. Mortality remains high in patients with AML who develop IFI.","['Wasylyshyn, Anastasia', 'Linder, Kathleen A', 'Castillo, Caroline G', 'Zhou, Shiwei', 'Kauffman, Carol A', 'Miceli, Marisa H']","['Wasylyshyn A', 'Linder KA', 'Castillo CG', 'Zhou S', 'Kauffman CA', 'Miceli MH']",,"['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'VA Ann Arbor Health Care System, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'VA Ann Arbor Health Care System, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. mmiceli@med.umich.edu.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Michigan Health System, F4005 University Hospital South, 1500 East Medical Dr., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-5378, USA. mmiceli@med.umich.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200114,Netherlands,Mycopathologia,Mycopathologia,7505689,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillus/*isolation & purification', 'Candida/*isolation & purification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', '*Invasive Fungal Infections/complications/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Tacrolimus/adverse effects', 'Tertiary Care Centers']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Antifungal prophylaxis', 'Aspergillosis', 'Breakthrough invasive fungal infections', 'Mold infections']",2020/01/16 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/01/16 06:00'],"['2019/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11046-019-00418-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s11046-019-00418-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Mycopathologia. 2020 Apr;185(2):299-306. doi: 10.1007/s11046-019-00418-8.

METHODS: 100 EC, 20 normal endometrium and 20 atypical hyperplasia endometrium specimens were collected from West China Second University Hospital from January 2005 to January 2015. The expression of BCL11A was detected by immunohistochemistry and its relationships with clinicopathological features and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: The expression of BCL11A in ER-/PR-EC was higher than that in normal endometrium, atypical hyperplasia endometrium, and ER+/PR+EC (P < 0.001). The expression of BCL11A in EC was associated with age, menopause, EC classification, para-aortic lymph node metastasis, tumor differentiation, histological type, ER/PR expression and p53 expression (P < 0.05). The expression of BCL11A in the deceased group was significantly higher than that in the survival group (P = 0.011). Survival analysis indicated that the high expression of BCL11A was associated with low survival rate (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: BCL11A may play an important role in the development of ER-/PR-EC. It may serve as a potential target for therapy and a predict factor for prognosis. It can also provide molecular basis for new EC classification.","['You, Di', 'Lin, Lin', 'Wang, Qilin', 'Yi, Tianjin', 'Zhao, Lingjun', 'Li, Maomao', 'Wang, Ping']","['You D', 'Lin L', 'Wang Q', 'Yi T', 'Zhao L', 'Li M', 'Wang P']",,"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180601,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL11A', 'Endometrial carcinoma (EC)', 'estrogen receptor (ER)', 'immunohistochemistry (IHC)', 'progesterone receptor (PR)', 'survival analysis']",2018/06/01 00:00,2018/06/01 00:01,['2020/01/16 06:00'],"['2018/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/01 00:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2018 Jun 1;11(6):3068-3075. eCollection 2018.,PMC6958092,['None.'],,,['IJCEP Copyright (c) 2018.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BECLIN1 and ATG5 are vital upstream regulators in the macroautophagy signaling pathway. Therefore, we explored the expression levels of BECLIN1 and ATG5 in AML patients and investigated their prognostic value, that of other clinical features. METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR was used to investigate the mRNA levels of BECLIN1 and ATG5 in 101 newly diagnosed leukemia patients. RESULTS: AML samples with CEBPalpha or c-KIT mutations showed lower BECLIN1 expression levels compared with those without mutations (P=0.044 and P=0.036) and those with the c-KIT mutation showed lower ATG5 expression (P=0.040). Overexpression of BECLIN1 and ATG5 was related to a shorter overall survival (OS; P=0.02 and P=0.035) but not to disease-freesurvival (DFS). In multivariate analysis, the clinical characteristics exhibited no statistically significant differences in OS, except for the FLT3-ITD mutation (P=0.001) and age of the patients (P=0.032). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that high levels of BECLIN1 and ATG5 are associated with poor disease outcome.

This study developed a rapid detection method of eight common pediatric leukemia fusion genes. METHODS: In this study, one step multiplex RT-PCR assay was developed for the simultaneous detection of eight common leukemia fusion genes, including BCR-ABL, ETV6-RUNX1, MLL-AF4, E2A-PBX1, AML1-ETO, PML-RARalpha, CBFbeta-MYH11 and SIL-TAL1. The single step RT-PCR approach is mediated by universal primers after obtaining total RNA from bone marrow specimens. The size of the amplified fragments were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis assay. A total of 122 patients with positive leukemia fusion genes were tested by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Respectively, 21 cases were detected as CBRB-MYH11 fusion gene, 13 cases were detected as SIL-TAL1 fusion gene, 16 cases were detected as ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene, 16 cases were detected as E2A-PBX1 fusion gene, 15 cases were detected as PML-RARalpha fusion gene, 14 cases were detected as AML1-ETO fusion gene, 13 cases were detected as MLL-AF4 fusion gene, except for 1 case where no fusion gene was detected. CONCLUSION: This method has a high accuracy and detection rate. Therefore, one step multiplex RT-PCR combined with a capillary electrophoresis analysis system can be used as an important tool for the clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of pediatric leukemia.","['Chen, Qian', 'Hu, Zheng', 'Fang, Yongjun', 'Kang, Meiyun', 'Zhang, Qihua']","['Chen Q', 'Hu Z', 'Fang Y', 'Kang M', 'Zhang Q']",,"[""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University No.72 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing 210008, China."", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University No.72 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing 210008, China."", ""Department of Hematology & Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University No.72 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing 210008, China."", ""Department of Hematology & Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University No.72 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing 210008, China."", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University No.72 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing 210008, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180301,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['One-step multiplex RT-PCR', 'leukemia fusion gene', 'universal primer']",2018/03/01 00:00,2018/03/01 00:01,['2020/01/16 06:00'],"['2017/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/01 00:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2018 Mar 1;11(3):1074-1087. eCollection 2018.,PMC6958138,['None.'],,,['IJCEP Copyright (c) 2018.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The SHI-1 cells were firstly infected with the rescued recombinant lentivirus to establish SHI-1/CXCR4i cell line. The expression of CXCR4, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the SHI-1/CXCR4i cell was determined by real time quantitative PCR and flow cytometry. MTT assay was performed to detect the SHI-1/CXCR4i cell proliferative rate. The co-culture system of the leukemia cells with bone marrow stromal cells was utilized to detect the adhesive and migratory ability of SHI-1/CXCR4i cell. The nude mouse was subcutaneously inoculated with both cell lines, and then used to evaluate the growth ability of leukemia cells without CXCR4 expressing. The expression of CXCR4 mRNA in established SHI-1/CXCR4i cells decreased by 76% comparing with that in SHI-1/NC cells, which were infected with negative control virus. The proliferative rate of the SHI-1/CXCR4i cells in vitro did not show obvious difference with the SHI-1/NC cells, however, the adhesive and trans-Matrigel invasive ability were significantly decreased. Notably, the neoplasm was not observed in mice subcutaneously inoculated with SHI-1/CXCR4i cells, but presented in the SHI-1/WT and SHI-1/NC cells-inoculated mice in neoplastic volume of both groups. The present data showed that the CXCR4 silencing reduced the adhesive and migratory ability of SHI-1 cells in vitro, and suppressed the formation of subcutaneous neoplasm in vivo, demonstrating that the CXCR4 can be served as a novel target for leukemia gene therapy.","['Zheng, Jifu', 'Fu, Lei', 'Li, Zhenjiang', 'Shi, Qingzhi', 'Li, Jian', 'Chen, Sanjun']","['Zheng J', 'Fu L', 'Li Z', 'Shi Q', 'Li J', 'Chen S']",,"['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University Nanchang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180101,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute monocytic leukemia cells', 'CXCR4', 'RNA interference', 'mouse model', 'tumorigenesis']",2018/01/01 00:00,2018/01/01 00:01,['2020/01/16 06:00'],"['2017/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2018 Jan 1;11(1):68-75. eCollection 2018.,PMC6957952,['None.'],,,['IJCEP Copyright (c) 2018.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The uridine-cytidine kinase 1 (UCK1) has an established role in activating 5'-AZA and its protein level is significantly downregulated in patients resistant to the drug. However, the underlying molecular mechanism for the reduced UCK1 expression remains to be elucidated. Methods: Using mass spectrometry and molecular biochemistry analyses, we identified specific enzymes mediating UCK1 degradation. Human AML cell lines and murine AML model were used to characterize the effects of these enzymes on 5'-AZA resistance. Results: We demonstrated that the ubiquitin E3 ligase KLHL2 interacted with UCK1 and mediated its polyubiquitination at the K81 residue and degradation. We showed that deubiquitinase USP28 antagonized KLHL2-mediated polyubiquitylation of UCK1. We also provided evidence that ATM-mediated phosphorylation of USP28 resulted in its disassociation from KLHL2 and UCK1 destabilization. Conversely, UCK1 phosphorylation by 5'-AZA-activated ATM enhanced the KLHL2-UCK1 complex formation. Importantly, silencing KLHL2 or USP28 overexpression not only inhibited AML cell proliferation but also sensitized AML cells to 5'-AZA-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. These results were no longer observed in USP28-deficient cells. Conclusions: Our study revealed a novel mechanism by which the KLHL2/USP28/ATM axis mediates resistance of AML cells to 5'-AZA by regulating UCK1 ubiquitination and phosphorylation. These results have direct clinical implications and provide a rationale for the combination drug treatment of AML patients.","['Zhang, Heng', 'Huang, He', 'Feng, Xing', 'Song, Huiwen', 'Zhang, Zhiyong', 'Shen, Aizong', 'Qiu, Xingfeng']","['Zhang H', 'Huang H', 'Feng X', 'Song H', 'Zhang Z', 'Shen A', 'Qiu X']",,"['Department of Histology and Embryology, Xiang Ya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Xiang Ya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'The affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Brain and Cognitive Neuroscience, Guangxi Neurological Diseases Clinical Research Center, Guilin, Guangxi, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Jiading District Central Hospital Affiliated Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'National Center for International Research of Biological Targeting Diagnosis and Therapy (Guangxi Key Laboratory of Biological Targeting Diagnosis and Therapy Research), Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Surgery, Robert-Wood-Johnson Medical School University Hospital, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA.', 'Pharmacy Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200101,Australia,Theranostics,Theranostics,101552395,IM,,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/metabolism', '*Azacitidine/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microfilament Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/*metabolism', 'Uridine Kinase/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"[""*5'-AZA"", '*KLHL2', '*UCK1', '*USP28', '*ubiquitination']",2020/01/16 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2020/01/16 06:00'],"['2019/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/thno.36503 [doi]', 'thnov10p1046 [pii]']",epublish,Theranostics. 2020 Jan 1;10(3):1046-1059. doi: 10.7150/thno.36503. eCollection 2020.,PMC6956814,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (KLHL2 protein, human)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (USP28 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.48 (Uridine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",['(c) The author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Direct inhibition of Bcl-2 by venetoclax and indirect targeting of Mcl-1 with transcription inhibitors have been successful approaches for CLL. AMG-176 is a selective and direct antagonist of Mcl-1, which has shown efficacy in several hematologic malignancies; however, its effect on CLL is elusive. We evaluated biological and molecular effects of AMG-176 in primary CLL cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using samples from patients (n = 74) with CLL, we tested effects of AMG-176 on CLL and normal hematopoietic cell death and compared importance of CLL prognostic factors on this biological activity. We evaluated CLL cell apoptosis in the presence of stromal cells and identified cell death pathway including stabilization of Mcl-1 protein. Finally, we tested a couplet of AMG-176 and venetoclax in CLL lymphocytes. RESULTS: AMG-176 incubations resulted in time- and dose-dependent CLL cell death. At 100 and 300 nmol/L, there was 30% and 45% cell death at 24 hours. These concentrations did not result in significant cell death in normal hematopoietic cells. Presence of stroma did not affect AMG-176-induced CLL cell death. IGHV unmutated status, high beta2M and Mcl-1 protein levels resulted in slightly lower cell death. Mcl-1, but not Bcl-2 protein levels, in CLL cells increased with AMG-176. Low concentrations of venetoclax (1-30 nmol/L) were additive or synergistic with AMG-176. CONCLUSIONS: AMG-176 is active in inducing CLL cell death while sparing normal blood cells. Combination with low-dose venetoclax was additive or synergistic.","['Yi, Xue', 'Sarkar, Aloke', 'Kismali, Gorkem', 'Aslan, Burcu', 'Ayres, Mary', 'Iles, LaKesla R', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Wierda, William G', 'Long, James P', 'Bertilaccio, Maria Teresa Sabrina', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Yi X', 'Sarkar A', 'Kismali G', 'Aslan B', 'Ayres M', 'Iles LR', 'Keating MJ', 'Wierda WG', 'Long JP', 'Bertilaccio MTS', 'Gandhi V']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5853-5938'],"['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematology, Wuhan No. 1 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Ankara University Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. vgandhi@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200114,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Naphthalenes/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Spiro Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,2020/01/16 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2020/01/16 06:00'],"['2019/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-19-1397 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-1397 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2020 Jul 15;26(14):3856-3867. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-1397.

Treatments based on HLA-presented peptides have shown promising results in clinical application as personalized T cell-based immunotherapy. Peptide vaccination cocktails are produced as investigational medicinal products under GMP conditions. To support clinical trials based on HLA-presented tumor-associated antigens, in this study the sensitive LC-MS/MS HLA class I antigen identification pipeline was fully validated for our technical equipment according to the current US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines.The immunopeptidomes of JY cells with or without spiked-in, isotope labeled peptides, of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers as well as a chronic lymphocytic leukemia and a bladder cancer sample were reliably identified using a data-dependent acquisition method.

Germline POT1 mutations are associated with an autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome presenting with diverse malignancies, including glioma, angiosarcoma, colorectal cancer and melanoma. Although somatic POT1 mutations promote telomere elongation and genome instability in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the contribution of POT1 mutations to development of other sporadic cancers is largely unexplored. METHODS: We performed logistic regression, adjusted for tumour mutational burden, to identify associations between POT1 mutation frequency and tumour type in 62 368 tumours undergoing next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 1834 tumours harboured a non-benign mutation of POT1 (2.94%), of which 128 harboured a mutation previously reported to confer familial cancer risk in the setting of germline POT1 deficiency. Angiosarcoma was 11 times more likely than other tumours to harbour a POT1 mutation (p=1.4x10(-20)), and 65% of POT1-mutated angiosarcoma had >1 mutations in POT1. Malignant gliomas were 1.7 times less likely to harbour a POT1 mutation (p=1.2x10(-3)) than other tumour types. Colorectal cancer was 1.2 times less likely to harbour a POT1 mutation (p=0.012), while melanoma showed no differences in POT1 mutation frequency versus other tumours (p=0.67). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm a role for shelterin dysfunction in angiosarcoma development but suggest that gliomas arising in the context of germline POT1 deficiency activate a telomere-lengthening mechanism that is uncommon in gliomagenesis.","['Shen, Erica', 'Xiu, Joanne', 'Lopez, Giselle Y', 'Bentley, Rex', 'Jalali, Ali', 'Heimberger, Amy B', 'Bainbridge, Matthew N', 'Bondy, Melissa L', 'Walsh, Kyle M']","['Shen E', 'Xiu J', 'Lopez GY', 'Bentley R', 'Jalali A', 'Heimberger AB', 'Bainbridge MN', 'Bondy ML', 'Walsh KM']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5879-9981'],"['Department of Neurosurgery, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Medical Affairs, Caris Life Sciences Inc, Phoenix, Arizona, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', ""The Genomic Institute, Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, California, USA."", 'Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA kyle.walsh@duke.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200114,England,J Med Genet,Journal of medical genetics,2985087R,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Germ-Line Mutation/genetics', 'Glioma/genetics/pathology', 'Hemangiosarcoma/genetics/pathology', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melanoma/genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary/*genetics/pathology', 'Shelterin Complex', 'Telomere/*genetics', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*POT1 mutation', '*atrx', '*hereditary cancer syndrome families', '*telomere', '*tert']",2020/01/16 06:00,2021/07/09 06:00,['2020/01/16 06:00'],"['2019/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['jmedgenet-2019-106657 [pii]', '10.1136/jmedgenet-2019-106657 [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Genet. 2020 Oct;57(10):664-670. doi: 10.1136/jmedgenet-2019-106657.

Recent reports demonstrated the great breakthroughs made by the chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy, which is significantly different from traditional T cells therapies. In spite of the progress of CAR-T technology in the treatment of lymphoma, leukemia, and other blood system tumor, there are still many difficulties in the treatment of solid tumors by CAR-T technology. METHODS: In this report, we designed a panel of IL23mAb-PSMA-CARs, including PSMA-CAR, IL23mAb-T2A-PSMA-CAR, IL23mAb-PSMA-CAR, and PSMA-CAR (soluble IL23mAb). And we studied the function of these CARs in mice model. RESULTS: Co-culture experiments with different CAR T cells have normal lysis function in vitro. The duo-CAR T cells co-expressing the IL-23mAb and PSMA-mAb had a significant higher population than the rest three different CAR T cells in co-culturing experiments at day 28, 35 and 42. A panel of cytokines were differentially secreted at higher amounts in IL23mAb-T2A-PSMA-CAR T cells than CAR T cells in other groups. In NOD/SCID IL-2 gamma (NSG) mice model, IL23mAb-T2A-PSMA-CAR T cells functioned significantly better than CAR T cells from the other groups and eradicated the tumor from these mice starting at day 14 post T cells injection and regained the body weight immediately. In IL23mAb-T2A-PSMA-CAR mice, CD45RO+ CD8+ T cells and CD127+ CD4+ CAR T cells were significantly increased. RNA sequencing revealed a difference expression pattern of genes in IL23mAb-T2A-PSMA-CAR mice. A reverse infusion experiment under the same model further proved the tumor eradication function of IL23mAb-T2A-PSMA-CAR T cells. CONCLUSIONS: We found that IL-23mAb combined PSMA CARs worked better than PSMA CAR only in Prostate Cancer Eradication, and we further discussed the mechanisms among different IL-23mAb combined PSMA CARs in Prostate Cancer Eradication.","['Wang, Dawei', 'Shao, Yuan', 'Zhang, Xiang', 'Lu, Guoliang', 'Liu, Boke']","['Wang D', 'Shao Y', 'Zhang X', 'Lu G', 'Liu B']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1044-672X'],"['Department of Urology, Ruijin Hospital North, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, No.999, Xiwang Road Jiading District, Shanghai, 201800, China.', 'Department of Urology, Ruijin Hospital North, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, No.999, Xiwang Road Jiading District, Shanghai, 201800, China. shaoyuan1602@163.com.', 'Department of Urology, Ruijin Hospital North, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, No.999, Xiwang Road Jiading District, Shanghai, 201800, China.', 'Department of Urology, Ruijin Hospital North, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, No.999, Xiwang Road Jiading District, Shanghai, 201800, China.', 'Department of Urology, Ruijin Hospital North, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, No.999, Xiwang Road Jiading District, Shanghai, 201800, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200114,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,IM,,"['Androgen Antagonists', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-23', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', '*Prostatic Neoplasms/therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR T cells', '*IL-23', '*IL23', '*PSMA', '*Prostate cancer', '*duoCAR', '*monoCAR']",2020/01/16 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/01/16 06:00'],"['2019/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-019-02206-w [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-019-02206-w [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2020 Jan 14;18(1):23. doi: 10.1186/s12967-019-02206-w.,PMC6961333,,,"['0 (Androgen Antagonists)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-23)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their toxicological effects and impact at the molecular level remain obscure. Nanotoxicology is mainly focused on the interactions of nanostructures with biological systems, particularly with an emphasis on elucidating the relationship between the physical and chemical properties such as size and shape. Therefore, we hypothesized whether these unique anisotropic nanoparticles could induce cytotoxicity similar to that of spherical nanoparticles and the mechanism involved. Thus, we synthesized unique and distinct anisotropic PtNPs using lycopene as a biological template and investigated their biological activities in model human acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) macrophages. Exposure to PtNPs for 24 h dose-dependently decreased cell viability and proliferation. Levels of the cytotoxic markers lactate dehydrogenase and intracellular protease significantly and dose-dependently increased with PtNP concentration. Furthermore, cells incubated with PtNPs dose-dependently produced oxidative stress markers including reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and carbonylated protein. An imbalance in pro-oxidants and antioxidants was confirmed by significant decreases in reduced glutathione, thioredoxin, superoxide dismutase, and catalase levels against oxidative stress. The cell death mechanism was confirmed by mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased ATP levels, mitochondrial copy numbers, and PGC-1alpha expression. To further substantiate the mechanism of cell death mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), we determined the expression of the inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE1), (PKR-like ER kinase) PERK, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and activating transcription factor 4 ATF4, the apoptotic markers p53, Bax, and caspase 3, and the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2. PtNPs could activate ERS and apoptosis mediated by mitochondria. A proinflammatory response to PtNPs was confirmed by significant upregulation of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1beta), interferon gamma (IFNgamma), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), and interleukin (IL-6). Transcriptomic and molecular pathway analyses of THP-1 cells incubated with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of PtNPs revealed the altered expression of genes involved in protein misfolding, mitochondrial function, protein synthesis, inflammatory responses, and transcription regulation. We applied transcriptomic analyses to investigate anisotropic PtNP-induced toxicity for further mechanistic studies. Isotropic nanoparticles are specifically used to inhibit non-specific cellular uptake, leading to enhanced in vivo bio-distribution and increased targeting capabilities due to the higher radius of curvature. These characteristics of anisotropic nanoparticles could enable the technology as an attractive platform for nanomedicine in biomedical applications.","['Gurunathan, Sangiliyandi', 'Jeyaraj, Muniyandi', 'La, Hyeonwoo', 'Yoo, Hyunjin', 'Choi, Youngsok', 'Do, Jeong Tae', 'Park, Chankyu', 'Kim, Jin-Hoi', 'Hong, Kwonho']","['Gurunathan S', 'Jeyaraj M', 'La H', 'Yoo H', 'Choi Y', 'Do JT', 'Park C', 'Kim JH', 'Hong K']",,"['Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology and Humanized Pig Center (SRC), Konkuk Institute of Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology and Humanized Pig Center (SRC), Konkuk Institute of Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology and Humanized Pig Center (SRC), Konkuk Institute of Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology and Humanized Pig Center (SRC), Konkuk Institute of Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology and Humanized Pig Center (SRC), Konkuk Institute of Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology and Humanized Pig Center (SRC), Konkuk Institute of Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology and Humanized Pig Center (SRC), Konkuk Institute of Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology and Humanized Pig Center (SRC), Konkuk Institute of Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology and Humanized Pig Center (SRC), Konkuk Institute of Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200109,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Anisotropy', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Lycopene/chemistry', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*toxicity/ultrastructure', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Platinum/*toxicity', 'Protein Carbonylation/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'molecular pathway analysis', 'oxidative stress', 'platinum nanoparticles', 'proinflammatory response', 'transcriptomic analysis']",2020/01/16 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2020/01/16 06:00'],"['2019/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21020440 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21020440 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jan 9;21(2). pii: ijms21020440. doi: 10.3390/ijms21020440.,PMC7014054,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (PPARGC1A protein, human)', '0 (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '49DFR088MY (Platinum)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'SB0N2N0WV6 (Lycopene)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we combined in vitro clonogenic assays with targeted sequencing to gain further insights into the cell-of-origin of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD-mutated AML in diagnostic bone marrow (BM) from nine NPM1+/FLT3-ITD (+/-) AMLs. We reasoned that individually plucked colony forming units (CFUs) are clonal and reflect the progeny of a single stem/progenitor cell. NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations seen in the diagnostic blasts were found in only 2/95 and 1/57 individually plucked CFUs, suggesting that BM clonogenic myeloid progenitors in NPM1-mutated and NPM1/FLT3-ITD-mutated AML patients do not harbor such molecular lesions. This supports previous studies on NPM1 mutations as secondary mutations in AML, likely acquired in an expanded pool of committed myeloid progenitors, perhaps CD34-, in line with the CD34(-/low) phenotype of NPM1-mutated AMLs. This study has important implications on the cell-of-origin of NPM1+ AML, and reinforces that therapeutic targeting of either NPM1 or FLT3-ITD mutations might only have a transient clinical benefit in debulking the leukemia, but is unlikely to be curative since will not target the AML-initiating/preleukemic cells. The absence of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations in normal clonogenic myeloid progenitors is in line with their absence in clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential.","['Guardia, Rafael Diaz de la', 'Gonzalez-Silva, Laura', 'Lopez-Millan, Belen', 'Rodriguez-Sevilla, Juan Jose', 'Baroni, Matteo L', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Anguita, Eduardo', 'Vives, Susana', 'Palomo, Laura', 'Lapillonne, Helene', 'Varela, Ignacio', 'Menendez, Pablo']","['Guardia RD', 'Gonzalez-Silva L', 'Lopez-Millan B', 'Rodriguez-Sevilla JJ', 'Baroni ML', 'Bueno C', 'Anguita E', 'Vives S', 'Palomo L', 'Lapillonne H', 'Varela I', 'Menendez P']",,"['Department of Biomedicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona 08036, Spain.', 'Instituto de Biomedicina y Biotecnologia de Cantabria, Universidad de Cantabria-CSIC, 39011 Santander, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona 08036, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona 08036, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona 08036, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona 08036, Spain.', 'Hematology and hemotherapy Department, Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IMDL, IdISSC, Departamento de Medicina, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, 08916 Badalona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma Barcelona, 08193 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, 08916 Badalona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma Barcelona, 08193 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Centre de recherche Saint-Antoine CRSA, AP-HP, Hospital Armand Trousseau, Haematology Laboratory, F-75012 Paris, France.', 'Instituto de Biomedicina y Biotecnologia de Cantabria, Universidad de Cantabria-CSIC, 39011 Santander, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona 08036, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBER-ONC), ISCIII, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona 08010, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200109,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phenotype', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*FLT3-ITD', '*NPM1 mutations', '*clonogenic progenitors', '*colony forming units (CFU)']",2020/01/16 06:00,2020/06/24 06:00,['2020/01/16 06:00'],"['2019/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['genes11010073 [pii]', '10.3390/genes11010073 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2020 Jan 9;11(1). pii: genes11010073. doi: 10.3390/genes11010073.,PMC7017102,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate that changes in cellular O-GlcNAc levels significantly affected the growth of pre-B cells, which rapidly proliferate to allow expansion of functional clones that express successfully rearranged heavy chains at the pro-B stage during early B cell development. In our study, the overall O-GlcNAc levels in these proliferative pre-B cells, which are linked to the glucose uptake rate, were highly induced when compared with those in pro-B cells. Thus, pharmacologically, genetically, or nutritionally, inhibition of O-GlcNAcylation in pre-B cells markedly downregulated c-Myc expression, resulting in cell cycle arrest via blockade of cyclin expression. Importantly, the population of B cells after the pro-B cell stage in mouse bone marrow was severely impaired by the administration of an O-GlcNAc inhibitor. These results strongly suggest that O-GlcNAcylation-dependent expression of c-Myc represents a new regulatory component of pre-B cell proliferation, as well as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of pre-B cell-derived leukemia.","['Lee, Da Hee', 'Kwon, Na Eun', 'Lee, Won-Ji', 'Lee, Moo-Seung', 'Kim, Doo-Jin', 'Kim, Ji Hyung', 'Park, Sung-Kyun']","['Lee DH', 'Kwon NE', 'Lee WJ', 'Lee MS', 'Kim DJ', 'Kim JH', 'Park SK']",,"['Infectious Disease Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology (KRIBB), 125 Gwahak-ro, Daejeon 34141, Korea.', 'Infectious Disease Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology (KRIBB), 125 Gwahak-ro, Daejeon 34141, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Konkuk Institute of Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea.', 'Environmental Diseases Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology (KRIBB), 125 Gwahak-ro, Daejeon 34141, Korea.', 'Infectious Disease Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology (KRIBB), 125 Gwahak-ro, Daejeon 34141, Korea.', 'Infectious Disease Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology (KRIBB), 125 Gwahak-ro, Daejeon 34141, Korea.', 'Infectious Disease Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology (KRIBB), 125 Gwahak-ro, Daejeon 34141, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200108,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,,"['Acetylglucosamine/*chemistry', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Glycosylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*cytology/metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['*O-GlcNAcylation', '*c-Myc', '*pre-B cell', '*proliferation']",2020/01/16 06:00,2021/02/05 06:00,['2020/01/16 06:00'],"['2019/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9010158 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9010158 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Jan 8;9(1). pii: cells9010158. doi: 10.3390/cells9010158.,PMC7016991,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,"['0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'V956696549 (Acetylglucosamine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The secondary objectives were to assess if any relationships existed between the mentioned SNPs and FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1 mutations with clinical outcomes and overall survival (OS) in AML patients. We investigated 281 AML cases and 405 healthy subjects. The results showed a significant association between a variant allele of rs2070215 (p = 0.007), CAT haplotype (p = 0.012), and AML susceptibility. No significant association was found between MCM7 variant genotypes and overall survival of AML patients (p > 0.05), while several associations between somatic mutations, clinical and biological features, and poor OS were noticed. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level >/= 600 IU/L had a significant effect on the hazard of death (p = 0.004, HR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.13-1.95).

Derivatives of this molecule may therefore prove to be useful chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we explored whether glycosylation increases the cytotoxic potency of lapachol towards HL-60 human leukemia cells. Two beta-glycosides were synthesized and characterized: LA4A (lapachol-beta-glucoside) and LA4C (lapachol-N-acetylglucosamine-beta-glucoside). The sugar moieties of both novel molecules were per-acetylated to facilitate cellular uptake. The IC50 values (in muM) for LA4A (5.7) and LA4C (5.3) were lower than those for lapachol (25). LA4A and LA4C triggered typical signs of apoptosis, such as the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outside of cells, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and a decrease of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) prior to cell lysis. Moreover, DNA fragmentation triggered by the lapachol-glycosides was reduced by pre-treatment with the caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk. While LA4A and LA4C activated caspases-3, -8 and -9, lapachol failed to activate these apoptotic proteases, even when used at high concentrations. Finally, the toxicity of lapachol and its derivatives was also tested on non-tumor cells. We used human peripheral neurons (PeriTox test) to evaluate the side effect potential of these compounds. LA4C was clearly less toxic than LA4A. We conclude that LA4C had the most favorable profile as drug candidate (high tumor cell toxicity, reduced neurotoxicity). In general, this study shows that the cytotoxicity of lapachol towards HL-60 can be enhanced by glycosylation, and that the therapeutic ratio may be modified by the type of sugar added.","['Marques, Lucas Bonfim', 'Ottoni, Flaviano Melo', 'Pinto, Mauro Cunha Xavier', 'Ribeiro, Juliana Martins', 'de Sousa, Fernanda S', 'Weinlich, Ricardo', 'de Victo, Nathalia Cruz', 'Kisitu, Jaffar', 'Holzer, Anna-Katharina', 'Leist, Marcel', 'Alves, Ricardo Jose', 'Souza-Fagundes, Elaine Maria']","['Marques LB', 'Ottoni FM', 'Pinto MCX', 'Ribeiro JM', 'de Sousa FS', 'Weinlich R', 'de Victo NC', 'Kisitu J', 'Holzer AK', 'Leist M', 'Alves RJ', 'Souza-Fagundes EM']",,"['Departamento de Fisiologia e Biofisica, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Farmacologia, Universidade Federal de Goias, Goiania, GO, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Fisiologia e Biofisica, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Fisiologia e Biofisica, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Instituto Israelita de Ensino e Pesquisa Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Instituto Israelita de Ensino e Pesquisa Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'In Vitro Toxicology and Biomedicine, Inaugurated by the Doerenkamp-Zbinden Foundation, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany.', 'In Vitro Toxicology and Biomedicine, Inaugurated by the Doerenkamp-Zbinden Foundation, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany.', 'In Vitro Toxicology and Biomedicine, Inaugurated by the Doerenkamp-Zbinden Foundation, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany.', 'Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Fisiologia e Biofisica, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.

We identified silencing of cerebellar degeneration-related 1 antisense (CDR1as), a regulator of miR-7, as a hallmark of melanoma progression. CDR1as depletion results from epigenetic silencing of LINC00632, its originating long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and promotes invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo through a miR-7-independent, IGF2BP3-mediated mechanism.

The translocation leads to the formation of a pathological RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion that leads to the disruption of the normal function of the core-binding factor, namely, its role in hematopoietic differentiation and maturation. The consequences of this alteration include the recruitment of repressors of transcription, thus blocking the expression of genes involved in hematopoiesis, and impaired apoptosis. A number of concurrent and cooperating mutations clearly play a role in modulating the proliferative potential of cells, including mutations in KIT, FLT3, and possibly JAK2. RUNX1-RUNX1T1 also appears to interact with microRNAs during leukemogenesis. Epigenetic factors also play a role, especially with the recruitment of histone deacetylases. A better understanding of the concurrent mutations, activated pathways, and epigenetic modulation of the cellular processes paves the way for exploring a number of approaches to achieve cure. Potential approaches include the development of small molecules targeting the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 protein, the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib and FLT3 inhibitors to target mutations that lead to a proliferative advantage of the leukemic cells, and experimentation with epigenetic therapies. In this review, we unravel some of the recently described molecular pathways and explore potential therapeutic strategies.","['Al-Harbi, Sayer', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Almohareb, Fahad', 'Ahmed, Syed Osman Ali']","['Al-Harbi S', 'Aljurf M', 'Mohty M', 'Almohareb F', 'Ahmed SOA']",,"['Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Center, and.', 'Adult Hematology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; and.', 'Hopital San Antoine, Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris, Sorbonne Universite, INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 938, Paris, France.', 'Adult Hematology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; and.', 'Adult Hematology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,"['*Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2020/01/15 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2019/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31702-X [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000168 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Jan 14;4(1):229-238. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000168.,PMC6960481,,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed immune recovery in 106 engrafted adult CBT recipients (median age 50 years [range 22-70]) transplanted for hematologic malignancies with cyclosporine/mycophenolate mofetil immunoprophylaxis and no ATG. Patients were treated predominantly for acute leukemia (66%), and almost all (96%) underwent myeloablation. Recovery of CD4+ T cells was faster than CD8+ T cells with median CD4+ T-cell counts exceeding 200/mm3 at 4 months. Early post-CBT, effector memory (EM), and central memory cells were the most common CD4+ subsets, whereas effector and EM were the most common CD8+ T-cell subsets. Naive T-cell subsets increased gradually after 6 to 9 months post-CBT. A higher engrafting CB unit infused viable CD3+ cell dose was associated with improved CD4+ and CD4+CD45RA+ T-cell recovery. Cytomegalovirus reactivation by day 60 was associated with an expansion of total, EM, and effector CD8+ T cells, but lower CD4+ T-cell counts. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) did not significantly compromise T-cell reconstitution. In serial landmark analyses, higher CD4+ T-cell counts and phytohemagglutinin responses were associated with reduced overall mortality. In contrast, CD8+ T-cell counts were not significant. Recovery of natural killer and B cells was prompt, reaching medians of 252/mm3 and 150/mm3 by 4 months, respectively, although B-cell recovery was delayed by aGVHD. Neither subset was significantly associated with mortality. ATG-free adult CBT is associated with robust thymus-independent CD4+ T-cell recovery, and CD4+ recovery reduced mortality risk.","['Politikos, Ioannis', 'Lavery, Jessica A', 'Hilden, Patrick', 'Cho, Christina', 'Borrill, Taylor', 'Maloy, Molly A', 'Giralt, Sergio A', 'van den Brink, Marcel R M', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Barker, Juliet N']","['Politikos I', 'Lavery JA', 'Hilden P', 'Cho C', 'Borrill T', 'Maloy MA', 'Giralt SA', 'van den Brink MRM', 'Perales MA', 'Barker JN']",,"['Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY; and.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY; and.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY; and.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY; and.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY; and.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Antilymphocyte Serum', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Fetal Blood', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/15 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2019/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31697-9 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000836 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Jan 14;4(1):191-202. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000836.,PMC6960461,,"['P01 CA023766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)'],['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, real-time diagnosis of patients can be quite challenging given the genetic heterogeneity of this disease and the often cytogenetically cryptic nature of Ph-like ALL-associated alterations. In this review, we discuss the complex biologic and clinical features of Ph-like ALL across the age spectrum, available diagnostic testing modalities, and current clinical treatment strategies for these high-risk patients. We further propose a practical and step-wise approach to Ph-like ALL genetic testing to facilitate the identification and allocation of patients to appropriate clinical trials of TKI-based therapies or commercially available drugs. Although the majority of patients with Ph-like ALL can be successfully identified via current clinical assays by the end of induction chemotherapy, increasing diagnostic efficiency and sensitivity and decreasing time to test resulting will facilitate earlier therapeutic intervention and may improve clinical outcomes for these high-risk patients.","['Harvey, Richard C', 'Tasian, Sarah K']","['Harvey RC', 'Tasian SK']",,"['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM.', 'University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; and."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use']",,,2020/01/15 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2019/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31701-8 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000163 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Jan 14;4(1):218-228. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000163.,PMC6960477,,"['R50 CA211542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA118100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among 16 patients who achieved PB uMRD and had contemporaneous BM assessments, 13 (81%) had confirmed BM uMRD, and patients with PB uMRD had outcomes at least as favorable as those with BM uMRD for time to progression, overall survival, and MRD recrudescence. Excluding 2 patients lacking earlier assessment, the median time to PB uMRD was 18 (range, 5-26) months, with 90% of instances achieved by 24 months.

Complex karyotype was associated with inferior uMRD attainment after 12 months of therapy (P = .015), and patients attaining uMRD whose disease harbored TP53 abnormalities demonstrated a trend toward earlier recrudescence (P = .089). Of patients who received venetoclax dose escalations, 4 (27%) of 15 achieved improvements in response. For patients with R/R CLL receiving venetoclax, PB uMRD commonly correlates with BM uMRD and is associated with a comparable longer-term prognosis. Concurrent rituximab augments uMRD attainment, but dose escalation and further treatment beyond 24 months infrequently deepen responses.","['Lew, Thomas E', 'Anderson, Mary Ann', 'Lin, Victor S', 'Handunnetti, Sasanka M', 'Came, Neil A', 'Blombery, Piers', 'Westerman, David A', 'Wall, Meaghan', 'Tam, Constantine S', 'Roberts, Andrew W', 'Seymour, John F']","['Lew TE', 'Anderson MA', 'Lin VS', 'Handunnetti SM', 'Came NA', 'Blombery P', 'Westerman DA', 'Wall M', 'Tam CS', 'Roberts AW', 'Seymour JF']",,"['Department of Clinical Haematology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Parkville, Australia.', 'Blood Cells and Blood Cancer Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Parkville, Australia.', 'Blood Cells and Blood Cancer Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Australia.', 'Blood Cells and Blood Cancer Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Parkville, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Parkville, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Parkville, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Victorian Cancer Cytogenetics Service, Fitzroy, Australia; and.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Parkville, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.', ""Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne, Fitzroy, Australia."", 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Parkville, Australia.', 'Blood Cells and Blood Cancer Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Parkville, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,"['Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic', 'Goals', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sulfonamides']",,,2020/01/15 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2019/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31694-3 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000864 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Jan 14;4(1):165-173. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000864.,PMC6960473,,,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By inducing a CR rate of 75%, the bendamustine, gemcitabine, vinorelbine (BEGEV) regimen represents an optimal chemotherapy regimen prior to ASCT. Presented here are the 5-year results of BEGEV followed by ASCT in R/R cHL. With a median follow-up of 5 years, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the whole series (n = 59) were 59% and 78%, respectively. ASCT was performed in 43 of 49 responding patients (73% by intention to treat [ITT]; 88% by response to BEGEV) and resulted in 33 with continuous CR (56% by ITT; 77% of transplanted patients), 7 with disease relapse, and 3 with nonrelapse mortality. For patients who received transplants, the 5-year PFS and OS were 77% and 91%, respectively, with no significant difference between relapsed and refractory patients. No patient experienced secondary leukemia or myelodysplasia. In summary, the long-term efficacy data, the benefits for both relapsed and refractory patients, and the excellent safety profile provide a strong rationale for further development of the BEGEV regimen.

Geriatricians have developed comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) methods for elderly patients; however, the tools used for CGA in AML are not uniform. Thus, we aimed to validate the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scales, age, comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index), and albumin (IACA) index, which is a new tool for CGA, in elderly patients with AML. METHODS: Patients aged >/=60 years who had been diagnosed with AML were screened for eligibility. Among the IACA low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test, and categorical variables were compared using chi and Fisher exact tests. In addition, probabilities of overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: A total of 21, 34, and 6 patients were categorized into IACA low-risk (0 point), intermediate-risk (1-2 points), and high-risk (>/=3 points) groups, respectively. The rates of relapse/progression-related mortality were 23.8%, 58.8%, and 100.0% in the IACA low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively (chi = 12.81, P < 0.001). The 2-year probabilities of OS were 47.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.8%-72.6%) and 20.2% (95% CI 5.9%-34.5%) in the IACA low- and intermediate-risk groups, respectively (chi = 5.99, P = 0.014), which were significantly higher than those in the high-risk group (low-risk [47.7% (95% CI 22.8%-72.6%)] vs. high-risk [0], chi = 20.80, P < 0.001; intermediate-risk [20.2% (95% CI 5.9%-34.5%)] vs. high-risk [0], chi = 7.56, P = 0.006; respectively). In the IACA low-risk group, the 2-year probability of OS in patients receiving induction chemotherapy (50.8% [95% CI 24.1%-77.5%]) was significantly higher than that in those receiving best supportive care (0, chi = 25.74, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We suggest that the IACA index might be a simple and effective tool for comprehensive geriatric assessment in elderly AML patients.","['Zhang, Chun-Li', 'Feng, Ru', 'Li, Jiang-Tao', 'Wang, Ting', 'Bai, Jie-Fei', 'Liu, Hui']","['Zhang CL', 'Feng R', 'Li JT', 'Wang T', 'Bai JF', 'Liu H']",,"['Department of Hematology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Beijing 100730, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Geriatric Assessment/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*mortality/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Serum Albumin/analysis']",,,2020/01/15 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CM9.0000000000000645 [doi]', '00029330-202002200-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2020 Feb 20;133(4):381-387. doi: 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000645.,PMC7046252,,,['0 (Serum Albumin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma tumor cells express CD30 in some cases and the increased expression of CD30 is considered to be one of the causes of constitutive NF-kappaB activation in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells. Brentuximab vedotin represents a major breakthrough in the treatment of CD30-positive lymphomas. Elderly patients treated with chemotherapy generally have higher rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse events; however a retrospective analysis demonstrated the safety and efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in adults >/=60 years with relapsed and refractory CD30-positive lymphomas. We herein report the clinical effects of brentuximab vedotin and the significance of CD30 expression in an elderly refractory/relapse adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma patient. CD30 expression is associated with disease progression in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma patients and brentuximab vedotin may be a new and promising treatment option for these patients.

The shelterin component TRF1 facilitates telomere replication but the molecular mechanism remains uncertain. By interrogating the proteomic composition of telomeres, we show that mouse telomeres lacking TRF1 undergo protein composition reorganisation associated with the recruitment of DNA damage response and chromatin remodellers. Surprisingly, mTRF1 suppresses the accumulation of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, BRCA1 and the SMC5/6 complex at telomeres, which is associated with increased Homologous Recombination (HR) and TERRA transcription. We uncovered a previously unappreciated role for mTRF1 in the suppression of telomere recombination, dependent on SMC5 and also POLD3 dependent Break Induced Replication at telomeres. We propose that TRF1 facilitates S-phase telomeric DNA synthesis to prevent illegitimate mitotic DNA recombination and chromatin rearrangement.","['Porreca, Rosa Maria', 'Herrera-Moyano, Emilia', 'Skourti, Eleni', 'Law, Pui Pik', 'Gonzalez Franco, Roser', 'Montoya, Alex', 'Faull, Peter', 'Kramer, Holger', 'Vannier, Jean-Baptiste']","['Porreca RM', 'Herrera-Moyano E', 'Skourti E', 'Law PP', 'Gonzalez Franco R', 'Montoya A', 'Faull P', 'Kramer H', 'Vannier JB']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8924-0462', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8491-8086', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4471-1854']","['Telomere Replication and Stability group, Medical Research Council - London Institute of Medical Sciences, London, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Telomere Replication and Stability group, Medical Research Council - London Institute of Medical Sciences, London, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Telomere Replication and Stability group, Medical Research Council - London Institute of Medical Sciences, London, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Telomere Replication and Stability group, Medical Research Council - London Institute of Medical Sciences, London, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Telomere Replication and Stability group, Medical Research Council - London Institute of Medical Sciences, London, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Biological Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics, Medical Research Council - London Institute of Medical Sciences, London, United Kingdom.', 'Biological Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics, Medical Research Council - London Institute of Medical Sciences, London, United Kingdom.', 'The Francis Crick Institute, Proteomics Mass Spectrometry Science and Technology Platform, London, United Kingdom.', 'Biological Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics, Medical Research Council - London Institute of Medical Sciences, London, United Kingdom.', 'Telomere Replication and Stability group, Medical Research Council - London Institute of Medical Sciences, London, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200114,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/metabolism', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA/biosynthesis', '*DNA Breaks', 'DNA Polymerase III/metabolism', 'DNA Replication/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Inclusion Bodies/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitosis', 'Recombination, Genetic/*genetics', 'Telomere/*metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['ALT', 'DNA damage response', 'DNA recombination', 'TERRA', 'cell biology', 'chromosomes', 'gene expression', 'human', 'mouse', 'replication', 'telomere']",2020/01/15 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2019/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.7554/eLife.49817 [doi]', '49817 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2020 Jan 14;9. pii: 49817. doi: 10.7554/eLife.49817.,PMC6986873,"['RP, EH, ES, PL, RG, AM, PF, HK, JV No competing interests declared']","['MC_UP_1102/14/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MRC Career Development Award/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Telomere Replication and Stability/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '637798 MetDNASecStr/European Commission']","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (SMC5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (POLD3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase III)']","['(c) 2020, Porreca et al.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In flow cytometry, however, the long lifetime poses a significant challenge to measure wherein the detection window is often too short to determine the decay characteristics. Here we report a time-resolved microfluidic flow cytometer (tr-mFCM) incorporating an acoustic-focusing chip, which allows slowing down of the flow while providing the same detection conditions for every target, achieving accurate lifetime measurement free of autofluorescence interference. Through configuration of the flow velocity and detection aperture with respect to the time-gating sequence, a multi-cycle luminescence decay profile is captured for every event under maximum excitation and detection efficiency. A custom fitting algorithm is then developed to resolve europium-stained polymer microspheres as well as leukemia cells against abundant fluorescent particles, achieving counting efficiency approaching 100% and lifetime CVs (coefficient of variation) around 2-6%. We further demonstrate lifetime-multiplexed detection of prostate and bladder cancer cells stained with different europium probes. Our acoustic-focusing tr-mFCM offers a practical technique for rapid screening of biofluidic samples containing multiple cell types, especially in resource-limited environments such as regional and/or underdeveloped areas as well as for point-of-care applications.","['Wang, Yan', 'Sayyadi, Nima', 'Zheng, Xianlin', 'Woods, Travis A', 'Leif, Robert C', 'Shi, Bingyang', 'Graves, Steven W', 'Piper, James A', 'Lu, Yiqing']","['Wang Y', 'Sayyadi N', 'Zheng X', 'Woods TA', 'Leif RC', 'Shi B', 'Graves SW', 'Piper JA', 'Lu Y']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0044-2170', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6462-9129', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8871-358X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6584-1853']","['ARC Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics (CNBP), Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales 2109, Australia. yiqing.lu@mq.edu.au and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales 2109, Australia.', 'ARC Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics (CNBP), Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales 2109, Australia. yiqing.lu@mq.edu.au and Department of Molecular Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales 2109, Australia.', 'ARC Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics (CNBP), Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales 2109, Australia. yiqing.lu@mq.edu.au and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales 2109, Australia.', 'Centre for Biomedical Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131, USA.', 'Newport Instruments, 3345 Hopi Place, San Diego, California 92117-3516, USA.', 'ARC Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics (CNBP), Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales 2109, Australia. yiqing.lu@mq.edu.au and Department of Biomedical Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales 2109, Australia.', 'Centre for Biomedical Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131, USA.', 'ARC Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics (CNBP), Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales 2109, Australia. yiqing.lu@mq.edu.au and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales 2109, Australia.', 'ARC Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics (CNBP), Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales 2109, Australia. yiqing.lu@mq.edu.au and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales 2109, Australia and School of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales 2109, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200114,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,IM,,"['Algorithms', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Europium/chemistry', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*chemistry', 'Humans', '*Lab-On-A-Chip Devices', 'Leukemia/*diagnostic imaging', 'Microspheres', 'Polymers/chemistry', 'Time Factors']",,,2020/01/15 06:00,2021/02/20 06:00,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c9lc00895k [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2020 Feb 7;20(3):655-664. doi: 10.1039/c9lc00895k.

The authors describe the case of a 55-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department with dyspnoea and abdominal pain. He had a 2-month history of fever, night sweats, asthenia and unintentional weight loss. Upon clinical examination he had bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Blood tests showed iron-deficit anaemia and high C-reactive protein. Abdominal ultrasound showed mesenteric and iliac adenopathies and hepatosplenomegaly. The patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine department for additional testing. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood showed CD5-positive monoclonal B-cell expansion. Excisional biopsy of a retroperitoneal adenopathy guided by computed tomography showed periodic acid-Schiff-positive bacilli inside the macrophages, further identified as Tropheryma whipplei through polymerase chain reaction. Bone marrow biopsy showed a scarce positive CD5 lymphoid population and haematopoietic alterations related to infection. The patient started treatment for T. whipplei with complete symptom resolution. This is the first case describing the simultaneous diagnosis of Whipple's disease and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in a patient with constitutional symptoms, fever and lymphadenopathies. LEARNING POINTS: Whipple's disease can mimic lymphoproliferative disorders and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy and fever, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms.Most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia are asymptomatic, but a minority have B symptoms and increased risk of infections.An accurate clinical history and differential diagnosis are fundamental; if the authors had not had a high level of suspicion, this patient could have been diagnosed with just chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and may have died if Whipple's disease had been left untreated.","['Guiomar, Veronica', 'Pinto, Maria Joao', 'Gomes, Clara', 'Correia, Cristina', 'Tavares, Sofia', 'Chaves, Vanessa', 'Oliveira, Diana']","['Guiomar V', 'Pinto MJ', 'Gomes C', 'Correia C', 'Tavares S', 'Chaves V', 'Oliveira D']",,"['Internal Medicine Department, Centro Hospitalar de Sao Joao, Porto, Portugal.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Centro Hospitalar de Tras-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Centro Hospitalar de Sao Joao, Porto, Portugal.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Centro Hospitalar de Sao Joao, Porto, Portugal.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Centro Hospitalar de Sao Joao, Porto, Portugal.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Centro Hospitalar de Sao Joao, Porto, Portugal.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Centro Hospitalar de Sao Joao, Porto, Portugal.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190925,Italy,Eur J Case Rep Intern Med,European journal of case reports in internal medicine,101648453,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Fever', ""Whipple's disease"", 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'lymphadenopathy', 'small lymphocytic lymphoma']",2020/01/15 06:00,2020/01/15 06:01,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2019/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.12890/2019_001270 [doi]', '1270-1-9180-1-10-20190919 [pii]']",epublish,Eur J Case Rep Intern Med. 2019 Sep 25;6(10):001270. doi: 10.12890/2019_001270. eCollection 2019.,PMC6953428,['Conflicts of Interests: The Authors declare that there are no competing interest'],,,['(c) EFIM 2019.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiology, Etiology, Pathophysiology and Treatment.",e2020009,10.4084/MJHID.2020.009 [doi],"Acute leukemias are a group of aggressive malignant diseases associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality. An important cause of both the latter is infectious complications. Patients with acute leukemia are highly susceptible to infectious diseases due to factors related to the disease itself, factors attributed to treatment, and specific individual risk factors in each patient. Patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia are at particularly high risk, and microbiological agents include viral, bacterial, and fungal agents. The etiology is often unknown in infectious complications, although adequate patient evaluation and sampling have diagnostic, prognostic and treatment-related consequences. Bacterial infections include a wide range of potential microbes, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive species, while fungal infections include both mold and yeast. A recurring problem is increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents, and in particular, this applies to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance (ESBL), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and even carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). International guidelines for the treatment of sepsis in leukemia patients include the use of broad-spectrum Pseudomonas-acting antibiotics. However, one should implant the knowledge of local microbiological epidemiology and resistance conditions in treatment decisions. In this review, we discuss infectious diseases in acute leukemia with a major focus on febrile neutropenia and sepsis, and we problematize the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic aspects of infectious complications in this patient group. Meticulously and thorough clinical and radiological examination combined with adequate microbiology samples are cornerstones of the examination. Diagnostic and prognostic evaluation includes patient review according to the multinational association for supportive care in cancer (MASCC) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scoring system. Antimicrobial treatments for important etiological agents are presented. The main challenge for reducing the spread of resistant microbes is to avoid unnecessary antibiotic treatment, but without giving to narrow treatment to the febrile neutropenic patient that reduce the prognosis.","['Hansen, Bent-Are', 'Wendelbo, Oystein', 'Bruserud, Oyvind', 'Hemsing, Anette Lodvir', 'Mosevoll, Knut Anders', 'Reikvam, Hakon']","['Hansen BA', 'Wendelbo O', 'Bruserud O', 'Hemsing AL', 'Mosevoll KA', 'Reikvam H']",,"['Department of Medicine, Haraldsplass Deaconess Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'VID Specialized University, Faculty of Health, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Cardiology, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive care, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200101,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bacteremia', '*Chemotherapy', '*Infectious disease', '*Leukemia', '*Sepsis', '*Stem cell transplantation']",2020/01/15 06:00,2020/01/15 06:01,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2019/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2020.009 [doi]', 'mjhid-12-1-e2020009 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2020 Jan 1;12(1):e2020009. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2020.009. eCollection 2020.,PMC6951355,['Competing interests: The authors declare no conflict of Interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relation between TET2 acquisition and CML transformation and/or imatinib resistance is needed to be investigated.2. Aim: To evaluate Ten Eleven Translocation 2 gene (TET2) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs2454206, rs34402524, rs61744960) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in relation to the disease prognostic criteria. Materials & Method: The study included 84 subjects; 54 CML in chronic phase and 30 healthy subjects as control group matched for age and sex. Routine investigations, including CBC, bone marrow aspiration, biochemical investigations, and molecular study, were performed in CML patients to identify the disease stage. DNA extraction and SNP assay for TET2 gene polymorphism were done using (Thermo-Fisher predesigned SNP, USA) PCR prism 7500. Results: The mean age was 45.98+/-15.7 yrs in CML patients and 39.3+/-6.587 yrs in the control group (p>0.05). TET2 SNP rs 34402524 was either heterozygous or homozygous in CML (48%, 46.2% respectively) but was mainly homozygous among control (80%) group (p=0.012). TET2 SNP rs 2454206 wild type within CML was detected in 65.4% of patients and in controls was 63.3% (p=0.046). TET2 SNP rs 61744960 showed a homozygous pattern among all groups (CML and control) (p=0.528). TET2 SNP in CML cases did not alter the prognostic criteria as no statistical significance was noted (p>0.05) yet, it was significantly related to spleen size in rs 34402524 where the homozygous group had larger spleen size and higher BCR-ABL1 levels six months after starting TKIs (p<0.05).

Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, DAC), as a hypomethylating agent (HMA), and chidamide (CS055), as a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), each demonstrate effects against leukemia. However, whether the combination of low-dose DAC with chidamide constitutes an effective epigenetic regimen for the treatment of myeloid leukemia is currently unknown. In this study, the combination of DAC at low doses and chidamide showed enhanced inhibition of myeloid leukemia cell (K562, THP-1) growth. As a novel HDACi, chidamide increased the level of ace-H3K18 expression. Combined use of low-dose DAC and chidamide arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase by upregulating p21 expression, and the combination also suppressed PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Furthermore, chidamide enhanced the apoptotic effect of DAC by downregulating expression of Bcl-2 and pro-caspase-3 and upregulating that of Bax, cleaved PARP-1, and caspase-9. Moreover, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential was significantly decreased in DAC-, chidamide-, or combination-treated leukemia cells. These results suggest that targeting the leukemia epigenome through the combination of low-dose DAC and chidamide is a promising approach.","['Xu, Fangfang', 'Guo, Honggang', 'Shi, Mingyue', 'Liu, Siwei', 'Wei, Min', 'Sun, Kai', 'Chen, Yuqing']","['Xu F', 'Guo H', 'Shi M', 'Liu S', 'Wei M', 'Sun K', 'Chen Y']",,"[""Department of Research and Discipline Development, Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Zhengzhou University People's Hospital Zhengzhou 450003, PR China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Zhengzhou University People's Hospital Zhengzhou 450003, PR China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Zhengzhou University People's Hospital Zhengzhou 450003, PR China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Zhengzhou University People's Hospital Zhengzhou 450003, PR China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Zhengzhou University People's Hospital Zhengzhou 450003, PR China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Zhengzhou University People's Hospital Zhengzhou 450003, PR China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Zhengzhou University People's Hospital Zhengzhou 450003, PR China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191215,United States,Am J Transl Res,American journal of translational research,101493030,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Decitabine', 'apoptosis', 'chidamide', 'myeloid leukemia cells']",2020/01/15 06:00,2020/01/15 06:01,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2019/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/15 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Transl Res. 2019 Dec 15;11(12):7644-7655. eCollection 2019.,PMC6943475,['None.'],,,['AJTR Copyright (c) 2019.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effects of cysteamine (Cys), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and Y27632 on guinea pig oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM). Cumulus-oocyte complexes were collected from antral follicles and classified into three different types before IVM. Among type I oocytes, maturation rates to metaphase II (MII) were similar in basal maturation medium and medium supplemented with Cys or LIF (39.5-40.9%), but combined Cys and LIF treatment increased the MII rate to 61.8%. Supplementation with Y27632 alone or in combination with Cys and LIF dramatically reduced the MII rate (27.7-29.7%). Similar trends were observed for type II oocytes, although their overall MII rate was lower than that of type I oocytes. The MII rate was higher among oocytes collected from 2-month-old guinea pigs compared with those from 4-month-old guinea pigs (56.5 vs. 44.8%). The optimal IVM duration was 24 h (52.5%), as 36 or 48 h of IVM reduced the MII rate (32.8-42.5%). Furthermore, Y27632 reduced the presence of microfilaments in oocytes. These findings indicate that combined supplementation of maturation medium with Cys and LIF, but not Y27632, improves the maturation efficiency of guinea pig oocytes. This study provides an important scientific basis for further efforts toward guinea pig in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene editing by establishing an animal model for human reproduction and related diseases.","['Wang, Jiqiang', 'Liu, Zhihui', 'Sun, Qianru', 'Xia, Shuang', 'Cui, Jing', 'Yang, Lan', 'An, Liyou', 'Zhang, Jiaxin', 'Su, Lei', 'Su, Youqiang', 'Du, Fuliang']","['Wang J', 'Liu Z', 'Sun Q', 'Xia S', 'Cui J', 'Yang L', 'An L', 'Zhang J', 'Su L', 'Su Y', 'Du F']",,"['Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Molecular and Medical Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University Nanjing 210046, P.

Initial clinical examination showed ascites of average abundance and hepatosplenomegaly; paraclinical examination objectified hepatocellular failure with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis of T-LGL was retained based on cytological and immunophenotypic study of bone marrow blood as well as on the detection of TCR rearrangement using molecular test. The patient received cyclophosphamide associated with symptomatic treatment. The patient died within three months of the diagnosis due to septic shock with cachexia. T-LGL often has an indolent behavior and initial clinical status at diagnosis is generally moderate, with progressive onset but that was not so for our patient.

Over the past two decades, 87 patients were seen for CLL (20% of patients with hematological malignancies) with an annual prevalence of 4.35 new cases. The average age of patients was 61 +/- 12,48 years (ranging from 17-85 years); 55 women and 32 men (sex ratio M/F 0.58) were enrolled. Clinically, 16 patients (18%) had no tumor syndrome, 33 patients (38%) had lymphadenopathy, 62 patients (71%) splenomegaly and 23 patients (26%) hepatomegaly. Biologically, the mean blood and medullary lymphocyte count was 87188/mm(3) (ranging from 7000-481780/mm(3)) and 75.75% +/- 12,88 (ranging from 44,5-96,5%) respectively; 65 patients (75%) had haemoglobin less than 10g/dl and 20 patients (23%) had platelet count below 100000/mm(3). At the time of diagnosis, 67 patients (77%) had Binet stage C, 7 patients (8%) stage B and 13 patients (15%) stage A. The study of biological prognostics factors showed that 66% of cases had beta2-microglobulin level higher than normal and 95% of cases had LDH higher than normal. CLL is a reality in Togo with a predominance of women and an average age of 61 years.

MLAA-34 is a newly identified monocytic leukemia-associated antigen. Downregulation of MLAA-34 expression significantly suppressed the proliferation of U937 cells in vitro and increased the spontaneous apoptosis of leukemia.

The results demonstrated that serum miR-203 expression was significantly reduced in AML patients compared with healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis revealed miR-203 could distinguish AML cases from normal controls. Low serum miR-203 levels were associated with worse clinical features, as well as poorer overall survival and relapse free survival of AML patients. Moreover, multivariate analysis confirmed low serum miR-203 expression to be an independent unfavorable prognostic predictor for AML. The bioinformatics analysis showed that the downstream genes and pathways of miR-203 was closely associated with tumorigenesis. Downregulation of miR-203 in AML cell lines upregulated the expression levels of oncogenic promoters such as CREB1, SRC and HDAC1.

METHODS: Two hundred twenty-eight CML patients were included and peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells were collected for B7-H6 mRNA expression analyses by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The expression of B7-H6 mRNA was successfully detected in all PB and BM samples. According to the clinical characteristics of CML patients, no difference was found in the B7-H6 level of PBMCs. However, a significantly decreased B7-H6 level was noted in BM samples from CML with BCR-ABL1/ABL > 0.1% (10 copies of BCR-ABL1/10000 copies of ABL) compared to </= 0.1% (P < 0.0001), and a negative correlation was found between the expression level of B7-H6 in BM and the number of BCR-ABL1/ABL transcripts (r = -0.26, P = 0.0057).

METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and special staining were used. RESULTS: Multinucleated giant cells and polymorphism were scattered visibly in 53.8% and 76.9% of the cases and spotty necrosis and hemorrhage were observed in 38% of the cases. Capsular micro-invasion was detected in 46% cases accompanied by hemorrhage and/or necrosis in the tumors with diameters larger than 5 cm. It was also found that 100% of cases diffusely expressed SMA, Melan-A, and vimentin except one negative for HMB-45. The tumor cells partly expressed CD56, CD99, desmin, and S-100 and were negative for CK-pan, TFE3, CD117, CD44, and CD34. Clinical follow-up found that 22 out of 23 patients were alive, with no recurrence or progression, ranging from 42 to 82 months. However, one patient died from leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the histopathologic features with the co-expressions of SMA and melanin, were the diagnostic basis of PEComas. The interspersed expressions of desmin and S-100 were helpful for the differential diagnosis of leiomyoma and neuroma. The expressions of S-100, CD56, and CD99 supported the origins of the pluripotent cells from the neural crests. Tumors larger than 5 cm in diameter with micro-hemorrhaging/necrosis and micro-capsular invasions should be considered either uncertain or of malignant potential. The spontaneous rupturing of blood vessels may be related to the amyloidosis and desmin negative expression, and broken elastic fibers.","['Bao, Luri', 'Shi, Yingxu', 'Zhong, Jinlong', 'Zhao, Meirong', 'Wu, Jing', 'Hai, Ling', 'Xu, Xiaoyan', 'Du, Hua', 'Shi, Yonghong']","['Bao L', 'Shi Y', 'Zhong J', 'Zhao M', 'Wu J', 'Hai L', 'Xu X', 'Du H', 'Shi Y']",,"['Department of Pathology, Affiliated Hospital & Basic Medical College, Inner Mongolia Medical University Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, PR China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Center, Affiliated Hospital Inner Mongolia Medical University Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, PR China.', 'Department of Pathology, Affiliated Hospital Inner Mongolia Medical University Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, PR China.', 'Department of Pathology, Affiliated Hospital & Basic Medical College, Inner Mongolia Medical University Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, PR China.', 'Department of Pathology, Affiliated Hospital Inner Mongolia Medical University Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, PR China.', 'Department of Pathology, Affiliated Hospital & Basic Medical College, Inner Mongolia Medical University Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, PR China.', 'Department of Pathology, Affiliated Hospital & Basic Medical College, Inner Mongolia Medical University Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, PR China.', 'Department of Pathology, Affiliated Hospital & Basic Medical College, Inner Mongolia Medical University Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, PR China.', 'Department of Pathology, Affiliated Hospital & Basic Medical College, Inner Mongolia Medical University Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191201,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['PEComa', 'angiomyolipoma', 'immunohistochemistry']",2020/01/15 06:00,2020/01/15 06:01,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2019/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/15 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2019 Dec 1;12(12):4380-4389. eCollection 2019.,PMC6949869,['None.'],,,['IJCEP Copyright (c) 2019.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, data describing the safety and efficacy of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) specifically in older patients with cancer are lacking. Advanced age may have a significant impact on drug pharmacology, but data on PKI safety in older patients remain poorly described in ""real life"". OBJECTIVES: We performed an observational study describing adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to PKIs and compared the results for younger and older (aged >/= 75 years) patients. METHODS: We extracted all notifications considered to be related to PKIs from our regional pharmacovigilance database between March 2003 and November 2015. Information about patients, drug exposure, and ADRs were captured. After a descriptive analysis of ADRs, we compared their characteristics between older and younger patients. RESULTS: In total, 214 patients experienced 320 ADRs related to PKIs. Slightly over half the patients were male (57%). The mean age was 64.1 years (range 15-90), and 52 (24.3%) patients were aged >/= 75 years. Cutaneous reactions were the most frequently reported ADRs (22.9%), followed by gastrointestinal (16.8%) and respiratory (12.1%) ADRs. The most often involved PKIs were imatinib [54 patients (25.2%)], dasatinib [25 (11.7%)], sunitinib [25 (11.7%)], erlotinib [25 (11.7%)], and sorafenib [24 (11.2%)], followed by vemurafenib [17 (7.9%)] and everolimus and nilotinib, with 11 patients (5.1%) each. These drugs were administered mostly for three therapeutic indications: chronic myeloid leukemia [56 patients (26.2%)], malignant urinary tract cancer [31 (14.5%)], and bronchial cancer [27 (12.6%)]. Comparison of PKI-related ADRs between older and younger patients showed no significant difference, except for the mean number of coadministered drugs (5.3 vs. 4.2; p = 0.03) and the proportion of vascular ADRs (17.3 vs. 4.3%; p = 0.005), mainly arterial hypertension, which were both significantly more frequent in the older group. CONCLUSIONS: Our work showed that PKI-related ADRs in older patients were similar to those in younger adults, except for vascular ADRs, which were significantly more frequent in the older population. Our results require confirmation by larger studies but could lead physicians to be more vigilant about cardiovascular comorbidities during initiation of PKIs in elderly people.","['Clapes, Vincent', 'Rousseau, Vanessa', 'Despas, Fabien', 'Montastruc, Jean-Louis', 'Olivier, Pascale']","['Clapes V', 'Rousseau V', 'Despas F', 'Montastruc JL', 'Olivier P']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1801-9581'],"[""Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Centre de PharmacoVigilance, de Pharmacoepidemiologie et d'Informations sur le Medicament, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire et Faculte de Medecine de Toulouse, 37 allees Jules Guesde, 31000, Toulouse, France."", ""Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Centre de PharmacoVigilance, de Pharmacoepidemiologie et d'Informations sur le Medicament, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire et Faculte de Medecine de Toulouse, 37 allees Jules Guesde, 31000, Toulouse, France."", ""Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Centre de PharmacoVigilance, de Pharmacoepidemiologie et d'Informations sur le Medicament, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire et Faculte de Medecine de Toulouse, 37 allees Jules Guesde, 31000, Toulouse, France."", 'Faculte de Medecine, INSERM, UMR 1027, CIC INSERM 1436, Universite de Toulouse, 31000, Toulouse, France.', ""Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Centre de PharmacoVigilance, de Pharmacoepidemiologie et d'Informations sur le Medicament, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire et Faculte de Medecine de Toulouse, 37 allees Jules Guesde, 31000, Toulouse, France."", 'Faculte de Medecine, INSERM, UMR 1027, CIC INSERM 1436, Universite de Toulouse, 31000, Toulouse, France.', ""Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Centre de PharmacoVigilance, de Pharmacoepidemiologie et d'Informations sur le Medicament, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire et Faculte de Medecine de Toulouse, 37 allees Jules Guesde, 31000, Toulouse, France. pascale.olivier@univ-tlse3.fr.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,New Zealand,Pharmaceut Med,Pharmaceutical medicine,101471195,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'France', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Pharmacovigilance', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/15 06:00,2020/04/29 06:00,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s40290-018-0259-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s40290-018-0259-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmaceut Med. 2019 Feb;33(1):21-27. doi: 10.1007/s40290-018-0259-1.,,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, there is a demand for alternative and target-specific drugs to improve the 5-year survival rate. Current treatment mainstays include chemotherapy, or mutation-specific targeting molecules including FLT3 inhibitors, IDH inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies. Efforts to devise new, targeted therapy have included recent advances in methods for high-throughput genomic screening and the availability of computer-assisted techniques for the design of novel agents predicted to specifically inhibit mutant molecules involved in leukemogenesis. Crosstalk between the leukemia cells and the bone marrow microenvironment through cell surface molecules, such as the integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5, might influence drug response and AML progression. This review article focuses on current AML treatment options, new AML targeted therapies, the role of integrins in AML progression, and a potential therapeutic agent-integrin alphavbeta3 antagonist.","['Sami, Shaheedul A', 'Darwish, Noureldien H E', 'Barile, Amanda N M', 'Mousa, Shaker A']","['Sami SA', 'Darwish NHE', 'Barile ANM', 'Mousa SA']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9294-015X'],"['Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, 1 Discovery Drive, Rensselaer, NY, USA.', 'Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, 1 Discovery Drive, Rensselaer, NY, USA.', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, 1 Discovery Drive, Rensselaer, NY, USA.', 'Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, 1 Discovery Drive, Rensselaer, NY, USA. shaker.mousa@acphs.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200113,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,IM,,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*etiology/mortality/*therapy', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Standard of Care', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell lymphoma gene 2', '*FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3', '*Isocitrate dehydrogenase', '*L-Thyroxine tetraiodothyroacetic acid', '*Nano-diamino-tetrac']",2020/01/15 06:00,2021/06/12 06:00,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11864-019-0694-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-019-0694-6 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2020 Jan 13;21(1):3. doi: 10.1007/s11864-019-0694-6.,,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MicroRNA dysregulation disrupts normal biological processes, resulting in tumorigenesis. Acute myeloid leukemia is an invasive hematological malignancy characterized by the abnormal proliferation and differentiation of immature myeloid cells. Due to the low 5-year survival rate, there is an urgent need to discover novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. In recent years, microRNAs have been shown to play important roles in hematological malignancies by acting as tumor suppressors and oncogenes. MicroRNAs have the potential to be a breakthrough in the diagnosis and treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. In this review, we summarize the biology of microRNAs and discuss the relationships between microRNA dysregulation and acute myeloid leukemia in the following aspects: signaling pathways, the abnormal biological behavior of acute myeloid leukemia cells, the clinical application of microRNAs and competing endogenous RNA regulatory networks.","['Li, Mingyu', 'Cui, Xianglun', 'Guan, Hongzai']","['Li M', 'Cui X', 'Guan H']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8399-739X'],"['Department of Clinical Hematology, Medical College of Qingdao University, 308 Ningxia Road, Qingdao, 266071, China.', 'Department of Inspection, Medical College of Qingdao University, Qingdao, 266071, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Medical College of Qingdao University, 308 Ningxia Road, Qingdao, 266071, China. guanhongzai@qdu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200113,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['Carcinogenesis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Biomarkers', 'Leukemogenesis', 'MicroRNAs', 'Therapeutic targets', 'ceRNA']",2020/01/15 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2019/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-019-03887-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-019-03887-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Mar;99(3):399-412. doi: 10.1007/s00277-019-03887-5.

As a consequence, AML can evolve towards more aggressive subtypes during treatment, which require additional therapies to prevent future relapse. As we have previously detected double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), in this current study we attempted to evaluate the potential diagnostic applications of AML EV-dsDNA derived from primary bone marrow and peripheral blood plasma samples. EVs from plasma of 29 pediatric AML patients (at initial diagnosis or during treatment) were isolated by ultracentrifugation, after which dsDNA was extracted from obtained EVs and analyzed for leukemia-specific mutations using next generation sequencing (NGS) and GeneScan-based fragment-length analysis. In 18 out of 20 patients, dsDNA harvested from EVs mirrored the (leukemia-specific) mutations found in the genomic DNA obtained from primary leukemia cells. In the nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), a decrease in EV numbers was observed in patients after treatment compared with initial diagnosis. Following treatment, in 75 samples out of the 79, these mutations were no longer detectable in EV-dsDNA. In light of our results, we propose the use of leukemia-derived EV-dsDNA as an additional measure for mutational status and, potentially, treatment response in pediatric AML.","['Kontopoulou, Evangelia', 'Strachan, Sarah', 'Reinhardt, Katarina', 'Kunz, Fabienne', 'Walter, Christiane', 'Walkenfort, Bernd', 'Jastrow, Holger', 'Hasenberg, Mike', 'Giebel, Bernd', 'von Neuhoff, Nils', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Thakur, Basant Kumar']","['Kontopoulou E', 'Strachan S', 'Reinhardt K', 'Kunz F', 'Walter C', 'Walkenfort B', 'Jastrow H', 'Hasenberg M', 'Giebel B', 'von Neuhoff N', 'Reinhardt D', 'Thakur BK']",,"[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, University Hospital of Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, University Hospital of Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, University Hospital of Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, University Hospital of Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, University Hospital of Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany."", 'Imaging Centre Essen, Electron Microscopy Unit, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Anatomy, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Imaging Centre Essen, Electron Microscopy Unit, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, University Hospital of Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, University Hospital of Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, University Hospital of Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany. basant-kumar.thakur@uk-essen.de.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20200113,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,['Ann Hematol. 2021 May;100(5):1355-1356.

Based on one promising model, information on KIR2DS1 and KIR3DL1 and their cognate ligands can be used to classify donors as KIR-advantageous or KIR-disadvantageous. This study was aimed at externally validating this model in unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation. The impact of the predictor on overall survival (OS) and relapse incidence was tested in a Cox regression model adjusted for patient age, a modified disease risk index, Karnofsky performance status, donor age, HLA match, sex match, cytomegalovirus match, conditioning intensity, type of T-cell depletion, and graft type. Data from 2222 patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome were analyzed. KIR genes were typed by using high-resolution amplicon-based next-generation sequencing. In univariable analyses and subgroup analyses, OS and the cumulative incidence of relapse of patients with a KIR-advantageous donor were comparable to patients with a KIR-disadvantageous donor. The adjusted hazard ratio from the multivariable Cox regression model was 0.99 (Wald test, P = .93) for OS and 1.04 (Wald test, P = .78) for relapse incidence. We also tested the impact of activating donor KIR2DS1 and inhibition by KIR3DL1 separately but found no significant impact on OS and the risk of relapse. Thus, our study shows that the proposed model does not universally predict NK-mediated disease control. Deeper knowledge of NK-mediated alloreactivity is necessary to predict its contribution to graft-versus-leukemia reactions and to eventually use KIR genotype information for donor selection.","['Schetelig, Johannes', 'Baldauf, Henning', 'Heidenreich, Falk', 'Massalski, Carolin', 'Frank, Sandra', 'Sauter, Jurgen', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Ayuk, Francis Ayuketang', 'Bethge, Wolfgang A', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Klein, Stefan', 'Wendler, Sarah', 'Lange, Vinzenz', 'de Wreede, Liesbeth C', 'Furst, Daniel', 'Kobbe, Guido', 'Ottinger, Hellmut D', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Mytilineos, Joannis', 'Fleischhauer, Katharina', 'Schmidt, Alexander H', 'Bornhauser, Martin']","['Schetelig J', 'Baldauf H', 'Heidenreich F', 'Massalski C', 'Frank S', 'Sauter J', 'Stelljes M', 'Ayuk FA', 'Bethge WA', 'Bug G', 'Klein S', 'Wendler S', 'Lange V', 'de Wreede LC', 'Furst D', 'Kobbe G', 'Ottinger HD', 'Beelen DW', 'Mytilineos J', 'Fleischhauer K', 'Schmidt AH', 'Bornhauser M']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'DKMS gemeinnutzige GmbH, Tubingen, Germany.', 'DKMS gemeinnutzige GmbH, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'DKMS gemeinnutzige GmbH, Tubingen, Germany.', 'DKMS Life Science Laboratory, Dresden, Germany.', 'Deutsches Register fur Stammzelltransplantationen e.V., Ulm, Germany.', 'DKMS gemeinnutzige GmbH, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Universitatsklinikum Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Universitatsklinikum Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Universitatsklinikum Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Universitatsklinikum Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Universitatsmedizin Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'DKMS gemeinnutzige GmbH, Tubingen, Germany.', 'DKMS Life Science Laboratory, Dresden, Germany.', 'Leiden University Medical Center, Department of Biomedical Data Sciences, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Institute for Clinical Transfusion Medicine and Immunogenetics Ulm, German Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Baden Wuerttemberg-Hessen and University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'University Hospital Dusseldorf, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany; and.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, and.', 'Institute for Clinical Transfusion Medicine and Immunogenetics Ulm, German Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Baden Wuerttemberg-Hessen and University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cellular Therapy, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'DKMS gemeinnutzige GmbH, Tubingen, Germany.', 'DKMS Life Science Laboratory, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Donor Selection', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics', 'Receptors, KIR3DL1/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', '*Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/15 06:00,2020/10/29 06:00,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2019/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)62101-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019002887 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Apr 16;135(16):1386-1395. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019002887.,PMC7162689,,,"['0 (KIR2DS1 protein, human)', '0 (KIR3DL1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '0 (Receptors, KIR3DL1)']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed 81 patients receiving these venetoclax-based combinations to identify molecular correlates of durable remission, response followed by relapse (adaptive resistance), or refractory disease (primary resistance). High response rates and durable remissions were typically associated with NPM1 or IDH2 mutations, with prolonged molecular remissions prevalent for NPM1 mutations. Primary and adaptive resistance to venetoclax-based combinations was most commonly characterized by acquisition or enrichment of clones activating signaling pathways such as FLT3 or RAS or biallelically perturbing TP53. Single-cell studies highlighted the polyclonal nature of intratumoral resistance mechanisms in some cases. Among cases that were primary refractory, we identified heterogeneous and sometimes divergent interval changes in leukemic clones within a single cycle of therapy, highlighting the dynamic and rapid occurrence of therapeutic selection in AML. In functional studies, FLT3 internal tandem duplication gain or TP53 loss conferred cross-resistance to both venetoclax and cytotoxic-based therapies. Collectively, we highlight molecular determinants of outcome with clinical relevance to patients with AML receiving venetoclax-based combination therapies.","['DiNardo, C D', 'Tiong, I S', 'Quaglieri, A', 'MacRaild, S', 'Loghavi, S', 'Brown, F C', 'Thijssen, R', 'Pomilio, G', 'Ivey, A', 'Salmon, J M', 'Glytsou, C', 'Fleming, S A', 'Zhang, Q', 'Ma, H', 'Patel, K P', 'Kornblau, S M', 'Xu, Z', 'Chua, C C', 'Chen, Xufeng', 'Blombery, P', 'Flensburg, C', 'Cummings, N', 'Aifantis, I', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Huang, D C S', 'Roberts, A W', 'Majewski, I J', 'Konopleva, M', 'Wei, A H']","['DiNardo CD', 'Tiong IS', 'Quaglieri A', 'MacRaild S', 'Loghavi S', 'Brown FC', 'Thijssen R', 'Pomilio G', 'Ivey A', 'Salmon JM', 'Glytsou C', 'Fleming SA', 'Zhang Q', 'Ma H', 'Patel KP', 'Kornblau SM', 'Xu Z', 'Chua CC', 'Chen X', 'Blombery P', 'Flensburg C', 'Cummings N', 'Aifantis I', 'Kantarjian H', 'Huang DCS', 'Roberts AW', 'Majewski IJ', 'Konopleva M', 'Wei AH']",,"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology and.', 'Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology and.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology and Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY.', 'Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology and.', 'Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology and Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; and.', 'Department of Haematology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology and.', 'Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology and Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology and.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology and.', 'Department of Haematology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology and.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,['Blood. 2020 Mar 12;135(11):781-782.

In this study, these 2 epigenetic mutations cooperated to induce leukemia. Leukemia-initiating cells from Dnmt3a-/- mice that express an IDH2 neomorphic mutant have a megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor-like immunophenotype, activate a stem-cell-like gene signature, and repress differentiated progenitor genes. We observed an epigenomic dysregulation with the gain of repressive H3K9 trimethylation and loss of H3K9 acetylation in diseased mouse bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). HDAC inhibitors rapidly reversed the H3K9 methylation/acetylation imbalance in diseased mouse HSPCs while reducing the leukemia burden. In addition, using targeted metabolomic profiling for the first time in mouse leukemia models, we also showed that prostaglandin E2 is overproduced in double-mutant HSPCs, rendering them sensitive to prostaglandin synthesis inhibition. These data revealed that Dnmt3a and Idh2 mutations are synergistic events in leukemogenesis and that HSPCs carrying both mutations are sensitive to induced differentiation by the inhibition of both prostaglandin synthesis and HDAC, which may reveal new therapeutic opportunities for patients carrying IDH1/2 mutations.","['Zhang, Xiaotian', 'Wang, Xinyu', 'Wang, Xue Qing David', 'Su, Jianzhong', 'Putluri, Nagireddy', 'Zhou, Ting', 'Qu, Ying', 'Jeong, Mira', 'Guzman, Anna', 'Rosas, Carina', 'Huang, Yun', 'Sreekumar, Arun', 'Li, Wei', 'Goodell, Margaret A']","['Zhang X', 'Wang X', 'Wang XQD', 'Su J', 'Putluri N', 'Zhou T', 'Qu Y', 'Jeong M', 'Guzman A', 'Rosas C', 'Huang Y', 'Sreekumar A', 'Li W', 'Goodell MA']",,"['Center for Epigenetics, Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics and.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Institute of Biomedical Big Data, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Center for Epigenetics, Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI.', 'Institute of Biomedical Big Data, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Dan L.

Multiple studies have identified the presence of measurable residual disease (MRD) assessed by flow cytometry before alloSCT as a strong predictor of relapse, but it is not clear how these findings apply to patients who test positive in molecular MRD assays, which have far greater sensitivity. We analyzed pretransplant blood and bone marrow samples by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in 107 patients with NPM1-mutant AML enrolled in the UK National Cancer Research Institute AML17 study. After a median follow-up of 4.9 years, patients with negative, low (<200 copies per 105ABL in the peripheral blood and <1000 copies in the bone marrow aspirate), and high levels of MRD had an estimated 2-year overall survival (2y-OS) of 83%, 63%, and 13%, respectively (P < .0001). Focusing on patients with low-level MRD before alloSCT, those with FLT3 internal tandem duplications(ITDs) had significantly poorer outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 6.14; P = .01). Combining these variables was highly prognostic, dividing patients into 2 groups with 2y-OS of 17% and 82% (HR, 13.2; P < .0001). T-depletion was associated with significantly reduced survival both in the entire cohort (2y-OS, 56% vs 96%; HR, 3.24; P = .0005) and in MRD-positive patients (2y-OS, 34% vs 100%; HR, 3.78; P = .003), but there was no significant effect of either conditioning regimen or donor source on outcome.

Between 2015 and 2018, 252 patients underwent allo-HCT; 41 patients underwent allo-HCT in the at-home program (46% myeloablative; 63% unrelated donor; 32% posttransplant cyclophosphamide), and these patients were compared with 39 in-patients; safety, capacity to release beds for other programs, and economic efficiency cost were evaluated. We observed a lower incidence of febrile neutropenia in the at-home group compared with that in the in-patient group (32% versus 90%; p < 0.0001), whereas the incidence of aspergillosis was similar among groups (at-home 1% versus in-patient 3%; p = 0.5). The at-home patients showed a lower incidence of 1-year severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; 10% versus 29%; p = 0.03). There were no differences in 1-year transplant-related mortality, relapse, or overall survival among groups. The re-admission rate in the at-home group was 7%. The at-home setting was less expensive (9087 euro/transplant), and its implementation increased capacity by 10.5 allo-HCTs/year. Moreover, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell program could be established without increasing beds. Thus, our at-home allo-HCT program may be a safe modality to reduce febrile neutropenia and acute GVHD, resulting in lower re-admission rates.","['Gutierrez-Garcia, Gonzalo', 'Rovira, Montserrat',

Identification of clinically relevant sncRNA signatures could, therefore, be of tremendous translational value. In the present study, genome-wide small RNA sequencing identified a unique pattern of differential regulation of eight miRs in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Among these, three were up-regulated (miR-1295a, miR-155, miR-4524a) and five were down-regulated (miR-30a, miR-423, miR-486*, let-7e, and miR-744) in CLL. Altered expression of all these eight differentially expressed miRs (DEMs) was validated by RQ-PCR. Besides, seven novel sequences identified to have elevated expression levels in CLL turned out to be transfer RNA (tRNA)/piRNAs (piRNA-30799, piRNA-36225)/snoRNA (SNORD43) related. Multivariate analysis showed that miR-4524a (HR: 1.916, 95% CI: 1.080-3.4, p value: 0.026) and miR-744 (HR: 0.415, 95% CI: 0.224-0.769, p value: 0.005) were significantly associated with risk and time to first treatment. Further investigations could help establish the scope of integration of these DEM markers into risk stratification designs and prognostication approaches for CLL.","['Kaur, Gurvinder', 'Ruhela, Vivek', 'Rani, Lata', 'Gupta, Anubha', 'Sriram, Krishnamachari', 'Gogia, Ajay', 'Sharma, Atul', 'Kumar, Lalit', 'Gupta, Ritu']","['Kaur G', 'Ruhela V', 'Rani L', 'Gupta A', 'Sriram K', 'Gogia A', 'Sharma A', 'Kumar L', 'Gupta R']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1319-7012', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4652-2376', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7752-1926', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0362-0956', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5364-4086']","['Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Computational Biology, Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology-Delhi (IIIT-D), Delhi, India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'SBILab, Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology-Delhi (IIIT-D), Delhi, India. anubha@iiitd.ac.in.', 'Department of Computational Biology, Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology-Delhi (IIIT-D), Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. drritugupta@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200113,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,IM,,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA-Seq/*methods']",,,2020/01/15 06:00,2020/09/25 06:00,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2019/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-019-0272-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-019-0272-y [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2020 Jan 13;10(1):6. doi: 10.1038/s41408-019-0272-y.,PMC6957689,,,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As conventional karyotypic and molecular cloning techniques evolved in the 1970s and 1980s, multiple cytogenetic aberrations were identified in lymphomas, often balanced translocations that juxtaposed oncogenes to the immunoglobulin (IG) or T-cell receptor (TR) loci, leading to dysregulation. However, genetic characterization and classification of lymphoma by conventional cytogenetic methods is limited by the infrequent occurrence of recurrent karyotypic abnormalities in many lymphoma subtypes and by the frequent difficulty in growing clinical lymphoma specimens in culture to obtain informative karyotypes. As higher-resolution genomic techniques developed, such as array comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization, many recurrent copy number changes were identified in lymphomas, and copy number assessment of interphase cells became part of routine clinical practice for a subset of diseases. Platforms to globally examine mRNA expression led to major insights into the biology of several lymphomas, although these techniques have not gained widespread application in routine clinical settings. With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques in the early 2000s, numerous insights into the genetic landscape of lymphomas were obtained. In contrast to the myeloid malignancies, most common lymphomas exhibit an at least somewhat mutationally complex genome, with few single driver mutations in the majority of patients. However, many recurrently mutated pathways have been identified across lymphoma subtypes, informing targeted therapeutic approaches that are beginning to make meaningful changes in the treatment of lymphoma. In addition to the ability to identify possible therapeutic targets, NGS techniques are highly amenable to the tracking of residual lymphoma following therapy, because of the presence of unique genetic ""fingerprints"" in lymphoma cells due to V(D)-J recombination at the antigen receptor loci. This review will provide an overview of the impact of novel genetic technologies on lymphoma classification, biology, and therapy.","['Bailey, Nathanael G', 'Elenitoba-Johnson, Kojo S J']","['Bailey NG', 'Elenitoba-Johnson KSJ']",,"['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201102,United States,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med,Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine,101571139,IM,,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification/*genetics/therapy', 'Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/therapy', 'Mutation']",,,2020/01/15 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2022/11/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['cshperspect.a035444 [pii]', '10.1101/cshperspect.a035444 [doi]']",epublish,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med. 2020 Nov 2;10(11). pii: cshperspect.a035444. doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a035444.,PMC7605231,,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,['2022/11/01 00:00'],

LPL has been associated with host genetics, mainly with the BoLA class II DRB3 gene. The aim of this work was to study the kinetics of BLV and the host response in Holstein calves carrying different BoLA-DRB3 alleles. Twenty BLV-free calves were inoculated with infected lymphocytes. Two calves were maintained uninfected as controls. Proviral load, total leukocyte and lymphocyte counts, anti-BLVgp51 titres and BLVp24 expression levels were determined in blood samples at various times post-inoculation. The viral load peaked at 30 days post-inoculation (dpi) in all animals. The viral load decreased steadily from seroconversion (38 dpi) to the end of the study (178 dpi) in calves carrying a resistance-associated allele (*0902), while it was maintained at elevated levels in calves with *1501 or neutral alleles after seroconversion. Leukocyte and lymphocyte counts and BLVp24 expression did not significantly differ between genetic groups. Animals with < 20 proviral copies/30 ng of DNA at 178 dpi or < 200 proviral copies at 88 dpi were classified as LPL, while calves with levels above these limits were considered to have high proviral load (HPL) profiles. All six calves with the *1501 allele progressed to HPL, while LPL was attained by 6/7 (86%) and 2/6 (33%) of the calves with the *0902 and neutral alleles, respectively. One calf with both *0902 and *1501 developed LPL.

Pim-1 is known to play a crucial role in cell cycle progression and acts as downstream target for the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Recently it has emerged as a hopeful therapeutic target for cancer treatment as deregulation or over expression of pim causes hematologic cancers. In present article molecular docking based three dimensional quantitative structure and activity relationship and molecular dynamics simulation studies have been carried out on indole derivatives reported as pim-1 inhibitors. Initially docking was carried out to obtain the receptor specific orientation of the molecules and later to understand the structural requirements of pim-1 inhibitors robust 3 D QSAR models were built using CoMFA (comparative molecular field analysis) and CoMSIA (comparative molecular similarity indices analysis) methods. The reliability of the models was established from conventional (r(2)) and cross validated (q(2)) values of 0.982, 0.524 for CoMFA and 0.974, 0.586 for CoMSIA respectively. Further the predictive ability of the model was evaluated using a test set of 17 molecules. The docking studies revealed that interaction with Glu 121 is vital for binding of inhibitors to pim-1. Based on the outcome of the results new molecules with improved activity were designed. Furthermore, MD simulations were also performed to examine the stability of interactions and investigate the pivotal role of Glu 121.","['Peddi, Sudhir Reddy', 'Peddi, Saikiran Reddy', 'Sivan, Sreekanth', 'Veerati, Radhika', 'Manga, Vijjulatha']","['Peddi SR', 'Peddi SR', 'Sivan S', 'Veerati R', 'Manga V']",,"['Molecular Modeling and Medicinal Chemistry Group, Department of Chemistry, University College of Science, Osmania University, Hyderabad, India.', 'Molecular Modeling and Medicinal Chemistry Group, Department of Chemistry, University College of Science, Osmania University, Hyderabad, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, Nizam College, Osmania University, Hyderabad.', 'Department of Chemistry, S R Engineering College, Ananthasagar, India.', 'Molecular Modeling and Medicinal Chemistry Group, Department of Chemistry, University College of Science, Osmania University, Hyderabad, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200113,England,J Recept Signal Transduct Res,Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,9509432,IM,,"['*Drug Design', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Indoles/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Ligands', '*Molecular Docking Simulation', '*Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Static Electricity']",['NOTNLM'],"['CoMFA', 'CoMSIA', 'Pim-1', 'indole derivatives', 'molecular dynamics simulations']",2020/01/15 06:00,2020/11/05 06:00,['2020/01/15 06:00'],"['2020/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10799893.2020.1713809 [doi]'],ppublish,J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2020 Feb;40(1):1-14. doi: 10.1080/10799893.2020.1713809.

However, emergence of the T315I mutation has been found to be a main cause of failure after dasatinib-containing treatments. We assessed the prognostic value of small clones with the T315I mutation at specific time points using the novel technology digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is more sensitive than direct sequencing. This study included 25 consecutive adult patients with Ph+ ALL who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following dasatinib-based chemotherapy at our center. Among six patients who experienced hematologic relapse after HSCT, four harbored the T315I mutation at relapse. However, the detection of small subclones with T315I at either diagnosis or HSCT was not associated with an increased risk of relapse. In contrast, all patients with the T315I mutation at molecular relapse after HSCT (n=4) eventually had a hematologic relapse, and only two of the 10 patients without the T315I mutation at molecular relapse after HSCT relapsed. In conclusion, the detection of small clones with the T315I mutation at molecular relapse after HSCT, but not before HSCT, could support an early clinical decision to change treatments.","['Akahoshi, Yu', 'Nakasone, Hideki', 'Kawamura, Koji', 'Kusuda, Machiko', 'Kawamura, Shunto', 'Takeshita, Junko', 'Yoshino, Nozomu', 'Misaki, Yukiko', 'Yoshimura, Kazuki', 'Gomyo, Ayumi', 'Tanihara, Aki', 'Tamaki, Masaharu', 'Kimura, Shun-Ichi', 'Kako, Shinichi', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu']","['Akahoshi Y', 'Nakasone H', 'Kawamura K', 'Kusuda M', 'Kawamura S', 'Takeshita J', 'Yoshino N', 'Misaki Y', 'Yoshimura K', 'Gomyo A', 'Tanihara A', 'Tamaki M', 'Kimura SI', 'Kako S', 'Kanda Y']",,"['Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.

Thus, we investigated the cytotoxic mechanism of VCR on U937 and HL-60 human leukaemia cell lines. We discovered that VCR treatment resulted in the up-regulation of TNF-alpha expression and activation of the death receptor pathway, which evoked apoptosis of U937 cells. Moreover, VCR induced microtubule destabilization and mitotic arrest. VCR treatment down-regulated SIRT3, and such down-regulation caused mitochondrial ROS to initiate phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. p38 MAPK suppressed MID1-modulated degradation of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) catalytic subunit. The SIRT3-ROS-p38 MAPK-PP2A axis inhibited tristetraprolin (TTP)-controlled TNF-alpha mRNA degradation, consequently, up-regulating TNF-alpha expression. Restoration of SIRT3 and TTP expression, or inhibition of the ROS-p38 MAPK axis increased the survival of VCR-treated cells and repressed TNF-alpha up-regulation. In contrast to suppression of the ROS-p38 MAPK axis, overexpression of SIRT3 modestly inhibited the effect of VCR on microtubule destabilization and mitotic arrest in U937 cells. Apoptosis of HL-60 cells, similarly, went through the same pathway. Collectively, our data indicate that the SIRT3-ROS-p38 MAPK-PP2A-TTP axis modulates TNF-alpha expression, which triggers apoptosis of VCR-treated U937 and HL-60 cells. We also demonstrate that the apoptotic signalling is not affected by VCR-elicited microtubule destabilization.","['Wang, Liang-Jun', 'Chiou, Jing-Ting', 'Lee, Yuan-Chin', 'Huang, Chia-Hui', 'Shi, Yi-Jun', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Wang LJ', 'Chiou JT', 'Lee YC', 'Huang CH', 'Shi YJ', 'Chang LS']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3204-5137'],"['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200113,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Microtubules/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*metabolism', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirtuin 3/*metabolism', 'Tristetraprolin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*PP2Acalpha stabilization', '*SIRT3 degradation', '*TNF-alpha mRNA decay', '*TTP degradation', '*Vincristine']",2020/01/14 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/01/14 06:00'],"['2019/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.14949 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2020 Feb;24(4):2552-2565. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.14949.

METHODS: Macrophage polarization was measured in eutopic endometrium of control participants ('normal endometrium'), eutopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis ('eutopic endometrium') and ectopic endometrium of endometriosis patients ('ectopic endometrium') by immunohistochemical staining. Expression of IL-6 and MCP-1 were measured in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Expression of CD163 was measured in human acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cell-derived macrophages that were treated with conditional medium induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, TNF-alpha + anti-IL-6 or TNF-alpha + anti-MCP-1 via flow cytometry. RESULTS: The ratio of CD163+/CD68+ macrophages in the normal endometrium was higher than that in the eutopic endometrium, while differences between the eutopic and ectopic endometrium were not statistically significant. IL-6 and MCP-1 exhibited enhanced expression in the ectopic endometrium group and decreased expression in the eutopic endometrium group. TNF-alpha could promote the expression of ESC-derived IL-6 and MCP-1. Intervention with TNF-alpha-induced conditioned medium resulted in the upregulation of CD163 in THP-1 cells, while conditional medium induced with IL-6 and MCP-1 neutralizing antibodies decreased the proportion of CD163+ macrophages significantly. CONCLUSION: In endometriosis patients, the macrophages of the eutopic endometrium polarize toward M1 compared with the normal endometrium, and those of the ectopic endometrium were mainly M2-polarized. Under the action of TNF-alpha, ESC-derived IL-6 and MCP-1 could stimulate peritoneal macrophages toward M2-polarization, which could modulate endometriosis.","['Li, Min-Zhen', 'Wu, Ya-Hong', 'Ali, Maria', 'Wu, Xian-Qing', 'Nie, Mei-Fang']","['Li MZ', 'Wu YH', 'Ali M', 'Wu XQ', 'Nie MF']",,"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200112,Australia,J Obstet Gynaecol Res,The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,9612761,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Chemokine CCL2/*metabolism', 'Endometriosis/*immunology', 'Endometrium/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",['NOTNLM'],"['M2 macrophage', 'endometriosis', 'interleukin-6', 'monocyte chemoattractant protein-1', 'tumor necrosis factor-alpha']",2020/01/14 06:00,2020/11/24 06:00,['2020/01/14 06:00'],"['2019/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jog.14135 [doi]'],ppublish,J Obstet Gynaecol Res. 2020 Feb;46(2):293-301. doi: 10.1111/jog.14135.

We next administrated MT-2 cells into 13-month-old marmosets under cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment to promote infection. HTLV-1 infection was determined by measuring HTLV-1 antibody titer in the common marmosets. RESULTS: The HTLV-1 antibody titer increased in the intraperitoneally inoculated marmoset with or without CsA treatment, and it kept over five 5 years though proviral copy number (proviral load, PVL) remained low throughout the study.

Furthermore, betulinic acid (BA), a lupane-type pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin isolated from birch trees, restored IM sensitivity in the BCR-ABL1 kinase-independent, IM-resistant primary cells and in K562R cells, as well as in primary CD34(+) bone marrow cells from CML patients. We found that BA restored IM sensitivity through inhibition of HDAC3 accumulation in cells, and that this was mediated by BA-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of HDAC3. BA at low dosage significantly increased IM antitumor effects on murine xenografts bearing K562R cells and inhibited HDAC3 expression in tumor tissue. Our findings demonstrated that HDAC3 is an essential factor in BCR-ABL1 kinase-independent IM resistance, and that BA in combination with IM may be a novel treatment strategy for overcoming IM resistance in CML.","['Lu, Tingting', 'Wei, Danna', 'Yu, Kunlin', 'Ma, Dan', 'Xiong, Jie', 'Fang, Qin', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Lu T', 'Wei D', 'Yu K', 'Ma D', 'Xiong J', 'Fang Q', 'Wang J']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6998-5969'],"['Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Centre, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China.', 'School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China.', 'Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre and Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centre, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China.', 'Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre and Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centre, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China.', 'Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre and Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centre, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China.', 'Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre and Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centre, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China.', 'Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre and Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centre, Guizhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200113,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentacyclic Triterpenes', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CML', '*HDAC3', '*betulinic acid', '*imatinib', '*ubiquitination']",2020/01/14 06:00,2020/10/07 06:00,['2020/01/14 06:00'],"['2019/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/nyas.14298 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2020 May;1467(1):77-93. doi: 10.1111/nyas.14298.

We present the case of a 55-year-old female who developed cranial nerve symptoms after a 20-year history of HAM/TSP. Although multiple white matter lesions were observed on brain magnetic resonance imaging, no abnormalities were seen on a systemic computed tomography scan. Quantitative flow-cytometric analysis of cell populations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed that most of the infiltrating cells were not inflammatory cells, but HTLV-1-infected CD4(+) CADM-1(+) T-cells completely lacking CD7 expression. As stepwise downregulation of CD7 is correlated with disease progression from HTLV-1 carrier to aggressive ATL, the CSF cells were classified as aggressive ATL; these cells exhibited a more progressed phenotype than those in peripheral blood (PB). HAM/TSP disease activity was estimated to be low. From these and other examinations, we made a diagnosis of acute-type ATL, which unusually developed in the central nervous system at initial onset prior to systemic progression. In ATL cases with a challenging diagnosis, immunophenotypic characterization of CSF and PB is valuable for differential diagnosis and understanding disease status.","['Takeda, Reina', 'Ishigaki, Tomohiro', 'Ohno, Nobuhiro', 'Yokoyama, Kazuaki', 'Kawamata, Toyotaka', 'Fukuyama, Tomofusa', 'Araya, Natsumi', 'Yamano, Yoshihisa', 'Uchimaru, Kaoru', 'Tojo, Arinobu']","['Takeda R', 'Ishigaki T', 'Ohno N', 'Yokoyama K', 'Kawamata T', 'Fukuyama T', 'Araya N', 'Yamano Y', 'Uchimaru K', 'Tojo A']",,"['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan. ishigaki@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Research Hospital, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. ishigaki@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Science, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Research Hospital, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200113,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,,"['Antigens, CD7', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/*cytology/*immunology', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*diagnosis/*immunology/pathology/virology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL)', 'Central nervous system involvement', 'HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP)', 'Multi-color flow cytometry']",2020/01/14 06:00,2020/09/30 06:00,['2020/01/14 06:00'],"['2019/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02815-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02815-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2020 Jun;111(6):891-896. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02815-7.

Importantly, this work has begun to shed light on our mechanistic understanding of the function of BCL-3 in tumour promotion and progression. Here, we summarize the current understanding of BCL-3 function in relation to the characteristics or traits associated with tumourigenesis, termed 'Hallmarks of Cancer'. With the focus on colorectal cancer, a major cause of cancer related mortality in the UK, we describe the evidence that potentially explains why increased BCL-3 expression is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. As well as promoting tumour cell proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis, a key emerging function of this proto-oncogene is the regulation of the tumour response to inflammation. We suggest that BCL-3 represents an exciting new route for targeting the Hallmarks of Cancer; in particular by limiting the impact of the enabling hallmarks of tumour promoting inflammation and cell plasticity. As BCL-3 has been reported to promote the stem-like potential of cancer cells, we suggest that targeting BCL-3 could increase the tumour response to conventional treatment, reduce the chance of relapse and hence improve the prognosis for cancer patients.","['Legge, Danny N', 'Chambers, Adam C', 'Parker, Christopher T', 'Timms, Penny', 'Collard, Tracey J', 'Williams, Ann C']","['Legge DN', 'Chambers AC', 'Parker CT', 'Timms P', 'Collard TJ', 'Williams AC']",,"['Colorectal Tumour Biology Group, School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Life Sciences, Biomedical Sciences Building, University Walk, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'Colorectal Tumour Biology Group, School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Life Sciences, Biomedical Sciences Building, University Walk, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'Colorectal Tumour Biology Group, School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Life Sciences, Biomedical Sciences Building, University Walk, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'Colorectal Tumour Biology Group, School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Life Sciences, Biomedical Sciences Building, University Walk, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'Colorectal Tumour Biology Group, School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Life Sciences, Biomedical Sciences Building, University Walk, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'Colorectal Tumour Biology Group, School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Life Sciences, Biomedical Sciences Building, University Walk, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,,"['B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein/*genetics', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",,,2020/01/14 06:00,2020/08/18 06:00,['2020/01/14 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['5700879 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgaa003 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2020 May 14;41(3):249-256. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgaa003.,PMC7221501,,"['MR/R017247/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/N001494/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '203988/Z/16Z /WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Cardiac enzymes and serum and urinary sodium and potassium levels were evaluated which were analyzed statistically by using one-way ANOVA. Subsequently, DOX initiated changes in the level of cardiac markers CK-MB, LDH, and troponin I, which were notably reversed by PDE. PDE was also effective against serum and urinary sodium and urinary potassium and protected against DOX-induced nephrotoxicity. Groups treated with different doses of PDE showed marked decrease in levels of cardiac and renal markers.

Previous studies reported that lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF1) expression and serum Galectin-3 level could affect clinical parameters and outcome in acute myeloid leukemia patients, but as far as we know, no study has addressed their combined effect on AML patients. Aim: We studied the expression of LEF1 by real-time qPCR and measured serum level of Gal.3 by ELISA technique in peripheral blood of 69 AML patients and correlated it with different clinicopathological criteria of patients, response, PFS and OS. Results: We found high expression (LEF1(high)) was associated with better OS (p = 0.02) and EFS (p = 0.019) compared to LEF1(low), low serum Gal.3 level had better OS (p = 0.014) and EFS (p = 0.02) compared to high serum Gal.3 level. LEF1(high) less likely to carry a FLT3-ITD (p = 0.047) compared to LEF1(low) patient, also LEF1(high) characterized by favorable risk (p = 0.02) than LEF1(low) patients. While patients with higher Gal-3 levels characterized by poor risk (p = 0.02) than lower Gal.3 lels, also more likely to carry a FLT3-ITD with borderline significance (p = 0.054). Combined LEF1(high)/Gal.3 low patients had lower baseline blast percentages (p = 0.02), favorable risk (p = 0.01), less likely to carry FLT3-ITD (p = 0.02), higher CR rate (p = 0.055), shorter time to CR (0.001) than other groups. Among high Gal.3 level group, LEF1(high)expression improved OS and EFS (20 and 15 months respectively) vs LEF1(low) expression (13 and 8 months respectively). Conclusion: We conclude that high LEF1 expression was a favorable prognostic marker which can define AML patient risk and outcome independent from assessing the serum galectin.3 level.","['ElBaiomy, M A', 'Aref, S', 'El Zaafarany, M', 'Atwa, Sara', 'Akl, Tamer', 'El-Beshbishi, Wafaa', 'El-Ashwah, Shaimaa', 'Ibrahim, L', 'El-Ghonemy, M']","['ElBaiomy MA', 'Aref S', 'El Zaafarany M', 'Atwa S', 'Akl T', 'El-Beshbishi W', 'El-Ashwah S', 'Ibrahim L', 'El-Ghonemy M']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8702-7633', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4822-5204', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1192-7162']","['Medical Oncology Unit, Mansoura University Oncology Center, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Medical Oncology Unit, Mansoura University Oncology Center, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Medical Oncology Unit, Mansoura University Oncology Center, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Medical Oncology Unit, Mansoura University Oncology Center, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Clinical Oncology and Nuclear Medicine Department, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Clinical Hematology Unit, Mansoura University Oncology Center, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura University, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191218,United States,Adv Hematol,Advances in hematology,101504271,,,,,,2020/01/14 06:00,2020/01/14 06:01,['2020/01/14 06:00'],"['2019/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/2352919 [doi]'],epublish,Adv Hematol. 2019 Dec 18;2019:2352919. doi: 10.1155/2019/2352919. eCollection 2019.,PMC6935809,['All authors declared that he/she had no conflicts of interest.'],,,['Copyright (c) 2019 M.

Mitochondria have a direct role in the maintenance of HSC functions. For example, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, generated due to the activity of mutated mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), has been implicated in the pathogenesis of leukemia. Furthermore, disturbances in the fatty acid breakdown and pyruvate oxidation are often seen in leukemic cells. These and other abnormalities expedite leukemogenesis and chemoresistance of leukemic cells. However, it needs to be elucidated whether these aberrations are the result or cause of leukemogenesis. Accordingly, for this review, a search was carried out in PubMed and Google Scholar databases until June 2019 to assess the relationship between metabolic pathways in altered mitochondria and leukemia development. In the present review, an overview of mitochondria-related mechanisms and their abnormalities in leukemia is presented, with mitochondrial pathways and factors, such as mitophagy, intermediary metabolism enzymes, oncometabolites and reactive oxygen species' generation, discussed as potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets in leukemia.","['Al Ageeli, Essam']",['Al Ageeli E'],,"['Department of Medical Biochemistry (Medical Genetics), Faculty of Medicine, Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191223,India,Saudi J Med Med Sci,Saudi journal of medicine & medical sciences,101675905,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'intermediary mitochondrial metabolism', 'leukemia', 'mitochondrial DNA', 'mitophagy', 'reactive oxygen species']",2020/01/14 06:00,2020/01/14 06:01,['2020/01/14 06:00'],"['2018/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/sjmms.sjmms_112_18 [doi]', 'SJMMS-8-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Saudi J Med Med Sci. 2020 Jan-Apr;8(1):3-11. doi: 10.4103/sjmms.sjmms_112_18.

In its nonsevere form, cGVHD associates with better control of the malignant disease, thus highlighting graft-versus-leukemia effects. However, severe cGVHD leads to debilitating morbidity and increased nonrelapse mortality. The prediction of severe cGVHD, in particular at disease onset, is therefore of high importance for ensuing clinical decisions and overall success of allogeneic stem cell transplantations. CXC-chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) is an interferon-inducible chemokine of the CXC family and is increased in cGVHD. Endothelial activation and stress index (EASIX) was shown to predict death after acute graft-versus-host disease. We explored CXCL9 and EASIX as predictors of severe cGVHD. METHODS: Sera and clinical data of 480 patients were available who survived at least 6 months following allogeneic stem cell transplantation without steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease and without early relapse. CXCL9 and EASIX were measured on day +100 and onset of cGVHD. RESULTS: Development of nonsevere cGVHD was significantly associated with improved overall survival (hazard ratio 0.53, P < 0.001). CXCL9 serum levels at the onset of cGVHD predicted the development of severe cGVHD later on (hazard ratio 1.33, P = 0.02). In contrast, EASIX at the onset of cGVHD was not associated with cGVHD severity but was a significant independent risk factor for overall mortality and nonrelapse mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CXCL9 levels at the onset of cGVHD can help to predict severe courses of the disease and have potential for optimizing tailored administration of immunosuppressive therapy.","['Giesen, Nicola', 'Schwarzbich, Mark-Alexander', 'Dischinger, Katharina', 'Becker, Natalia', 'Hummel, Manuela', 'Benner, Axel', 'Radujkovic, Aleksandar', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Luft, Thomas']","['Giesen N', 'Schwarzbich MA', 'Dischinger K', 'Becker N', 'Hummel M', 'Benner A', 'Radujkovic A', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Dreger P', 'Luft T']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Max-Eder Group Experimental Therapies for Hematologic Malignancies, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Chemokine CXCL9/*blood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/14 06:00,2021/02/10 06:00,['2020/01/14 06:00'],"['2020/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/TP.0000000000003108 [doi]', '00007890-202011000-00024 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2020 Nov;104(11):2354-2359. doi: 10.1097/TP.0000000000003108.,,,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CXCL9 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL9)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She achieved CR after two cycles of reinduction chemotherapy with cytarabine, aclarubicin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (CAG) but had early relapsed. Reinduction chemotherapy with fludarabine, Ara-C, and G-CSF (FLAG) led to her second remission, followed by unrelated umbilical cord hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Unfortunately, she died of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. The second case is a 23-year-old male who was diagnosed as NK-AML with HE. IA regimen was successively used in two cycles treatment achieving CR. He underwent haploidentical HSCT but had a relapse after 17 months of sustained remission and died 4 months later.

Meanwhile, we found that SIRT6, an important upstream protein of PARP1, associated with PARP1, leading to the stimulation of polyADP-ribose polymerase activity. We further demonstrated that SIRT6 and PARP1 activation were required for chemotherapy-induced ADP-ribosylation of HMGB1 in leukemic cells and then influenced the acetylation of HMGB1, finally promoting the autophagy of leukemic cells mediated by HMGB1 translocation. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of chemotherapeutic drug resistance. Targeting the HMGB1 translocation may overcome autophagy-related chemoresistance in leukemia.","['Kong, Qian', 'Li, Yunyao', 'Liang, Qixiang', 'Xie, Jianwei', 'Li, Xinyu', 'Fang, Jianpei']","['Kong Q', 'Li Y', 'Liang Q', 'Xie J', 'Li X', 'Fang J']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9893-8598'],"['Department of Pediatrics, TheThird Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, P.R.

Even though advances in anticancer treatment regimens in recent decades have considerably improved survival rates, their cytotoxic effects and the resulting long-term complications pose a significant burden on the patients and the health care system. Therefore, non-toxic treatment modalities are needed to decrease side effects. The human body is the host to approximately 40 trillion microbes, known as the human microbiota. The large majority of the microbiota is located in the gastrointestinal tract, and is primarily composed of bacteria. The microbiota plays several important physiological roles, ranging from digestive functions to immunological and neural development. Investigating the microbiota in patients with hematologic malignancies has several important implications. The microbiota affects hematopoiesis, and influences the efficacies of chemotherapy and antimicrobial treatments. Determination of the microbiota composition and diversity could be an important part of risk stratification in the future, and may also take part to personalize antimicrobial treatments. Modulation of the microbiota via probiotics or fecal transplant can potentially be involved in reducing side effects of chemotherapy, and eliminating multiple drug resistant strains in patients with hematologic malignancies.","['Song, Yajing', 'Himmel, Bryan', 'Ohrmalm, Lars', 'Gyarmati, Peter']","['Song Y', 'Himmel B', 'Ohrmalm L', 'Gyarmati P']",,"['Department of Cancer Biology and Pharmacology, University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria, 1 Illini Dr, Peoria, IL, 61605, USA.', 'University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 801 South Wright Street, Champaign, IL, 61820, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, K2 Medicin, Solna, 171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Pharmacology, University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria, 1 Illini Dr, Peoria, IL, 61605, USA. gyarmati@uic.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200111,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Biodiversity', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Dysbiosis/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Metagenome', 'Metagenomics/methods', '*Microbiota']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bloodstream infection', '*Hematologic malignancies', '*Leukemia', '*Metagenomics', '*Microbiota']",2020/01/14 06:00,2021/06/12 06:00,['2020/01/14 06:00'],"['2020/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11864-019-0693-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-019-0693-7 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2020 Jan 11;21(1):2. doi: 10.1007/s11864-019-0693-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MN1 overexpression has been linked to shorter overall and disease free survival in AML patients treated with intensive induction chemotherapy. MN1 overexpression may still be an adverse prognostic marker in AML patients treated with autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT) after intensive induction chemotherapy. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 54 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples of AML patients who received auto-SCT at remission (CR1) after intensive induction chemotherapy. MN1 and putative MN1-associated mRNAs, as well as MN1-associated micro-RNAs were assessed at diagnosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using Taqman gene expression assays. RESULTS: AML patients with elevated MN1 or FoxP1 gene expression at diagnosis had a significantly shorter progression-free and overall survival after intensive induction chemo-therapy and auto-SCT. The presence of the favourable risk NPM1 mutation associated with reduced MN1 gene expression. In contrast to MN1 and FOXP1, elevated expression of the putative tumor suppressive micro-RNA hsa-miR-181a-5p was predictive for positive outcome. Correlation analysis of MN1 with myeloid gene expression levels revealed association of MN1 and BMI-1, CD34, FOXP1 and MDM2 expression. Analysis of non-coding RNAs revealed an inverse correlation of MN1 with hsa-miR-20a-5p and hsa-miR-181b-5p expression. CONCLUSIONS: MN1, FOXP1 and hsa-miR-181a-5p are prognostic markers in AML patients treated with intensive induction chemotherapy and auto-SCT. While MDM2 is a validated therapeutic target, the transcription factors MN1 and FOXP1, and the chromatin modulator BMI-1 are potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of AML. The tumor suppressor hsa-miR-181a-5p may be a candidate miRNA mimic for therapeutic use.","['Seipel, Katja', 'Messerli, Christian', 'Wiedemann, Gertrud', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Pabst, Thomas']","['Seipel K', 'Messerli C', 'Wiedemann G', 'Bacher U', 'Pabst T']",,"['Department for Biomedical Research (DBMR), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland; Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital, Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland.

Instead, the focus may be on more complex time-to-event endpoints, such as the course of disease after the first event or endpoints occurring after randomization. We propose ""relapse- and immunosuppression-free survival"" (RIFS) as an innovative and clinically relevant outcome measure for assessing treatment success after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT). To capture the time-dynamic relationship of multiple episodes of immunosuppressive therapy during follow-up, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality, a multistate model was developed. The statistical complexity is that the probability of RIFS is nonmonotonic over time; thus, standard time-to-first-event methodology is inappropriate for formal treatment comparisons. Instead, a generalization of the Kaplan-Meier method was used for probability estimation, and simulation-based resampling was suggested as a strategy for statistical inference. We reanalyzed data from a recently published phase III trial in 201 leukemia patients after SCT. The study evaluated long-term treatment success of standard graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis plus a pretransplant antihuman T-lymphocyte immunoglobulin compared with standard prophylaxis alone. Results suggested that treatment increased the long-term probability of RIFS by approximately 30% during the entire follow-up period, which complements the original findings. This article highlights the importance of complex endpoints in oncology, which provide deeper insight into the treatment and disease process over time. Multistate models combined with resampling are highlighted as a promising tool to evaluate treatment success beyond standard endpoints.

Enhancing beta-cell preservation represents an important therapeutic strategy to treat type 2 DM. Far-infrared (FIR) radiation has been found to induce promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) activation to protect the vascular endothelium in diabetic mice. The influence of FIR on beta-cell preservation is unknown. Our previous study reveals that the biologically effective wavelength of FIR is 8-10mum. In the present study, we investigated the biological effects of FIR (8-10mum) on both survival and insulin secretion function of beta-cells. FIR reduced pancreatic islets loss and increased insulin secretion in nicotinamide-streptozotocin-induced DM mice, but only promoted insulin secretion in DM PLZF(-)(/)(-) mice. FIR-upregulated PLZF to induce an anti-apoptotic effect in a beta cell line RIN-m5f. FIR also upregulated mitochondrial function and the ratio of NAD(+)/NADH, and then induced Sirtuin1 (Sirt1) expression. The mitochondria Complex I inhibitor rotenone blocked FIR-induced PLZF and Sirt1. The Sirt1 inhibitor EX527 and Sirt1 siRNA inhibited FIR-induced PLZF and insulin respectively. Sirt1 upregulation also increased CaV1.2 expression and calcium influx that promotes insulin secretion in beta-cells. In summary, FIR-enhanced mitochondrial function prevents beta-cell apoptosis and enhances insulin secretion in DM mice through the Sirt1 pathway.","['Hsu, Yung-Ho', 'Chen, Yen-Cheng', 'Chen, Yu-Wei', 'Chiu, Tzu-Hsuan', 'Kuo, Yung-Ting', 'Chen, Cheng-Hsien']","['Hsu YH', 'Chen YC', 'Chen YW', 'Chiu TH', 'Kuo YT', 'Chen CH']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan.', 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan.', 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan.', 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan; Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan.

Metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells may result in strong dependencies on nutrients that could be exploited for therapy. While these dependencies may be in part due to the nutrient environment of tumors, mutations or expression changes in metabolic genes also reprogram metabolic pathways and create addictions to extracellular nutrients. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the major nutrient dependencies of cancer cells focusing on their discovery and potential mechanisms by which metabolites become limiting for tumor growth. We further detail available therapeutic interventions based on these metabolic features and highlight opportunities for restricting nutrient availability as an anti-cancer strategy. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to limit nutrients required for tumor growth using dietary interventions or nutrient degrading enzymes have previously been suggested for cancer therapy. The best clinical example of exploiting cancer nutrient dependencies is the treatment of leukemia with l-asparaginase, a first-line chemotherapeutic that depletes serum asparagine. Despite the success of nutrient starvation in blood cancers, it remains unclear whether this approach could be extended to other solid tumors. Systematic studies to identify nutrient dependencies unique to individual tumor types have the potential to discover targets for therapy.","['Garcia-Bermudez, Javier', 'Williams, Robert T', 'Guarecuco, Rohiverth', 'Birsoy, Kivanc']","['Garcia-Bermudez J', 'Williams RT', 'Guarecuco R', 'Birsoy K']",,"['Laboratory of Metabolic Regulation and Genetics, The Rockefeller University, 1230 York Avenue, New York, NY 10065, USA.

METHODS: We describe a seven-year-old boy with paraneoplastic necrotizing encephalitis associated with precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. RESULTS: The initial presentation involved acute-onset upper extremity weakness, seizure-like activity, and agitation. Extensive evaluation revealed pancytopenia, elevated protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, and normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) consistent with a clinical diagnosis of encephalitis of presumed viral etiology. He was treated with antimicrobials and intravenous immunoglobulin and returned to his neurological baseline before discharge. One month later, he was diagnosed with precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Before chemotherapy initiation, he again became encephalopathic. Repeat cerebrospinal fluid evaluation showed elevated protein, and MRI revealed findings consistent with diffuse necrotizing encephalitis. He received standard chemotherapy as well as immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis, with resolution of MRI abnormalities and improvement in neurological status. At six years postpresentation, he is in remission for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, without significant neurocognitive deficits and mild right spastic hemiparesis. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of paraneoplastic encephalitis associated with pediatric leukemia. A hematologic malignancy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of paraneoplastic encephalitis.","['Nguyen, Linda', 'Crawford, John Ross']","['Nguyen L', 'Crawford JR']",,"['Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, California.', ""Department of Neurosciences and Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, San Diego, California; Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, San Diego, California.

Within the same tissue, stem cells may be highly proliferative, or maintained in a quiescent state and only to be activated after tissue damage. Although various stem cell markers have been successfully identified, there is no universal stem cell marker, which is exclusively expressed in all stem cells. Here, we discuss the roles of master developmental regulator RUNX1 in stem cells and the development of a 270 base pair fragment of the Runx1 enhancer (eR1) for use as stem cell marker. Using eR1 to identify stem cells offers a distinct advantage over gene promoters, which might not be expressed exclusively in stem cells. Moreover, RUNX1 has been strongly implicated in various cancer types, such as leukemia, breast, esophageal, prostate, oral, skin, and ovarian cancers?it has been suggested that RUNX1 dysfunction promotes stem cell dysfunction and proliferation. As tissue stem cells are potential candidates for cancer cells-of-origin and cancer stem cells, we will also discuss the use of eR1 to target oncogenic gene manipulations in stem cells and to track subsequent neoplastic changes.","['Chuang, Linda Shyue Huey', 'Osato, Motomi', 'Ito, Yoshiaki']","['Chuang LSH', 'Osato M', 'Ito Y']",,"['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,IM,,"['Adult Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Humans']",['NOTNLM'],"['RUNX1', 'eR1', 'enhancer', 'stem cells']",2020/01/13 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2020/01/13 06:00'],"['2019/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['molcells.2019.0250 [pii]', '10.14348/molcells.2019.0250 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cells. 2020 Feb 29;43(2):121-125. doi: 10.14348/molcells.2019.0250.,PMC7057835,,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For patients without an HLA-identical donor, haploidentical (haplo-) HCT is becoming the leading source of stem cell donation. However, data are scarce on predictive factors for outcome in that setting. We identified 122 adults (20% female; median age, 31 years; range, 18 to 68 years) with T-ALL who underwent haplo-HCT with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (ptCy) between 2010 and 2017. The median duration of follow-up of living patients was 23 months. The 2-year incidences of relapse and nonrelapse mortality were 45% and 21%, respectively. The 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS), and graft-versus-host disease, relapse-free survival (GRFS) were 34%, 42%, and 27%, respectively. The 2-year LFS and OS were highly influenced by disease status at transplantation, being 49% and 55%, respectively, for patients in first complete remission (CR1); 34% and 50%, respectively, for those in second CR (CR2); and 8% and 12%, respectively, for patients with active disease. On multivariate analysis, only disease status was found to affect LFS and OS. Transplantation in CR2 negatively affected LFS, whereas active disease at the time of haplo-HCT negatively affected LFS and OS. In conclusion, haplo-HCT with ptCy produced encouraging results in this challenging disease, particularly when performed in patients in CR. Despite the limitation of the small sample size, our results were not affected by the type of conditioning, calling into question the need for total body irradiation-based myeloablative conditioning in that setting.","['Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Angelucci, Emanuele', 'Gulbas, Zafer', 'Ozdogu, Hakan', 'Arat, Mutlu', 'de Rosa, Luca', 'Pastano, Rocco', 'Pioltelli, Pietro', 'Montserrat, Rovira', 'Martino, Massimo', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Koc, Yener', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Herrera, Concepcion', 'Chalandon, Yves', 'Bernasconi, Paolo', 'Marotta, Giuseppe', 'Castagna, Luca', 'McDonald, Andrew', 'Visani, Guiseppe', 'Carluccio, Paola', 'Vitek, Antonin', 'Simand, Celestine', 'Afanasyev, Boris', 'Rosler, Wolf', 'Diez-Martin, J L', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Brissot, Eolia', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Bazarbachi A', 'Labopin M', 'Angelucci E', 'Gulbas Z', 'Ozdogu H', 'Arat M', 'de Rosa L', 'Pastano R', 'Pioltelli P', 'Montserrat R', 'Martino M', 'Ciceri F', 'Koc Y', 'Socie G', 'Blaise D', 'Herrera C', 'Chalandon Y', 'Bernasconi P', 'Marotta G', 'Castagna L', 'McDonald A', 'Visani G', 'Carluccio P', 'Vitek A', 'Simand C', 'Afanasyev B', 'Rosler W', 'Diez-Martin JL', 'Nagler A', 'Brissot E', 'Giebel S', 'Mohty M']",,"['Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.

METHODS: Adult patients with AML received either itraconazole or posaconazole for antifungal prophylaxis while undergoing intensive chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was incidence of prophylaxis failure (change in antifungal agent due to suspected invasive fungal infection [IFI], drug intolerance, drug interaction, or adverse event). RESULTS: From February 2016 to January 2018, 90 patients were included in the itraconazole group and 45 patients in the posaconazole group. Prophylaxis failure occurred in 88% of itraconazole recipients compared with 33% of posaconazole recipients (P<0.001). The primary reason for prophylaxis failure with itraconazole was suspected IFI (58%) whereas for posaconazole, failure predominantly related to drug interaction (60%). An antifungal regimen was continued upon discharge in 47% of itraconazole recipients compared with 9% of posaconazole recipients (P<0.001). The use of breakthrough IFI diagnostic tests was not significantly different in the two groups. A larger proportion of drug concentrations were collected in the posaconazole group. CONCLUSIONS: In AML patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy, posaconazole was associated with significantly lower rates of prophylaxis failure and less need for continued antifungal therapy on discharge compared with itraconazole.","['Copley, Melissa S', 'Waldron, Madeline', 'Athans, Vasilios', 'Welch, Sarah C', 'Brizendine, Kyle D', 'Cober, Eric', 'Siebenaller, Caitlin']","['Copley MS', 'Waldron M', 'Athans V', 'Welch SC', 'Brizendine KD', 'Cober E', 'Siebenaller C']",,"['Cleveland Clinic Main Campus, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio, 44195, United States.

Metformin, a classic hypoglycemic drug for diabetes recently delivered us a new identity that it exerted anti-tumor activity through suppressing mTOR in various tumors. But the anti-tumor effect of metformin in AML was not clear. METHODS: In this study, we used CCK8 assay and apoptosis assay to determine the anti-leukemia activity of metformin combined with AraC, and explore the mechanism of the joint role of Ara-C/metformin in AML. We finally used xenograft experiment in mice to determine the anti-leukemia effect of Ara-C/metformin in vivo. KEY FINDINGS: We found that metformin could synergistically sensitize AML cells to Ara-C via inhibiting mTORC1/P70S6K pathway. In vivo experiment also verified metformin in aid of Ara-C caused an obviously synergistic anti-tumor effect.

Human beings are affected by ionizing radiations that radiate from radioactive elements. The quantity of radioactive elements is different inside and outside the earth's surface. Soil and water are exigencies of human lives which are contaminated by radioactive elements. These radioactive elements enter into the human body through drinking, eating and breathing. On reaching hazardous limits in the human body, these radioactive elements cause stomach cancer, lung cancer and leukemia. Measurement of radioactive elements in soil and water is helpful in monitoring the health issues caused by exposure to these elements. In Iraq, numerous studies about natural radioactivity, radon concentration and physiochemical parameters have been conducted by different researchers, of which most of the studies were conducted in Barsa, Nasirya, Najaf, Karbala, Baghdad, Balad, Kirkuk, Erbil, Mosul and Dohuk cities. This article aims to review and compile the studies conducted in these cities of Iraq from 2011 to 2019. In most articles, high-purity germanium (HPGe), RAD7 and CR-39 detectors are used for radioactivity and radon measurement. These cities are located in the low-high folded and Mesopotamian zones. From this study, it can be concluded that radon concentration in soil and water was greater in the Mesopotamian and lower in the low-high folded zones. Higher concentrations of natural radioactivity in water and soil were found in the low-high folded zone in Iraq. However, most of the conducted studies show that concentrations of radon and natural radioactivity are above the permissible limits recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and World Health Organization (WHO). The values of physiochemical parameters were found to be greater in the Mesopotamian zone, but overall they are not above the permissible limits.","['Alam, Iftikhar', 'Rehman, Jalil Ur', 'Ahmad, Nisar', 'Nazir, Alia', 'Hameed, Aslam', 'Hussain, Altaf']","['Alam I', 'Rehman JU', 'Ahmad N', 'Nazir A', 'Hameed A', 'Hussain A']",,"['Department of Physics, Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan.', 'Department of Physics, Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences, Quetta, Pakistan.', 'Department of Physics, Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences, Quetta, Pakistan.', 'Department of Physics, Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan.', 'Department of Physics, Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan.', 'Department of Physics, Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Rev Environ Health,Reviews on environmental health,0425754,IM,,"['Elements, Radioactive/*analysis', 'Fresh Water/chemistry', 'Iraq', '*Radiation Monitoring', 'Saline Waters/chemistry', 'Soil/chemistry', 'Soil Pollutants, Radioactive/*analysis', 'Water Pollutants, Radioactive/*analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['CR-39', 'HPGe', 'Iraq', 'RAD7', 'radioactivity', 'radon', 'sodium iodide', 'soil', 'water']",2020/01/12 06:00,2020/09/25 06:00,['2020/01/12 06:00'],"['2019/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1515/reveh-2019-0070 [doi]', '/j/reveh.ahead-of-print/reveh-2019-0070/reveh-2019-0070.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Rev Environ Health. 2020 Jun 25;35(2):147-155. doi: 10.1515/reveh-2019-0070.,,,,"['0 (Elements, Radioactive)', '0 (Soil)', '0 (Soil Pollutants, Radioactive)', '0 (Water Pollutants, Radioactive)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate vitamin D status at the time of diagnosis to investigate its predictors and association with overall survival in children with leukemia. PROCEDURE: We included all 295 children and adolescents diagnosed with leukemia at our institution between 1990 and 2016 who had available serum sample from the time of diagnosis. We analyzed serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone levels and correlated them with clinical data. RESULTS: The 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was deficient (< 25 nmol/L), insufficient (25-50 nmol/L), sufficient (50-75 nmol/L), and optimal (> 75 nmol/L) in 6.4%, 26.8%, 39.7%, and 27.1% of the children, respectively. Older age and a more recent time of sampling (calendar year) predicted lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. In preschool children (age </=6 years), lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was also associated with acute myeloid leukemia, and a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 50 nmol/L was associated with inferior overall survival. In school-aged children (age > 6 years), the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level showed significant seasonal variation. CONCLUSION: It remains unclear whether vitamin D supplementation in pediatric leukemia patients will improve outcome.","['Jackmann, Natalja', 'Makitie, Outi', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Gustafsson, Jan', 'Nezirevic Dernroth, Dzeneta', 'Frisk, Per']","['Jackmann N', 'Makitie O', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Gustafsson J', 'Nezirevic Dernroth D', 'Frisk P']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2817-3299', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2767-5828']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University Children's Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden."", 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institute, and Clinical Genetics, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University Children's Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University Children's Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden."", 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University Children's Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200111,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/blood/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Seasons', 'Survival Rate', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Vitamin D Deficiency/*physiopathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*adolescents', '*leukemia', '*overall survival', '*pediatric', '*vitamin D']",2020/01/12 06:00,2020/06/27 06:00,['2020/01/12 06:00'],"['2019/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28163 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Apr;67(4):e28163. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28163.

We compared nine generic formulations of L-asparaginase available in India with the innovator. METHODS: The quality of formulations was assessed by measuring 72-hour trough asparaginase activity in children with ALL during induction following administration of 10,000 IU/m(2) of L-asparaginase. In-vitro analysis of the label claim was assessed by measuring activity of three generic formulations. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was used to determine the amount of host contaminant proteins (HCPs) in the formulations. RESULTS: Between March 2015 to June 2018, 240 samples from 195 patients were analyzed. The number of samples analyzed ranged from 7-66 per generic brand (median: 18) and seven of the innovator. The proportion of generic formulations that failed to achieve a predefined clinical threshold activity of 50 IU/L ranged from 16.7% (2/12) to 84.9% (28/33) in the highest activity to lowest activity generic respectively. On other hand, all innovator samples had activity greater than 50 IU/L. In-vitro asparaginase activity in the three generic formulations tested ranged from 71.4-74.6% of the label claim (10,000 IU) compared to 93.5% for the innovator. LC/MS analysis of generic 5 identified 25 HCPs with a relative peptide count of 27.1% of the total peptides. CONCLUSIONS: Generic formulations had lower asparaginase activity which raises serious clinical concerns regarding their quality. Until stringent regulatory enforcement improves the quality of these generics, dose adaptive strategies coupled with therapeutic drug monitoring need to be considered.","['Sankaran, Hari', 'Sengupta, Soumika', 'Purohit, Vaitashi', 'Kotagere, Anand', 'Moulik, Nirmalya Roy', 'Prasad, Maya', 'Dhamne, Chetan', 'Narula, Gaurav', 'Banavali, Shripad', 'Gota, Vikram']","['Sankaran H', 'Sengupta S', 'Purohit V', 'Kotagere A', 'Moulik NR', 'Prasad M', 'Dhamne C', 'Narula G', 'Banavali S', 'Gota V']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0666-2630'],"['Department of Paediatric Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'KIIT School of Biotechnology, KIIT Deemed to be University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200218,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,IM,,"['*Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Escherichia coli', 'Humans', 'India', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Generics', '*Innovator', '*L-asparaginase', '*Quality']",2020/01/12 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/01/12 06:00'],"['2019/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bcp.14216 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2020 Jun;86(6):1081-1088. doi: 10.1111/bcp.14216.

However, its biological function and underlying molecular mechanism in AML remain to be further defined. Herein, we found that a significant increase in miR-362-5p expression was observed in AML patients and cell lines using quantitative real-time PCR. The expression of miR-362-5p was altered in THP-1 and HL-60 cells by transfecting with miR-362-5p mimic or inhibitor. A series of experiments showed that inhibition of miR-362-5p expression significantly suppressed cell proliferation, induced G0/G1 phase arrest and attenuated tumor growth in vivo. On the contrary, ectopic expression of miR-362-5p resulted in enhanced cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and tumor growth. Moreover, growth arrest-specific 7 (GAS7) was confirmed as a direct target gene of miR-362-5p and was negatively modulated by miR-362-5p. GAS7 overexpression imitated the tumor suppressive effect of silenced miR-362-5p on THP-1 cells. Furthermore, miR-362-5p knockdown or GAS7 overexpression obviously down-regulated the expression levels of PCNA, CDK4 and cyclin D1, but up-regulated p21 expression. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that miR-362-5p exerts oncogenic effects in AML by directly targeting GAS7, which might provide a promising therapeutic target for AML.","['Wu, Fuqun', 'Yin, Changxin', 'Qi, Junhua', 'Duan, Deyu', 'Jiang, Xi', 'Yu, Jianhua', 'Luo, Zhaofan']","['Wu F', 'Yin C', 'Qi J', 'Duan D', 'Jiang X', 'Yu J', 'Luo Z']",,"['Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun-Yat-Sen University, No. 628, Zhenyuan Road, Guangming District, Shenzhen, 518017, Guangdong, China. wu_fuqun1314@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanghua Hospital, Dongguan, 523080, Guangdong, China. wu_fuqun1314@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun-Yat-Sen University, No. 628, Zhenyuan Road, Guangming District, Shenzhen, 518017, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun-Yat-Sen University, No. 628, Zhenyuan Road, Guangming District, Shenzhen, 518017, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun-Yat-Sen University, No. 628, Zhenyuan Road, Guangming District, Shenzhen, 518017, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanghua Hospital, Dongguan, 523080, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanghua Hospital, Dongguan, 523080, Guangdong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200110,Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,IM,,"['Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Nerve Tissue Proteins']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cell cycle', 'GAS7', 'miR-362-5p']",2020/01/12 06:00,2020/08/11 06:00,['2020/01/12 06:00'],"['2019/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13577-019-00319-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s13577-019-00319-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Hum Cell. 2020 Apr;33(2):405-415. doi: 10.1007/s13577-019-00319-4.

Like many malignancies, the genomic landscape of pediatric AML has been mapped recently through sequencing of large cohorts of patients. Much has been learned about the biology of AML through studies of specific recurrent genetic lesions. Further, genetic lesions have been linked to specific clinical features, response to therapy, and outcome, leading to improvements in risk stratification. Lastly, targeted therapeutic approaches have been developed for the treatment of specific genetic lesions, some of which are already having a positive impact on outcomes. While the advances made based on the discoveries of sequencing studies are significant, much work is left. The biologic, clinical, and prognostic impact of a number of genetic lesions, including several seemingly unique to pediatric patients, remains undefined. While targeted approaches are being explored, for most, the efficacy and tolerability when incorporated into standard therapy is yet to be determined. Furthermore, the challenge of how to study small subpopulations with rare genetic lesions in an already rare disease will have to be considered.

The prognosis is pejorative due to the molecular complexity and pathways implicated in leukemogenesis. OBJECTIVES: Our research was focused on comparing the metabolic profiles of leukemic cells in basal culture and deprivation conditions to investigate their behaviors under metabolic stress. METHODS: We performed untargeted metabolomics using (1)H HRMAS-NMR. Five human leukemic cell lines-KG1, K562, HEL, HL60 and OCIAML3-were studied in the basal and nutrient deprivation states. A multivariate analysis of the metabolic profile was performed to find over- or under- expressed metabolites in the different cell lines, depending on the experimental conditions. RESULTS: In the basal state, each leukemic cell line exhibited a specific metabolic signature related to the diversity of AML subtypes represented and their phenotypes. When cultured in a serum-free medium, they showed quick metabolic adaptation and continued to proliferate and survive despite the lack of nutrients. Low apoptosis was observed. Increased phosphocholine and glutathione was a common feature of all the observed cell lines, with the maximum increase in these metabolites at 24 h of culture, suggesting the involvement of lipid metabolism and oxidative stress regulators in the survival mechanism developed by the leukemic cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new insights into the metabolic mechanisms in leukemogenesis and suggests a hierarchy of metabolic pathways activated within leukemic cells, some dependent on their genotypes and others conserved among the subtypes but commonly induced under micro-environmental stress.","['Lo Presti, Caroline', 'Fauvelle, Florence', 'Mondet, Julie', 'Mossuz, Pascal']","['Lo Presti C', 'Fauvelle F', 'Mondet J', 'Mossuz P']",,"['Department of Biological Hematology, Grenoble Alpes University Hospital, Grenoble, France. clopresti@chu-grenoble.fr.', 'UGA/INSERM U1209/CNRS 5309, Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Grenoble, France. clopresti@chu-grenoble.fr.', 'UGA/INSERM U1216, Grenoble Institute of Neurosciences, Grenoble, France.', 'UGA/INSERM US17, Grenoble MRI Facility IRMaGe, Grenoble, France.', 'UGA/INSERM U1209/CNRS 5309, Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Grenoble, France.', 'Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Grenoble Alpes University Hospital, Grenoble, France.', 'Department of Biological Hematology, Grenoble Alpes University Hospital, Grenoble, France.', 'UGA/INSERM U1209/CNRS 5309, Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Grenoble, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200110,United States,Metabolomics,Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society,101274889,IM,,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/adverse effects', '*Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', '*Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Metabolome', '*Stress, Physiological']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*HRMAS-NMR', '*Metabolic pathways', '*Metabolomics']",2020/01/12 06:00,2020/10/09 06:00,['2020/01/12 06:00'],"['2019/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11306-020-1633-z [doi]', '10.1007/s11306-020-1633-z [pii]']",epublish,Metabolomics. 2020 Jan 10;16(1):13. doi: 10.1007/s11306-020-1633-z.,,,,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The etiology of immune PTR is typically human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies (Abs) from pregnancy or previous transfusion. Herein, we report PTR in the setting of induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) from Abs against CD36/glycoprotein (GP)IV. A 66-year-old African American woman presented with anemia and thrombocytopenia. She was found to have transfusion-dependent AML, and a 7 + 3 regimen (7 days of standard-dose cytarabine and 3 days of an anthracycline antibiotic or an anthracenedione, most often daunorubicin) was initiated. The patient developed profound thrombocytopenia, with platelet nadir of 0 by day 13. The results of HLA antibody screening were negative. However, the results of a screening test for platelet-specific antibodies screen showed Abs against cluster of differentiation (CD)36. The platelets of the patient lacked expression of CD36, and DNA analysis showed mutations in the CD36 gene. HLA Ab-mediated PTR is common in patients with hematological malignancies. However, once HLA Abs are excluded, other less-frequent Abs should be considered, particularly in patient populations of Asian, African, or Middle Eastern descent.","['Schmidt, Amy E', 'Sahai, Tanmay', 'Refaai, Majed A', 'Sullivan, Mia', 'Curtis, Brian R']","['Schmidt AE', 'Sahai T', 'Refaai MA', 'Sullivan M', 'Curtis BR']",,"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York.', 'The Platelet & Neutrophil Immunology Laboratory, Blood Center of Wisconsin (part of Versiti), Milwaukee, WI.', 'The Platelet & Neutrophil Immunology Laboratory, Blood Center of Wisconsin (part of Versiti), Milwaukee, WI.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Lab Med,Laboratory medicine,0250641,IM,,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Blood Platelet Disorders/complications/genetics/*immunology', 'Decitabine/*administration & dosage', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/complications/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy', '*Platelet Transfusion']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD36', 'human platelet antigen', 'isoimmunization', 'platelet', 'platelet antibody', 'transfusion refractoriness']",2020/01/12 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2020/01/12 06:00'],"['2020/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['5700528 [pii]', '10.1093/labmed/lmz091 [doi]']",ppublish,Lab Med. 2020 Sep 1;51(5):540-544. doi: 10.1093/labmed/lmz091.,,,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'Platelet Glycoprotein IV Deficiency']","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology 2020.

Sixty-two patients were randomly assigned to either arm. Treatment 'successes' was the primary end point, defined as >/=0.5 log reduction in 12-month qPCR level from trial entry.

Although recently introduced small-molecule B-cell receptor signalling inhibitors have revolutionized CLL treatment, data for ibrutinib still point to impaired prognosis for TP53-affected patients. Among cancer-associated TP53 mutations, missense substitutions predominate and typically result in a high mutated-p53 protein level. Therefore, rescuing the p53 tumor suppressor function through specific small molecules restoring p53 wild-type (wt) conformation represents an attractive therapeutic strategy for cancer patients with TP53 missense mutations. We tested the effect of mutated-p53 reactivating molecule PRIMA-1(MET) in 62 clinical CLL samples characterized for TP53 mutations and p53 protein level. At the subtle PRIMA-1(MET) concentrations (1-4 muM), most samples manifested concentration-dependent viability decrease and, conversely, apoptosis induction, with the response being similar in both the TP53-mutated and TP53-wt groups, as well as in the TP53-mutated samples with p53 protein stabilization and without it. PRIMA-1(MET) was able to reduce mutated p53 protein in a proportion of TP53-mutated CLL samples, and this reduction correlated with a significantly stronger viability decrease and apoptosis induction than samples with stable p53 levels. CLL cells are mostly sensitive to PRIMA-1(MET) apart from those with stable mutated p53.","['Jaskova, Zuzana', 'Pavlova, Sarka', 'Malcikova, Jitka', 'Brychtova, Yvona', 'Trbusek, Martin']","['Jaskova Z', 'Pavlova S', 'Malcikova J', 'Brychtova Y', 'Trbusek M']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic; Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic; Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.

This study aimed to investigate the influence of detecting the MRD by the multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) at day 15 (D15) of the induction on the analysis of the risk group classifications of the different childhood ALL treatment protocols used in a referral hospital in southern Brazil. METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with B-cell ALL, aged 1 to 18 years, treated at a hospital from January 2013 to April 2017. MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were analyzed. Regarding the MRD by the MFC at D15, the analyses showed statistical significance when the MRD was grouped into three categories, < 0.1%, 0.1-10%, and > 10%, with the following distribution: 30.7%, 52.0%, and 17.3%, respectively. There was a significant association between D15 MRD-MFC < 0.1% and the likelihood of dying or relapsing and between D15 MRD-MFC > 10% and the likelihood of dying or relapsing. The cumulative hazard ratio for the relapse of patients with D15 MRD-MFC < 0.1%, 0.1-10%, and > 10% was 19.2%, 59.8%, and 80.1%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests D15 MRD-MFC < 0.1% as a cut-off point for patients with more favorable outcomes and that the MRD at D15 in risk classifications is particularly useful for the stratification of patients with a more favorable prognosis.","['Silva, Klerize Anecely de Souza', 'Spagnol, Fabiane', 'Farias, Mariela Granero', 'Alegretti, Ana Paula', 'Michalowski, Mariana Bohns', 'Daudt, Liane Esteves']","['Silva KAS', 'Spagnol F', 'Farias MG', 'Alegretti AP', 'Michalowski MB', 'Daudt LE']",,"['Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.

Reduction-sensitive 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) based prodrug and pH-sensitive doxorubicin (DOX) based prodrug were grafted onto PDPAO by an azide-alkyne ""Click Chemistry"" reaction to acquire a pH/reduction-sensitive polymeric prodrug (PDPAO@imine-DOX/cis-6MP), which was able to self-aggregate to form polymeric micelles (M(DOX/6MP)) with an average particle size of 116 +/- 2 nm in the water. The resultant micelles could maintain a stable sphere structure and show stability with a small particles' dispersion index in the blood. Importantly, it has been observed that the pH-sensitive surface charge-conversion accompanied pH-triggered DOX release in the biomimetic extracellular acidic environment of tumor tissue and a rapid dual-drug release triggered by pH and GSH in the intracellular environment. The in vitro evaluation of micelles on human cervical cancer (HeLa) and human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells showed an enhanced cellular uptake because of charge-conversion and exhibited a higher cell-killing performance. Moreover, the graft ratio of DOX and 6MP showed the ability to adjust the cytotoxicity; the micelles with a graft ratio of 2: 1 (M(DOX2/6MP)) displayed the higher cellular inhibition on either HeLa (combination index (CI) = 0.62) or HL-60 (CI = 0.35) cells.

Given the unique morphology of the bract of the Manicaria saccifera palm, being an interwoven meshwork of fibers, we believe that these fibers with this built-in structure could prove useful as a tissue engineering scaffold material. Thus, we first investigated the fiber's in vitro biocompatibility and immunogenicity. We cultured NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts, human aortic smooth muscle cells, and human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells on the fiber mats, which all readily attached and over 21 days grew to engulf the fibers. Importantly, this was achieved without treating the plant tissue with extracellular matrix proteins or any adhesion ligands. In addition, we measured the gene expression and protein secretion of three target inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-8, and TNFalpha) from THP-1 human leukemia monocytes cultured in the presence of the biotextile as an in vitro immunological model. After 24 h of culture, gene expression and protein secretion were largely the same as the control, demonstrating the low immunogenicity of Manicaria saccifera fibers. We also measured the tensile mechanical properties of the fibers. Individual fibers after processing had a Young's modulus of 9.51 +/- 4.38 GPa and a tensile strength of 68.62 +/- 27.93 MPa. We investigated the tensile mechanical properties of the fiber mats perpendicular to the fiber axis (transverse loading), which displayed upwards of 100% strain, but with a concession in strength compared to longitudinal loading. Collectively, our in vitro assessments point toward Manicaria saccifera as a highly biocompatible biotextile, with a range of potential clinical and engineering applications.","['James, Bryan D', 'Ruddick, William N', 'Vasisth, Shangradhanva E', 'Dulany, Krista', 'Sulekar, Soumitra', 'Porras, Alicia', 'Maranon, Alejandro', 'Nino, Juan C', 'Allen, Josephine B']","['James BD', 'Ruddick WN', 'Vasisth SE', 'Dulany K', 'Sulekar S', 'Porras A', 'Maranon A', 'Nino JC', 'Allen JB']",,"['Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Florida, 100 Rhines Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.', 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Florida, 100 Rhines Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.', 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Florida, 100 Rhines Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.', 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Florida, 100 Rhines Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.', 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Florida, 100 Rhines Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.', 'Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad de los Andes, CR 1 ESTE 19A 40, Bogota 111711, Colombia.', 'Chemical Engineering Department, Universidad de los Andes, CR, 1 ESTE 19A 40, Bogota, 111711, Colombia.', 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Florida, 100 Rhines Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.', 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Florida, 100 Rhines Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.

MLL-FPs occur in about 10% of acute leukemias and are associated with dismal prognosis and treatment outcomes which emphasized the need for new therapeutic strategies. In present study, by a cell-based screening in-house compound collection, we disclosed that Rabeprazole specially inhibited the proliferation of leukemia cells harboring MLL-FPs with little toxicity to non-MLL cells. Mechanism study showed Rabeprazole down-regulated the transcription of MLL-FPs related Hox and Meis1 genes and effectively inhibited MLL1 H3K4 methyltransferase (HMT) activity in MV4-11 cells bearing MLL-AF4 fusion protein. Displacement of MLL1 probe from WDR5 protein suggested that Rabeprazole may inhibit MLL1 HMT activity through disturbing MLL1-WDR5 protein-protein interaction. Moreover, other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) also indicated the inhibition activity of MLL1-WDR5. Preliminary SARs showed the structural characteristics of PPIs were also essential for the activities of MLL1-WDR5 inhibition. Our results indicated the drug reposition of PPIs for MLL-rearranged leukemias and provided new insight for further optimization of targeting MLL1 methyltransferase activity, the MLL1-WDR5 interaction or WDR5.","['Chen, Wei-Lin', 'Li, Dong-Dong', 'Chen, Xin', 'Wang, Ying-Zhe', 'Xu, Jun-Jie', 'Jiang, Zheng-Yu', 'You, Qi-Dong', 'Guo, Xiao-Ke']","['Chen WL', 'Li DD', 'Chen X', 'Wang YZ', 'Xu JJ', 'Jiang ZY', 'You QD', 'Guo XK']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China; Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China; Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.

Abnormal circular RNAs (circRNAs) participated in this progression. This study attempted to investigate the potential role of circ_0009910 in imatinib resistance of CML cells. METHODS: The expression of circ_0009910 and miR-34a-5p was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The characterization of circ_0009910 was investigated using oligo (dT)18 primers, Actinomycin D and RNase R. Cell viability (IC50 value) and apoptosis were assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay and flow cytometry assay, respectively. The relative protein expression was quantified by western blot. The relationship among miR-34a-5p, circ_0009910 and ULK1 was predicted by online bioinformatics tool, and verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). RESULTS: The expression of circ_0009910 was up-regulated in the serum of imatinib-resistance CML patients and K562/R cells, and associated with unfavorable clinicopathologic features. Circ_0009910 in K562 and K562/R cells was mainly localized in the cytoplasm. Circ_0009910 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and autophagy, but induced apoptosis in K562/R cells. Circ_0009910 targeted miR-34a-5p to regulate ULK1. MiR-34a-5p depression rescued the effects of circ_0009910 knockdown on apoptosis and autophagy in K562/R cells. CONCLUSION: Circ_0009910 accelerated imatinib-resistance in CML cells by modulating ULK1-induced autophagy via targeting miR-34a-5p, providing a potential target in imatinib resistance of CML.","['Cao, Hai-Xia', 'Miao, Chao-Feng', 'Sang, Li-Na', 'Huang, Yu-Min', 'Zhang, Ran', 'Sun, Ling', 'Jiang, Zhong-Xing']","['Cao HX', 'Miao CF', 'Sang LN', 'Huang YM', 'Zhang R', 'Sun L', 'Jiang ZX']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 450052 Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Department of Vascular surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 450052 Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 450052 Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 450052 Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 450052 Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 450052 Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 450052 Zhengzhou, Henan, China.

Thus, TP53 dysfunction is implicated in malignant processes and remains the most commonly mutated gene in cancer but represents a relatively small proportion in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients with TP53-mutated AML attain inferior responses to therapy resulting in poor overall outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: Traditional treatment approaches with conventional chemotherapy yields suboptimal responses for patients with TP53 mutant AML compared with wildtype TP53. In recent years, there is increasing interest in understanding the role and underlying biology of TP53 mutations in AML with efforts to harness the physiological tumor suppressive function of TP53 protein. Novel combination and targeted therapies may contribute to improved outcomes; however, responses to therapy may be short-lived and ongoing research is indicated to evaluate relapse-risk reduction strategies. These patients may benefit from consideration of enrollment in clinical trials or lower intensity therapy approaches in lieu of intensive chemotherapy. SUMMARY: Pharmacological treatments targeting the TP53 pathway in addition to novel emerging therapeutics and immunotherapy-based approaches hold promise for treatment of TP53 mutant AML.","['Asghari, Hannah', 'Talati, Chetasi']","['Asghari H', 'Talati C']",,"['Moffitt Cancer Center.', 'University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Moffitt Cancer Center.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,,"['Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1/*genetics']",,,2020/01/11 06:00,2020/06/04 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000568 [doi]', '00062752-202003000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2020 Mar;27(2):66-75. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000568.,,,,['0 (Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: After induction with 3 fixed intravenous doses of 1,500 IU/m(2) PEGasparaginase, medium-risk patients (n = 243) received 14 individualized doses that targeted trough levels of 100-250 IU/L, standard-risk patients (n = 108) received 1 individualized dose, and high-risk patients (n = 18) received 2-5 fixed administrations (1,500 IU/m(2)). After a neutralizing hypersensitivity reaction, patients were started with 20,000 IU/m(2) Erwinia asparaginase 3 times per week, and l-asparagine was measured to monitor asparaginase efficacy. Several asparaginase-associated toxicities were studied. RESULTS: The final median PEGasparaginase dose was lowered to 450 IU/m(2). Overall, 97% of all trough levels of nonallergic patients were > 100 IU/L. Asparagine was < 0.5 muM in 96% and 67% of the PEGasparaginase and Erwinia asparaginase levels > 100 IU/L, respectively. Ten percent developed a neutralizing hypersensitivity reaction to PEGasparaginase, of which 40% were silent inactivations. The cumulative incidence of grade 3-4 pancreatitis, central neurotoxicity, and thromboses was 12%, 4%, and 6%, respectively, and not associated with asparaginase activity levels. During medium-risk intensification, 50% had increased ALT and 3% hyperbilirubinemia (both grade 3/4 and correlated with asparaginase activity levels), and 37% had grade 3/4 hypertriglyceridemia. Hypertriglyceridemia occurred less in intensification compared with ALL-10 (37% v 47%), which is similar to ALL-11 but with higher asparaginase levels during intensification. CONCLUSION: TDM of asparaginase results in a significant reduction of the PEGasparaginase dose with adequate asparaginase activity levels and sufficient asparagine depletion. In addition, with TDM, silent inactivation and allergic-like reactions were identified. However, the effect of reduced asparaginase activity levels on toxicity is limited.","['Kloos, Robin Q H', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Jumelet, Florine M V', 'de Groot-Kruseman, Hester A', 'van den Bos, Cor', 'van der Sluis, Inge M']","['Kloos RQH', 'Pieters R', 'Jumelet FMV', 'de Groot-Kruseman HA', 'van den Bos C', 'van der Sluis IM']",,"[""Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', ""Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', ""Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."", ""Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200110,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/etiology', 'Humans', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precision Medicine', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",,,2020/01/11 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.19.02292 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2020 Mar 1;38(7):715-724. doi: 10.1200/JCO.19.02292.

There are limited outcomes data for patients with a history of leukaemia who present with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: We queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2004-2014) for patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of AMI, and a concomitant diagnosis of leukaemia, and further stratified according to the subtype of leukaemia. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify the association between leukaemia and major acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE; composite of mortality, stroke and cardiac complications) and bleeding. RESULTS: Out of 6 750 878 AMI admissions, a total of 21 694 patients had a leukaemia diagnosis. The leukaemia group experienced higher rates of MACCE (11.8% vs 7.8%), mortality (10.3% vs 5.8%) and bleeding (5.6% vs 5.3%). Following adjustments, leukaemia was independently associated with increased odds of MACCE (OR 1.26 [1.20, 1.31]) and mortality (OR 1.43 [1.37, 1.50]) without an increased risk of bleeding (OR 0.86 [0.81, 0.92]). Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) was associated with approximately threefold risk of MACCE (OR 2.81 [2.51, 3.13]) and a fourfold risk of mortality (OR 3.75 [3.34, 4.22]). Patients with leukaemia were less likely to undergo coronary angiography (CA) (48.5% vs 64.5%) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (28.2% vs 42.9%) compared with those without leukaemia. CONCLUSION: Patients with leukaemia, especially those with AML, are associated with poor clinical outcomes after AMI, and are less likely to receive CA and PCI compared with those without leukaemia. A multi-disciplinary approach between cardiologists and haematology oncologists may improve the outcomes of patients with leukaemia after AMI.","['Mohamed, Mohamed O', 'Lopez-Mattei, Juan C', 'Parwani, Purvi', 'Iliescu, Cezar A', 'Bharadwaj, Aditya', 'Kim, Peter Y', 'Palaskas, Nicolas L', 'Rashid, Muhammad', 'Potts, Jessica', 'Kwok, Chun Shing', 'Gulati, Martha', 'Al Zubaidi, Abdul Majeed Brek', 'Mamas, Mamas A']","['Mohamed MO', 'Lopez-Mattei JC', 'Parwani P', 'Iliescu CA', 'Bharadwaj A', 'Kim PY', 'Palaskas NL', 'Rashid M', 'Potts J', 'Kwok CS', 'Gulati M', 'Al Zubaidi AMB', 'Mamas MA']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9678-5222', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7047-1586']","['Keele Cardiovascular Research Group, Centre for Prognosis Research, Institutes of Applied Clinical Science and Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University, Keele, UK.', 'Department of Cardiology, Royal Stoke Hospital, University Hospital North Midlands, Stoke-on-Trent, UK.', 'Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Cardiology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Cardiology, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Cardiology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Cardiology, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Cardiology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Cardiology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Keele Cardiovascular Research Group, Centre for Prognosis Research, Institutes of Applied Clinical Science and Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University, Keele, UK.', 'Keele Cardiovascular Research Group, Centre for Prognosis Research, Institutes of Applied Clinical Science and Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University, Keele, UK.', 'Keele Cardiovascular Research Group, Centre for Prognosis Research, Institutes of Applied Clinical Science and Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University, Keele, UK.', 'Division of Cardiology, University of Arizona, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Cardiology, Al Mafraq Hospital, Abu Dhabi, UAE.', 'Keele Cardiovascular Research Group, Centre for Prognosis Research, Institutes of Applied Clinical Science and Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University, Keele, UK.', 'Department of Cardiology, Royal Stoke Hospital, University Hospital North Midlands, Stoke-on-Trent, UK.', 'Institute of Population Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200120,England,Int J Clin Pract,International journal of clinical practice,9712381,IM,,"['Aged', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/*therapy', 'Patient Discharge/*statistics & numerical data', 'Stroke/etiology', 'United States']",,,2020/01/11 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijcp.13476 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Pract. 2020 May;74(5):e13476. doi: 10.1111/ijcp.13476.

METHODS: G+R banding technique was used to analyze the chromosomal karyotype of the patient after 24 h of cell culture. Combined interphase and metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to detect specific chromosomal sites for complex translocations and minor missing fragments. RESULTS: The patient was found to harbor MLL-AF10 fusion gene due to rearrangement of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene in conjunct with deletion of the D13S319 locus on chromosome 13. CONCLUSION: Whether MLL gene rearrangement and absence of D13S319 locus has a double impact on AML should attract more attention. For AML patient with clonal abnormalities such as 13q-, del(13)(q14), -13 or der(13), FISH assay should be proof and considered to determine the size of missing fragment so as targeted therapy may be implemented.","['Zhang, Zhenhao', 'Wang, Yanfang', 'Wan, Wei', 'Ke, Xiaoyan']","['Zhang Z', 'Wang Y', 'Wan W', 'Ke X']",,"['Department of Hematology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China. xiaoyank@yahoo.com.']",['chi'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,IM,,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Metaphase', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2020/01/11 06:00,2020/01/14 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['940637013 [pii]', '10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2020.01.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Jan 10;37(1):48-51. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2020.01.013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the upper age limit for allogeneic stem cell transplantation is constantly increasing, so that this procedure is offered and actually given to an increasing number of older patients with AML. A literature review was conducted of the PubMed database for articles published in English as well as for abstracts from most important and recent hematology meetings on AML in older patients.Expert opinion: Appropriate selection among different options on the basis of clinical fitness and molecular findings at diagnosis as well as at relapse would result in improvement of therapeutic results, sparing unnecessary toxicity and optimizing health systems resources.","['Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Picardi, Alessandra']","['Ferrara F', 'Picardi A']",,"['Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Program, AORN Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Program, AORN Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Video-Audio Media']",20200122,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allografts', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*geriatric assessment', '*new drugs', '*older patients']",2020/01/11 06:00,2021/01/22 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2020.1715207 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2020 Feb;13(2):99-108. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2020.1715207.

Hematologic cancer cell lines (Raji, K562 and Jurkat) were treated with IFA in a dosedependent manner and proliferation was measured by a cell proliferation assay. Cell cycle arrest was detected via flow cytometry using propidium iodide (PI) staining. Cell apoptosis and apoptosisassociated signal pathways were analyzed via Annexin V/PI staining and western blot assays, respectively. IFA inhibited cell viability, induced cell apoptosis and triggered cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase in Raji, K562, and Jurkat cells in a dosedependent manner. In response to IFA treatment, the levels of cleaved poly(ADPribose) polymerase and cleaved caspase3 were increased in Jurkat and K562 cells, which was associated with increased phosphorylation of Cdc2 and reduction of Cyclin B1 levels. IFA remarkably attenuated the phosphorylation of mTOR and Akt in Jurkat cells. Collectively, the present data suggested that IFA had therapeutic effects on Jurkat, K562, and Raji cells, indicating it as a promising candidate for the treatment of hematologic malignancy.","['Long, Zhiguo', 'Feng, Guangjia', 'Zhao, Na', 'Wu, Lei', 'Zhu, Hongbo']","['Long Z', 'Feng G', 'Zhao N', 'Wu L', 'Zhu H']",,"['Department of Hematology, Shanghai Pudong Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 201399, P.R.

AML can escape immunosurveillance of natural killer (NK) by gene mutation, fusions and epigenetic modification. The mechanism of AML immune evasion is not clearly understood. Here we show that CD48 high expression is a favorable prognosis factor that is down-regulated in AML patients, which can help AML evade from NK cell recognition and killing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CD48 expression is regulated by methylation and that a hypomethylating agent can increase the CD48 expression, which increases the NK cells killing in vitro. Finally, we show that CD48 high expression can reverse the AML immune evasion and activate NK cells function in vivo. The present study suggests that a combination the hypomethylating agent and NK cell infusion could be a new strategy to cure AML.","['Wang, Zhiding', 'Xiao, Yang', 'Guan, Wei', 'Wang, Mengzhen', 'Chen, Jinghong', 'Zhang, Linlin', 'Li, Yan', 'Xiong, Qian', 'Wang, Hong', 'Wang, Maoquan', 'Li, Yuyan', 'Lv, Na', 'Li, Yonghui', 'Wang, Lixin', 'Yu, Li']","['Wang Z', 'Xiao Y', 'Guan W', 'Wang M', 'Chen J', 'Zhang L', 'Li Y', 'Xiong Q', 'Wang H', 'Wang M', 'Li Y', 'Lv N', 'Li Y', 'Wang L', 'Yu L']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Clin Sci (Lond),"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",7905731,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'CD48 Antigen/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Decitabine/pharmacology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Gene Silencing/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Tumor Escape/genetics/*immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CD48', 'Methylation', 'NK']",2020/01/11 06:00,2020/02/11 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['221833 [pii]', '10.1042/CS20191170 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Sci (Lond). 2020 Jan 31;134(2):261-271. doi: 10.1042/CS20191170.,,,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CD48 Antigen)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']","['(c) 2020 The Author(s).

The IGH enhancer on 14q32 is juxtaposed to the IL3 gene on 5q31, leading to interleukin-3 overproduction and release of mature eosinophils in the blood. Clinical, biological and outcome data are extremely scarce in the literature. Except for eosinophilia, no relevant common feature has been highlighted in these patients. However, it has been classified as a distinct entity in the World Health Organization classification. Cases Presentation: Eight patients with t(5;14)(q31;q32) treated by French or Austrian protocols were retrospectively enrolled. Array comparative genomic hybridization, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification or genomic PCR search for IKZF1 deletion were performed in 7. Sixteen patients found through an exhaustive search in the literature were also analyzed. For those 24 patients, median age at diagnosis is 14.3 years with a male predominance (male to female ratio = 5). Eosinophilia-related symptoms are common (neurologic in 26%, thromboembolic in 26% or pulmonary in 50%). Median white blood cells count is high (72 x 10(9)/L) and linked to eosinophilia (median: 32 x 10(9)/L). Peripheral blasts are present at a low level or absent (median: 0 x 10(9)/L; range: 0-37 x 10(9)/L). Bone marrow morphology is marked by a low blast infiltration (median: 42%). We found an IKZF1 deletion in 5 out of 7 analyzable patients Outcome data are available for 14 patients (median follow-up: 28 months): 8 died and 6 are alive in complete remission. Some of these features are concordant with those seen in patients with other IGH-rearranged B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias: young age at onset, male sex, low blast count, high incidence of IKZF1 deletion and intermediate prognosis. Conclusion: Based on shared epidemiological and biological features, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with t(5;14)(q31;q32) is a peculiar subset of IGH-rearranged B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with an intermediate prognosis and particular clinical features related to eosinophilia.","['Fournier, Benjamin', 'Balducci, Estelle', 'Duployez, Nicolas', 'Clappier, Emmanuelle', 'Cuccuini,

In total, 513 lung adenocarcinoma samples from TCGA and ImmPort databases were collected and analyzed. The R package coxph was employed to mine immune-related genes that were significant prognostic indicators using both univariate and multivariate analyses. The R software package glmnet was then used for Lasso Cox regression analysis, and a prognosis prediction model was constructed for lung adenocarcinoma; clusterProfiler was selected for functional gene annotations and KEGG enrichment analysis. Finally, correlations between the RiskScore and clinical features or signaling pathways were established. Sixty-four immune-related genes remarkably correlated with patient prognosis and were further applied. Samples were hierarchically clustered into two subgroups. Accordingly, the LASSO regression algorithm was employed to screen the 14 most representative immune-related genes (PSMD11, PPIA, MIF, BMP5, DKK1, PDGFB, ANGPTL4, IL1R2, THRB, LTBR, TNFRSF1, TNFRSF17, IL20RB, and MC1R) with respect to patient prognosis. Then, the prognosis prediction model for lung adenocarcinoma patients (namely, the RiskScore equation) was constructed, and the training set samples were incorporated to evaluate the efficiency of this model to predict and classify patient prognosis. Subsequently, based on functional annotations and KEGG pathway analysis, the 14 immune-related genes were mainly enriched in pathways closely associated with lung adenocarcinoma and its immune microenvironment, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection. Furthermore, correlations between the RiskScore and clinical features of the training set samples and signaling pathways (such as p53, cell cycle, and DNA repair) were also demonstrated. Finally, the test set sample data were employed for independent testing and verifying the model. We established a prognostic prediction RiskScore model based on the expression profiles of 14 immune-related genes, which shows high prediction accuracy and stability in identifying immune features. This could provide clinical guidance for the diagnosis and prognosis of different immunophenotypes, and suggest multiple targets for precise advanced lung adenocarcinoma therapy based on subtype-specific immune molecules.","['Zhang, Minghui', 'Zhu, Kaibin', 'Pu, Haihong', 'Wang, Zhuozhong', 'Zhao, Hongli', 'Zhang, Jinfeng', 'Wang, Yan']","['Zhang M', 'Zhu K', 'Pu H', 'Wang Z', 'Zhao H', 'Zhang J', 'Wang Y']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191210,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['hierarchal clustering', 'immunophenotypes', 'lung adenocarcinoma', 'patient prognosis', 'riskscore']",2020/01/11 06:00,2020/01/11 06:01,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01314 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Dec 10;9:1314. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01314. eCollection 2019.,PMC6914845,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2019 Zhang, Zhu, Pu, Wang, Zhao, Zhang and Wang.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additional novel therapies are showing promising clinical results and may rapidly transform the therapeutic landscape of AML. Despite the emerging clinical success of B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-2 targeting in AML and a large body of preclinical data supporting myeloid leukemia cell (MCL)-1 as an attractive therapeutic target for AML, MCL-1 targeting remains relatively unexplored, although novel MCL-1 inhibitors are under clinical investigation. Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) involved in the regulation of transcription, CDK9 in particular, are being investigated in AML as a strategy to target MCL-1 indirectly.

We also analyzed the response of newly diagnosed AML patients to standard DA or IA induction chemotherapy and the relationship between the chemotherapy outcome and the frequency of different gene mutation abnormalities. Methods: NGS assay covering 43 genes was studied in 93 de novo MDS and 325 non-M3 AML patients. Bone marrow samples from all patients underwent gene mutational analysis by NGS. Results: At least one non-synonymous gene mutation was detected in 279 AML patients (85.8%) and 85 MDS patients (91.4%). Contrary to 59 years and younger AML patients, there was a significantly higher incidence of gene mutation in 60 years and older AML patients (2.37 vs 1.94, p = 0.034). Gene mutation incidence in 60 years and older MDS patients increased, but no statistical significance was present (1.95 vs 1.64, p = 0.216). AML patients had a significantly higher gene mutation incidence compared with MDS-MLD patients (2.02 vs 1.63, p = 0.046).

AML patients had significantly higher incidences of CEBPA, FLT3-ITD, DNMT3A, NPM1 and IDH1/2 gene mutations (p = 0.0043, 0.000, 0.030962, 0.002752, and 0.000628, respectively) and a lower incidence of TET2 and U2AF1 gene mutations (p = 0.000004 and 0.000, respectively) compared with MDS patients. Among the individual genes in different age groups, there were significantly higher incidences of RUNX1, IDH2, TP53 and SF3B1 gene mutations (p = 0.0478, 0.0028, 0.0024 and 0.005, respectively) as well as a trend of higher ASXL gene mutation (p = 0.057) in 60 years and older AML patients compared to 59 years and younger patients. There was no statistically significant difference in MDS patients with the different age groups and among the individual genes. Between AML patients and MDS patients among the different gene functional groups, AML patients had a significantly higher incidence of transcriptional deregulation (27.4% vs 15.1%, p = 0.014963), activated signalling (36.3% vs 10.8%, p = 0.000002) related gene mutations as well as a significantly lower incidence of RNA spliceosome (6.15% vs 60.1%, p = 0.000) related gene mutations. Furthermore, among the patients who received either IA or DA regimen for induction chemotherapy, patients with IA regimen had a significantly better CR rate than those with DA regimen (76.6% vs 57.1%, p = 0.0228). Conclusions: Different gene mutations had been found in majority of MDS and AML patients. MDS and AML patients had different gene mutation patterns. AML patients with fewer or no gene mutations had a better chance of achieving CR when treated with IA and DA regimen induction chemotherapy.","['Yu, Jifeng', 'Li, Yingmei', 'Li, Tao', 'Li, Yafei', 'Xing, Haizhou', 'Sun, Hui', 'Sun, Ling', 'Wan, Dingming', 'Liu, Yanfang', 'Xie, Xinsheng', 'Jiang, Zhongxing']","['Yu J', 'Li Y', 'Li T', 'Li Y', 'Xing H', 'Sun H', 'Sun L', 'Wan D', 'Liu Y', 'Xie X', 'Jiang Z']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1217-4385'],"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 1 East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou, 450052 China.grid.412633.1', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 1 East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou, 450052 China.grid.412633.1', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 1 East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou, 450052 China.grid.412633.1', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 1 East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou, 450052 China.grid.412633.1', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 1 East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou, 450052 China.grid.412633.1', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 1 East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou, 450052 China.grid.412633.1', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 1 East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou, 450052 China.grid.412633.1', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 1 East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou, 450052 China.grid.412633.1', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 1 East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou, 450052 China.grid.412633.1', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 1 East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou, 450052 China.grid.412633.1', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 1 East Jianshe Road, Zhengzhou, 450052 China.grid.412633.1']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200106,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Clinical outcome', 'Gene mutation', 'Induction chemotherapy', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome', 'Next generation sequencing']",2020/01/11 06:00,2020/01/11 06:01,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-019-0158-5 [doi]', '158 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2020 Jan 6;9:2. doi: 10.1186/s40164-019-0158-5. eCollection 2020.,PMC6945703,"['Competing interestsThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the', 'absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as', 'potential competing interests.']",,,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Radiological assessment of pneumonia severity may serve as an effective intermediate endpoint to reduce barriers to successful completion of antimicrobial trials. We sought to determine whether the Radiologic Severity Index (RSI) correlated with mortality and healthcare resource utilisation in patients with acute leukaemia undergoing induction chemotherapy. Methods: We measured RSI (range 0-72) on all chest radiographs performed within 33 days of induction chemotherapy in 165 haematological malignancy patients with pneumonia. Peak RSI was defined as the highest RSI score within 33 days of induction. We used extended Cox proportional hazards models to measure the association of time-varying RSI with all-cause mortality within the first 33 days after induction chemotherapy, and logistic regression or generalised models to measure the association of RSI with total daily cost and healthcare resource utilisation. Results: After adjustment for clinical variables, each one-point increase in RSI was associated with a 7% increase in all-cause 33-day mortality (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.09, p<0.0001). Peak RSI values of 37.5 or higher were associated with 86% higher daily direct costs (p<0.0001), more days in intensive care unit (9.9 vs 4.8 days, p=0.001) and higher odds for mechanical ventilation (OR 12.1, p<0.0001). Conclusions: Greater radiological severity as measured by RSI was associated with increased mortality and morbidity in acute leukaemia patients with pneumonia. RSI is a promising intermediate marker of pneumonia severity and is well suited for use in antimicrobial trials.","['Sheshadri, Ajay', 'Godoy, Myrna', 'Erasmus, Jeremy J', 'Gruschkus, Stephen', 'Hasan, Arain', 'Evans, Scott E', 'Barreda-Garcia, Javier', 'Chemaly, Roy F', 'Dickey, Burton', 'Ost, David']","['Sheshadri A', 'Godoy M', 'Erasmus JJ', 'Gruschkus S', 'Hasan A', 'Evans SE', 'Barreda-Garcia J', 'Chemaly RF', 'Dickey B', 'Ost D']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8091-0180'],"['Pulmonary Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Diagnostic Imaging, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Diagnostic Imaging, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Pulmonary Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Pulmonary Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Pulmonary Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Pulmonary Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Pulmonary Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191223,England,BMJ Open Respir Res,BMJ open respiratory research,101638061,,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Infective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units/statistics & numerical data', 'Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Lung/*diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Pneumonia/*diagnosis/etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Radiology', 'Remission Induction', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Risk Assessment', '*Severity of Illness Index']",['NOTNLM'],"['*imaging/CT MRI etc', '*pneumonia', '*respiratory infection']",2020/01/11 06:00,2020/07/04 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1136/bmjresp-2019-000471 [doi]', 'bmjresp-2019-000471 [pii]']",epublish,BMJ Open Respir Res. 2019 Dec 23;6(1):e000471. doi: 10.1136/bmjresp-2019-000471. eCollection 2019.,PMC6937103,"['Competing interests: SEE and BD are inventors of a technology to deliver', 'aerosolised TLR ligands to induce resistance to microbial infection of the lungs;', 'this technology has been licensed by MD Anderson Cancer Center to Pulmotect', '(Houston, Texas, USA), in which SEE and BD have ownership interests, and which', 'has sponsored research in the laboratories of BD.

Recognition of neoantigens presented via human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules on the tumor cell surface by T cells holds promise to enable highly specific and effective anti-cancer immune responses and thus neoantigens provide an exceptionally attractive target for immunotherapy. While genome sequencing approaches already enable the reliable identification of somatic mutations in tumor samples, the identification of mutation-derived, naturally HLA-presented neoepitopes as targets for immunotherapy remains challenging, particularly in low mutational burden cancer entities, including hematological malignancies. Several approaches have been utilized to identify neoepitopes from primary tumor samples. Besides whole genome sequencing with subsequent in silico prediction of potential mutation-derived HLA ligands, mass spectrometry (MS) allows for the only unbiased identification of naturally presented mutation-derived HLA ligands. The feasibility of characterizing and targeting these novel antigens has recently been demonstrated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Several immunogenic, HLA-presented peptides derived from mutated Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) were identified, allowing for the generation of T-cell receptor-transduced NPM1(mut)-specific T cells with anti-leukemic activity in a xenograft mouse model. Neoantigen-specific T-cell responses have also been identified for peptides derived from mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH(mut)), and specific T-cell responses could be induced by IDH(mut) peptide vaccination. In this review, we give a comprehensive overview on known neoantigens in hematological malignancies, present possible prediction and discovery tools and discuss their role as targets for immunotherapy approaches.","['Roerden, Malte', 'Nelde, Annika', 'Walz, Juliane S']","['Roerden M', 'Nelde A', 'Walz JS']",,"['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute for Cell Biology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute for Cell Biology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute for Cell Biology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20191220,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*instrumentation', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Peptides/*immunology', '*T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HLA antigens', '*NPM1 mutations', '*hematological malignancies', '*immunopeptidomics', '*mass spectrometry', '*neoantigens']",2020/01/11 06:00,2020/11/06 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.03004 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Dec 20;10:3004. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.03004. eCollection 2019.,PMC6934135,,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']","['Copyright (c) 2019 Roerden, Nelde and Walz.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of hematologic cancers using allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) serendipitously led to the discovery that T cells specific for minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHAs) could cure hematopoietic cancers. Besides, studies based on treatment of solid tumor with ex vivo-expanded tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or immune checkpoint therapy demonstrated that anti-tumor responses could be achieved by targeting tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). It is our contention that much insight can be gained by sharing the tremendous amount of data generated in the two-abovementioned universes. Our perspective article has two specific goals.

Preclinical models proved that adoptive transfer of Tregs or the use of compounds that can favor their function in vivo are effective for prevention and treatment of graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD). Following these findings, Treg-based therapies have been employed in clinical trials. Adoptive immunotherapy with Tregs effectively prevents GvHD induced by alloreactive T cells in the setting of one HLA haplotype mismatched hematopoietic transplantation. The absence of post transplant pharmacologic immunosuppression unleashes T-cell mediated graft-vs.-tumor (GvT) effect, which results in an unprecedented, almost complete control of leukemia relapse in this setting. In the present review, we will report preclinical studies and clinical trials that demonstrate Treg ability to promote donor engraftment, protect from GvHD and improve GvT effect. We will also discuss new strategies to further enhance in vivo efficacy of Treg-based therapies.","['Mancusi, Antonella', 'Piccinelli, Sara', 'Velardi, Andrea', 'Pierini, Antonio']","['Mancusi A', 'Piccinelli S', 'Velardi A', 'Pierini A']",,"['Hematology and Clinical Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20191217,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Allografts', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology/*therapy', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', '*T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/transplantation']",['NOTNLM'],"['*allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation', '*engraftment', '*graft-vs.-host-disease', '*graft-vs.-tumor effect', '*regulatory T cells', '*tolerance']",2020/01/11 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.02901 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Dec 17;10:2901. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02901. eCollection 2019.,PMC6927932,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2019 Mancusi, Piccinelli, Velardi and Pierini.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the factors that determine the sensitivity or resistance of leukemia cells in the context of NK-mediated cytotoxicity are not well-established. Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen in the human chronic-myelogenous-leukemia (CML) cell line K562 to identify genes that regulate the vulnerability of leukemia cells to killing by primary human NK cells. The distribution of guide RNAs (gRNAs) in K562 cells that survived co-incubation with NK cells showed that loss of NCR3LG1, which encodes the ligand of the natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp30, protected K562 cells from killing. In contrast, loss of genes that regulate the antigen-presentation and interferon-gamma-signaling pathways increased the vulnerability of K562 cells. The addition of IFN-gamma neutralizing antibody increased the susceptibility of K562 cells to NK-mediated killing. Upregulation of MHC class I on K562 cells after co-incubation with NK cells was dependent on IFNGR2. Analysis of RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed that low IFNGR2 expression in cancer tissues was associated with improved overall survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) patients. Our results, showing that the upregulation of MHC class I by NK-derived IFN-gamma leads to resistance to NK cytotoxicity, suggest that targeting IFN-gamma responses might be a promising approach to enhance NK cell anti-cancer efficacy.","['Zhuang, Xiaoxuan', 'Veltri, Daniel P', 'Long, Eric O']","['Zhuang X', 'Veltri DP', 'Long EO']",,"['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD, United States.', 'Bioinformatics and Computational Biosciences Branch, Office of Cyber Infrastructure and Computational Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD, United States.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20191211,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,,"['B7 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', '*Carcinoma, Renal Cell/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', '*Interferon-gamma/genetics/immunology', 'K562 Cells', 'Kidney Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 3/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Interferon/genetics/immunology', '*Tumor Escape']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CRISPR screen', '*IFN-gamma', '*IFNGR2', '*MHC class I', '*anti-leukemia activity', '*natural killer cells']",2020/01/11 06:00,2020/10/23 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.02879 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Dec 11;10:2879. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02879. eCollection 2019.,PMC6917608,,,"['0 (B7 Antigens)', '0 (IFNG protein, human)', '0 (IFNGR2 protein, human)', '0 (NCR3 protein, human)', '0 (NCR3LG1 protein, human)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 3)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']","['Copyright (c) 2019 Zhuang, Veltri and Long.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent data shows that immunotherapy with either bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells can eliminate residual chemotherapy-resistant B-ALL cells. Objective: The objective of the manuscript is to present improvements in the clinical outcome for chemotherapy-resistant ALL in the real-life setting, by describing Romania's experience with bispecific antibodies for B-cell ALL. Methods: We present the role of novel therapies for relapsed B-cell ALL, including the drugs under investigation in phase I-III clinical trials, as a potential bridge to transplant. Blinatumomab is presented in a critical review, presenting both the advantages of this drug, as well as its limitations. Results: Bispecific antibodies are discussed, describing the clinical trials that resulted in its approval by the FDA and EMA. The real-life setting for relapsed B-cell ALL is described and we present the patients treated with blinatumomab in Romania. Conclusion: In the current manuscript, we present blinatumomab as a therapeutic alternative in the bridge-to-transplant setting for refractory or relapsed ALL, to gain a better understanding of the available therapies and evidence-based data for these patients in 2019.","['Deak, Dalma', 'Pop, Cristina', 'Zimta, Alina-Andreea', 'Jurj, Ancuta', 'Ghiaur, Alexandra', 'Pasca, Sergiu', 'Teodorescu, Patric', 'Dascalescu, Angela', 'Antohe, Ion', 'Ionescu, Bogdan', 'Constantinescu, Catalin', 'Onaciu, Anca', 'Munteanu, Raluca', 'Berindan-Neagoe, Ioana', 'Petrushev, Bobe', 'Turcas, Cristina', 'Iluta, Sabina', 'Selicean, Cristina', 'Zdrenghea, Mihnea', 'Tanase, Alina', 'Danaila, Catalin', 'Colita, Anca', 'Colita, Andrei', 'Dima, Delia', 'Coriu, Daniel', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Tomuleasa, Ciprian']","['Deak D', 'Pop C', 'Zimta AA', 'Jurj A', 'Ghiaur A', 'Pasca S', 'Teodorescu P', 'Dascalescu A', 'Antohe I', 'Ionescu B', 'Constantinescu C', 'Onaciu A', 'Munteanu R', 'Berindan-Neagoe I', 'Petrushev B', 'Turcas C', 'Iluta S', 'Selicean C', 'Zdrenghea M', 'Tanase A', 'Danaila C', 'Colita A', 'Colita A', 'Dima D', 'Coriu D', 'Einsele H', 'Tomuleasa C']",,"['Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta Clinical Cancer Center, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Research Center for Advanced Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Grigore T.

CD8(+) T cell numbers are increased and demonstrate elevated expression of PD-1 and impaired function. The mechanisms driving these features of exhaustion are uncertain but are likely to include chronic immune recognition of tumor and/or infectious agents. We investigated the number, phenotype and function of total and virus-specific CD8+ T cells in 65 patients with CLL and 14 patients undergoing long-term ibrutinib therapy (median 21 months). Ibrutinib substantially reduced the number of both CD3+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. Importantly, this was associated with a reduction in PD-1 expression on CD8+ T cells (median 28 vs. 24%; p = 0.042) and 3.5 fold increase in cytokine production following mitogen stimulation. The influence of ibrutinib on antigen-specific CD8+ T cell function was assessed by HLA-peptide tetramers and revealed increased IFNgamma and TNFalpha cytokine responses following stimulation with CMV or EBV peptides together with a 55% reduction in the frequency of ""inflated"" virus-specific CD8+ T cells. These findings reveal that long-term ibrutinib therapy is associated with substantial reversal of T cell exhaustion in B-CLL and is likely to contribute to the reduced infection risk seen in association with this agent.","['Parry, Helen M', 'Mirajkar, Nikhil', 'Cutmore, Natasha', 'Zuo, Jianmin', 'Long, Heather', 'Kwok, Marwan', 'Oldrieve, Ceri', 'Hudson, Chris', 'Stankovic, Tatjana', 'Paneesha, Shankara', 'Kelly, Melanie', 'Begum, Jusnara', 'McSkeane, Tina', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Moss, Paul']","['Parry HM', 'Mirajkar N', 'Cutmore N', 'Zuo J', 'Long H', 'Kwok M', 'Oldrieve C', 'Hudson C', 'Stankovic T', 'Paneesha S', 'Kelly M', 'Begum J', 'McSkeane T', 'Pratt G', 'Moss P']",,"['Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Queen Elizabeth Hospital, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', ""St James' University Hospital, Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust, Leeds, United Kingdom."", 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Heartlands Hospital, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Heartlands Hospital, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Queen Elizabeth Hospital, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191212,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Duration of Therapy', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptides/immunology', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CD8 T cells', '*EBV-epstein-barr virus', '*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)', '*cytomegalovirus', '*exhaustion', '*herpes viruses', '*ibrutinib', '*immunotherapy']",2020/01/11 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.02832 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Dec 12;10:2832. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02832. eCollection 2019.,PMC6921985,,['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']","['Copyright (c) 2019 Parry, Mirajkar, Cutmore, Zuo, Long, Kwok, Oldrieve, Hudson,', 'Stankovic, Paneesha, Kelly, Begum, McSkeane, Pratt and Moss.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, limited research has investigated family adjustment when facing pediatric cancer. The aim of the current study was to explore the role of protective factors at the individual (parental psychological flexibility), intrafamilial (dyadic coping) and contextual level (network support) in explaining family adjustment as perceived by parents of children with leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In addition, we were interested to see whether these protective factors could be predictive for family adjustment at a later time point. Method: Participants were 70 mothers and 53 fathers (80 families) of children with leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Mean time since diagnosis was 5.26 (T1) and 18.86 (T2) months post-diagnosis. Parents completed the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II (to assess psychological flexibility), Dyadic Coping Inventory, a network support questionnaire, Impact on Family Scale and the Family Adjustment Scale. Both concurrent and prospective association models were tested. Results: Psychological flexibility, dyadic coping and network support proved to be cross-sectionally and positively related to parents' perception of family adjustment post-diagnosis; psychological flexibility and dyadic coping proved to predict better family adjustment over time. Conclusion: Our findings led to the conclusion that protective factors at all three levels (individual, intrafamilial and contextual) are important for explaining family adjustment as perceived by parents facing a diagnosis of cancer in their child. Interventions targeting the individual, couple, as well as family level are warranted to enhance family adjustment.","['Van Schoors, Marieke', 'De Paepe, Annick Lena', 'Lemiere, Jurgen', 'Morez, Ann', 'Norga, Koenraad', 'Lambrecht, Karolien', 'Goubert, Liesbet', 'Verhofstadt, Lesley L']","['Van Schoors M', 'De Paepe AL', 'Lemiere J', 'Morez A', 'Norga K', 'Lambrecht K', 'Goubert L', 'Verhofstadt LL']",,"['Department of Experimental Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Experimental Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Antwerp University Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology and Immunology, University Hospital Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Experimental Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Experimental Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191210,Switzerland,Front Psychol,Frontiers in psychology,101550902,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['dyadic coping', 'family', 'network support', 'parents', 'pediatric cancer', 'psychological flexibility']",2020/01/11 06:00,2020/01/11 06:01,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02740 [doi]'],epublish,Front Psychol. 2019 Dec 10;10:2740. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02740. eCollection 2019.,PMC6914864,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2019 Van Schoors, De Paepe, Lemiere, Morez, Norga, Lambrecht,', 'Goubert and Verhofstadt.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to identify the SE-associated hub genes associated with the clinical characteristics of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Methods: Eigengenes from CML clinical modules were determined using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Overlapping genes between eigengenes and SE-associated genes were used to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and annotate for pathway enrichment analysis. Expression patterns of the top-ranked SE-associated hub genes were further determined in CML patients and healthy controls via real-time PCR. After treatment of K562 cells with the BRD4 inhibitor, JQ1, for 24 hrs, mRNA and protein levels of SE-associated hub genes were evaluated using real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and BRD4 ChIP-seq signal peaks were used to predict and identify SEs visualized by the Integrative Genomics Viewer. Results: The yellow module was significantly related to the status and pathological phase of CML. SE-associated hub candidate genes were mainly enriched in the cell cycle pathway. Based on the PPI networks of hub genes and the top rank of degree, five SE-associated genes were identified: specifically, BUB1, CENPO, KIF2C, ORC1, and RRM2. Elevated expression of these five genes was not only related to CML status and phase but also positively regulated by SE and suppressed by the BRD4 inhibitor, JQ1, in K562 cells. Strong signal peaks of H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and BRD4 ChIP-seq of the five genes were additionally observed close to the predicted SE regions. Conclusion: This is the first study to characterize SE-associated genes linked to clinical characteristics of CML via weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Our results support a novel mechanism involving aberrant expression of hub SE-associated genes in CML patients and K562 cells, and these genes will be potential new therapeutic targets for human leukemia.","['Ma, Hongying', 'Qu, Jian', 'Luo, Jian', 'Qi, Tingting', 'Tan, Huanmiao', 'Jiang, Zhaohui', 'Zhang, Haiwen', 'Qu, Qiang']","['Ma H', 'Qu J', 'Luo J', 'Qi T', 'Tan H', 'Jiang Z', 'Zhang H', 'Qu Q']",,"[""Department of Pharmacy, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute for Rational and Safe Medication Practices, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410078, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute for Rational and Safe Medication Practices, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410078, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha 410128, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute for Rational and Safe Medication Practices, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, Hunan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191223,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['WGCNA', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'eigengene', 'hub gene', 'super-enhancer']",2020/01/11 06:00,2020/01/11 06:01,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S214614 [doi]', '214614 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2019 Dec 23;11:10705-10718. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S214614. eCollection 2019.,PMC6934127,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,['(c) 2019 Ma et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, kinase inhibitors, such as the BCR-ABL and BRAF inhibitors, have markedly improved the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and melanoma. In this review, we discuss the special challenges posed by poor adherence, drug-drug interactions with other substances, and side effects, among other problems, and the ways in which these challenges can be met. METHODS: A selective search was carried out in PubMed for original and review articles on the safety of new oral anti-cancer drugs. Guidelines and current Summaries of Product Characteristics (SmPC) were also considered in the analysis. RESULTS: Review articles have pointed out numerous safety concerns with oral anti-cancer drugs. One of these is adherence, on which highly variable figures are available (with mean non-adherence rates ranging from 0 to 54%). The absorption of approximately half of these drugs is influenced by the patient's diet, and that of approximately 20% by gastric pH (Caution: proton-pump inhibitors may influence bioavailability). 70% of the active substances are metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, which means that their pharmacokinetics can be altered by grapefruit juice and CYP3A4 modulators. The prevention, detection, and treatment of side effects (which can be gastrointestinal, cutaneous, cardiovascular, or other) is a highly important matter. CONCLUSION: The increasing use of oral anti-cancer drugs confronts patients and treatment teams with special challenges. To optimize treatment outcomes, a multidisciplinary approach should be taken, involving physicians, pharmacists, and nurses. To improve medication safety, medication and side-effect management should be performed, and adherence should be regularly checked and systematically encouraged.","['Schlichtig, Katja', 'Durr, Pauline', 'Dorje, Frank', 'Fromm, Martin F']","['Schlichtig K', 'Durr P', 'Dorje F', 'Fromm MF']",,"['Chair of Clinical Pharmacology and Clinical Toxicology, Institute for Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen; Pharmacy, University Hospital Erlangen; Comprehensive Cancer Center Erlangen-European Metropolitan Region of Nuremberg (EMN), Erlangen.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,IM,['Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2020 Mar 27;117(13):222.

CASE REPORT: An adult female koala was presented for rapidly deteriorating health and death of a pouch young. Significant weight loss was apparent despite supplemental feeding; the abdomen was distended; and the koala was weak and mentally depressed. Haematology revealed a significant mastocytosis with a concurrent population of atypical mononuclear cells. The koala was euthanised and tissues were collected for histology. Bone marrow, lymph node, lung, stomach and spleen exhibited significant infiltration by mast cells. Atypical round cells consistent with those identified in the peripheral blood were also identified in the marrow. A diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis and probable mast cell leukaemia was made. Immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical staining was not able to further characterise the atypical cell population, and the mast cells exhibited only weak staining with CD117. CONCLUSION: The histological diagnosis, in this case, was systemic mastocytosis and myeloproliferative disease of uncertain origin. There was a dominant population of mast cells in the peripheral blood and marrow, and a population of circulating atypical mononuclear cells, appearing similar to mast cell leukaemia-acute myeloid leukaemia in humans.","['Phillips, C A', 'Jaensch, S', 'Hayward, D']","['Phillips CA', 'Jaensch S', 'Hayward D']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9911-4133'],"['Wyoming Greencross Vets, 24 Cary Street, Wyoming, New South Wales, 2250, Australia.', 'Vetnostics, 60 Waterloo Road, Macquarie Park, New South Wales, 2113, Australia.', 'Vetnostics, 60 Waterloo Road, Macquarie Park, New South Wales, 2113, Australia.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200109,England,Aust Vet J,Australian veterinary journal,0370616,IM,,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/*veterinary', 'Mast Cells', 'Mastocytosis/*veterinary', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*veterinary', '*Phascolarctidae']",['NOTNLM'],"['Phascolarctos cinereus', 'koala', 'mast cell neoplasia']",2020/01/11 06:00,2020/07/02 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/avj.12904 [doi]'],ppublish,Aust Vet J. 2020 Mar;98(3):96-99. doi: 10.1111/avj.12904.

Daratumumab is a humanized IgG1kappa CD38 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) which has demonstrated impressive single agent activity even in relapsed refractory MM patients as well as strong synergy with other anti-MM drugs. Natural Killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic immune effector cells that mediate in vivo tumour immunosurveillance. NK cells also play an important role during MoAb therapy by inducing antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) via their FcgammaRIII (CD16) receptor. Furthermore, 15% of the population express a naturally occurring variant of CD16 harbouring a single-point polymorphism (F158V). However, the contribution of NK cells to the efficacy of daratumumab remains debatable as clinical data clearly indicate the rapid depletion of CD38(high) peripheral blood NK cells in patients upon daratumumab administration. In contrast, CD38(low) peripheral blood NK cells have been shown to survive daratumumab mediated fratricide in vivo, while still retaining their potent anti-MM cytolytic effector functions ex vivo. Therefore, we hypothesize that transiently expressing the CD16(F158V) receptor using a ""safe"" mRNA electroporation-based approach on CD38(low) NK cells in combination with daratumumab could represent a novel therapeutic option for treatment of MM. In the present study, we investigate a NK cell line (KHYG-1), derived from a patient with aggressive NK cell leukemia, as a platform for generating CD38(low) NK cells expressing CD16(F158V) which can be administered as an ""off-the-shelf"" therapy to target both CD38(high) and CD38(low) tumour clones in patients receiving daratumumab.","['Sarkar, Subhashis', 'Chauhan, Sachin K S', 'Daly, John', 'Natoni, Alessandro', 'Fairfield, Heather', 'Henderson, Robert', 'Nolan, Emma', 'Swan, Dawn', 'Hu, Jinsong', 'Reagan, Michaela R', ""O'Dwyer, Michael""]","['Sarkar S', 'Chauhan SKS', 'Daly J', 'Natoni A', 'Fairfield H', 'Henderson R', 'Nolan E', 'Swan D', 'Hu J', 'Reagan MR', ""O'Dwyer M""]",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6173-7140'],"['Apoptosis Research Centre, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Newcastle Road, Galway, H91 W2TY, Ireland.', 'ONK Therapeutics Ltd., Galway, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Newcastle Road, Galway, H91 W2TY, Ireland.', 'ONK Therapeutics Ltd., Galway, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Newcastle Road, Galway, H91 W2TY, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Newcastle Road, Galway, H91 W2TY, Ireland.', 'Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Scarborough, ME, USA.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Newcastle Road, Galway, H91 W2TY, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Newcastle Road, Galway, H91 W2TY, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Newcastle Road, Galway, H91 W2TY, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Newcastle Road, Galway, H91 W2TY, Ireland.', 'Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Scarborough, ME, USA.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Newcastle Road, Galway, H91 W2TY, Ireland. michael.odwyer@nuigalway.ie.', 'ONK Therapeutics Ltd., Galway, Ireland. michael.odwyer@nuigalway.ie.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200109,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, IgG/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['ADCC', 'Daratumumab', 'Multiple myeloma', 'NK cells']",2020/01/11 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00262-019-02477-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-019-02477-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2020 Mar;69(3):421-434. doi: 10.1007/s00262-019-02477-8.

Moreover, little is known about the role of stem cell transplantation (SCT) in such patients. METHODS: Clinical data of patients with AML under 18 years of age were retrieved from the TARGET dataset. We analyzed the prevalence, clinical profile, molecular characteristics, and prognosis of MS in these patients. RESULTS: Among 884 pediatric patients with AML, the frequency of MS was 12.3%. Pediatric AML with MS was associated with age under 1-year, abnormal cytogenetics, and KMT2A rearrangement. Moreover, MS was associated with a low complete remission rate, high induction death, poor 5-year EFS, and OS. KMT2A rearrangement had a negative impact on clinical outcome in AML patients with MS. In addition, SCT had no significant effect on the survival of AML patients with MS. Multivariate analysis revealed that MS was an unfavorable prognostic factor in pediatric AML in terms of EFS (Hazard ratio 1.670, P < 0.001) and OS (Hazard ratio 1.623, P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of MS at diagnosis of pediatric AML is associated with poor clinical outcomes, particularly when associated with KMT2A rearrangements.

Several FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed in the last few years with variable kinase inhibitory properties, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity profiles. FLT3 inhibitors are divided into first generation multi-kinase inhibitors (such as sorafenib, lestaurtinib, midostaurin) and next generation inhibitors (such as quizartinib, crenolanib, gilteritinib) based on their potency and specificity of FLT3 inhibition. These diverse FLT3 inhibitors have been evaluated in myriad clinical trials as monotherapy or in combination with conventional chemotherapy or hypomethylating agents and in various settings, including front-line, relapsed or refractory disease, and maintenance therapy after consolidation chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In this practical question-and-answer-based review, the main issues faced by the leukemia specialists on the use of FLT3 inhibitors in AML are addressed.","['Antar, Ahmad I', 'Otrock, Zaher K', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Bazarbachi, Ali']","['Antar AI', 'Otrock ZK', 'Jabbour E', 'Mohty M', 'Bazarbachi A']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hammoud Hospital University Medical Center, Saida, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Henry Ford Hospital, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Service d'hematologie clinique et therapie cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, INSERM UMRs 938 and universite Sorbonne, Paris, France."", 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon. bazarbac@aub.edu.lb.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200109,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology', 'DNA Methylation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Furans', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Sorafenib/pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",,,2020/01/11 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0694-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0694-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Mar;34(3):682-696. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0694-3.

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), secreted by leukemia cells, facilitates tumor progression via remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the BMM. Hypothesizing that leukemias may instruct the BMM to degrade the ECM, we show, that MMP-9-deficiency in the BMM prolongs survival of mice with BCR-ABL1-induced B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) compared with controls and reduces leukemia-initiating cells. MMP-9-deficiency in the BMM leads to reduced degradation of proteins of the ECM and reduced invasion of B-ALL. Using various in vivo and in vitro assays, as well as recipient mice deficient for the receptor for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha (TNFR1) we demonstrate that B-ALL cells induce MMP-9-expression in mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and possibly other cells of the BMM via a release of TNFalpha. MMP-9-expression in MSC is mediated by activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) downstream of TNFR1. Consistently, knockdown of TNF-alpha in B-ALL-initiating cells or pharmacological inhibition of MMP-9 led to significant prolongation of survival in mice with B-ALL. In summary, leukemia cell-derived Tnfalpha induced MMP-9-expression by the BMM promoting B-ALL progression. Inhibition of MMP-9 may act as an adjunct to existing therapies.","['Verma, Divij', 'Zanetti, Costanza', 'Godavarthy, Parimala Sonika', 'Kumar, Rahul', 'Minciacchi, Valentina R', 'Pfeiffer, Jakob', 'Metzler, Markus', 'Lefort, Sylvain', 'Maguer-Satta, Veronique', 'Nicolini, Franck E', 'Burroni, Barbara', 'Fontenay, Michaela', 'Krause, Daniela S']","['Verma D', 'Zanetti C', 'Godavarthy PS', 'Kumar R', 'Minciacchi VR', 'Pfeiffer J', 'Metzler M', 'Lefort S', 'Maguer-Satta V', 'Nicolini FE', 'Burroni B', 'Fontenay M', 'Krause DS']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2214-9450', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1556-068X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5492-6349', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3603-1119']","['Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'CRCL, Inserm U1052-CNRS UMR5286, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', 'CRCL, Inserm U1052-CNRS UMR5286, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Hematology and INSERM U 1052, CRCL, Centre Leon Berard, 69373, Lyon Cedex, France.', 'Pathology Department, Groupe Hospitalier Cochin, APHP, Paris Descartes University, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology Hopital Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, 75014, Paris, France.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

Current methods for CAR-T-cell production use viral vectors for T-cell genetic modification and can take up to 15 days to generate the infusion product. The development of simple and less costly manufacturing protocols is needed in order to meet the increasing demand for this therapy. In this present work, we generated 19BBz CAR-T cells in 8 days using a protocol based on the non-viral transposon-based vector Sleeping Beauty. The expanded cells display mostly a central memory phenotype, expressing higher levels of inhibitory receptors when compared with mock cells. In addition, CAR-T cells were cytotoxic against CD19+ leukemia cells in vitro and improved overall survival rates of mice xenografted with human RS4;11 or Nalm-6 B-cell leukemias. Infused CAR-T cells persisted for up to 28 days, showing that they are capable of long-term persistence and antitumor response.

Following the sharp expansion upon pathogen infection, most T cells die in order to keep balance in the immune system, a process which is controlled by death receptors during the early phase and Bcl-2 proteins in the later phase. It is still highly debated whether the apoptosis of T cells is determined from the beginning, upon activation, or determined later during the contraction. MCL1, a Bcl-2 family member, plays a pivotal role in T cell survival. As a fast turnover protein, MCL1 levels are tightly regulated by the 26S proteasome-controlled protein degradation process. In searching for regulatory factors involved in the actions of MCL1 during T cell apoptosis, we found that ALG-2 was critical for MCL1 stability, a process mediated by a direct interaction between ALG-2 and Rpn3, a key component of the 26S proteasome. As a critical calcium sensor, ALG-2 regulated the activity of the 26S proteasome upon increases to cytosolic calcium levels following T cell activation, this consequently influenced the stability of MCL1 and accelerated the T cell ""death"" process, leading to T cell contraction and restoration of immune homeostasis. Our study provides support for the notion that T cells are destined for apoptosis after activation, and echoes the previous study about the function of ALG-2 in T cell death.","['He, Tian-Sheng', 'Ji, Wangsheng', 'Zhang, Junqi', 'Lu, Jing', 'Liu, Xinqi']","['He TS', 'Ji W', 'Zhang J', 'Lu J', 'Liu X']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6963-1287', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6045-718X']","['State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China. liu2008@nankai.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200102,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteolysis', 'Retroviridae/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",,,2020/01/11 06:00,2020/11/12 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-019-2199-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-019-2199-4 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Jan 2;11(1):5. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-2199-4.,PMC6952393,,,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PDCD6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (ATP dependent 26S protease)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The instrument consists of three parts: the needle, stilette and an adjustable guard. The overall length of the needle is 76 mm and has uniform external diameter except for the distal penetrating segment, which is sharp but short and safe to use on the sternum. The proximal end of the needle is fitted with a plastic T-bar handle, which is ergonomically designed for firm grip and easy manoeuvrability. RESULTS: The instrument has been designed to obtain bone marrow aspirate specimens as well as to inject therapeutic agents into the posterior ilium. CONCLUSIONS: The rationale for the intramedullary injection of therapeutic agents for the treatment of patients with leukaemia, lymphoma and other haematological and non-haematological malignant disorders is described.

Separation of GVHD and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) remains a great challenge in the field. We investigated the contribution of individual pathways involved in the complement cascade in GVH and GVL responses to identify specific targets by which to separate these two processes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used multiple preclinical murine and human-to-mouse xenograft models involving allo-HCT recipients lacking components of the alternative pathway (AP) or classical pathway (CP)/lectin pathway (LP) to dissect the role of each individual pathway in GVHD pathogenesis and the GVL effect. For translational purposes, we used the AP-specific complement inhibitor, CR2-fH, which localizes in injured target organs to allow specific blockade of complement activation at sites of inflammation. RESULTS: Complement deposition was evident in intestines of mice and patients with GVHD. In a preclinical setting, ablation of the AP, but not the CP/LP, significantly improved GVHD outcomes. Complement activation through the AP in host hematopoietic cells, and specifically dendritic cells (DC), was required for GVHD progression. AP deficiency in recipients decreased donor T-cell migration and Th1/Th2 differentiation, while increasing the generation of regulatory T cells. This was because of decreased activation and stimulatory activity of recipient DCs in GVHD target organs. Treatment with CR2-fH effectively prevented GVHD while preserving GVL activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the AP as a new therapeutic target to prevent GVHD and tumor relapse after allo-HCT. Targeting the AP by CR2-fH represents a promising therapeutic approach for GVHD treatment.","['Nguyen, Hung', 'Alawieh, Ali', 'Bastian, David', 'Kuril, Sandeepkumar', 'Dai, Min', 'Daenthanasanmak, Anusara', 'Zhang, Mengmeng', 'Iamsawat, Supinya', 'Schutt, Steven D', 'Wu, Yongxia', 'Sleiman, M Mahdi', 'Shetty, Akshay', 'Atkinson, Carl', 'Sun, Shaoli', 'Varela, Juan Carlos', 'Tomlinson, Stephen', 'Yu, Xue-Zhong']","['Nguyen H', 'Alawieh A', 'Bastian D', 'Kuril S', 'Dai M', 'Daenthanasanmak A', 'Zhang M', 'Iamsawat S', 'Schutt SD', 'Wu Y', 'Sleiman MM', 'Shetty A', 'Atkinson C', 'Sun S', 'Varela JC', 'Tomlinson S', 'Yu XZ']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3073-3574', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6745-941X']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina. yux@musc.edu hung.nguyen@ucf.edu.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Medical Scientist Training Program, College of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Pediatric, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Surgery, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Ralph H.

The heterogeneous clinical course and genetic complexity of CLL warrant improved molecular prognostication. However, the prognostic value of recurrent mutations at the time of diagnosis remains unclear. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We sequenced samples from 314 consecutive, newly diagnosed patients with CLL to investigate the clinical impact of 56 recurrently mutated genes assessed by next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: Mutations were identified in 70% of patients with enrichment among IGHV unmutated cases. With 6.5 years of follow-up, 15 mutated genes investigated at the time of diagnosis demonstrated significant impact on time to first treatment (TTFT). Carrying driver mutations was associated with shorter TTFT and poor overall survival. For outcome from CLL diagnosis, the number of signaling pathways altered by driver mutations stratified patients better than the number of driver mutations. Moreover, we demonstrated gradual impact on TTFT with increasing number of altered pathways independent of CLL-IPI risk. Thus, a 25-gene, pathway-based biomarker assessing recurrent mutations refines prognostication in CLL, in particular for CLL-IPI low- and intermediate-risk patients. External validation emphasized that a broad gene panel including low burden mutations was key for the biomarker based on altered pathways. CONCLUSIONS: We propose to include the number of pathways altered by driver mutations as a biomarker together with CLL-IPI in prospective studies of CLL from time of diagnosis for incorporation into clinical care and personalized follow-up and treatment.","['Brieghel, Christian', 'da Cunha-Bang, Caspar', 'Yde, Christina Westmose', 'Schmidt, Ane Yde', 'Kinalis, Savvas', 'Nadeu, Ferran', 'Andersen, Michael Asger', 'Jacobsen, Line Offenbach', 'Andersen, Mette Klarskov', 'Pedersen, Lone Bredo', 'Delgado, Julio', 'Baumann, Tycho', 'Mattsson, Mattias', 'Mansouri, Larry', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Campo, Elias', 'Nielsen, Finn Cilius', 'Niemann, Carsten Utoft']","['Brieghel C', 'da Cunha-Bang C', 'Yde CW', 'Schmidt AY', 'Kinalis S', 'Nadeu F', 'Andersen MA', 'Jacobsen LO', 'Andersen MK', 'Pedersen LB', 'Delgado J', 'Baumann T', 'Mattsson M', 'Mansouri L', 'Rosenquist R', 'Campo E', 'Nielsen FC', 'Niemann CU']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6893-2822', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2910-9440', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9729-9974', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9729-9974', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9850-9793']","['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Center for Genomic Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Center for Genomic Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Center for Genomic Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Lymphoid Neoplasms Program, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Center for Genomic Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Lymphoid Neoplasms Program, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', ""Lymphoid Neoplasms Program, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Center for Genomic Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. carsten.utoft.niemann@regionh.dk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200109,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,"['Aged', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Databases, Genetic/statistics & numerical data', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*mortality/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', '*Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate']",,,2020/01/11 06:00,2021/01/15 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2018/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-18-4158 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-4158 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2020 Mar 15;26(6):1507-1515. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-4158.

Current treatment regimens are based on the administration of polychemotherapy, combining high doses of cytarabine with anthracyclines and topoisomerase inhibitors. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an option for high-risk patients with AML (and for intermediate-risk patients if a sibling donor is available). With this strategy, AML survival has increased substantially; however, it has remained stagnant at approximately 60%, with relapse being the principal culprit. The predominant role of the immune system and natural killer (NK) cells in controlling paediatric AML has gained importance within the context of HSCT. In this protocol, we propose incorporating this cell therapy as an adjuvant treatment through the infusion of activated and expanded haploidentical NK (NKAE) cells in paediatric patients with AML who are in cytological remission after completing consolidation therapy, and with no indication for HSCT. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Patients up to 30 years of age, diagnosed with AML, in their first cytological remission, who have completed both the induction and the consolidation phases of chemotherapy and do not meet the criteria for allogeneic HSCT are eligible. The patients will receive two doses of NKAE cells once a week, using a GMP K562-mbIL15-41BBL stimulus from a haploidentical donor and interleukin 2 subcutaneously. The patients will then be followed up for 36 months to assess the primary endpoint, which is the probability of relapse after NK cell infusion. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This clinical trial was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of La Paz University Hospital and The Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and community reporting.

While global hypomethylation of these elements has been widely reported in solid tumours, their epigenetic dysregulation is yet to be characterised in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and there has been scant consideration of their evolutionary history that mediates sensitivity to hypomethylation. Here, we developed an approach for locus- and evolutionary subfamily-specific analysis of retrotransposons using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450K microarray platform, which we applied to publicly-available datasets from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and other haematological malignancies. We identified 9,797 microarray probes mapping to 117 LINE-1 subfamilies and 13,130 mapping to 37 Alu subfamilies. Of these, 10,782 were differentially methylated (PFDR<0.05) in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients (n=139) compared with healthy individuals (n=14), with enrichment at enhancers (p=0.002). Differential methylation was associated with evolutionary age of LINE-1 (r2=0.31, p=0.003) and Alu (r2=0.74, p=0.002) elements, with greater hypomethylation of older subfamilies (L1M, AluJ). Locus-specific hypomethylation was associated with differential expression of proximal genes, including DCLK2, HK1, ILRUN, TANK, TBCD, TNFRSF1B and TXNRD2, with higher expression of DCLK2 and TNFRSF1B associated with reduced patient survival. Hypomethylation at nine loci was highly frequent in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (>90% patients) but not observed in healthy individuals or other leukaemias, and was detectable in blood samples taken prior to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia diagnosis in 9 of 82 individuals from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. Our results demonstrate differential methylation of retrotransposons in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia by their evolutionary heritage that modulates expression of proximal genes.","['Barrow, Timothy M', 'Wong Doo, Nicole', 'Milne, Roger L', 'Giles, Graham G', 'Willmore, Elaine', 'Strathdee, Gordon', 'Byun, Hyang-Min']","['Barrow TM', 'Wong Doo N', 'Milne RL', 'Giles GG', 'Willmore E', 'Strathdee G', 'Byun HM']",,"['Faculty of Health Sciences and Wellbeing, University of Sunderland, Sunderland, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Epidemiology Division, Cancer Council Victoria, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Cancer Epidemiology Division, Cancer Council Victoria, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Cancer Epidemiology Division, Cancer Council Victoria, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210101,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Cohort Studies', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics', 'Retroelements/genetics']",,,2020/01/11 06:00,2021/05/22 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2020/01/09 00:00 [aheadofprint]', '2019/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3324/haematol.2019.228478 [doi]'],epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Jan 1;106(1):98-110. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.228478.,PMC7776340,,,['0 (Retroelements)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recent development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown impressive results in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory hematological B cell malignancies. In the recent years, B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) has appeared as a promising antigen to target using a variety of immuno-therapy treatments including CART cells, for MM patients. To this end, we generated clinical-grade murine CART cells directed against BCMA, named ARI2m cells. Having demonstrated its efficacy, and in an attempt to avoid the immune rejection of CART cells by the patient, the single chain variable fragment was humanized, creating ARI2h cells. ARI2h cells demonstrated comparable in vitro and in vivo efficacy to ARI2m cells, and superiority in cases of high tumor burden disease. In terms of inflammatory response, ARI2h cells showed a lower TNFalpha production and lower in vivo toxicity profile. Large-scale expansion of both ARI2m and ARI2h cells was efficiently conducted following Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines, obtaining the target CART cell dose required for treatment of multiple myeloma patients. Moreover, we demonstrate that soluble BCMA and BCMA released in vesicles impacts on CAR-BCMA activity. In summary, this study sets the bases for the implementation of a clinical trial (EudraCT code: 2019-001472-11) to study the efficacy of ARI2h cell treatment for multiple myeloma patients.","['Perez-Amill, Lorena', 'Sune, Guillermo', 'Antonana-Vildosola, Asier', 'Castella, Maria', 'Najjar, Amer', 'Bonet, Jaume', 'Fernandez-Fuentes, Narcis', 'Inoges, Susana', 'Lopez, Ascension', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Juan, Manel', 'Urbano-Ispizua, Alvaro', 'Martin-Antonio, Beatriz']","['Perez-Amill L', 'Sune G', 'Antonana-Vildosola A', 'Castella M', 'Najjar A', 'Bonet J', 'Fernandez-Fuentes N', 'Inoges S', 'Lopez A', 'Bueno C', 'Juan M', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Martin-Antonio B']",,"['Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Dept. of Pediatrics - Research, The University of Texas M.

The major challenges in the treatments of T-ALL are dose-limiting toxicities of chemotherapeutics and drug resistance. Despite important progress in deciphering the genomic landscape of T-ALL, translation of these findings into effective targeted therapies remains largely unsuccessful. New targeted agents with significant antileukemic efficacy and less toxicity are in urgent need. We herein report that the expression of WEE1, a nuclear tyrosine kinase involved in cell cycle G2-M checkpoint signaling, is significantly elevated in T-ALL. Mechanistically, oncogenic MYC directly binds to the WEE1 promoter and activates its transcription. T-ALL cells particularly rely on the elevated WEE1 for cell viability. Pharmacological inhibition of WEE1 elicits global metabolic reprogramming which results in a marked suppression of aerobic glycolysis in T-ALL cells, leading to an increased dependency on glutaminolysis for cell survival. As such, dual targeting of WEE1 and glutaminase (GLS1) induces synergistic lethality in multiple T-ALL cell lines and shows great efficacy in T-ALL patient-derived xenografts. These findings provide mechanistic insights in the regulation of WEE1 kinase in T-ALL and suggest an additional vulnerability during WEE1 inhibitor treatments.

Recently, increasing evidence has shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) can act as effective biomarkers of various human cancers. However, the roles of circRNAs in AML remain largely unclear. In the present study, circ_0000370 was found to be significantly increased in FLT3-ITD(+) AML and was demonstrated to act as an oncogenic circRNA of AML in vitro. TargetScan results showed that miR-1299, miR-370-3p, miR-502-5p, miR-1281 and miR-640 were potential targets of circ_0000370, and miR-1299 had the broadest range of interactome compared with other microRNAs of interest. Moreover, we demonstrated that S100A7A was a target gene of miR-1299, and circ_0000370 could regulate S100A7A expression by sponging miR-1299 in AML cell lines. Therefore, we suggest that the promoting effects of circ_0000370 on the progression of FLT3-ITD(+) AML might be relevant to the inhibition of miR-1299 and the upregulation of S100A7A.","['Zhang, Lingyan', 'Bu, Zibin', 'Shen, Juan', 'Shang, Liping', 'Chen, Yuanyuan', 'Wang, Yan']","['Zhang L', 'Bu Z', 'Shen J', 'Shang L', 'Chen Y', 'Wang Y']",,"[""Division of Hematology-oncology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310003, PR China.

Current reviews report that the simultaneous analysis of multiple (i.e. three or more) high dimensional omics data sources is still challenging and suitable statistical methods are unavailable. Often mentioned challenges are the lack of accounting for the hierarchical structure between omics domains and the difficulty of interpretation of genomewide results. This study is motivated to address these challenges. We propose multiset sparse Partial Least Squares path modeling (msPLS), a generalized penalized form of Partial Least Squares path modeling, for the simultaneous modeling of biological pathways across multiple omics domains. msPLS simultaneously models the effect of multiple molecular markers, from multiple omics domains, on the variation of multiple phenotypic variables, while accounting for the relationships between data sources, and provides sparse results. The sparsity in the model helps to provide interpretable results from analyses of hundreds of thousands of biomolecular variables. RESULTS: With simulation studies, we quantified the ability of msPLS to discover associated variables among high dimensional data sources. Furthermore, we analysed high dimensional omics datasets to explore biological pathways associated with Marfan syndrome and with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia. Additionally, we compared the results of msPLS to the results of Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA), which is an alternative method to analyse this type of data. CONCLUSIONS: msPLS is an multiset multivariate method for the integrative analysis of multiple high dimensional omics data sources. It accounts for the relationship between multiple high dimensional data sources while it provides interpretable results through its sparse solutions. The biomarkers found by msPLS in the omics datasets can be interpreted in terms of biological pathways associated with the pathophysiology of Marfan syndrome and of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia. Additionally, msPLS outperforms MOFA in terms of variation explained in the chronic lymphocytic leukaemia dataset while it identifies the two most important clinical markers for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia AVAILABILITY: http://uva.csala.me/mspls.https://github.com/acsala/2018_msPLS.","['Csala, Attila', 'Zwinderman, Aeilko H', 'Hof, Michel H']","['Csala A', 'Zwinderman AH', 'Hof MH']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4969-5555'],"['Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, 1105 AZ, The Netherlands. a@csala.me.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, 1105 AZ, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, 1105 AZ, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200109,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,IM,,"['Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Marfan Syndrome/metabolism/pathology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Proteomics/methods', '*User-Computer Interface']",['NOTNLM'],"['High dimensional omics data', 'Multivariate analysis', 'Partial least squares']",2020/01/11 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2019/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12859-019-3286-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-019-3286-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2020 Jan 9;21(1):9. doi: 10.1186/s12859-019-3286-3.,PMC6953292,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was performed to investigate the associations of SLC2 family gene expression with mortality in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Clinical features and SLC2 family gene expression data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus database. The associations between SLC2 family gene expression and clinicopathologic features were analyzed using linear regression model. Kaplan-Meier survival, univariate, multivariate survival analyses and validation analysis were performed to analyze the associations between SLC2 family gene expression and patients' overall survival. RESULTS: Patient mortality was positively associated with age and cytogenetic risk in AML patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis suggested that patients with high SLC2A5 and SLC2A10 expression showed poorer survival than those with low SLC2A5 and SLC2A10 expression. In contrast, patients with high SLC2A13 expression exhibited better prognosis than those with low SLC2A13 expression (P < 0.05 for all cases, log rank test). Multivariate survival analysis and validation analysis confirmed that high expression of SLC2A5 and SLC2A10 and low expression of SLC2A13 were associated with increased mortality (P = 0.00, Odd ratio [OR]:4.05, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.73-10.22; P = 0.00, OR: 3.66, 95% CI: 1.54-9.25; and P = 0.01, OR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.09-0.68, respectively). CONCLUSION: SLC family gene expression, such as SLC2A5, SLC2A10 and SLC2A13, was significantly associated with prognosis of AML patients, their expression levels might become useful prognostic biomarkers in AML.","['Lai, Binbin', 'Lai, Yanli', 'Zhang, Yanli', 'Zhou, Miao', 'Sheng, Lixia', 'OuYang, Guifang']","['Lai B', 'Lai Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhou M', 'Sheng L', 'OuYang G']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5463-4784', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0915-2372']","['Department of Hematology, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,IM,,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Databases, Genetic/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucose Transport Proteins, Facilitative/*genetics/metabolism', 'Glucose Transporter Type 5/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Overall survival', '*SLC2A10', '*SLC2A13', '*SLC2A5']",2020/01/11 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1533033819894308 [doi]'],ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2020 Jan-Dec;19:1533033819894308. doi: 10.1177/1533033819894308.,PMC7099669,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Glucose Transport Proteins, Facilitative)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 5)', '0 (SLC2A10 protein, human)', '0 (SLC2A13 protein, human)', '0 (SLC2A5 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proofreading mechanisms eliminate unprocessed and irregular pre-mRNAs to control the quality of gene expression. Retroviruses need to export partially spliced and unspliced full-length RNAs to the cytoplasm where they serve as templates for protein synthesis and/or as encapsidated RNA in progeny viruses. Genetically complex retroviruses such as HIV-1 use Rev-equivalent proteins to export intron-retaining RNA from the nucleus using the cellular CRM1-driven nuclear export machinery. By contrast, genetically simpler retroviruses such as murine leukaemia virus (MLV) recruit the NXF1 RNA export machinery. In this study, we reveal for the first time that MLV hijacks both NXF1 and CRM1-dependent pathways to achieve optimal replication capacity. The CRM1-pathway marks the MLV full-length RNA (FL RNA) for packaging, while NXF1-driven nuclear export is coupled to translation. Thus, the cytoplasmic function of the viral RNA is determined early in the nucleus. Depending on the nature of ribonucleoprotein complex formed on FL RNA cargo in the nucleus, the FL RNA will be addressed to the translation machinery sites or to the virus-assembly sites at the plasma membrane.","['Mougel, M', 'Akkawi, C', 'Chamontin, C', 'Feuillard, J', 'Pessel-Vivares, L', 'Socol, M', 'Laine, S']","['Mougel M', 'Akkawi C', 'Chamontin C', 'Feuillard J', 'Pessel-Vivares L', 'Socol M', 'Laine S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0345-1427', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8773-5127', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7760-373X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5362-6099', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8960-2408', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1540-5679', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5217-4972']","['Team R2D2: Retroviral RNA Dynamics and Delivery, IRIM, UMR9004, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, FranceG.', 'Team R2D2: Retroviral RNA Dynamics and Delivery, IRIM, UMR9004, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, FranceG.', 'Team R2D2: Retroviral RNA Dynamics and Delivery, IRIM, UMR9004, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, FranceG.', 'Team R2D2: Retroviral RNA Dynamics and Delivery, IRIM, UMR9004, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, FranceG.', 'Team R2D2: Retroviral RNA Dynamics and Delivery, IRIM, UMR9004, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, FranceG.', 'Team R2D2: Retroviral RNA Dynamics and Delivery, IRIM, UMR9004, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, FranceG.', 'Team R2D2: Retroviral RNA Dynamics and Delivery, IRIM, UMR9004, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, FranceG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200123,United States,RNA Biol,RNA biology,101235328,IM,,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/*virology', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism/*virology', 'Karyopherins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/physiology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections', 'Tumor Virus Infections', 'Viral Genome Packaging']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CRM1', '*MLV', '*NXF1/Tap', '*RNA', '*export', '*packaging', '*retrovirus', '*trafficking']",2020/01/11 06:00,2021/04/27 06:00,['2020/01/11 06:00'],"['2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15476286.2020.1713539 [doi]'],ppublish,RNA Biol. 2020 Apr;17(4):528-538. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2020.1713539.

EO was obtained by a hydrodistillation clevenger-type apparatus and characterized quali- and quantitatively by GC-MS and GC-FID, respectively. In vitro cytotoxic potential of EO was evaluated in human cancer cell lines (HL-60, MCF-7 CAL27, HSC-3, HepG2 and HCT116) and in human non-cancer cell line (MRC-5) by Alamar blue method. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining, cell cycle distribution and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed by flow cytometry for HL-60 cells treated with EO. In vivo efficacy of EO (50 and 100mg/kg) was evaluated in C.B-17 SCID mice with HL-60 cell xenografts. Chemical composition analyses showed spathulenol, gamma-muurolene, bicyclogermacrene, beta-elemene and delta-elemene as main constituents of assayed sample.

We were interested in whether transcriptomic-based machine learning could predict AML status without requiring expert input. Using 12,029 samples from 105 different studies, we present a large-scale study of machine learning-based prediction of AML in which we address key questions relating to the combination of machine learning and transcriptomics and their practical use. We find data-driven, high-dimensional approaches-in which multivariate signatures are learned directly from genome-wide data with no prior knowledge-to be accurate and robust. Importantly, these approaches are highly scalable with low marginal cost, essentially matching human expert annotation in a near-automated workflow. Our results support the notion that transcriptomics combined with machine learning could be used as part of an integrated -omics approach wherein risk prediction, differential diagnosis, and subclassification of AML are achieved by genomics while diagnosis could be assisted by transcriptomic-based machine learning.","['Warnat-Herresthal, Stefanie', 'Perrakis, Konstantinos', 'Taschler, Bernd', 'Becker, Matthias', 'Bassler, Kevin', 'Beyer, Marc', 'Gunther, Patrick', 'Schulte-Schrepping, Jonas', 'Seep, Lea', 'Klee, Kathrin', 'Ulas, Thomas', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Mukherjee, Sach', 'Schultze, Joachim L']","['Warnat-Herresthal S', 'Perrakis K', 'Taschler B', 'Becker M', 'Bassler K', 'Beyer M', 'Gunther P', 'Schulte-Schrepping J', 'Seep L', 'Klee K', 'Ulas T', 'Haferlach T', 'Mukherjee S', 'Schultze JL']",,"['LIMES-Institute, Department for Genomics and Immunoregulation, University of Bonn, Carl-Troll-Str. 31, 53115 Bonn, Germany.', 'Statistics and Machine Learning, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Venusberg-Campus 1, Building 99, 53127 Bonn, Germany.', 'Statistics and Machine Learning, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Venusberg-Campus 1, Building 99, 53127 Bonn, Germany.', 'PRECISE Platform for Single Cell Genomics and Epigenomics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases and the University of Bonn, Venusberg-Campus 1, Building 99, 53127 Bonn, Germany.', 'LIMES-Institute, Department for Genomics and Immunoregulation, University of Bonn, Carl-Troll-Str. 31, 53115 Bonn, Germany.', 'Molecular Immunology in Neurodegeneration, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Venusberg-Campus 1, Building 99, 53127 Bonn, Germany; PRECISE Platform for Single Cell Genomics and Epigenomics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases and the University of Bonn, Venusberg-Campus 1, Building 99, 53127 Bonn, Germany.', 'LIMES-Institute, Department for Genomics and Immunoregulation, University of Bonn, Carl-Troll-Str. 31, 53115 Bonn, Germany.', 'LIMES-Institute, Department for Genomics and Immunoregulation, University of Bonn, Carl-Troll-Str. 31, 53115 Bonn, Germany.', 'LIMES-Institute, Department for Genomics and Immunoregulation, University of Bonn, Carl-Troll-Str. 31, 53115 Bonn, Germany.', 'LIMES-Institute, Department for Genomics and Immunoregulation, University of Bonn, Carl-Troll-Str. 31, 53115 Bonn, Germany.', 'LIMES-Institute, Department for Genomics and Immunoregulation, University of Bonn, Carl-Troll-Str. 31, 53115 Bonn, Germany.', 'MLL, Munchner Leukamielabor GmbH, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, 81377 Munchen, Germany.', 'Statistics and Machine Learning, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Venusberg-Campus 1, Building 99, 53127 Bonn, Germany.

However, it's still unexplored whether luteolin represses the metastasis progression of leukemia cells via regulating the expression of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). Jurkat cells were stimulated by lactacystin and chloroquine after luteolin preincubation. C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) was applied to induce migration of Jurkat cells after the cells were pre-incubated with luteolin (50, 100, 150, and 200 muM). CXCR4 was quantified by Western blot assay. Next, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) was used to detect cell viability. Apoptotic cells were observed with flow cytometry after staining. Migration assay was performed using a modified Boyden's chamber. We found that luteolin repressed CXCR4 expression at mRNA levels and restrained CXCL12-induced proliferation as well as migration. Furthermore, luteolin facilitated Jurkat cells apoptosis which was associated with the cleavage of caspase. Additionally, luteolin impeded the phosphorylated expression of PI3K, AKT, and ERK1 which was enhanced by CXCL12. In conclusion, luteolin exhibited anti-proliferation and anti-metastasis functions in CXCL12-treated Jurkat cells and inactivated PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling pathways via repressing the transcription of CXCR4.","['Bu, Yunwen', 'Zhao, Dandan']","['Bu Y', 'Zhao D']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Jining No.1 People's Hospital, Jining 272011, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Jining No.1 People's Hospital, Jining 272011, China.

SCOPE: This document is an update of the 2008 American Association of Feline Practitioners' feline retrovirus management guidelines and represents current knowledge on pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of retrovirus infections in cats. TESTING AND INTERPRETATION: Although vaccines are available for FeLV in many countries and for FIV in some countries, identification of infected cats remains an important factor for preventing new infections. The retrovirus status of every cat at risk of infection should be known. Cats should be tested as soon as possible after they are acquired, following exposure to an infected cat or a cat of unknown infection status, prior to vaccination against FeLV or FIV, and whenever clinical illness occurs. It might not be possible to determine a cat's infection status based on testing at a single point in time; repeat testing using different methods could be required. Although FeLV and FIV infections can be associated with clinical disease, some infected cats, especially those infected with FIV, can live for many years with good quality of life. MANAGEMENT OF INFECTED CATS: There is a paucity of data evaluating treatments for infected cats, especially antiretroviral and immunomodulatory drugs. Management of infected cats is focused on effective preventive healthcare strategies, and prompt identification and treatment of illness, as well as limiting the spread of infection.","['Little, Susan', 'Levy, Julie', 'Hartmann, Katrin', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina', 'Hosie, Margaret', 'Olah, Glenn', 'Denis, Kelly St']","['Little S', 'Levy J', 'Hartmann K', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R', 'Hosie M', 'Olah G', 'Denis KS']",,"['Bytown Cat Hospital, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'Charing Cross Cat Clinic, Brantford, ON, Canada.', ""Maddie's Shelter Medicine Program, Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA."", 'Charing Cross Cat Clinic, Brantford, ON, Canada.', 'Clinic of Small Animal Medicine, Centre for Clinical Veterinary Medicine, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Charing Cross Cat Clinic, Brantford, ON, Canada.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Department of Clinical Diagnostics and Services, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Charing Cross Cat Clinic, Brantford, ON, Canada.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow, UK.', 'Charing Cross Cat Clinic, Brantford, ON, Canada.', 'Albuquerque Cat Clinic, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Charing Cross Cat Clinic, Brantford, ON, Canada.', 'Charing Cross Cat Clinic, Brantford, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline']",,England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,IM,['J Feline Med Surg. 2020 Jan;22(1):3.

A synchronous occurrence of bifocal intracranial germinoma and bilateral testicular epidermoid cyst in an adolescent patient with Klinefelter`s syndrome. Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 456-459. Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is characterized by an additional X chromosome in males leading to a karyotype of 47,XXY. It is associated with an increased risk of certain malignancies, including leukemia, breast cancer and extragonadal germ cell tumor such as mediastinal germ cell tumors and rarely intracranial germ cell tumors. It is possible that the increased risk of developing certain cancers can be attributed to a direct effect of the chromosomal abnormality or the combined action of the abnormal chromosomes and hormonal imbalances.

The synchronous occurrence of the dual tumors in this patient with Klinefelter`s syndrome might be resulted from the migration defect during embriyogenesis due to underlying genetic disease or it is a coincidental condition, yet there has been no case reported in the literature, so far.","['Ozyoruk, Derya', 'Kocayozgat, Ayca', 'Yaman-Bajin, Inci', 'Cetindag, Faik', 'Oguz-Erdogan, Ayse Selcen', 'Gunes, Altan']","['Ozyoruk D', 'Kocayozgat A', 'Yaman-Bajin I', 'Cetindag F', 'Oguz-Erdogan AS', 'Gunes A']",,"[""Divisions of Pediatric Oncology, Ankara Children's Hematology and Oncology Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey."", ""Divisions of Pediatric Oncology, Ankara Children's Hematology and Oncology Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey."", ""Divisions of Pediatric Oncology, Ankara Children's Hematology and Oncology Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey."", 'Division of Radiation Oncology, Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Oncology Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', ""Divisions of Pathology, Ankara Children's Hematology and Oncology Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey."", ""Divisions of Radiology, Ankara Children's Hematology and Oncology Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.""]",['eng'],['Case Reports'],,Turkey,Turk J Pediatr,The Turkish journal of pediatrics,0417505,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Biopsy', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging', 'Brain Neoplasms/*complications/diagnosis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Epidermal Cyst/*complications/diagnosis', 'Germinoma/*complications/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Klinefelter Syndrome/*complications/diagnosis', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Testicular Diseases/*complications/diagnosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Klinefelter`s syndrome', '*bilateral testicular epidermoid cyst', '*germinoma']",2020/01/10 06:00,2020/07/14 06:00,['2020/01/10 06:00'],"['2020/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1984 [pii]', '10.24953/turkjped.2019.03.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Turk J Pediatr. 2019;61(3):456-459. doi: 10.24953/turkjped.2019.03.024.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Outcome of allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation on Diamond-Blackfan anemia using busulfan-based myeloablative regimen. Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 407-412. Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only known curative option for hematologic manifestations of Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) as a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome. This treatment may be considered for DBA patients with corticosteroid-resistance, transfusion dependence, and/or progression to severe aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/ Acute myleloid leukemia (AML). In this prospective study, 10 pediatric DBA patients (age < 15 years) who underwent allo-HSCT from HLA-matched donors using non-TBI myeloablative conditioning regimen (intravenous busulfan and cyclophosphamide +/- antithymocyte globulin) during September 2010 to February 2014 are reported. For Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) prophylaxis cyclosporine A. and a short course of methotrexate were administered. Except one patient who received transplantation from his sibling cord blood, engraftment occurred in all the other patients (9 out of 10) with full donor chimerism ( > 95%). The median neutrophil and platelet engraftment times were 11 (range, 10- 13) days and 23 (range, 15-50) days, respectively. Acute GvHD developed in 7 patients. After a median follow-up of 53.3 months, 8 patients are still alive, of whom 7 patients are disease-free. The other two patients died due to grade III-IV acute GvHD. Our data suggests that allo-HSCT using busulan-based non-TBI myeloablative conditioning regimen could be a long-term effective treatment for DBA patients. Early transplantation especially before having multiple transfusions leading to iron overload, particularly from an HLAmatched sibling donor would be associated with favorable outcomes.","['Behfar, Maryam', 'Koochakzadeh, Lili', 'Yazdanian, Nafise', 'Salajegheh, Pourya', 'Rostami, Tahereh', 'Khodayari-Namini, Nazanin', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir', 'Hamidieh, Amir Ali']","['Behfar M', 'Koochakzadeh L', 'Yazdanian N', 'Salajegheh P', 'Rostami T', 'Khodayari-Namini N', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Hamidieh AA']",,"['Department of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Children's Medical Center."", 'Department of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Children's Medical Center."", 'Department of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Children's Medical Center."", 'Department of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Turk J Pediatr,The Turkish journal of pediatrics,0417505,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Diamond-Blackfan/*therapy', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*administration & dosage', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/administration & dosage', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Diamond-Blackfan anemia', '*Non- TBI myeloablative conditioning', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplantation']",2020/01/10 06:00,2020/07/14 06:00,['2020/01/10 06:00'],"['2020/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1973 [pii]', '10.24953/turkjped.2019.03.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Turk J Pediatr. 2019;61(3):407-412. doi: 10.24953/turkjped.2019.03.013.,,,,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a rare disease and consists of 4-5% of all childhood ALL. Despite improved survival rates in childhood ALL, infants with ALL have a worse prognosis. We aimed to evaluate the clinical features and treatment outcomes of our patients diagnosed with infant ALL at Hacettepe University, Pediatric Hematology Department between 1 January 2008 and 1 January 2018 retrospectively. There were 13 patients with a median age of 7 months. Three of the patients were triplets born from a spontaneous monozygotic triplet pregnancy. Relapse were observed in 4 patients. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed for five patients. Relapse after HSCT was observed in 3 patients. After a median follow-up period of 18 months, 6 patients (45%) (3 after HSCT and 3 who only received chemotherapy) were alive and in remission. Prognosis of infant ALL is poor in that only half of the patients survive. Our results suggest that bone marrow transplantation seems to be a good and efficient choice of treatment for selected patients. However, there is still a big issue to decide which patient should undergo transplantation and more studies are needed to reevaluate the eligibility criteria for HSCT in this group of patients.","['Yaman-Bajin, Inci', 'Aytac, Selin', 'Kuskonmaz, Baris', 'Uckan-Cetinkaya, Duygu', 'Unal, Sule', 'Gumruk, Fatma', 'Cetin, Mualla']","['Yaman-Bajin I', 'Aytac S', 'Kuskonmaz B', 'Uckan-Cetinkaya D', 'Unal S', 'Gumruk F', 'Cetin M']",,"['Division of Pediatric Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Turk J Pediatr,The Turkish journal of pediatrics,0417505,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Triplets', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*chemotherapy', '*infant leukemia']",2020/01/10 06:00,2020/08/20 06:00,['2020/01/10 06:00'],"['2020/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1962 [pii]', '10.24953/turkjped.2019.03.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Turk J Pediatr. 2019;61(3):325-329. doi: 10.24953/turkjped.2019.03.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, the foundational mechanism of UCA1 in AML pathologies remains unclear. Herein, we found an escalation of UCA1 expression and suppression of miR-204 expression in pediatric AML patients and cells. UCA1 silencing suppressed cell proliferative abilities, promoted apoptotic rates, decreased Ki67, and increased cleaved caspase-3 in AML cells. Moreover, UCA1 sponged miR-204 and suppressed its expression. UCA1 overexpression inversed the miR-204 suppressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis. UCA1 also boosted the expression of SIRT1, a miR-204 target, via the sponging interaction. Furthermore, miR-204 inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression, while UCA1 overexpression inversed the inhibitory effects in AML cells. Our findings concluded that UCA1 downregulation repressed cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis through inactivating SIRT1 signals by upregulating miR-204 in pediatric AML.","['Liang, Yu', 'Li, Erwei', 'Zhang, Hongliang', 'Zhang, Lina', 'Tang, Yingying', 'Wanyan, Yuanyuan']","['Liang Y', 'Li E', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang L', 'Tang Y', 'Wanyan Y']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1177-7758'],"[""Department of Blood Transfusion, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, China."", 'Department of Blood Transfusion of Central China Fuwai Hospital, Central China Fuwai Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', ""Department of Blood Transfusion, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, China."", 'Department of Blood Transfusion of Central China Fuwai Hospital, Central China Fuwai Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', ""Department of Blood Transfusion, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, China."", 'Department of Blood Transfusion of Central China Fuwai Hospital, Central China Fuwai Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', ""Department of Blood Transfusion, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, China."", 'Department of Blood Transfusion of Central China Fuwai Hospital, Central China Fuwai Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', ""Department of Blood Transfusion, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, China."", 'Department of Blood Transfusion of Central China Fuwai Hospital, Central China Fuwai Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', ""Department of Blood Transfusion, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, China."", 'Department of Blood Transfusion of Central China Fuwai Hospital, Central China Fuwai Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200109,United States,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,9717231,IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Female', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', '*MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*RNA, Long Noncoding/biosynthesis/genetics', '*RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', '*Sirtuin 1/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'lncRNA UCA1', 'miR-204', 'pediatric acute myeloid leukemia', 'proliferation']",2020/01/10 06:00,2020/10/08 06:00,['2020/01/10 06:00'],"['2019/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbt.22435 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem Mol Toxicol. 2020 Mar;34(3):e22435. doi: 10.1002/jbt.22435.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo experiments, mice bearing floxed alleles of YAP were crossed with mice expressing a Cre recombinase driven by the endothelial Tek promoter (Tek-Cre) to finally obtain the following three genotypes: YAP(f/f) , Tek-Cre; YAP(f/w) , Tek-Cre; and YAP(f/f) . Retinal vascularization and astrocyte network were evaluated by whole-mount fluorescence and Western blotting. In vitro, experiments were performed in an astrocyte and human microvascular endothelial cell (HMEC-1) coculture model to analyse the mechanisms underlying the effect of endothelial YAP on astrocytes. RESULTS: In vivo, YAP(f/f) ;Tek-Cre mice showed delayed angiogenesis, sparse vessels and decreased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ astrocytes but aberrant growth of endothelial networks and immature astrocytes (platelet-derived growth factor A, PDGFRA+ astrocytes) overgrowth. In vitro, Yap deletion attenuated the LIF release that delayed the maturation of retinal astrocyte which was consistent with the results of HMEC-1-astrocyte coculture. The effect of YAP overexpression on LIF-LIFR axis in HMEC-1 interferes the GFAP expression of astrocyte. In contrast, LIF protein rescues the astrocytic GFAP expression when EC YAP was inhibited by siRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: We show that EC yes-associated protein (YAP) is not only a critical coactivator of Hippo signalling in retinal vessel development but also plays an essential role in retinal astrocyte maturation by regulating LIF production.","['Ai, Li-Qian-Yu', 'Yuan, Rong-Di', 'Chen, Xi', 'Liu, Yun-Jia', 'Liu, Wen-Yi', 'Zhu, Jing-Yi', 'Zhang, Zhou', 'Yan, Jun', 'Chen, Chun-Lin', 'Lin, Sen', 'Ye, Jian']","['Ai LQ', 'Yuan RD', 'Chen X', 'Liu YJ', 'Liu WY', 'Zhu JY', 'Zhang Z', 'Yan J', 'Chen CL', 'Lin S', 'Ye J']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6433-6476', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9346-8187']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Research Institute of Surgery & Daping Hospital, Army Medical Center of PLA, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, XinQiao Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Research Institute of Surgery & Daping Hospital, Army Medical Center of PLA, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Research Institute of Surgery & Daping Hospital, Army Medical Center of PLA, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Research Institute of Surgery & Daping Hospital, Army Medical Center of PLA, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Research Institute of Surgery & Daping Hospital, Army Medical Center of PLA, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Research Institute of Surgery & Daping Hospital, Army Medical Center of PLA, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Research Institute of Surgery & Daping Hospital, Army Medical Center of PLA, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Research Institute of Surgery & Daping Hospital, Army Medical Center of PLA, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Research Institute of Surgery & Daping Hospital, Army Medical Center of PLA, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Research Institute of Surgery & Daping Hospital, Army Medical Center of PLA, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200108,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Coculture Techniques/methods', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism/physiology', 'Female', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/metabolism/pathology', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/physiology', 'Neurogenesis/physiology', 'Retina/*metabolism/physiology', 'Retinal Vessels/*metabolism/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'YAP-Signaling Proteins']",['NOTNLM'],"['astrocyte premature', 'leukaemia inhibitory factor', 'retinal vessel development', 'yes-associated protein']",2020/01/10 06:00,2020/03/07 06:00,['2020/01/10 06:00'],"['2019/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cpr.12757 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2020 Feb;53(2):e12757. doi: 10.1111/cpr.12757.

METHODS: Forty Sprague-Dawley male rats (weight 220-250 g) were randomly divided into four groups: a control group (NC, n = 10), a Sham surgery group (n = 10), an IRI group (n = 10), and a 3-MA-treated IRI group [10 muL 3-MA (10 mmol/L) was injected in vitreous after the injury, n = 10]. The retinal IRI was induced by elevating the intraocular pressure to 110 mmHg for 60 min. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to calculate the number of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The level of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3), Beclin-1, and Caspase-3 in the retina was detected using the immunofluorescence staining method. The LC3, Beclin-1, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), and Caspase-3 protein levels were examined by Western blotting. RESULTS: The number of RGCs in IRI group was significantly lower than that in NC group (P < 0.05), demonstrated by HE staining. Western blotting results indicated that the protein expression of LC3 and Beclin-1 in the IRI group was significantly elevated compared with those in the NC group (P < 0.05). However, with 3-MA treatment, the number of RCGs in 3-MA-treated IRI group was elevated and protein levels of LC3, Beclin-1 were down-regulated, compared with those in the IRI group (P < 0.05). Further immunohistochemistry staining and Western blot showed that 3-MA-treated IRI group presented down-regulated Caspase-3 and up-regulated Bcl-2 protein expression with comparison of IRI group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Retina IRI-caused RGCs loss involved activated autophagy pathway and apoptosis, which could be prevented by autophagy inhibitor 3-MA. Autophagy inhibitor 3-MA may act as a potent therapeutic tool in attenuating retina IRI.","['Wang, Xiaorui', 'Wu, Yuyu']","['Wang X', 'Wu Y']",,"['Ophthalmology Department, Second Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou, China.', 'Ophthalmology Department, Second Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou, China. qzwyydoctor@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial, Veterinary']",20200108,Netherlands,Int Ophthalmol,International ophthalmology,7904294,IM,,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Beclin-1/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Count', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reperfusion Injury/diagnosis/*prevention & control', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Retinal Vessels/diagnostic imaging/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['3-Methyladenine', 'Autophagy', 'Retinal ischemia-reperfusion']",2020/01/10 06:00,2021/03/27 06:00,['2020/01/10 06:00'],"['2019/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10792-019-01272-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s10792-019-01272-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Int Ophthalmol. 2020 May;40(5):1095-1101. doi: 10.1007/s10792-019-01272-9.

METHODS: Retrospectively, differences in body weight changes and serum LTs in AML patients (n = 213) who received PN versus no PN during RI treatment in one of three Dutch hospitals between 2004 and 2015 were assessed. Weekly body weight and serum LT registrations were collected from medical records. Patients' body weight changes were compared between the hospitals where PN is applied upon first indication of inadequate oral intake (PN hospitals) and the hospital where use of PN is limited to severe cases only (no-PN hospital) using repeated measures mixed model analysis. Differences in severity of serum LT elevations, according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, were assessed between patients who did and did not receive PN using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, and multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Compared with patients of the PN hospitals, patients of the no-PN hospital experienced significantly more body weight loss during RI treatment (between-group difference 7.2%, 95% CI 4.0-10.3%). Furthermore, PN was associated with transient mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes, but not with raised median total bilirubin levels nor with occurrence of CTCAE grade 3-4 LT elevations. CONCLUSION: Frequent compared with exceptional use of PN in AML patients during RI treatment better preserved body weight, without clinically relevant (CTCAE grade 3-4) elevations in serum LTs.","['van Lieshout, Rianne', 'Tick, Lidwine W', 'Dieleman, Jeanne P', 'Custers, Stephanie', 'van Dongen, Marieke S', 'van der Lee, Debbie', 'Schaaphok, Anne R', 'Snellen, Merel', 'Schouten, Harry C', 'Beijer, Sandra']","['van Lieshout R', 'Tick LW', 'Dieleman JP', 'Custers S', 'van Dongen MS', 'van der Lee D', 'Schaaphok AR', 'Snellen M', 'Schouten HC', 'Beijer S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9898-6100'],"['Department of Dietetics and Nutrition, Maxima MC, De Run 4600, 5504 DB, Veldhoven, The Netherlands. r.vanlieshout@mmc.nl.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Maxima MC, De Run 4600, 5504 DB, Veldhoven, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Research, Maxima MC, De Run 4600, 5504 DB, Veldhoven, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Dietetics and Nutrition, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Dietetics and Nutrition, Catharina Hospital, Michelangelolaan 2, 5623 EJ, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Dietetics and Nutrition, Maxima MC, De Run 4600, 5504 DB, Veldhoven, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Dietetics and Nutrition, Maxima MC, De Run 4600, 5504 DB, Veldhoven, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Research and Development, Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organization, Godebaldkwartier 419, 3511 DT, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Dietetics and Nutrition, Maxima MC, De Run 4600, 5504 DB, Veldhoven, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Research and Development, Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organization, Godebaldkwartier 419, 3511 DT, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section Hematology, Maastricht University Medical Center, P.

Methods: The cooperative program begins when the patient is diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Newly diagnosed AML patients are admitted to the internal medicine hematology department, then attending hematology physician requests a consultation from the occupational and environmental medicine (OEM) department. The OEM doctor next visits the hospitalized patient and interviews them to take their occupational history, and preliminarily evaluates the likelihood that the condition is associated with occupation. If the patient wants to apply for compensation through the Korea Workers' Compensation & Welfare Service, the patient was informed to visits the outpatient clinic of the OEM department and requests a 'work-relatedness evaluation report' for use in applying for compensation. Results: Among the 103 patients, who received an OEM departmental work history evaluation, 18 patients were considered to have a work-related incidence and 12 patients were registered in the Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance system.

Prostate cancer is characterized by relatively low numbers of mutations, and, in contrast to many other common epithelial cancers, commercially available single nucleotide mutation assays for quantification of ctDNA are insufficient for therapy assessment in this disease. However, prostate cancer shares some similarity with translocation-affected mesenchymal tumors (e.g., leukemia and Ewing sarcoma), which are common in pediatric oncology, where chromosomal translocations are used as biomarkers for quantification of the tumor burden. Approximately 50% of prostate cancers carry a chromosomal translocation resulting in generation of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene, which is unique to the tumor cells of each individual patient because of variability in the fusion breakpoint sites. In the present study, we examined the structural preconditions for TMPRSS2-ERG fusion sites in comparison with mesenchymal tumors in pediatric patients to determine whether the sequence composition is suitable for the establishment of tumor-specific quantification assays in prostate cancer patients. Genomic repeat elements represent potential obstacles to establishment of quantification assays, and we found similar proportions of repeat elements at fusion sites in prostate cancer to those reported for mesenchymal tumors, where genomic fusion sequences are established as biomarkers. Our data support the development of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene as a noninvasive tumor marker for therapy assessment, risk stratification, and relapse detection to improve personalized therapy strategies for patients with prostate cancer.","['Krumbholz, Manuela', 'Agaimy, Abbas', 'Stoehr, Robert', 'Burger, Maximilian', 'Wach, Sven', 'Taubert, Helge', 'Wullich, Bernd', 'Hartmann, Arndt', 'Metzler, Markus']","['Krumbholz M', 'Agaimy A', 'Stoehr R', 'Burger M', 'Wach S', 'Taubert H', 'Wullich B', 'Hartmann A', 'Metzler M']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4416-0394', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0445-8161', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7018-3517', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9077-1727']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Erlangen, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital Erlangen, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital Erlangen, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Urology, University of Regensburg, Caritas St. Josef Medical Center, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Urology and Pediatric Urology, University Hospital Erlangen, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Urology and Pediatric Urology, University Hospital Erlangen, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Urology and Pediatric Urology, University Hospital Erlangen, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital Erlangen, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Erlangen, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20191212,United States,Dis Markers,Disease markers,8604127,IM,,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell-Free Nucleic Acids/genetics', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Connective and Soft Tissue/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precision Medicine', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",,,2020/01/10 06:00,2020/05/12 06:00,['2020/01/10 06:00'],"['2019/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/5085373 [doi]'],epublish,Dis Markers. 2019 Dec 12;2019:5085373. doi: 10.1155/2019/5085373. eCollection 2019.,PMC6930771,['The authors confirm that there are no conflicts of interest.'],,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell-Free Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TMPRSS2-ERG fusion protein, human)']",['Copyright (c) 2019 Manuela Krumbholz et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this research was to evaluate the antileukemic effect of ASF on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, which was hypothesized from the systemic pharmacological analysis of ASF, focusing on the combined effect of ASF extract (ASFE) and imatinib (IM). The compounds of ASF were identified using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database and analysis platform. The target gene information was acquired from the UniProt database. The compound and target interaction network was generated from Cytoscape 3.7.1. Using this analysis, 10 compounds effective against CML cells were obtained. ASFE was prepared and analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography to provide experimental proof for the relationship between ASF and CML. The anti-p210(Bcr-Abl) effects of ASFE and ASFE + IM combination were evaluated by western blotting. Either ASFE alone or in combined treatment with IM on K-562 CML cells resulted in a significant reduction of the Bcr-Abl levels. As expected from the systemic analysis results, ASF had antileukemic activity, showing that it is a potential therapy for CML.","['Kim, Youn Sook', 'Suh, Su Yeon', 'Ahn, Yong Tae', 'Lee, Chul Won', 'Lee, Sang Yull', 'Ahn, Soon Cheol', 'An, Won G']","['Kim YS', 'Suh SY', 'Ahn YT', 'Lee CW', 'Lee SY', 'Ahn SC', 'An WG']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7781-1480', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5826-6392', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1341-2114']","['School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan 50512, Republic of Korea.', 'Okpo Korean Medicine Clinic, Daegu 42970, Republic of Korea.', 'Research Institute for Korean Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan 50612, Republic of Korea.', 'Research Institute for Korean Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan 50612, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan 50512, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan 50512, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Korean Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan 50612, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191212,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,,,2020/01/10 06:00,2020/01/10 06:01,['2020/01/10 06:00'],"['2019/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/6959764 [doi]'],epublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2019 Dec 12;2019:6959764. doi: 10.1155/2019/6959764. eCollection 2019.,PMC6930722,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Youn Sook Kim et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has done likewise for midostaurin, CPX-351, and GO. While increasing options for persons, particularly older ones, for whom current therapy is unsatisfactory, or simply not given, these approvals raise several concerns. Although the venetoclax and glasdegib approvals were for persons considered ""unfit"" for intensive induction, the criteria for fitness were not well defined (age >/=75 per se being insufficient) and are frequently subjective, making it likely that many subjects in the venetoclax and glasdegib registration trials were fit for intensive induction; for example, none had performance status 3-4. Fitness must be assessed together with the potential efficacy of a proposed therapy. We note the modest complete remission rates and durations in the venetoclax + hypomethylating agent trial. Although these formed the basis for FDA approval, it is unclear that better results might not have obtained with more intense induction, as several studies, with considerably longer-follow up, have suggested. Hence, we question the venetoclax (and glasdegib) approvals absent randomized comparisons with intense induction. Given the uncertain relation in older individuals between survival and complete remission (CR), much less responses less than CR, we are skeptical of the sole use of these responses in the ivosidenib and venetoclax approvals; we also question the use of survival, without event-free survival, in the glasdegib approval. Noting the midostaurin and CPX-351 approvals included populations not participating in the registration studies we suggest means to address this issue as well as those involving fitness, randomization, and endpoints.","['Estey, Elihu', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Emadi, Ashkan', 'Othus, Megan', 'Gale, Robert Peter']","['Estey E', 'Karp JE', 'Emadi A', 'Othus M', 'Gale RP']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8176-6371'],"['Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. eestey@uw.edu.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA. eestey@uw.edu.', 'Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Public Health Division and SWOG Statistical Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Haematology Research Centre, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200108,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Approval', 'Gemtuzumab/pharmacology', 'Glycine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",,,2020/01/10 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2020/01/10 06:00'],"['2019/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0704-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0704-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Mar;34(3):671-681. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0704-5.

Moreover, the prognosis of patients with co-occurring NPM1 and FLT3/ITD mutations is controversial. Here, we analyzed the impact of NPM1 mutations on prognoses of 869 pediatric AML patients from the TAGET dataset. The frequency of NPM1 mutations was 7.6%. NPM1 mutations were significantly associated with older age (P < 0.001), normal cytogenetics (P < 0.001), FLT3/ITD mutations (P < 0.001), and high complete remission induction rates (P < 0.05). Overall, NPM1-mutated patients had a significantly better 5-year EFS (P = 0.001) and OS (P = 0.016) compared to NPM1 wild-type patients, and this favorable impact was maintained even in the presence of FLT3/ITD mutations. Stem cell transplantation had no significant effect on the survival of patients with both NPM1 and FLT3/ITD mutations. Multivariate analysis revealed that NPM1 mutations were independent predictors of better outcome in terms of EFS (P = 0.004) and OS (P = 0.012). Our findings showed that NPM1 mutations confer an independent favorable prognostic impact in pediatric AML despite of FLT3/ITD mutations. In addition, pediatric AML patients with both NPM1 and FLT3/ITD mutations appear to have favorable prognoses and may not need hematopoietic stem cell transplantations.","['Xu, Lu-Hong', 'Fang, Jian-Pei', 'Liu, Yao-Chung', 'Jones, Adrianna I', 'Chai, Li']","['Xu LH', 'Fang JP', 'Liu YC', 'Jones AI', 'Chai L']",,"[""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Davidson College, Davidson, NC, 28035, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA. lchai@bwh.harvard.edu.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200109,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,IM,,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetics/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis']",,,2020/01/10 06:00,2020/09/25 06:00,['2020/01/10 06:00'],"['2019/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-019-0268-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-019-0268-7 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2020 Jan 9;10(1):1. doi: 10.1038/s41408-019-0268-7.,PMC6949268,,,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated acalabrutinib plus obinutuzumab in a phase Ib/II study (NCT02296918) of patients with treatment-naive or relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Nineteen treatment-naive and 26 relapsed/refractory patients were treated with acalabrutinib (100 mg twice daily) until progression and obinutuzumab (cycle 1: 100 mg day 1, 900 mg day 2, 1000 mg days 8 and 15; cycles 2-6: 1,000 mg day 1). Grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 71% of patients. Overall response rates were 95% (treatment-naive) and 92% (relapsed/refractory). Thirty-two percent of treatment-naive and 8% of relapsed/refractory patients achieved complete remission. At 36 months, 94% (treatment-naive) and 88% (relapsed/refractory) were progression free. Acalabrutinib plus obinutuzumab was well tolerated, producing high and durable responses in treatment-naive and relapsed/refractory CLL. SIGNIFICANCE: Rituximab plus the less selective BTK inhibitor ibrutinib has not shown benefit in CLL; however, the selective BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib plus the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-enhanced antibody obinutuzumab yielded durable responses that deepened over time in treatment-naive and relapsed/refractory CLL, supporting the evaluation of this approach in larger, comparative studies in CLL.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 327.","['Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Blachly, James S', 'Rogers, Kerry A', 'Bhat, Seema A', 'Jianfar, Mojgan', 'Lozanski, Gerard', 'Weiss, David M', 'Andersen, Barbara L', 'Gulrajani, Michael', 'Frigault, Melanie M', 'Hamdy, Ahmed', 'Izumi, Raquel', 'Munugalavadla, Veerendra', 'Quah, Cheng', 'Wang, Min-Hui', 'Byrd, John C']","['Woyach JA', 'Blachly JS', 'Rogers KA', 'Bhat SA', 'Jianfar M', 'Lozanski G', 'Weiss DM', 'Andersen BL', 'Gulrajani M', 'Frigault MM', 'Hamdy A', 'Izumi R', 'Munugalavadla V', 'Quah C', 'Wang MH', 'Byrd JC']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4275-5562', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7335-1325']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio. jennifer.woyach@osumc.edu.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Acerta Pharma, a member of the AstraZeneca Group, South San Francisco, California.', 'Acerta Pharma, a member of the AstraZeneca Group, South San Francisco, California.', 'Acerta Pharma, a member of the AstraZeneca Group, South San Francisco, California.', 'Acerta Pharma, a member of the AstraZeneca Group, South San Francisco, California.', 'Acerta Pharma, a member of the AstraZeneca Group, South San Francisco, California.', 'Acerta Pharma, a member of the AstraZeneca Group, South San Francisco, California.', 'Acerta Pharma, a member of the AstraZeneca Group, South San Francisco, California.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200108,United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,IM,,"['Adult', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Benzamides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyrazines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2020/01/10 06:00,2021/06/10 06:00,['2020/01/10 06:00'],"['2019/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['2159-8290.CD-19-1130 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-19-1130 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2020 Mar;10(3):394-405. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-19-1130.

The HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) gene is constantly expressed in HTLV-1 infected cells and ATL cells. HBZ protein suppresses transcription of the tax gene through blocking the LTR recruitment of not only ATF/CREB factors but also CBP/p300. HBZ promotes transcription of Foxp3, CCR4, and T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT). Thus, HBZ is critical for the immunophenotype of infected cells and ATL cells. HBZ also functions in its RNA form. HBZ RNA suppresses apoptosis and promotes proliferation of T cells. Since HBZ RNA is not recognized by cytotoxic T cells, HTLV-1 has a clever strategy for avoiding immune detection.

The choice of an optimum supportive treatment should be based on local epidemiology, as well as intensity and toxicity of the anti-leukemic therapy applied.Areas covered: This review presents an overview of recently published studies focusing on the prevention of infection in pediatric AML patients. PubMed has been systematically searched for clinical trials, reviews, and meta-analyses published in the last 10 years. The focus of this article will be limited to primary prophylaxis only, while secondary prophylaxis is beyond the scope of the current review.Expert opinion: Although anti-bacterial agents may decrease the bacterial infection burden, there is no consensus regarding prophylactic use. To that end, there is a need for further randomized controlled trials to establish the precise role of anti-bacterial prophylaxis in pediatric AML patients. The prophylactic use of anti-fungal agents is strongly recommended for all AML patients. Since the contribution of hematopoietic growth factors to improved survival has not been demonstrated, they should not be routinely applied. Decisions regarding an appropriate prophylactic strategy should be taken in collaboration with the infectious disease experts and pharmacology team.","['Arad-Cohen, Nira', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Shachor-Meyouhas, Yael']","['Arad-Cohen N', 'Rowe JM', 'Shachor-Meyouhas Y']",,"[""Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Department, Ruth Rappaport Children's Hospital, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel."", 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus Haifa, Haifa, Israel.', 'Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.', ""Pediatric Infectious Diseases Unit, Rambam Health Care Campus, Ruth Rappaport Children's Hospital Haifa, Israel.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200108,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,IM,,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'children', 'infection', 'prophylaxis']",2020/01/09 06:00,2020/03/11 06:00,['2020/01/09 06:00'],"['2020/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14656566.2019.1701654 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2020 Feb;21(2):193-205. doi: 10.1080/14656566.2019.1701654.

Luspatercept, a recombinant fusion protein that binds transforming growth factor beta superfamily ligands to reduce SMAD2 and SMAD3 signaling, showed promising results in a phase 2 study. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with very-low-risk, low-risk, or intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (defined according to the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System) with ring sideroblasts who had been receiving regular red-cell transfusions to receive either luspatercept (at a dose of 1.0 up to 1.75 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo, administered subcutaneously every 3 weeks. The primary end point was transfusion independence for 8 weeks or longer during weeks 1 through 24, and the key secondary end point was transfusion independence for 12 weeks or longer, assessed during both weeks 1 through 24 and weeks 1 through 48. RESULTS: Of the 229 patients enrolled, 153 were randomly assigned to receive luspatercept and 76 to receive placebo; the baseline characteristics of the patients were balanced. Transfusion independence for 8 weeks or longer was observed in 38% of the patients in the luspatercept group, as compared with 13% of those in the placebo group (P<0.001). A higher percentage of patients in the luspatercept group than in the placebo group met the key secondary end point (28% vs. 8% for weeks 1 through 24, and 33% vs. 12% for weeks 1 through 48; P<0.001 for both comparisons). The most common luspatercept-associated adverse events (of any grade) included fatigue, diarrhea, asthenia, nausea, and dizziness. The incidence of adverse events decreased over time. CONCLUSIONS: Luspatercept reduced the severity of anemia in patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts who had been receiving regular red-cell transfusions and who had disease that was refractory to or unlikely to respond to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents or who had discontinued such agents owing to an adverse event.

Previous studies have identified cytokine-selective IL6ST defects that preserve LIF signaling. We describe three unrelated families with at least five affected individuals who presented with lethal Stuve-Wiedemann-like syndrome characterized by skeletal dysplasia and neonatal lung dysfunction with additional features such as congenital thrombocytopenia, eczematoid dermatitis, renal abnormalities, and defective acute-phase response. We identified essential loss-of-function variants in IL6ST (a homozygous nonsense variant and a homozygous intronic splice variant with exon skipping). Functional tests showed absent cellular responses to GP130-dependent cytokines including IL-6, IL-11, IL-27, oncostatin M (OSM), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Genetic reconstitution of GP130 by lentiviral transduction in patient-derived cells reversed the signaling defect. This study identifies a new genetic syndrome caused by the complete lack of signaling of a whole family of GP130-dependent cytokines in humans and highlights the importance of the LIF signaling pathway in pre- and perinatal development.","['Chen, Yin-Huai', 'Grigelioniene, Giedre', 'Newton, Phillip T', 'Gullander, Jacob', 'Elfving, Maria', 'Hammarsjo, Anna', 'Batkovskyte, Dominyka', 'Alsaif,

We hypothesize that there is no consistent monogenetic inheritance. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the serrated polyposis phenotype, assessing features of mendelian inheritance, and to compare these features with patients with a solitary sessile serrated lesion. DESIGN: This was a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database comparing patients with serrated polyposis versus solitary sessile serrated lesions. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a single-institution tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Patients with serrated polyposis meeting World Health Organization criteria type I (>/=5 serrated polyps proximal to the sigmoid, >/=2 of which are >/=10 mm in diameter) and isolated sessile serrated lesions were included MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:: Disease phenotype was the main outcome measured. RESULTS: A total of 46 serrated polyposis patients were identified. Median age of first sessile serrated lesion was 66 years (interquartile range, 42-70 y). A total of 60.3% were current or past smokers (mean = 38.6 packs per year). Serrated polyposis patients had a higher number of all types of polyps (26.3 vs 4.4) and a higher rate of high-grade dysplasia (19.6% vs 3.7%) compared with patients with a solitary sessile serrated lesion. A total of 36.2% of patients had personal history of noncolorectal cancers, including skin, prostate, breast, thyroid, and renal cell cancers and leukemia. In addition, 32.6% had a family history of colorectal cancer in first- or second-degree relatives; these cancers were not young age of onset. Breast and prostate cancers were also common (family history of any cancer, 83.0%). Ten patients underwent genetic testing: 4 had negative panels, 1 had a pathogenic variant in MSH2, 1 an IVS7 deletion in PTEN, 2 negative APC sequencing (1 negative MYH), and 1 a pathogenic variant in Chek2. LIMITATIONS: RNF4 was not sequenced. Genetic analysis was performed on a subset of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of associated cancers suggests an underlying genetic predisposition to disordered growth, but serrated polyposis does not have typical features of dominant inheritance. The association with smoking suggests that familial/environmental factors play a role. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B84.

La edad mediana de la primera lesion serrada sesil fue de 66 anos (RIC: 42-70 anos). El 60.3% eran fumadores actuales o pasados (medio 38.6 paquetes / ano). Los pacientes con poliposis serrada tuvieron un mayor numero de todos los tipos de polipos (26.3 versus 4.4) y una mayor tasa de displasia de alto grado (19.6% versus 3.7%) en comparacion con los pacientes con una lesion serrada sesil solitaria. El 36.2% de los pacientes tenian antecedentes personales de canceres no colorectales, incluyendo los canceres de piel, prostata, mama, tiroides, celulas renales y leucemia. El 32.6% tenia antecedentes familiares de cancer colorectal en familiares de primer o segundo grado; estos canceres no eran de inicio de edad temprana. El cancer de mama y prostata tambien fue frecuente (antecedentes familiares de cualquier tipo de cancer: 83.0%). 10 pacientes se sometieron a pruebas geneticas: 4 tenian paneles negativos, 1 tenia una variante patogenica en MSH2, 1 una eliminacion IVS7 en PTEN, 2 secuenciacion APC negativa (1 MYH negativa) y 1 variante patogenica en Chek2.RNF4 no fue secuenciado. El analisis genetico se realizo en un subconjunto de pacientes.La tasa de canceres asociados sugiere una predisposicion genetica subyacente al crecimiento desordenado, pero la poliposis serrada no tiene caracteristicas tipicas de herencia dominante. La asociacion con el tabaquismo sugiere que los factores familiares / ambientales juegan un papel. Consulte Video Resumen en http://links.lww.com/DCR/B84.

However, in diagnostic settings other techniques are often employed. We assess whether equivalent CNA profiles are called using SNP arrays, ensuring platform independence. We demonstrate concordance between SNP6.0 and MLPA CNA calling on 143 leukaemia samples from two UK trials; comparing 1,287 calls within eight genes and a region. The techniques are 99% concordant using manually augmented calling, and 98% concordant using an automated pipeline. We classify these discordant calls and examine reasons for discordance. In nine cases the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm failed to detect focal abnormalities or those flanking gaps in IKZF1 probe coverage. Eight cases were discordant due to probe design differences, with focal abnormalities detectable using one technique not observable by the other. Risk classification using manually augmented array calling resulted in four out of 143 patients being assigned to a different CNA risk group and eight patients using the automated pipeline. We conclude that MLPA defined CNA profiles can be accurately mirrored by SNP6.0 or similar array platforms. Automated calling using the CBS algorithm proved successful, except for IKZF1 which should be manually inspected.","['Bashton, Matthew', 'Hollis, Robin', 'Ryan, Sarra', 'Schwab, Claire J', 'Moppett, John', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Enshaei, Amir']","['Bashton M', 'Hollis R', 'Ryan S', 'Schwab CJ', 'Moppett J', 'Harrison CJ', 'Moorman AV', 'Enshaei A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6847-1525'],"['Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Faculty of Medical Science, Centre for Cancer, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU, UK.', 'Department of Applied Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 8ST, UK.', 'Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Faculty of Medical Science, Centre for Cancer, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU, UK.', 'Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Faculty of Medical Science, Centre for Cancer, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU, UK.', 'Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Faculty of Medical Science, Centre for Cancer, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Bristol, BS2 8BJ, UK.', 'Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Faculty of Medical Science, Centre for Cancer, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU, UK.', 'Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Faculty of Medical Science, Centre for Cancer, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU, UK.', 'Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Faculty of Medical Science, Centre for Cancer, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU, UK. amir.enshaei@newcastle.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200108,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', '*DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Gene Dosage', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",,,2020/01/09 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/01/09 06:00'],"['2019/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-56972-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-56972-0 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Jan 8;10(1):45. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-56972-0.,PMC6949215,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genome-wide association studies have identified common risk alleles at 24 independent loci. Sequencing studies of familial cases and kindreds have begun to identify promising candidate genes where variants with strong effects on MM risk might reside. Finally, functional studies are starting to give insight into how identified risk alleles promote the development of MM.

Although novel emerging drugs are available, the overall prognosis remains poor and new therapeutic approaches are required. PP2A phosphatase is a key regulator of cell homeostasis and is recurrently inactivated in AML. The anticancer activity of several PP2A-activating drugs (e.g., FTY720) depends on their interaction with the SET oncoprotein, an endogenous PP2A inhibitor that is overexpressed in 30% of AML cases. Elucidation of SET regulatory mechanisms may therefore provide novel targeted therapies for SET-overexpressing AMLs. Here, we show that upregulation of protein kinase p38beta is a common event in AML. We provide evidence that p38beta potentiates SET-mediated PP2A inactivation by two mechanisms: facilitating SET cytoplasmic translocation through CK2 phosphorylation, and directly binding to and stabilizing the SET protein. We demonstrate the importance of this new regulatory mechanism in primary AML cells from patients and in zebrafish xenograft models. Accordingly, combination of the CK2 inhibitor CX-4945, which retains SET in the nucleus, and FTY720, which disrupts the SET-PP2A binding in the cytoplasm, significantly reduces the viability and migration of AML cells. In conclusion, we show that the p38beta/CK2/SET axis represents a new potential therapeutic pathway in AML patients with SET-dependent PP2A inactivation.","['Arriazu, Elena', 'Vicente, Carmen', 'Pippa, Raffaella', 'Peris, Irene', 'Martinez-Balsalobre, Elena', 'Garcia-Ramirez, Patricia', 'Marcotegui, Nerea', 'Igea, Ana', 'Alignani, Diego', 'Rifon, Jose', 'Mateos, Maria C', 'Cayuela, Maria L', 'Nebreda, Angel R', 'Odero, Maria D']","['Arriazu E', 'Vicente C', 'Pippa R', 'Peris I', 'Martinez-Balsalobre E', 'Garcia-Ramirez P', 'Marcotegui N', 'Igea A', 'Alignani D', 'Rifon J', 'Mateos MC', 'Cayuela ML', 'Nebreda AR', 'Odero MD']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1028-6511'],"['University of Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), Pamplona, Spain. earriazu@unav.es.', 'CIBERONC, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain. earriazu@unav.es.', 'University of Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), Pamplona, Spain.', 'University of Navarra, Biochemistry and Genetics Department, Pamplona, Spain.', 'University of Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), Pamplona, Spain.', 'Thomas Jefferson University, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Molecular Oncology Department, Philadelphia, USA.', 'University of Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), Pamplona, Spain.', 'University of Navarra, Biochemistry and Genetics Department, Pamplona, Spain.', 'University Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca, and Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria (IMIB), Murcia, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra (CHN), Pamplona, Spain.', 'University of Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), Pamplona, Spain.', 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'University of Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), Pamplona, Spain.', 'CIBERONC, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'University of Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), Pamplona, Spain.', 'CIBERONC, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'IdiSNA, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra (CHN), Pamplona, Spain.', 'IdiSNA, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'University Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca, and Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria (IMIB), Murcia, Spain.', 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.', 'University of Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), Pamplona, Spain. modero@unav.es.', 'CIBERONC, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain. modero@unav.es.', 'University of Navarra, Biochemistry and Genetics Department, Pamplona, Spain. modero@unav.es.', 'IdiSNA, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain. modero@unav.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200108,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,IM,,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Histone Chaperones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Zebrafish']",,,2020/01/09 06:00,2020/09/25 06:00,['2020/01/09 06:00'],"['2019/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-019-0270-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-019-0270-0 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2020 Jan 8;10(1):3. doi: 10.1038/s41408-019-0270-0.,PMC6949222,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (SET protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the majority of cases, there is overexpression of MUC4, and most cases show EWSR1-CREB3L1 gene fusions. A subset of SEF displays composite histologic features of SEF and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS). These ""hybrid"" tumors are more likely to harbor the FUS-CREB3L2 fusion, which is also seen in most LGFMS. We, here, characterize a series of 8 soft tissue neoplasms with morphologic features highly overlapping with LGFMS and SEF but lacking MUC4 expression and EWSR1/FUS-CREB3L gene fusions. Seven tumors showed fusions of the YAP1 and KMT2A genes, and 1 had a fusion of PRRX1 and KMT2D; all but 1 case displayed reciprocal gene fusions. At gene expression profiling, YAP1 and KMT2A/PRRX1 and KMT2D tumors were distinct from LGFMS/SEF. The patients were 4 female individuals and 4 male individuals aged 11 to 91 years. Tumors with known locations were in the lower extremity (5), trunk (2), and upper extremity (1); 3 originated in acral locations. Tumor size ranged from 2.5 to 13 cm. Proportions of SEF-like and LGFMS-like areas varied considerably among tumors. All tumors that showed infiltrative growth and mitotic figures per 10 HPFs ranged from 0 to 18. Tumor necrosis was present in 1 case. Follow-up was available for 5 patients (11 to 321 mo), 2 of whom developed local recurrences, and 1 died of metastatic disease. The clinical behavior of these soft tissue sarcomas remains to be further delineated in larger series with extended follow-up; however, our limited clinical data indicate that they are potentially aggressive.","['Puls, Florian', 'Agaimy, Abbas', 'Flucke, Uta', 'Mentzel, Thomas', 'Sumathi, Vaiyapuri P', 'Ploegmakers, Marieke', 'Stoehr, Robert', 'Kindblom, Lars-Gunnar', 'Hansson, Magnus', 'Sydow, Saskia', 'Arbajian, Elsa', 'Mertens, Fredrik']","['Puls F', 'Agaimy A', 'Flucke U', 'Mentzel T', 'Sumathi VP', 'Ploegmakers M', 'Stoehr R', 'Kindblom LG', 'Hansson M', 'Sydow S', 'Arbajian E', 'Mertens F']",,"['Department Clinical Pathology and Genetics, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital of Erlangen, Erlangen.', 'Departments of Pathology.', 'Dermatopathology Friedrichshafen, Germany.', 'Department of Musculoskeletal Pathology, Royal Orthopaedic Hospital, Birmingham, UK.', 'Radiology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital of Erlangen, Erlangen.', 'Department Clinical Pathology and Genetics, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg.', 'Department Clinical Pathology and Genetics, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics and Pathology, University and Regional Laboratories, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Progression', 'Epithelioid Cells/pathology', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Fibrosarcoma/*genetics/mortality/secondary/therapy', '*Gene Fusion', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'RNA-Seq', 'Sclerosis', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/*genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'YAP-Signaling Proteins']",,,2020/01/09 06:00,2020/07/29 06:00,['2020/01/09 06:00'],"['2020/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/PAS.0000000000001423 [doi]', '00000478-202005000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2020 May;44(5):594-606. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0000000000001423.,,,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (PRRX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (YAP-Signaling Proteins)', '0 (YAP1 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we highlight recent advances in allogeneic HCT that broadened access, refined prognostication, and improved outcomes of AML patients undergoing this procedure. RECENT FINDINGS: Eligibility for allogeneic HCT continued to expand to AML patients older than 60 years, as well as to patients lacking human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors with the advent of alternative donor sources, such as umbilical cord blood and HLA-haploidentical transplantation. Molecular profiling of AML has redefined prognostication for patients in specific AML genomic subgroups undergoing allogeneic HCT and has served as a new strategy for measuring minimal residual disease before and after allogeneic HCT. Using high intensity conditioning regimens has emerged as a potential strategy to reduce risk of relapse and improve overall survival, especially in patients with minimal residual disease prior to allogeneic HCT. SUMMARY: As access to allogeneic HCT continues to improve, also, with more refined prognostic strategies, the field continues to move to optimize transplantation approaches by decreasing the risk of relapse and minimizing transplant-related complications.","['Gomez-Arteaga, Alexandra', 'Gyurkocza, Boglarka']","['Gomez-Arteaga A', 'Gyurkocza B']",,"['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,,"['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",,,2020/01/09 06:00,2020/06/04 06:00,['2020/01/09 06:00'],"['2020/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000572 [doi]', '00062752-202003000-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2020 Mar;27(2):115-121. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000572.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosing and treating these patients remains challenging. In recent years, systematic efforts have been made to better define the genetic landscape of MPAL. These insights allow better understanding of the pathophysiology of MPAL, have the potential for a more biologically meaningful classification and may promote targeted, novel approaches to treat these leukemias. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies suggest that MPALs originate in a multipotent primitive cell, demonstrate large genetic diversity and include subgroups that may benefit from targeted therapy. Recent data support the use of ALL-type induction followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first remission for most adults. Novel targeted approaches hold promise for treatment of MPAL; however, some may unpredictably select for clonal expansion of cells from a different lineage than observed at presentation. SUMMARY: A biologically and genetically driven classification of MPAL may yield more accurate prognosis and potentially direct therapy in patients with MPAL. Prospective efforts that incorporate targeted approaches based on genetics and immunophenotype are warranted.","['Wolach, Ofir', 'Stone, Richard M']","['Wolach O', 'Stone RM']",,"['Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Departement of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*therapy', 'Phenotype']",,,2020/01/09 06:00,2020/06/04 06:00,['2020/01/09 06:00'],"['2020/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000570 [doi]', '00062752-202003000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2020 Mar;27(2):95-102. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000570.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used the outer cellular domain of the B-lymphocyte antigen, CD19, as the target for this study. First, using available protein-aptamer structures deposited in the protein data bank as resources, structural annotation was performed to seek the most probable binding aptamer and its potential initial configuration to the CD19 structure. Using this initial structure, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for adjustment of the aptamer-binding. During this process, we observed an ""aptamer walking"" mechanism of the binding of the single-stranded RNA-aptamer to CD19: the aptamer molecule gradually adjusts its configurations and shifts toward favorable binding positions. However, the target molecule CD19 maintained a relatively stable conformation during this process. The interface area between the RNA-aptamer and CD19 increased from less than 8 nm(2) to over 12 nm(2) during a 2-mus MD simulation. Using a stable binding pose as the starting structure, we manually mutated the RNA-aptamer to a DNA-aptamer and found that the interface area was further increased to over 16 nm(2) , indicating a stronger affinity compared to the RNA-aptamer. The RNA- and DNA-aptamers and their stable binding-poses to the CD19 molecule may be used as templates in designing potential aptamer molecules that target the B-cell marker molecule CD19 with enhanced specificity and stability.","['Danquah, Michael K', 'Guo, Hao-Bo', 'Tan, Kei X', 'Bhakta, Manoo']","['Danquah MK', 'Guo HB', 'Tan KX', 'Bhakta M']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4232-7138'],"['Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Tennessee, Chattanooga, Tennessee.', 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Tennessee, Chattanooga, Tennessee.', 'SimCenter, University of Tennessee, Chattanooga, Tennessee.', 'School of Materials Science & Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.', ""Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital at Erlanger, Chattanooga, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200111,United States,Biotechnol Prog,Biotechnology progress,8506292,IM,,"['Antigens, CD19/drug effects/*genetics', 'Aptamers, Nucleotide/chemistry/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Conformation/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell leukemia', '*CD19', '*MD simulations', '*aptamer', '*aptamer-walking']",2020/01/09 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2020/01/09 06:00'],"['2019/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/btpr.2957 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Prog. 2020 May;36(3):e2957. doi: 10.1002/btpr.2957.

This study assessed the putative link between cardiac failure (CF) and AZA exposure. METHODS: Cases of CF in patients treated with AZA were retrospectively collected and described from several centres of the Groupe Francophone des Myelodysplasies. A description analysis and a disproportionality analysis using Vigibase, the WHO Global Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) database, were conducted on ICSRs by the Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQ broad) cardiac failure and by preferred terms cardiac failure and cardiac failure acute. The reported odds ratio (ROR) and its 95% 2-sided confidence interval was computed by comparing the proportion of CF reports with the suspected drug (AZA) and the proportion of reports of the same adverse drug reaction with all other suspected drugs in the database during the same period. RESULTS: In the 4 case reports, all patients presented a cardiovascular history. In 1 patient, CF recurred after AZA re-challenge. The pharmacovigilance analysis in Vigibase retrieved 307 ICSRs of CF (SMQ) with AZA. Significant disproportionality signals associated with AZA were identified by using the SMQ cardiac failure (ROR 1.3) and the preferred terms cardiac failure (ROR 5.1) and cardiac failure acute (ROR 23.2). CONCLUSION: This study points to the potential role of AZA in the occurrence of CF. Cardiac evaluation before AZA initiation and regular monitoring of cardiac function during AZA treatment should be performed in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease.","['Perino, Justine', 'Mottal, Nathan', 'Bohbot, Yohann', 'Servant, Vincent', 'Berroneau, Aude', 'Poustis, Pierre', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Laribi, Kamel', 'Charbonnier, Aude', 'Bilion, Emilien', 'Calmettes, Claire', 'Begaud, Bernard', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Miremont-Salame, Ghada', 'Theophile, Helene', 'Dimicoli-Salazar, Sophie']","['Perino J', 'Mottal N', 'Bohbot Y', 'Servant V', 'Berroneau A', 'Poustis P', 'Fenaux P', 'Laribi K', 'Charbonnier A', 'Bilion E', 'Calmettes C', 'Begaud B', 'Pigneux A', 'Milpied N', 'Miremont-Salame G', 'Theophile H', 'Dimicoli-Salazar S']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0039-0734'],"['CHU de Bordeaux, Pole de Sante Publique, Service de pharmacologie medicale, Centre Regional de pharmacovigilance de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', ""CHU de Bordeaux, Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire Bordeaux, France."", ""CHU d'Amiens, Pole Coeur-Thorax-Vaisseaux, Departement de Cardiologie, Amiens Cedex, France."", 'Pharmacie a Usage Interieur, CHU de Bordeaux, Pessac, France.', 'Pharmacie a Usage Interieur, CHU de Bordeaux, Pessac, France.', 'Service des soins intensifs cardiologiques Haut-Leveque (intensive care unit), Pessac, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Seniors, Hopital Saint Louis, Ass Pub Hop Paris and Paris 7 Universite Paris, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier du Mans, Le Mans, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France."", ""CHU de Bordeaux, Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire Bordeaux, France."", 'Univ.

The Phase 3 QuANTUM-R study investigated the efficacy of quizartinib monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD mutation-positive AML. The clinical course of four QuANTUM-R participants exemplifies issues specific to quizartinib treatment and is described here. Patient 1 was FLT3-ITD mutation-negative at AML diagnosis, but became FLT3-ITD mutation-positive during treatment that included several lines of chemotherapy and was therefore a suitable candidate for quizartinib. Because of the clonal shifts of AML during treatment, retesting genetic alterations at each relapse or resistance may help to identify candidates for targeted treatment options. Patient 2 developed QTc prolongation during quizartinib treatment, but the QTc interval normalised after dose reduction, allowing the patient to continue treatment and eventually resume the recommended dose. Patient 3 responded to quizartinib and was scheduled for haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), but developed febrile neutropenia and invasive aspergillosis during conditioning and subsequently died (to avoid drug-drug interactions, no azole antifungal was administered concomitantly). Care is required when selecting concomitant medications, and if there is potential for interactions (e.g. if prophylactic azole antifungals are required) the quizartinib dose should be reduced to minimise the risk of QTc prolongation. Patient 4 was able to undergo HSCT after responding to quizartinib and experienced a durable response after HSCT while on quizartinib maintenance therapy. Together, these cases illustrate the main issues to be addressed when managing patients under quizartinib, allowing for adequate scheduling and tolerability, bridging to HSCT, and durable remission on maintenance therapy in some patients.","['Martinez-Cuadron, David', 'Rodriguez-Macias, Gabriela', 'Rodriguez-Veiga, Rebeca', 'Boluda, Blanca', 'Montesinos, Pau']","['Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Rodriguez-Macias G', 'Rodriguez-Veiga R', 'Boluda B', 'Montesinos P']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7540-4091'],"['Hematology Department (Torre G, Planta 7), Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Avinguda Fernando Abril Martorell, 106, CP 46026, Valencia, Spain. martinez_davcua@gva.es.', 'CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain. martinez_davcua@gva.es.', 'Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department (Torre G, Planta 7), Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Avinguda Fernando Abril Martorell, 106, CP 46026, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology Department (Torre G, Planta 7), Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Avinguda Fernando Abril Martorell, 106, CP 46026, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology Department (Torre G, Planta 7), Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Avinguda Fernando Abril Martorell, 106, CP 46026, Valencia, Spain.', 'CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Clin Drug Investig,Clinical drug investigation,9504817,IM,,"['Adult', 'Benzothiazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*administration & dosage', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,,2020/01/09 06:00,2020/07/28 06:00,['2020/01/09 06:00'],"['2020/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40261-019-00881-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s40261-019-00881-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Drug Investig. 2020 Mar;40(3):227-235. doi: 10.1007/s40261-019-00881-7.,PMC7035240,,"['Funding Daiichi Sankyo provided financial support for medical writing', 'services./Daiichi Sankyo']","['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have reported that coumestrol, daidzein and genistein could induce cell death by reducing Annexin A1 protein in leukemic cell lines. Annexin A1 (ANXA1) is involved in cell progression, metastasis, and apoptosis in several types of cancer cells. The present study sought to investigate if the effects of phytoestrogens on apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and phagocytosis in ANXA1-knockdown leukemic cells are mediated through ANXA1 or occurred independently. METHODS: Transfection of ANXA1 siRNA was conducted to downregulate ANXA1 expression in Jurkat, K562 and U937 cells. Apoptosis and cell cycle assays were conducted using flow cytometry. Western blot was performed to evaluate ANXA1, caspases and Bcl-2 proteins expression. Phagocytosis was determined using hematoxylin and eosin staining. RESULTS: The expression of ANXA1 after the knockdown was significantly downregulated in all cell lines. Genistein significantly induced apoptosis associated with an upregulation of procaspase-3, -9, and - 1 in Jurkat cells. The Bcl-2 expression showed no significant difference in Jurkat, K562 and U937 cells. Treatment with phytoestrogens increased procaspase-1 expression in Jurkat and U937 cells while no changes were detected in K562 cells. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that after ANXA1 knockdown, coumestrol and genistein caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in selected type of cells. The percentage of phagocytosis and phagocytosis index increased after the treatment with phytoestrogens in all cell lines.

The HSCs are a small population of undifferentiated cells that reside in the bone marrow (BM) and can undergo self-renewal by giving rise to mature cells. METHODS: Relevant literature was identified through a PubMed search (2000-2019) of English-language papers using the following terms: reactive oxygen species, hematopoietic stem cell, leukemic stem cell, leukemia and chemotherapy. RESULTS: HSCs are very sensitive to high levels of ROS and increased production of ROS have been attributed to HSC aging. HSC aging induced by both cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors is linked to impaired HSC self-renewal and regeneration. In addition, the elevated ROS levels might even trigger differentiation of Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) and ROS may be involved in the initiation and progression of hematological malignancies, such as leukemia. CONCLUSION: Targeting genes involved in ROS in LSCs and HSCs are increasingly being used as a critical target for therapeutic interventions. Appropriate concentration of ROS may be an optimal therapeutic target for treatment of leukemia during chemotherapy, but still more studies are required to better understanding of the of ROS role in blood disorders.","['Samimi, Azin', 'Khodayar, Mohammad Javad', 'Alidadi, Hadis', 'Khodadi, Elahe']","['Samimi A', 'Khodayar MJ', 'Alidadi H', 'Khodadi E']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4044-3351', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9518-1286', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2623-0758', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3738-8454']","['Department of Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Legal Medicine Organization, Legal Medicine Research Center, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Department of Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Toxicology Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Department of Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Toxicology Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Thalassemia & Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Health Research Institute, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran. khodadi.e@ajums.ac.ir.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Stem Cell Rev Rep,Stem cell reviews and reports,101752767,IM,,"['Cell Self Renewal', '*Cytoprotection', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chemotherapy', '*Hematopoietic stem cell', '*Leukemic stem cell', '*Reactive oxygen species']",2020/01/09 06:00,2021/06/04 06:00,['2020/01/09 06:00'],"['2020/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12015-019-09949-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12015-019-09949-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Stem Cell Rev Rep. 2020 Apr;16(2):262-275. doi: 10.1007/s12015-019-09949-5.,,,,['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common entities are gliomas, craniopharyngiomas and embryonal tumors, including primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the CNS, such as medulloblastoma. Proper management of malignancies requires a histological diagnosis, especially in childhood, since diagnostic errors have a significant negative influence on the treatment and subsequently on the patient's care. Experimental research conducted in the last years regarding the genomic and epigenetic landscape of pediatric brain tumors has provided considerable help in understanding their pathogenesis. New mutations and new signaling pathways have been associated with pediatric neoplasia, according to recent studies. Current therapeutic protocols recommend triple therapy, consisting in the surgical resection of the tumor, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, the success of the therapy depends on the precociousness of establishing the diagnosis and initiating the treatment, age of the child, type of surgery (totalpartial), result of the histological examination, chemotherapy protocols and type of radiotherapy. Although immunotherapy and gene therapy continue to be a challenge, extensive studies are needed in order to confirm their promising role in the management of pediatric brain tumors.","['Cojocaru, Elena', 'Mihaila, Doina', 'Leon-Constantin, Maria Magdalena', 'Cobzaru, Roxana Gabriela', 'Ripa, Carmen Valerica', 'Trandafirescu, Mioara Florentina', 'Trandafir, Laura Mihaela']","['Cojocaru E', 'Mihaila D', 'Leon-Constantin MM', 'Cobzaru RG', 'Ripa CV', 'Trandafirescu MF', 'Trandafir LM']",,"['1st Medical Department, Department of Morphofunctional Sciences I - Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, ""Grigore T.

Case notes and chest imaging were reviewed, HTLV-1 serology and the number of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) infected with HTLV-1 (pro-viral load (PVL)) were determined, and radiological abnormality scores were calculated. Participants were followed for a mean+/-sd of 1.14+/-0.86 years and causes of death were determined. Median (interquartile range) HTLV-1 PVL for cases was 8-fold higher than controls (cases 213.8 (19.7-3776.3) copies per 10(5) PBLs versus controls 26.6 (0.9-361) copies per 10(5) PBLs; p=0.002). Radiological abnormality scores were higher for cases with HTLV-1 PVL >/=1000 copies per 10(5) PBLs and no cause of bronchiectasis other than HTLV-1 infection. Major predictors of bronchiectasis were prior severe lower respiratory tract infection (adjusted OR (aOR) 17.83, 95% CI 4.51-70.49; p<0.001) and an HTLV-1 PVL >/=1000 copies per 10(5) PBLs (aOR 12.41, 95% CI 3.84-40.15; p<0.001).

High mortality rate in AML is due to high incidence of relapse after complete remission with chemotherapy and inadequate prognostic assessment of patients. Moreover, there is dearth of therapeutic targets for treatment of this malignancy. Previous pilot study (n = 24) by our group revealed strong association between cathepsin B (CTSB) overexpression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and poor survival outcome in pediatric AML patients. To further explore the clinical utility and role of this protease in pediatric AML, we measured its enzymatic activity and mRNA expression in PBMCs as well as bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) of patients (n = 101) and PBMCs of healthy controls. Our results revealed elevated CTSB activity (P < 0.01) and overexpression of its mRNA (P < 0.01) in AML patients. Interestingly CTSB in BMMCs of patients emerged as an independent prognostic marker when compared with other known risk factors. Moreover, chemical inhibition of CTSB activity compromised survival, and induced apoptosis in an AML cell line THP-1. We further demonstrate the inhibition of CTSB activity by chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin in these cells. Docking and simulation studies suggested the binding of doxorubicin to CTSB with higher affinity than its known specific inhibitor CA-074 Me, thereby indicating that cell death induced by this drug may at least partly be mediated by CTSB inhibition. CTSB, therefore, may serve as a prognostic marker and an attractive chemotherapeutic target in pediatric AML.","['Pandey, Garima', 'Bakhshi, Sameer', 'Kumar, Manoj', 'Thakur, Bhaskar', 'Jain, Prerna', 'Kaur, Punit', 'Chauhan, Shyam S']","['Pandey G', 'Bakhshi S', 'Kumar M', 'Thakur B', 'Jain P', 'Kaur P', 'Chauhan SS']",,"['Department of Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Biophysics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Biostatistics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Biophysics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191201,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cathepsin B', 'leukemia', 'mononuclear cells', 'pediatric AML']",2020/01/09 06:00,2020/01/09 06:01,['2020/01/09 06:00'],"['2019/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/09 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2019 Dec 1;9(12):2634-2649. eCollection 2019.,PMC6943344,['None.'],,,['AJCR Copyright (c) 2019.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we identify a role for Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex 4 (CRL4), known for modulating DNA replication, as a crucial mitotic regulator that triggers the termination of the SAC and enables chromosome segregation. CRL4 is recruited to chromatin by the replication origin binding protein RepID/DCAF14/PHIP. During mitosis, CRL4 dissociates from RepID and replaces it with RB Binding Protein 7 (RBBP7), which ubiquitinates the SAC mediator BUB3 to enable mitotic exit.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Periphery blood samples from 79 patients with AML (at diagnosis or/and after chemotherapy or at relapse) and 24 healthy controls were prospectively collected. We performed phenotypic and functional analysis of various lymphocytes through multiparametric flow cytometry and investigated prognostic immune-related risk factors. RESULTS: Immune defects in AML were reflected in T and natural killer (NK) cells, whereas B-cell function remained unaffected. Both CD8(+) T and CD4(+) T cells exhibited features of senescence and exhaustion at diagnosis. NK dysfunction was supported by excessive maturation and downregulation of NKG2D and NKP30. Diseased gammadelta T cells demonstrated a highly activated or even exhausted state through PD-1 upregulation and NKG2D downregulation. Effective therapeutic response following chemotherapy correlated with T and NK function restoration. Refractory and relapsed patients demonstrated even worse immune impairments, and selective immune signatures apparently correlated clinical outcomes and survival. PD-1 expression in CD8(+) T cells was independently predictive of poor overall survival and event-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: T-cell senescence and exhaustion, together with impaired NK and gammadelta T-cell function, are dominant aspects involved in immune dysfunction in AML. Noninvasive immune testing of blood samples could be applied to predict therapeutic reactivity, high risk for relapse, and unfavorable prognosis.","['Tang, Lu', 'Wu, Jianghua', 'Li, Cheng-Gong', 'Jiang, Hui-Wen', 'Xu, Min', 'Du, Mengyi', 'Yin, Zhinan', 'Mei, Heng', 'Hu, Yu']","['Tang L', 'Wu J', 'Li CG', 'Jiang HW', 'Xu M', 'Du M', 'Yin Z', 'Mei H', 'Hu Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7941-2443'],"['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Hubei Clinical Medical Center of Cell Therapy for Neoplastic Disease, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Hubei Clinical Medical Center of Cell Therapy for Neoplastic Disease, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Hubei Clinical Medical Center of Cell Therapy for Neoplastic Disease, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Hubei Clinical Medical Center of Cell Therapy for Neoplastic Disease, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Hubei Clinical Medical Center of Cell Therapy for Neoplastic Disease, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', ""Zhuhai Precision Medical Center, Zhuhai People's Hospital Affiliated with Jinan University, Jinan University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China."", 'The Biomedical Translational Research Institute, Faculty of Medical Science, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China. hmei@hust.edu.cn dr_huyu@126.com.', 'Hubei Clinical Medical Center of Cell Therapy for Neoplastic Disease, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China. hmei@hust.edu.cn dr_huyu@126.com.', 'Hubei Clinical Medical Center of Cell Therapy for Neoplastic Disease, Wuhan, Hubei, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200107,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Female', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', '*Tumor Escape', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/09 06:00,2021/01/23 06:00,['2020/01/09 06:00'],"['2019/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-19-3003 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-3003 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2020 Apr 1;26(7):1763-1772. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-3003.

We analyzed AKI in adult myeloablative CBT recipients who underwent transplantation from 2006 to 2017 for hematologic malignancies using cyclosporine A (CSA)/mycophenolate mofetil immunosuppression. Maximum grades of AKI were calculated using Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (grade 1, 1.5 to <2-fold; grade 2, 2 to <3-fold; or grade 3, >/=3-fold over baseline) definitions. In total, 153 patients (median 51 years [range, 23-65], 114/153 [75%] acute leukemia, 27/153 [18%] African, 88/153 [58%] cytomegalovirus seropositive, median age-adjusted hematopoietic cell comorbidity index 3 [range, 0-9], median pretransplant albumin 4.0 g/dL [range, 2.6-5.2]) underwent transplantation. The day 100 cumulative incidence of grade 1-3 AKI was 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77%-89%) (predominantly grade 2, median onset 40 days, range 0 to 96), and grade 2-3 AKI incidence was 54% (95% CI, 46%-62%) (median onset 43 days, range 0 to 96). Mean CSA level preceding AKI onset was high (360 ng/mL, target range 300-350). In multivariate analysis, African ancestry, addition of haploidentical CD34(+) cells, low day -7 albumin, critical illness/intensive care admission, and nephrotoxic drug exposure (predominantly CSA and/or foscarnet) were associated with AKI. In a day 100 landmark analysis, 6% of patients with no prior AKI had chronic kidney disease (CKD) at 2 years versus 43% with prior grade 1 and 38% with prior grade 2-3 AKI (overall P= .02). Adult CBT recipients are at significant AKI risk, and AKI is associated with increased risk of CKD.

The complex biological processes underlying immune stimulation and leukemogenesis may benefit from novel statistical approaches that account for mixed exposures and their nonlinear interactions. In this study, we utilized targeted machine learning and traditional statistical methods to investigate the association of multiple measures of early immune stimulation with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Costa Rican children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used data from a population-based case-control study conducted in Costa Rica (2001-2003). Cases of ALL (n = 240) were diagnosed in 1995-2000 (age >1 year and <15 years at diagnosis) and were identified through the National Cancer Registry and National Children's Hospital. Population controls (n = 578) were frequency-matched to cases by birth year and drawn from the National Birth Registry. Data on surrogate measures of early immune stimulation were collected through in-home interviews. We fitted multivariable models, utilizing targeted causal inference (varimpact), unconditional logistic regression, and latent class analysis (LCA). RESULTS: In varimpact analysis, contact with any pet [risk difference (RD) = -0.17, 95% CI: -0.25, -0.10)] or any farm animal (RD = -0.07, 95% CI: -0.13, 0.00) and allergies (RD = -0.08, 95% CI: -0.17, 0.01) were associated with a reduced risk of ALL, whereas experiencing a fever longer than one week was associated with an increased risk (RD = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.33). In unconditional logistic regression models, contact with any pet or farm animal and a complete vaccination scheme were inversely associated with odds of ALL (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.31, 0.62; OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.90; OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.83; respectively), whereas experiencing a fever longer than one week was positively associated with ALL (OR = 2.44, 95% CI: 1.61, 3.70). Two-class and three-class LCA revealed a group with elevated risk for ALL whose exposure profile was mainly characterized by reduced exposure to pets and farm animals. CONCLUSIONS: Using distinct statistical approaches, we observed that exposure to pets and farm animals was inversely associated with ALL risk, whereas having a fever longer than one week (a putative proxy of severe infection) was associated with an increased risk. For multifactorial diseases such as childhood leukemia, we recommend estimating the joint effects of multiple exposures by applying diverse statistical methods and interpreting their results together. Overall, we found support for the hypothesis that early immune stimulation offers protection against childhood ALL.","['Figueroa, Sophia Colombari', 'Kennedy, Chris J', 'Wesseling, Catharina', 'Wiemels, Joseph M', 'Morimoto, Libby', 'Mora, Ana M']","['Figueroa SC', 'Kennedy CJ', 'Wesseling C', 'Wiemels JM', 'Morimoto L', 'Mora AM']",,"['Central American Institute for Studies on Toxic Substances (IRET), Universidad Nacional, P.O.

Nanoparticles were made from iron oxide, coated with poly(ethylene glycol), and conjugated through avidin-biotin chemistry with antibody specifically against epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). On exposure of targeted nanoparticles to tumor cells, specific uptake by EpCAM-expressing tumor cells (e.g., BxPC3, a pancreatic cancer cell) was observed, whereas there was negligible uptake by cells with low EpCAM expression (e.g., CCRF-CEM, a leukemia cell). Using an arrangement of magnets called a Halbach array, capture efficiency and specificity towards BxPC3 cells tagged with magnetic nanoparticles were enhanced, compared to conditions without the magnetic field gradient and/or without magnetic nanoparticles, either in buffer or in whole blood. These results illustrate that engineered magnetic nanoparticles and their integration with microfluidics have great potential for tumor cell enumeration and cancer prognosis.","['Unni, Mythreyi', 'Zhang, Jinling', 'George, Thomas J', 'Segal, Mark S', 'Fan, Z Hugh', 'Rinaldi, Carlos']","['Unni M', 'Zhang J', 'George TJ', 'Segal MS', 'Fan ZH', 'Rinaldi C']",,"['Department of Chemical Engineering, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.', 'Interdisciplinary Microsystems Group, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA; University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.', 'Interdisciplinary Microsystems Group, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA; J.

Studies on QOL of AL patients and their FCs are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the QOL of AL patients and their FCs, and to explore the factors associated with QOL of patients and of FCs. METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted. The QOL of 196 patient-FC dyads was assessed. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu) was used for patients, and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) was used for FCs. Independent-samples t-tests or one-way analysis of variance were used to compare QOL subscale scores between groups with different sociodemographic/clinical characteristics. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors associated with QOL of AL patients and their FCs. RESULTS: The total FACT-Leu score for AL patients was 76.80 +/- 16.44, and the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores for FCs were 64.67 +/- 15.44 and 52.50 +/- 13.49, respectively. All QOL subscales for patients (t = 12.96-34.73, p < 0.001) and FCs (t = 2.55-14.36, p < 0.05), except role emotional (t = - 0.01, p = 0.993), were lower than those reported in previous studies. Sex, employment, and chemotherapy were significantly associated with total FACT-Leu score in AL patients (p < 0.05). Age, sex, marital status, education, employment, and relationship to patients were significantly associated with SF-36 PCS or MCS (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: AL patients and their FCs both have lower QOL than the population in previous studies. These findings suggest that not only AL patients' physical and mental health but also overall family QOL should be assessed. Interventions supporting patient-FC dyads should be developed to improve their QOL.","['Wang, Chunfeng', 'Yan, Jie', 'Chen, Jingyi', 'Wang, Ying', 'Lin, Ying Chun', 'Hu, Rong', 'Wu, Yong']","['Wang C', 'Yan J', 'Chen J', 'Wang Y', 'Lin YC', 'Hu R', 'Wu Y']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9949-7528'],"['School of Nursing, Fujian Medical University, No. 1 Xueyuan Road, Shangjie Town, Minhou County, Fuzhou City, 350108, Fujian Province, China.', 'School of Nursing, Fujian Medical University, No. 1 Xueyuan Road, Shangjie Town, Minhou County, Fuzhou City, 350108, Fujian Province, China.', 'School of Nursing, Fujian Medical University, No. 1 Xueyuan Road, Shangjie Town, Minhou County, Fuzhou City, 350108, Fujian Province, China.', 'School of Nursing, Fujian Medical University, No. 1 Xueyuan Road, Shangjie Town, Minhou County, Fuzhou City, 350108, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, No. 20 of Chazhong Road, Taijiang District, Fuzhou City, 350004, Fujian Province, China.', 'School of Nursing, Fujian Medical University, No. 1 Xueyuan Road, Shangjie Town, Minhou County, Fuzhou City, 350108, Fujian Province, China. ronghu1246@fjmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, No. 29 Xinquan Road, Gulou District, Fuzhou City, 350001, Fujian Province, China. wuyong9195@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200107,England,Health Qual Life Outcomes,Health and quality of life outcomes,101153626,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Caregivers/*psychology', 'China', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Quality of Life', 'Regression Analysis', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'China', 'Family caregiver', 'Quality of life']",2020/01/09 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,['2020/01/09 06:00'],"['2019/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12955-020-1269-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12955-020-1269-8 [pii]']",epublish,Health Qual Life Outcomes. 2020 Jan 7;18(1):8. doi: 10.1186/s12955-020-1269-8.,PMC6947991,,"['2018-ZQN-63/the Scientific Research Talents Training Project of the Fujian', 'Province Health Commission', '2019J01684/the Natural Scientific Foundation Project of Fujian Province']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this meta-analysis was to more comprehensively analyze associations between polymorphisms in IL-10 and hematological oncology by combing the results of all relevant studies.Methods: Eligible articles were searched from Pubmed, Embase, WOS and CNKI. The latest literature searching update was performed on 8 October 2019. We used Review Manager to combine the results of eligible studies.Results: Forty-one articles were included in this meta-analysis. IL-10 rs1800890 polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with hematological oncology under AA vs. TT+TA (recessive comparison, OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.24), and rs1800896 polymorphism was also found to be significantly associated with hematological oncology under AA vs. AG+GG (dominant comparison, OR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.83-0.95) in overall combined analyses. In subgroup analyses, we observed positive results for rs1800871 (recessive comparison), rs1800872 (dominant, recessive and allele comparisons), and rs1800896 (dominant and allele comparisons) polymorphisms in the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subgroup. Besides, we also detected positive associations between rs1800872 polymorphism and acute leukemia (AL) (dominant and recessive comparisons) and found significant associations between rs1800896 polymorphism and chronic leukemia (CL) (recessive comparison).Conclusion: In summary, this meta-analysis demonstrated that IL-10 rs1800890, rs1800896, rs1800871 and rs1800872 polymorphisms may confer susceptibility to hematology oncology, especially for NHL.","['Hong, Pan', 'Feng, Wei-Ying', 'Fu, Lei-Hua', 'Jin, Jing', 'Fu, Jia-Ping']","['Hong P', 'Feng WY', 'Fu LH', 'Jin J', 'Fu JP']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Shaoxing People's Hospital, Shaoxing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shaoxing People's Hospital, Shaoxing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shaoxing People's Hospital, Shaoxing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shaoxing People's Hospital, Shaoxing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shaoxing People's Hospital, Shaoxing, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200107,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,IM,,"['Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Hematological oncology', '*Interleukin-10 (IL-10)', '*Meta-analysis', '*Polymorphisms']",2020/01/09 06:00,2021/07/06 06:00,['2020/01/09 06:00'],"['2020/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384047.2019.1702404 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2020 Apr 2;21(4):372-378. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2019.1702404.

Acetylcholine (ACh) plays an important role in cellular physiology. ACh also acts at the different parts of the central nervous system and nonneuronal cells. Cholinergic receptors also have different functions in many cell types and tissues. Caspases (cysteine aspartic proteases and cysteine aspartases) are cysteine dependent aspartate-specific proteases. They are an important role in necrosis and cell death and inflammation signaling pathways. They are also the primary mediators of apoptosis. During apoptosis, different caspase types participate in different functions. We have previously shown that carbachol (CCh) inhibits K562 cell proliferation. This study was performed to investigate the anti-tumor efficacy of cholinergic drugs in hemin-induced erythroid differentiated K562 cells. The aim of this study was to address the mechanism of cholinergic drugs on hemin-induced erythroid differentiated K562 cell proliferation and caspase activities. We detected M3 muscarinic receptor expression in erythroid differentiated K562 cell line.Methods: K562 cells were differentiated with hemin (50 muM). The expression of the M3 muscarinic receptor was detected by the western blotting technique. Erythroid differentiated K562 cells treated with CCh (100 muM). After 24 and 48 h, cells were counted by BrdU cell proliferation kit. Caspase 3,8, and 9 activities were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits according to the manufacturer's instructions.Results: Erythroid differentiated K562 cell proliferation was not significantly increased after CCh treatment. In the meantime, caspases 8 and 9 activities in erythroid differentiated K562 cell line was significantly higher than undifferentiated K562 cells (p < .05).","['Cabadak, Hulya', 'Aydin, Banu']","['Cabadak H', 'Aydin B']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5757-2198', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3267-8620']","['Department of Biophysics, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Biophysics, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200107,England,J Recept Signal Transduct Res,Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,9509432,IM,,"['Carbachol/pharmacology', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cholinergic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cholinergic Agonists/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Erythroid Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Receptors, Cholinergic/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Carbachol', 'apoptosis', 'caspases', 'differentiation', 'leukemia', 'muscarinic receptor']",2020/01/09 06:00,2020/11/05 06:00,['2020/01/09 06:00'],"['2020/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10799893.2019.1710849 [doi]'],ppublish,J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2020 Feb;40(1):42-48. doi: 10.1080/10799893.2019.1710849.

The possible reaction mechanism may be that cells can be severely damaged by CL substrates, and the released contents, possibly proteins (such as cytochrome c), can remarkably magnify CL owing to the increased production of singlet oxygen. More importantly, based on the above phenomena, a novel cell-assisted enhanced CL strategy was proposed for the rapid and label-free detection of tumor cells. The complexes of aptamer sgc8c and streptavidin-modified magnetic beads were employed to recognize and isolate target tumor cells from whole blood. The enhanced CL intensity, which was triggered directly by the captured cells, was measured. The proposed strategy exhibited a good detection performance with a linear range from 200 to 10,000 cells/mL. The analysis can be finished in approximately 30 min, and the limit of detection was down to 100 cells/mL.

In this case, a woman aged 39 years was found to have anemia and thrombocytopenia after presenting to her primary care physician with fatigue, weight loss, and persistent infections. During further workup of the cytopenia, she was diagnosed with AUL and received 7+3 (daunorubicin, 60 mg/m2/d intravenously on days 1-3, and cytarabine, 100 mg/m2 24-hour continuous intravenous infusion on days 1-7) due to the presence of the IDH1 mutation. Bone marrow biopsy performed on day 14 of 7+3 showed persistent disease, and ivosidenib was initiated due to severe HLA alloimmunization (panel-reactive antibody, 100%) and significant bleeding complications. The patient achieved a complete morphologic and molecular remission on ivosidenib monotherapy despite critical bleeding complications during induction. Targeted therapy using ivosidenib may represent an encouraging therapeutic option in patients with AUL and IDH1 mutations.

Among CVCs, the number of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) placed has risen significantly. In this multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study, we enrolled patients aged 6 months to 18 years with newly placed PICCs or tunneled lines (TLs). We evaluated the incidence of VTE, central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), and catheter malfunctions in PICCs and TLs, and risk factors of CVC-related VTE. A total of 1967 CVCs were included in the analysis. The incidence of CVC-related VTE was 5.9% +/- 0.63%. The majority of the cases, 80%, were in subjects with PICCs, which had a significantly higher risk of catheter-related VTE than subjects with TLs (hazard ratio [HR] = 8.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1-23; P < .001). PICCs were significantly more likely to have a CLABSI (HR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.2; P = .002) and CVC malfunction (HR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.6-2.4; P < .001). Increased risk of CVC-related VTE was found in patients with a prior history of VTE (HR = 23; 95% CI, 4-127; P < .001), multilumen CVC (HR = 3.9; 95% CI, 1.8-8.9; P = .003), and leukemia (HR = 3.5; 95% CI, 1.3-9.0; P = .031). Children with PICCs had a significantly higher incidence of catheter-related VTE, CLABSI, and CVC malfunction over TLs. The results suggest that pause be taken prior to placing CVCs, especially PICCs, due to the serious complications they have been shown to cause.","['Jaffray, Julie', 'Witmer, Char', ""O'Brien, Sarah H"", 'Diaz, Rosa', 'Ji, Lingyun', 'Krava, Emily', 'Young, Guy']","['Jaffray J', 'Witmer C', ""O'Brien SH"", 'Diaz R', 'Ji L', 'Krava E', 'Young G']",,"[""Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA."", ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH."", ""Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX; and."", 'Department of Preventative Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', ""Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA."", ""Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,['Blood. 2020 Jan 16;135(3):156-157.

A previous cross-sectional interview-based study elicited concepts for inclusion in a novel QOL instrument. Here, we further develop and validate this new instrument, the AML-QOL. Iterative revisions of the draft AML-QOL were refined based on feedback from 16 patients, 8 medical providers, and 3 psychometricians. The instrument underwent factor analysis based on responses from 202 patients with AML and analogous aggressive myeloid neoplasms receiving AML-like therapy. A prospective validation study was then undertaken in 50 patients who completed the AML-QOL at multiple time points while undergoing a cycle of intensive chemotherapy to establish test-retest reliability and sensitivity to change. The final AML-QOL contains 27 items and is categorized into 5 domains (Physical, Social, Cognitive, Anxiety, Depression), one Symptom Index, a single item assessing overall quality of life, and a Summary Score. The AML-QOL domains show high internal consistency (median alpha: 0.85), good test-retest reliability (median interclass correlation: 0.82), and had convergent and divergent validity when compared to a non-disease-specific instrument (the EORTC QLQ-C30). The Summary Score demonstrated good sensitivity to change when anchored to patient perception of QOL change.

This service evaluation aimed to determine what specialist paediatric neuro-oncology rehabilitation services were available across the UK at the time of the surveys and whether the needs of patients and their families were being met. Design: Cross-sectional on-line surveys. Participants: Survey 1: neuro-oncologist and nurse specialist members of the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) at Children's Principle Treatment Centres (PTCs) in the UK; Survey 2: parents of paediatric neuro-oncology patients belonging to The Brain Tumour Charity (TBTC) Research Involvement Network (RIN). Results: 17 of the 20 (85%) PTCs in the UK and two teenagers and young adult cancer units responded to Survey 1, and 17 members of TBTC's RIN responded to Survey 2. Access to inpatient and outpatient neuro-oncology rehabilitation services after treatment for a central nervous system (CNS) tumour varied across regions in the UK. Service users in the RIN identified a need for an established neuro-oncology rehabilitation service for young people, a need for better communication across services and with families, and a need to fill gaps in multidisciplinary teams. Conclusion: The urgent need for specialist paediatric, teenage and young adult neuro-oncology rehabilitation services in the UK is often unmet, particularly for outpatients. Where services are not provided for those children and young people disadvantaged by the diagnosis of a CNS tumour, in clear breach of current guidelines, remedial action needs to be taken to ensure appropriate and equal access.","['Treadgold, Bethan', 'Kennedy, Colin', 'Spoudeas, Helen', 'Sugden, Elaine', 'Walker, David', 'Bull, Kim']","['Treadgold B', 'Kennedy C', 'Spoudeas H', 'Sugden E', 'Walker D', 'Bull K']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0255-7422', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5541-4556']","['Department of Primary Care and Population Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, Hampshire, UK.', 'Centre for Paediatric Endocrinology, University College London, London, London, UK.', 'Oxford, UK.', ""Children's Brain Tumour Research Centre, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, UK."", 'Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, Hampshire, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191215,England,BMJ Paediatr Open,BMJ paediatrics open,101715309,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CNS tumours', 'children', 'rehabilitation services', 'young adults', 'young people']",2020/01/08 06:00,2020/01/08 06:01,['2020/01/08 06:00'],"['2019/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1136/bmjpo-2019-000567 [doi]', 'bmjpo-2019-000567 [pii]']",epublish,BMJ Paediatr Open. 2019 Dec 15;3(1):e000567. doi: 10.1136/bmjpo-2019-000567. eCollection 2019.,PMC6937011,['Competing interests: None.'],,,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Here, we report the overexpression of sortilin in leukemic cells from patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Methods: Flow cytometry was used to compare the expression of sortilin in CLL patients (n=52) and healthy individuals (n=26). Also, in vitro apoptosis induction was assessed in CLL Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMCs) following directly targeting of sortilin. Results: The results showed a significant expression of sortilin on the surface of CLL PBMCs (range from 2.2 to 71.5%) in comparison to healthy individuals (range from 0.03 to 7.4%) (p</=0.0001). The optimal cut-off value of sortilin expression was determined at 7.2% with high sensitivity and specificity. Treatment of leukemic cells with anti-sortilin antibody could induce apoptosis without any effect on normal cells. Conclusion: Apoptosis induction in CLL cells together with a significant correlation between the expression of sortilin and CD23 represent a possible functional role of sortilin in leukemogenesis of CLL cells. Therefore, sortilin might be considered as a promising novel biomarker in diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy of patients with CLL.","['Farahi, Lia', 'Ghaemimanesh, Fatemeh', 'Milani, Saeideh', 'Razavi, Seyed Mohsen', 'Akhondi, Mohammad Mehdi', 'Rabbani, Hodjattallah']","['Farahi L', 'Ghaemimanesh F', 'Milani S', 'Razavi SM', 'Akhondi MM', 'Rabbani H']",,"['Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'Clinic of Hematology and Oncology, Firoozgar Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Avicenna J Med Biotechnol,Avicenna journal of medical biotechnology,101511065,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Biomarker', 'Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Monoclonal antibody', 'Sortilin']",2020/01/08 06:00,2020/01/08 06:01,['2020/01/08 06:00'],"['2020/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/08 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Avicenna J Med Biotechnol. 2019 Oct-Dec;11(4):270-276.,PMC6925395,['Conflict of Interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Avicenna Research Institute.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advances in cytogenetic and molecular studies partially disclosed the mystery about risk factors and pathophysiology of MLs. Regarding incidence, risk factors, response to treatment, and overall survival of patients, research showed differences among different countries. However, the Western registry data are the basis for the documented description of MLs in medical textbooks. This research aimed to study MLs in Middle Eastern health centers. Egypt has the highest population in the Middle East; furthermore, 96.6% of the population is native Egyptians; accordingly the study focused on Egypt. Patients and methods: Data of 468 patients with MLs were collected from hospital records at two big tertiary health centers. They were grouped into group 1 (chronic myeloid leukemia, CML) and group 2 (acute myeloid leukemia, AML); the latter was subgrouped into 2a (primary AML) and 2b (secondary AML). Results and conclusions: The median age of patients was 43 years; males predominate in group 2a and females in groups 1 and 2b. 37.2% of group 1 patients were treated with Gleevec. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was planned for only 5% of group 2 and 18% relapsed. Of groups 1 and 2 patients, 25% and 12%, respectively, stopped follow up, and 15% and 35% died. ORR and overall survival were 53%, 27% and 7%, 0.4% for groups 1 and 2, respectively. Conclusively, this study showed a young age of ML patients, with female predominance in CML, and poor outcome. This reflected racial, ethnic and risk factor differences in incidence of MLs.","['Khaled, Safaa Aa', 'Nabih, Ola', 'Abdel Aziz, Nashwa M', 'Mahran, Dalia G']","['Khaled SA', 'Nabih O', 'Abdel Aziz NM', 'Mahran DG']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2239-7219', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8351-2321', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1701-9248']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Clinical Hematology Unit, Assiut University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Unit of Bone Marrow Transplantation, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, Assiut University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Department of Public Health and Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191216,New Zealand,J Blood Med,Journal of blood medicine,101550884,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Middle East', 'centers', 'glance', 'myeloid leukemias']",2020/01/08 06:00,2020/01/08 06:01,['2020/01/08 06:00'],"['2019/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/JBM.S221317 [doi]', '221317 [pii]']",epublish,J Blood Med. 2019 Dec 16;10:425-433. doi: 10.2147/JBM.S221317. eCollection 2019.,PMC6926095,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,['(c) 2019 Khaled et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested a hypothesis that different cell types respond to HNP differently in lung microenvironment that may influence the host responses. Methods: Plasma concentrations of HNP were measured in healthy volunteers and patients with sepsis. Cells including the bacteria P. aeruginosa, human lung epithelial cells and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were exposed to various concentrations of HNP. Bacterial killing, epithelial cell inflammation, MSC adhesion and behaviours were examined after HNP stimulation. Results: Incubation of P. aeruginosa or stimulation of human lung epithelial cells with HNP resulted in bacterial killing or IL-8 production at a dose of 50 mug/mL, while MSC adhesion and alternations of secretome profiles took place after HNP stimulation at a dose of 10 mug/mL. The secretome profile changes were characterized by increased release of the IL-6 family members such as C-reactive protein (CRP), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin (IL-11), and first apoptosis signal (FAS) and platelet-derived growth factor-AA as compared to a vehicle control group. Conclusion: Stimulation of MSCs with HNP resulted in changes of secretome profiles at 5-fold lower concentration than that required for bacterial killing and lung epithelial inflammation. This undisclosed risk factor of HNP in lung environment should be taken into consideration when MSCs are applied as cell therapy in inflammatory lung diseases.","['Dai, Qingqing', 'Morita, Yasumasa', 'Huang, Yongbo', 'Liaw, Patricia C', 'Wu, Jianfeng', 'Khang, Julie', 'Islam, Diana', 'Yu, Kaijiang', 'Li, Yimin', 'Zhang, Haibo']","['Dai Q', 'Morita Y', 'Huang Y', 'Liaw PC', 'Wu J', 'Khang J', 'Islam D', 'Yu K', 'Li Y', 'Zhang H']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7783-1393', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9098-2500', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6293-8446']","[""Department of Critical Care Medicine, The 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Chiba Aoba Municipal Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', ""The State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, and The 1st Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.', ""Department of Critical Care Medicine, The 1st Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", 'Keenan Research Center for Biomedical Science of Unity Health Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Keenan Research Center for Biomedical Science of Unity Health Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', ""Department of Critical Care Medicine, The 1st Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""The State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, and The 1st Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""The State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, and The 1st Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", 'Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Departments of Anesthesia, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Physiology, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191218,New Zealand,J Inflamm Res,Journal of inflammation research,101512684,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cytokines', 'defensins', 'lung injury', 'sepsis']",2020/01/08 06:00,2020/01/08 06:01,['2020/01/08 06:00'],"['2019/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/JIR.S219276 [doi]', '219276 [pii]']",epublish,J Inflamm Res. 2019 Dec 18;12:335-343. doi: 10.2147/JIR.S219276. eCollection 2019.,PMC6927223,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,['(c) 2019 Dai et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: In this multicenter nationwide study a total of 971 HCT procedures (741 allo-HCT; 230 auto-HCT) over a period of 6 years were analyzed. Results: During this period 801 episodes of viral infections were diagnosed in 442 patients. The incidence of viral infections was 57.9% in allo-HCT and 4.8% in auto-HCT patients. The most frequent infections after allo-HCT were caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), polyoma BK virus (BKV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The majority of infections occurred within the first 4 months after allo-HCT and over 80% required pharmacotherapy or symptomatic therapy. The median time of treatment of specific viral infection ranged from 7 (for EBV) to 24 (for CMV) days. The highest mortality was observed in case of CMV infection. The risk factors for viral infections were allo-HCT, acute leukemia, acute and chronic graft versus host disease (a/cGVHD), and matched unrelated donor (MUD)/mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD)-HCT. The risk factor for death from viral infection were CMV-IgG seropositivity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia recipient, and MUD/MMUD-HCT. The incidence of EBV infection requiring pre-emptive treatment with rituximab in allo-HCT children was 19.3%. In 30.8% cases of EBV infection, these episodes were preceded by other viral infection and treated with antivirals, which did not prevent development of EBV-DNA-emia with need of rituximab treatment in 81.5% cases. In 47.7% of these cases, GVHD was a factor enabling development of significant EBV-DNA-emia during antiviral therapy of other infection. Conclusion: We have shown that antiviral drugs do not prevent EBV reactivation in allo-HCT pediatric patients.","['Czyzewski, Krzysztof', 'Dziedzic, Magdalena', 'Salamonowicz, Malgorzata', 'Fraczkiewicz, Jowita', 'Zajac-Spychala, Olga', 'Zaucha-Prazmo, Agnieszka', 'Gozdzik, Jolanta', 'Galazka, Przemyslaw', 'Bartoszewicz, Natalia', 'Demidowicz, Ewa', 'Styczynski, Jan']","['Czyzewski K', 'Dziedzic M', 'Salamonowicz M', 'Fraczkiewicz J', 'Zajac-Spychala O', 'Zaucha-Prazmo A', 'Gozdzik J', 'Galazka P', 'Bartoszewicz N', 'Demidowicz E', 'Styczynski J']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7704-7518', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8467-8788', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8836-8605', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8227-8350', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3158-119X']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Transplantation, Oncology and Hematology, Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Transplantation, Oncology and Hematology, Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', ""Stem Cell Transplant Center, University Children's Hospital, Department of Clinical Immunology and Transplantology, Jagiellonian University Collegium Medicum, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of General and Oncological Surgery for Children and Adolescents, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Bydgoszcz, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191217,New Zealand,Infect Drug Resist,Infection and drug resistance,101550216,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['EBV', 'HCT', 'children', 'infectious complications', 'risk factors analysis', 'viral infections']",2020/01/08 06:00,2020/01/08 06:01,['2020/01/08 06:00'],"['2019/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/IDR.S224291 [doi]', '224291 [pii]']",epublish,Infect Drug Resist. 2019 Dec 17;12:3893-3902. doi: 10.2147/IDR.S224291. eCollection 2019.,PMC6925545,['All authors declare no potential conflict of interest relevant to this article.'],,,['(c) 2019 Czyzewski et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the heterogeneity of leukemia, vaccines with a single peptide have elicited only a limited immune response. Targeting several peptides together elicited peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in leukemia patients, and this was associated with clinical responses. Thus, the discovery of novel antigens is essential. In the current study, we investigated cyclin E as a novel target for immunotherapy. Cyclin E1 and cyclin E2 were found to be highly expressed in hematologic malignancies, according to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. We identified two HLA-A*0201 binding nonameric peptides, CCNE1M from cyclin E1 and CCNE2L from cyclin E2, which both elicited the peptide-specific CTLs. The peptide-specific CTLs specifically kill leukemia cells. Furthermore, CCNE1M and CCNE2L CTLs were increased in leukemia patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and this was associated with desired clinical outcomes. Our findings suggest that cyclin E1 and cyclin E2 are potential targets for immunotherapy in leukemia.","['He, Hong', 'Kondo, Yukio', 'Ishiyama, Ken', 'Alatrash, Gheath', 'Lu, Sijie', 'Cox, Kathryn', 'Qiao, Na', 'Clise-Dwyer, Karen', 'St John, Lisa', 'Sukhumalchandra, Pariya', 'Ma, Qing', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey J']","['He H', 'Kondo Y', 'Ishiyama K', 'Alatrash G', 'Lu S', 'Cox K', 'Qiao N', 'Clise-Dwyer K', 'St John L', 'Sukhumalchandra P', 'Ma Q', 'Molldrem JJ']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6189-0620', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1196-1715']","['Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Toyama Prefectural Central Hospital, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. jmolldre@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200106,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Cyclin E/*immunology', 'Cyclins/*immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Female', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/08 06:00,2020/10/08 06:00,['2020/01/08 06:00'],"['2019/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0698-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0698-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Jun;34(6):1626-1636. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0698-z.

Approximately one-third of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients have mutations of this gene, and activation of the FLT3 downstream pathway plays an important role in both normal and malignant hematopoiesis. However, the role of N-glycosylation for FLT3 activation remains unclear. In this study, we showed that the N-glycan structures on wild type (WT), internal tandem duplication (ITD), and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutants of FLT3 were different. Interestingly, expression of either WT or mutant FLT3 in Ba/F3 cells, an interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell, greatly induced core fucosylation. To elucidate the function of core fucosylation in FLT3-mediated signaling, we used a CRISPR/Cas9 system to establish alpha1,6-fucosyltransferase (Fut8) knockout (KO) cells. Surprisingly, the Fut8KO resulted in cell proliferation in an IL-3-independent manner in FLT3-WT cells, which was not observed in the parental cells, and suggested that this proliferation is dependent on FLT3 expression. Fut8KO greatly increased cellular tyrosine phosphorylation levels, together with an activation of STAT5, AKT, and ERK signaling, which could be completely neutralized by restoration with Fut8 in the KO cells. Consistently, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor efficiently inhibited cell proliferation induced by Fut8KO or specific fucosylation inhibitor. Additionally, immunostaining with FLT3 showed that the proteins were mainly expressed on the cell surface in the KO cells, which is similar to FLT3-WT cells, but different from the ITD mutant. Finally, we found that Fut8KO could induce dimer-formation in FLT3 without ligand-stimulation. Taken together, the present study clearly defines the regulatory function of core fucosylation in FLT3, which could provide a valuable direction for development of drugs could be effective in the treatment of AML.","['Duan, Chengwei', 'Fukuda, Tomohiko', 'Isaji, Tomoya', 'Qi, Feng', 'Yang, Jie', 'Wang, Yuqin', 'Takahashi, Shinichiro', 'Gu, Jianguo']","['Duan C', 'Fukuda T', 'Isaji T', 'Qi F', 'Yang J', 'Wang Y', 'Takahashi S', 'Gu J']",,"['Division of Regulatory Glycobiology, Institute of Molecular Biomembrane and Glycobiology, Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Division of Regulatory Glycobiology, Institute of Molecular Biomembrane and Glycobiology, Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Division of Regulatory Glycobiology, Institute of Molecular Biomembrane and Glycobiology, Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Division of Regulatory Glycobiology, Institute of Molecular Biomembrane and Glycobiology, Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Division of Regulatory Glycobiology, Institute of Molecular Biomembrane and Glycobiology, Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Pharmacy College, Nantong University, Nantong, China.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Division of Regulatory Glycobiology, Institute of Molecular Biomembrane and Glycobiology, Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200105,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,IM,,"['Animals', 'Fucose/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*FLT3', '*Fut8', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*cellular signaling', '*core fucosylation']",2020/01/08 06:00,2020/10/07 06:00,['2020/01/08 06:00'],"['2019/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fj.201902313RR [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 2020 Feb;34(2):3239-3252. doi: 10.1096/fj.201902313RR.

A disruption of this balance leads to the development of various diseases, including cancer. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of proteins of the Bcl-2 family is of great importance for biomedical research. Among the members of the Bcl-2 family, antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 is characterized by a short half-life, which renders this protein highly sensitive to changes in its synthesis or degradation. Hence, the regulation of Mcl-1 is of particular scientific interest, and the study of Mcl-1 modulators could aid in the understanding of the mechanisms of disease development and the ways of their treatment.

In CML, the acquisition of the fusion tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL1 in a haematopoietic stem cell drives its transformation to become a LSC. In AML, LSCs can arise from multiple cell types through the activity of a number of oncogenic drivers and pre-leukaemic events, adding further layers of context and genetic and cellular heterogeneity to AML LSCs not observed in most cases of CML. Furthermore, LSCs from both AML and CML can be refractory to standard-of-care therapies and persist in patients, diversify clonally and serve as reservoirs to drive relapse, recurrence or progression to more aggressive forms. Despite these complexities, LSCs in both diseases share biological features, making them distinct from other CML or AML progenitor cells and from normal haematopoietic stem cells. These features may represent Achilles' heels against which novel therapies can be developed. Here, we review many of the similarities and differences that exist between LSCs in CML and AML and examine the therapeutic strategies that could be used to eradicate them.","['Vetrie, David', 'Helgason, G Vignir', 'Copland, Mhairi']","['Vetrie D', 'Helgason GV', 'Copland M']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2075-4662', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1616-132X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7655-016X']","['Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK. david.vetrie@glasgow.ac.uk.', 'Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK. mhairi.copland@glasgow.ac.uk.""]",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200106,England,Nat Rev Cancer,Nature reviews.

While the ""BCL-2 addiction"" of different cell types is well described in mouse models, there is only limited information available on the role of different anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins in a given human cell type. Here we characterize the role of BCL-XL for survival and function of human hematopoietic cells, with the aim to predict hematological side effects of novel BCL-XL-inhibiting BH3-mimetics and to identify hematological malignancies potentially responsive to such inhibitors. Earlier clinical studies have shown that the combined BCL-2/BCL-XL/BCL-W inhibitor, Navitoclax (ABT-263) induces severe thrombocytopenia caused by direct platelet demise and counteracted by increased megakaryopoiesis. In contrast, murine studies have reported important contribution of BCL-XL to survival of late erythroid cells and megakaryocytes. Using lentiviral knockdown, we show that the roles of BCL-XL for human hematopoietic cells are much more pronounced than expected from murine data and clinical trials. Efficient genetic or chemical BCL-XL inhibition resulted in significant loss of human erythroid cells beginning from very early stages of erythropoiesis, and in a reduction of megakaryocytes. Most importantly, BCL-XL deficient human hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors were reduced in numbers, and they showed a severely impaired capacity to engraft in mice during xenotransplantation. BCL-XL deficiency was fully compensated by BCL-2 overexpression, however, loss of its antagonist BIM did not result in any rescue of human erythroid or stem and progenitor cells. We thus conclude that novel and specific BCL-XL inhibitors might be efficient to treat malignancies of erythroid or megakaryocytic origin, such as polycythemia vera, acute erythroid leukemia, essential thrombocytosis or acute megakaryocytic leukemia. At the same time, it can be expected that they will have more severe hematological side effects than Navitoclax.","['Afreen, Sehar', 'Bohler, Sheila', 'Muller, Alexandra', 'Demmerath, Eva-Maria', 'Weiss, Julia Miriam', 'Jutzi, Jonas Samuel', 'Schachtrup, Kristina', 'Kunze, Mirjam', 'Erlacher, Miriam']","['Afreen S', 'Bohler S', 'Muller A', 'Demmerath EM', 'Weiss JM', 'Jutzi JS', 'Schachtrup K', 'Kunze M', 'Erlacher M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7261-1447'],"['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Section of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine I, University Medical Center Freiburg, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency (CCI), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Medical Center Freiburg, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. miriam.erlacher@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg, Germany and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. miriam.erlacher@uniklinik-freiburg.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200106,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/metabolism', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Cells/drug effects/metabolism', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",,,2020/01/08 06:00,2021/01/16 06:00,['2020/01/08 06:00'],"['2019/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-019-2203-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-019-2203-z [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Jan 6;11(1):8. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-2203-z.,PMC6944703,,,"['0 (A-1155463)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cases of meningitis arising during neutropenia, CSF abnormalities tend to be subtle and can be easily overlooked, and mortality rate is high. We report a survived case of B. cereus meningitis/brain abscess in severe neutropenia, presenting as immune reconstitution syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old Japanese female with acute myelogenous leukemia developed B. cereus bacteremia and meningitis during consolidation chemotherapy. At the onset, she presented with mild meningism. She had marked leukocytopenia (WBC <100/muL, neutrophils 0/muL) and lumbar puncture yielded only mild pleocytosis. She was transferred to intensive care unit, and meropenem, linezolid and vancomycin was started. With intensive therapy, she recovered and once became afebrile. On day 19, however, her fever, meningism and consciousness level dramatically worsened despite recovery of bone marrow function. The antimicrobial chemotherapy was continued and finally she was cured with no complications. CONCLUSIONS: With early diagnosis and prompt initiation and of antibiotics, the case was successfully treated without any sequelae. It is important to remember that, even under optimal antimicrobial therapy, bone marrow recovery can cause transient reaggravation of the disease. In such cases, timely and appropriate evaluation should be done to make the clinical decision to change, continue, or intensify treatment.","['Koizumi, Yusuke', 'Okuno, Takafumi', 'Minamiguchi, Hitoshi', 'Hodohara, Keiko', 'Mikamo, Hiroshige', 'Andoh, Akira']","['Koizumi Y', 'Okuno T', 'Minamiguchi H', 'Hodohara K', 'Mikamo H', 'Andoh A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9369-8767'],"['Department of Clinical Infectious Diseases, Aichi Medical University Hospital, 1-1 Yazakokarimata, Nagakute, Aichi, 480-1195, Japan. ykoizumi@aichi-med-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Shiga, Japan. ykoizumi@aichi-med-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Shiga, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Shiga, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Shiga, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Infectious Diseases, Aichi Medical University Hospital, 1-1 Yazakokarimata, Nagakute, Aichi, 480-1195, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Shiga, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20200106,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,IM,,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacillus cereus/isolation & purification', 'Bacteremia/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Brain Abscess/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Meningitis, Bacterial/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bacillus cereus', 'Bacteremia', 'Febrile neutropenia', 'Immune reconstitution syndrome', 'Meningitis']",2020/01/08 06:00,2020/03/07 06:00,['2020/01/08 06:00'],"['2019/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-019-4753-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-019-4753-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2020 Jan 6;20(1):15. doi: 10.1186/s12879-019-4753-1.,PMC6945728,,,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the first case, a 27-year-old male who received haploidentical transplantation to treat T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), developed CMV encephalitis during the time of the ganciclovir maintenance treatment. After intravenous foscarnet and donor CMV-specific CTLs, CMV-DNA of CSF became undetectable and the abnormal signs of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were limited. Another case, a 57-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent haploidentical transplantation, also developed CMV encephalitis during the maintenance treatment of the ganciclovir.

Brain and cauda equina magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, including flow cytometry for cell immunophenotyping and microbiological exams were performed in all patients.Results: Patients developed signs and symptoms of involvement of isolated (n = 11) or multiple (n = 1) cranial nerves, at different stages of the primary disease, and, in 5 of these cases in complete remission after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Among the 5 cases that eventually were diagnosed as having NM, cerebrospinal fluid was positive for neoplastic cells in 3, and MRI gadolinium-enhancement was present in 3. The other episodes were attributed to heterogeneous pathologies that were unrelated to meningeal infiltration by neoplastic cells.Conclusions: Our observations confirm that NM in haematological malignancies can yield insidious isolated signs of cranial nerves. Only a multidisciplinary approach allows prompt recognition of these conditions through a challenging process of differential diagnosis, and proper therapies.","['Diamanti, Luca', 'Berzero, Giulia', 'Franciotta, Diego', 'Bini, Paola', 'Furione, Milena', 'Farina, Lisa Maria', 'Bastianello, Stefano', 'Colombo, Anna Amelia', 'Marchioni, Enrico']","['Diamanti L', 'Berzero G', 'Franciotta D', 'Bini P', 'Furione M', 'Farina LM', 'Bastianello S', 'Colombo AA', 'Marchioni E']",,"['IRCCS C.

Concurrent comorbidities, mild to severe organ dysfunctions, and low performance status (PS) are frequently found in older patients at the onset, conditioning treatment choice and crucially influencing the outcome. Although anthracyclines plus cytarabine-based chemotherapy, also called ""7 + 3"" regimen, remains the standard of care in young adults, its use in patients older than 65 years should be reserved to selected cases because of higher incidence of toxicity.

Among the several advantages over conventional monoclonal antibodies, their small size (12-15 kDa) allows them to extravasate rapidly, to show improved tissue penetration, and to clear rapidly from blood, which are important characteristics for cancer imaging and targeted radiotherapy. Herein, we identified Nbs against CD33, a marker for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A total of 12 Nbs were generated against recombinant CD33 protein, out of which six bound natively CD33 protein, expressed on the surface of acute myeloid leukemia THP-1 cells. The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of these six Nbs and CD33 range from 4 to 270 nM, and their melting temperature (Tm) varies between 52.67 and 67.80 degrees C. None of these Nbs showed leukemogenicity activity in vitro. The selected six candidates were radiolabeled with (99m)Tc, and their biodistribution was evaluated in THP-1-tumor-bearing mice. The imaging results demonstrated the fast tumor-targeting capacity of the Nbs in vivo. Among the anti-CD33 Nbs, Nb_7 showed the highest tumor uptake (2.53 +/- 0.69 % injected activity per gram (IA/g), with low background signal, except in the kidneys and bladder.

The study was comprised of 34 children (23 boys and 11 girls) after the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia or myeloid leukemia (mean age of 11.29 +/- 2.81 years, mean body height of 146.88 +/- 16.11 cm, and mean body weight of 43.68 +/- 13.93 kg). The mean time since treatment completion was 3.09 +/- 1.80 years. The level of physical activity was assessed with the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children questionnaire (HBSC). Physical efficiency was assessed based on the palant ball throw (assessment of strength, coordination, and upper limb speed), the long jump (assessment of jumping ability, speed and coordination) and the 60 m run (assessment of speed). Measurements of motor skills were normalized, classified according to age and sex, and converted into grades. The mean values obtained in the run and the ball throw showed low pass grades in the study group. In the case of the long jump, satisfactory grades were obtained. A correlation of r = 0.512 was found between vigorous physical activity (HBSC 3) and the grade in the run. A correlation of r = -0.437 was observed between the duration of computer use in leisure time (HBSC 6) and the grade in the long jump, whereas correlations of r = -0.482 and -0.485 were noted between the number hours per week spent on games (HBSC 5) and the duration of computer use in leisure time (HBSC 6) and the grade obtained in the ball throw, respectively.

AML initiation is primarily attributed to mutations in crucial cellular regulators such as epigenetic factors, transcription factors, and signaling genes. AML's aggressiveness and responsiveness to treatment depends on the specific cell type where leukemia first arose. Aged hematopoietic cells are often genetically and/or epigenetically altered and, therefore, present with a completely different cellular context for AML development compared to young cells. In this review, we summarize key aspects of AML development, and we focus, in particular, on the contribution of cellular aging to leukemogenesis and on current treatment options for elderly AML patients. Hematological disorders and leukemia grow exponentially with age. So far, with conventional induction therapy, many elderly patients experience a very poor overall survival rate requiring substantial social and medical costs during the relatively few remaining months of life. The global population's age is increasing rapidly without an acceptable equal growth in therapeutic management of AML in the elderly; this is in sharp contrast to the increase in successful therapies for leukemia in younger patients. Therefore, a focus on the understanding of the biology of aging in the hematopoietic system, the development of appropriate research models, and new therapeutic approaches are urged.","['Zjablovskaja, Polina', 'Florian, Maria Carolina']","['Zjablovskaja P', 'Florian MC']",,"['Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Ulm, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Ulm, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine in Barcelona (CMRB), IDIBELL, Hospital Duran i Reynals, Av.

Its quantity and subcellular location is controlled through a complex network and its activity increases during redox perturbation, inflammation, growth factor stimulation, and energy fluxes. Even before all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment era it was a common experience that acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells are highly sensitive to first line chemotherapy. Since we demonstrated how high doses of ascorbate (ASC) preferentially kill leukemic blast cells from APL patients, we aimed to define the underlying mechanism and found that promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML/RARa) inhibits NRF2 function, impedes its transfer to the nucleus and enhances its degradation in the cytoplasm. Such loss of NRF2 function alters cell metabolism, demarcating APL tissue from both normal promyelocytes and other acute myeloide leukemia (AML) blast cells. Resistance to ATRA/arsenic trioxide (ATO) treatment is rare but grave and the metabolically-oriented treatment with high doses of ASC, which is highly effective on APL cells and harmless on normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), could be of use in preventing clonal evolution and in rescuing APL-resistant patients.","['Banella, Cristina', 'Catalano, Gianfranco', 'Travaglini, Serena', 'Divona, Mariadomenica', 'Masciarelli, Silvia', 'Guerrera, Gisella', 'Fazi, Francesco', 'Lo Coco, Francesco', 'Voso, Maria Teresa', 'Noguera, Nelida']","['Banella C', 'Catalano G', 'Travaglini S', 'Divona M', 'Masciarelli S', 'Guerrera G', 'Fazi F', 'Lo Coco F', 'Voso MT', 'Noguera N']",,"['Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Tor Vergata University of Rome, 00133 Rome, Italy.', 'Neuro-Oncohematology Unit, Fondazione Santa Lucia, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (I.R.C.C.S.), 00143 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Tor Vergata University of Rome, 00133 Rome, Italy.', 'Neuro-Oncohematology Unit, Fondazione Santa Lucia, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (I.R.C.C.S.), 00143 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Tor Vergata University of Rome, 00133 Rome, Italy.', 'Oncologia Medica, Policlinico Universitario Tor Vergata, 00133 Rome, Italy.', 'Istituto di Istologia ed Embriologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, 00168 Rome, Italy.', 'Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

Intermediate and unfavorable-risk AML represent the most difficult-to-treat entities. We recently reported the benefit of the clofarabine-based consolidation (CLARA) regimen compared to the standard high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) regimen in younger AML patients. Here, we aimed at assessing the clinical significance of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-array alterations and their interactions with chemotherapy regimens. A SNP-array was successfully performed in 187 out of the 221 intent-to-treat patients (CLARA arm: n = 92 patients, HDAC arm: n = 95 patients). The CLARA regimen did not significantly improve relapse-free survival (RFS) among patients who displayed a complex karyotype when compared to the HDAC regimen (4-year RFS (4y-RFS): 36.4% vs. 18.8%, respectively; p = 0.134). Defining micro-complex karyotypes from at least four SNP-array lesions enabled us to refine and enlarge the subset of adverse patients. In such patients, the CLARA regimen significantly improved RFS compared to the HDAC regimen (4y-RFS: 44.4% vs. 13.8%, respectively; p = 0.004). From our study cohort, 8% of patients displayed TP53 mutations, which were associated with an impaired RFS (4y-RFS: 20.0% vs 43.7%; p = 0.029). In a multivariate analysis, micro-complex karyotypes remained the sole poor prognostic factor in the HDAC arm (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.324 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.337-4.041), p = 0.003). The SNP array represents a powerful and reproductive approach to refine adverse AML patients that may benefit from alternative consolidation regimens.","['Fenwarth, Laurene', 'Duployez, Nicolas', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Geffroy, Sandrine', 'Marceau-Renaut, Alice', 'Caillot, Denis', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Lemasle, Emilie', 'Marolleau, Jean-Pierre', 'Berthon, Celine', 'Cheok, Meyling H', 'Peyrouze, Pauline', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Celli-Lebras, Karine', 'Terre, Christine', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Dombret, Herve']","['Fenwarth L', 'Duployez N', 'Thomas X', 'Boissel N', 'Geffroy S', 'Marceau-Renaut A', 'Caillot D', 'Raffoux E', 'Lemasle E', 'Marolleau JP', 'Berthon C', 'Cheok MH', 'Peyrouze P', 'Pigneux A', 'Vey N', 'Celli-Lebras K', 'Terre C', 'Preudhomme C', 'Dombret H']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2808-4843', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3927-1022', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7820-8026']","['Laboratory of Hematology, CHU Lille, 59000 Lille, France.', 'Jean-Pierre AUBERT Research Center, University Lille, Inserm, UMR-S 1277, 59000 Lille, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, CHU Lille, 59000 Lille, France.', 'Jean-Pierre AUBERT Research Center, University Lille, Inserm, UMR-S 1277, 59000 Lille, France.', 'Lyon Sud, University Hospital, 69495 Pierre-Benite Lyon, France.', 'ALFA Group, 75010 Paris, France.', 'Hematology Department, Saint-Louis Hospital, 75010 Paris, France.', 'EA3518, Saint-Louis Institute for Research, Paris University, 75010 Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, CHU Lille, 59000 Lille, France.', 'Jean-Pierre AUBERT Research Center, University Lille, Inserm, UMR-S 1277, 59000 Lille, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, CHU Lille, 59000 Lille, France.', 'Jean-Pierre AUBERT Research Center, University Lille, Inserm, UMR-S 1277, 59000 Lille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Dijon University Hospital, 21000 Dijon, France.', 'Hematology Department, Saint-Louis Hospital, 75010 Paris, France.', 'Hematology Department, Henri Becquerel Cancer Center, 76038 Rouen, France.', 'Hematology Department, Amiens University Hospital, 80054 Amiens, France.', 'Hematology Department, CHU Lille, 59000 Lille, France.', 'Jean-Pierre AUBERT Research Center, University Lille, Inserm, UMR-S 1277, 59000 Lille, France.', 'Jean-Pierre AUBERT Research Center, University Lille, Inserm, UMR-S 1277, 59000 Lille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Bordeaux Haut-Leveque University Hospital, 33600 Pessac, France.', 'Onco-Hematology Department, Paoli-Calmettes Cancer Institute, 13009 Marseille, France.', 'ALFA Group, 75010 Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Andre Mignot Hospital, 78157 Le Chesnay, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, CHU Lille, 59000 Lille, France.', 'Jean-Pierre AUBERT Research Center, University Lille, Inserm, UMR-S 1277, 59000 Lille, France.', 'ALFA Group, 75010 Paris, France.', 'ALFA Group, 75010 Paris, France.', 'Hematology Department, Saint-Louis Hospital, 75010 Paris, France.', 'EA3518, Saint-Louis Institute for Research, Paris University, 75010 Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191230,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'micro-complex karyotype', 'snp-array']",2020/01/08 06:00,2020/01/08 06:01,['2020/01/08 06:00'],"['2019/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/08 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12010088 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12010088 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Dec 30;12(1). pii: cancers12010088. doi: 10.3390/cancers12010088.,PMC7017244,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It shares the adverse prognosis of Ph-positive ALL, but lacks the BCR-ABL1 fusion oncogene. Instead, Ph-like ALL is associated with alternative mutations in signaling pathways. We describe a case of Ph-like ALL that harbored 2 genomic alterations, which activated signaling, an NRASGly12Asp mutation, and an ETV6-NTRK3 rearrangement. Initially, the NRAS mutation was detected at high frequency, whereas the gene fusion was only detectable with a targeted next-generation sequencing-based fusion assay, but not by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. The disease failed to respond to multiagent chemotherapy but investigational CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy resulted in a complete remission. However, the leukemia relapsed after 6 weeks. Intriguingly, the NRAS mutation was extinguished during the chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and did not contribute to the relapse, which was instead associated with a rise in ETV6-NTRK3.

Poor bioavailability and solubility are significant factors limiting the efficacy of chemopreventive agents. In AML, the epigenetic regulator polycomb group of protein member EZH2 is highly expressed and is essential for the survival of leukemic cells. An EZH2-specific inhibitor, EPZ011989, encapsulated in human serum albumin nanoparticles (HSANPs) was synthesized for the first time via the desolvation method. The noncovalent interactions between EPZ011989 and HSANPs in nanocomposites facilitating the efficient loading and sustainable release of the drug showed enhanced cellular uptake and nuclear localization of EPZ011989-loaded HSANPs in human AML cell lines. The reduction of cell viability, colony formation inhibition, cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, and cell proliferation assay promoting apoptosis through the loss of mitochondrial homeostasis exerting antileukemic activity were evident. The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot-based studies showed that the present nanoformulation reduces the level of PcG proteins, including EZH2, BMI-1, etc. This downregulation is associated with reduced H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub modifications conferring chromatin compaction. The immunoprecipitation study showed the physical interaction of EZH2 and c-Myb can be linked to the regulation of leukemogenesis. Further investigation revealed the mechanism of EZH2 and c-Myb downregulation via ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation pathway, confirmed by using proteasome inhibitor, suggesting the key role of proteasomal degradation machinery. Moreover, c-Myb interacted with the EZH2 promoter, which is evident by the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and siRNA silencing. Furthermore, the formulation of EPZ011989 in HSANPs improved its biodistribution in vivo and showed excellent aqueous dispersibility and biocompatibility. In vivo studies further showed that EPZ011989-loaded HSANPs reduce the expression of CD11b(+) and CD45(+) markers in immunophenotyping from peripheral blood and bone marrow in engrafted nude mice. Targeted depletion of EZH2 alleviated the disease progression in nude mice and prolonged their survival. The findings provide valuable experimental evidence for the targeted epigenetic therapy of AML. The present results demonstrate an epigenetic regulation-based superior antileukemic therapy.","['Kaundal, Babita', 'Srivastava, Anup K', 'Dev, Atul', 'Mohanbhai, Soni Jignesh', 'Karmakar, Surajit', 'Roy Choudhury, Subhasree']","['Kaundal B', 'Srivastava AK', 'Dev A', 'Mohanbhai SJ', 'Karmakar S', 'Roy Choudhury S']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6800-2457', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7894-8297']","['Institute of Nano Science and Technology , Phase-10 , Mohali (Habitat Center) , Punjab 160062 , India.', 'Institute of Nano Science and Technology , Phase-10 , Mohali (Habitat Center) , Punjab 160062 , India.', 'Institute of Nano Science and Technology , Phase-10 , Mohali (Habitat Center) , Punjab 160062 , India.', 'Institute of Nano Science and Technology , Phase-10 , Mohali (Habitat Center) , Punjab 160062 , India.', 'Institute of Nano Science and Technology , Phase-10 , Mohali (Habitat Center) , Punjab 160062 , India.', 'Institute of Nano Science and Technology , Phase-10 , Mohali (Habitat Center) , Punjab 160062 , India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200106,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Compounding/methods', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*genetics', 'Serum Albumin, Human/chemistry', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*EPZ011989', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*epigenetics', '*methyltransferase', '*nanoformulation']",2020/01/07 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/01/07 06:00'],"['2020/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.9b01071 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2020 Feb 3;17(2):604-621. doi: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.9b01071.

In this article, we review the recent literature on myeloid sarcoma, focusing on treatment approach for this rare disease, and addressing the prognostic and therapeutic role of molecular and cytogenetic aberrations. RECENT FINDINGS: Molecular testing and cytogenetics are important adjunct to conventional diagnostic methods. The significance of cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities in myeloid sarcoma is not completely established, but testing for targetable mutations on myeloid sarcoma cells is feasible, imperative, and may guide treatment decisions. Outcomes in myeloid sarcoma largely depend on the background of its development. Almost all patients with myeloid sarcoma eventually develop AML typically in a short period after its diagnosis; therefore, remission induction treatment using AML type chemotherapy has been the standard of care. Postremission therapy is controversial; allogenic SCT, radiotherapy or consolidation chemotherapy should be considered according to patient risk. SUMMARY: Further research is required to understand the nature of myeloid sarcoma, and inclusion of patients with this condition in clinical trials should be considered to better identify the best diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approach in managing this rare disease.","['Shahin, Omar A', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Shahin OA', 'Ravandi F']",,"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas - MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,,"['Humans', '*Sarcoma, Myeloid']",,,2020/01/07 06:00,2020/06/04 06:00,['2020/01/07 06:00'],"['2020/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000571 [doi]', '00062752-202003000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2020 Mar;27(2):88-94. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000571.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since its first description as a variant CML lacking the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), the diagnostic criteria for aCML have evolved significantly. Nevertheless, distinguishing it from other Ph-negative myeloid neoplasms can still be very challenging, and given its generally worse prognosis, this is a clinically important distinction. The purpose of this review is to conceptualize our understanding of aCML molecular genetics based on recent advances, and describe how genetic features can be used in conjunction with clinical and morphologic features to better diagnose this elusive entity. RECENT FINDINGS: The classification criteria for aCML have evolved and changed multiple times over the past decades, and is now based on strict application of morphologic, clinical and laboratory criteria. Recent work has elucidated the mutational landscape of aCML, especially with respect to potentially differentiating profiles compared with other Ph-negative myeloid neoplasms. SUMMARY: Atypical CML is a rare MDS/MPN overlap syndrome that can be diagnostically challenging; however, its emerging molecular genetic understanding and clinicomorphologic phenotype can help in distinguishing it from other Ph-negative myeloid neoplasms.","['Sadigh, Sam', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Hobbs, Gabriela']","['Sadigh S', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Hobbs G']",,"['Departments of Pathology and Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/pathology']",,,2020/01/07 06:00,2020/06/04 06:00,['2020/01/07 06:00'],"['2020/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000565 [doi]', '00062752-202003000-00012 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2020 Mar;27(2):122-127. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000565.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains the curative therapy for refractory AML or high-risk MDS, old age is often a hurdle to the procedure. We conducted a retrospective study to analyze the prognostic factors predicting outcomes of older patients undergoing allo-HSCT for acute leukemia and MDS. METHODS: We collected data from patients diagnosed with acute leukemia or MDS, who underwent allo-HSCT at >50 years of age and reviewed clinical characteristics, including age, sex, underlying disease, European Group for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) risk score, and presence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) or chronic GVHD (cGVHD). The Cox proportional hazard model was adopted to explore the independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and non-relapse mortality (NRM). RESULTS: A total of 85 older patients were included, with the median age at allo-HSCT being 55 years. The significant prognostic factors for worse OS or PFS were an EBMT risk score > 3 and grade III-IV aGVHD, while patients with moderate to severe cGVHD would have better OS or PFS. Interestingly, it is not cGVHD but grade III-IV aGVHD that significantly correlated with NRM. CONCLUSION: This cohort study suggests that an EBMT risk score >3 and grade III-IV aGVHD predict poor outcomes, and careful management of GVHD may allow better survival for older patients undergoing allo-HSCT.","['Chien, Sheng-Hsuan', 'Liu, Yao-Chung', 'Liu, Chia-Jen', 'Ko, Po-Shen', 'Wang, Hao-Yuan', 'Hsiao, Liang-Tsai', 'Lin, Jeong-Shi', 'Chiou, Tzeon-Jye', 'Liu, Chun-Yu', 'Gau, Jyh-Pyng']","['Chien SH', 'Liu YC', 'Liu CJ', 'Ko PS', 'Wang HY', 'Hsiao LT', 'Lin JS', 'Chiou TJ', 'Liu CY', 'Gau JP']",,"['Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,J Chin Med Assoc,Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,101174817,IM,,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/*therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2020/01/07 06:00,2021/08/31 06:00,['2020/01/07 06:00'],"['2020/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000255 [doi]', '02118582-202003000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,J Chin Med Assoc. 2020 Mar;83(3):238-244. doi: 10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000255.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is important to determine the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of BLV throughout the country in order to gain a more thorough understanding of the current situation of BLV and to reveal the possibility of masked genotypes that the primers used by OIE are unable to identify. Blood samples were collected at random from 289 cows distributed in 75 farms across the country. PCR amplification of env, gag and tax gene segments was performed. The obtained amplicons were sequenced and then subjected to phylogenetic analyses. A total of 62% of the cows present at 92% of the farms were BLV-positive for gag fragment. Genotype 1 was exclusively detected by env gene segment when analyzed using previously reported primers. However, tax gene analysis revealed circulation of genotype 6 variants, which were also detected based on env gene analysis with newly designed primers.

This study investigates the anti-cancer properties and underlying mechanism of ergolide isolated from Inula oculus christi against leukemic cell lines. METHODS: Viability, metabolic activity and proliferation evaluated using different index of MTT assay such as IC50 and GI50. Human erythrocytes were used to evaluate hemolytic activity. Flow-cytometry was used to detect and measure ROS level, and the induction of apoptosis and autophagy were evaluated using Annexin V/PI, Acridine Orange staining, respectively. Moreover, qRT-PCR was performed to examine the expression of a large cohort of crucial regulatory genes. Tunel assay was also carried out to assess morphologically ergolide effects. RESULTS: Ergolide did not exert ant cytotoxicity against non-tumorous cells and did not cause noticeable hemolysis. It also caused ROS production during early hours after treatment of cells which was then followed by cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and autophagy induction. Using N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), we found that ergolide could not increase ROS and induce autophagy and moreover repressed cell death, indicating that ergolide induce cell death through ROS-dependent manner by altering the expression of pro apoptotic related genes. Autophagy inhibition also potentiated ergolide-induced cell death. Furthermore, ergolide intensified vincristine cytotoxicity against acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines revealed robust synergistic properties of ergolide with VCR. CONCLUSION: Here we showed that ergolide could be considered as a potent natural compound against leukemic cells by inducing cell cycle arrest followed by dose-dependent cell death. Based on results, Autophagy response in a result of ROS accumulation acted as a survival pathway and blocking this pathway could noticeably increase ergolide cytotoxicity on ALL cell lines.","['Yami, Amir', 'Hamzeloo-Moghadam, Maryam', 'Darbandi, Arezoo', 'Karami, Afshin', 'Mashati, Pargol', 'Takhviji, Vahideh', 'Gharehbaghian, Ahmad']","['Yami A', 'Hamzeloo-Moghadam M', 'Darbandi A', 'Karami A', 'Mashati P', 'Takhviji V', 'Gharehbaghian A']",,"['Department of Laboratory Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

In order to explore a further enhancement in the inhibitory effect of ATRA on FLT3-ITD AML cells, we investigated the suitability of a combination of ATRA and DNA damage drug SN38. In vitro experiments showed that this combinatorial approach effectively inhibited the proliferation of FLT3-ITD cells and induced cell apoptosis in AML. In vivo experiments confirmed that the combination could substantially improve the anti-tumor effect of SN38. Taken together, our results indicate that ATRA down-regulates Chk1 in FLT3-ITD AML cells, and the combination of ATRA and SN38 significantly improves the anti-tumor effect of either ATRA or SN38 when used alone.","['Wang, Wenliang', 'Jiang, Zongru', 'Wang, Li', 'Wang, Aoli', 'Liu, Juan', 'Chen, Cheng', 'Yu, Kailin', 'Zou, Fengming', 'Wang, Wenchao', 'Liu, Jing', 'Liu, Qingsong']","['Wang W', 'Jiang Z', 'Wang L', 'Wang A', 'Liu J', 'Chen C', 'Yu K', 'Zou F', 'Wang W', 'Liu J', 'Liu Q']",,"['High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, 230031, PR China; University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230036, PR China.', 'High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, 230031, PR China; University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230036, PR China.', 'High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, 230031, PR China; University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230036, PR China.', 'High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, 230031, PR China.', 'High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, 230031, PR China; University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230036, PR China.', 'High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, 230031, PR China; University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230036, PR China.', 'High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, 230031, PR China.', 'High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, 230031, PR China.', 'High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, 230031, PR China; Precision Medicine Research Laboratory of Anhui Province, Hefei, Anhui, 230088, PR China.

In the past, prophylactic cranial irradiation was commonly used in the form of whole-brain radiotherapy in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia to prevent the development of intracranial diseases. However, in addition to the inherent risk of toxicity, this type of therapy has several delayed side effects including the development of secondary intracranial tumors. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a rare case of a patient with concurrent pituicytoma, meningioma, and cavernomas 44 years after prophylactic cranial irradiation for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient presented with visual disturbance, headache, and features of hypopituitarism. Endoscopic transsphenoidal resection of the pituicytoma and meningioma was performed. Subsequent regrowth of the residual meningioma necessitated further surgery and adjuvant treatment with radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This case report highlights the unusual case of a patient with 3 concurrent intracranial lesions of distinct pathologies after prophylactic cranial irradiation therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Chester, Aaron N', 'Tan, Chi Hau', 'Muthurajah, Vanaja', 'Parker, Andrew J']","['Chester AN', 'Tan CH', 'Muthurajah V', 'Parker AJ']",,"['Department of Surgery and Anaesthesia, Otago Medical School, Wellington Regional Hospital, Capital & Coast District Health Board, Wellington, New Zealand.', 'Department of Surgery Neurosurgery, Wellington Regional Hospital, Capital & Coast District Health Board, Wellington, New Zealand.

Dysregulation of HOTAIRM1 has been found to be implicated in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the role of HOTAIRM1 in the drug resistance in AML remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of HOTAIRM1 on the cytarabine (Ara-C) resistance in leukemia cell lines and to explore the underlying mechanism. The leukemia cell lines, HL60 and THP-1, were transfected with HOTAIRM1 specific siRNA (si-HOTAIRM1) or control siRNA (si-ctrl), and then treated with Ara-C for 48 h. The mRNA levels of HOTAIRM1 and platelet-type phosphofructokinase (PFKP) were measured using RT-PCR. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. Apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry and caspase-3/7 activity assay. Glycolysis was evaluated by determining the glucose consumption and lactate production. To activate the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, HL60 and THP-1 cells were transfected with beta-catenin overexpressing plasmid (pcDNA-beta-catenin). Protein levels of PFKP, beta-catenin, and c-Myc were examined using western blot analysis. The results showed that knockdown of HOTAIRM1 enhanced Ara-C-induced reduction of cell viability and increase of cell apoptosis. HOTAIRM1 knockdown suppressed the glucose consumption and lactate production, as well as the expression of PFKP in AML cells. Besides, HOTAIRM1 knockdown resulted in a significant inhibitory effect on the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Furthermore, activating Wnt/beta-catenin pathway mitigated the effects of HOTAIRM1 knockdown on glycolysis and Ara-C cytotoxicity in AML cells. In conclusion, knockdown of HOTAIRM1 enhanced Ara-C cytotoxicity through regulating the Wnt/beta-catenin/PFKP signaling pathway. These findings suggested that HOTAIRM1 might be a therapeutic target for overcoming the Ara-C resistance in AML.","['Chen, Li', 'Hu, Ning', 'Wang, Chao', 'Zhao, Hongmian']","['Chen L', 'Hu N', 'Wang C', 'Zhao H']",,"['Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, Henan, China.

Administration of bacterial asparaginase (ASNase) has improved survival rates to nearly 80%, however these therapeutics have high incidence of immunological neutralization and serum activity must be monitored for most effective treatment regimens. Here, a 72% improvement in cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) of FDA approved l-asparaginase (crisantaspase) is demonstrated by employing an aspartate-fed-batch reactor format. A CFPS-based ASNase activity assay as a tool for therapeutic regimentation and production quality control is also presented. This work suggests that shelf-stable and low-cost Escherichia coli-based CFPS reactions may be employed on-demand to 1) synthesize biologics on-site for patient administration, 2) verify biologic activity for dosage calculations, and 3) monitor therapeutic activity in human serum during the treatment regimen. The combination of both therapeutic production and activity assessment introduces a concept of synergistic utility for bacterial cell lysates in modern medical treatment. Indeed, recent work with CFPS biosensors supports a not-too-distant future when shelf-stable E. coli CFPS systems are used to diagnose, treat, and monitor treatment of diseases in the clinical setting.","['Hunt, J Porter', 'Wilding, Kristen M', 'Barnett, R Jordan', 'Robinson, Hannah', 'Soltani, Mehran', 'Cho, Jae Eun', 'Bundy, Bradley C']","['Hunt JP', 'Wilding KM', 'Barnett RJ', 'Robinson H', 'Soltani M', 'Cho JE', 'Bundy BC']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4438-183X'],"['Department of Chemical Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, 84602, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, 84602, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, 84602, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, 84602, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, 84602, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, 84602, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, 84602, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200120,Germany,Biotechnol J,Biotechnology journal,101265833,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*biosynthesis/*therapeutic use', 'Bacteria/enzymology', 'Batch Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Engineering', 'Escherichia coli/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Engineering/*methods', 'Serum/*enzymology']",['NOTNLM'],"['asparaginase assay', 'cell-free protein synthesis', 'crisantaspase', 'human serum', 'lymphoblastic leukemia']",2020/01/07 06:00,2020/10/27 06:00,['2020/01/07 06:00'],"['2019/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/biot.201900294 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol J. 2020 Apr;15(4):e1900294. doi: 10.1002/biot.201900294.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways play a crucial role in T-cell development and in self-renewal of healthy and leukemic stem cells. Notably, beta-catenin is a transcriptional regulator of several genes involved in cancer cell proliferation and survival. In this way, aberrations of components belonging to the aforementioned networks contribute to T-ALL pathogenesis. For this reason, inhibition of both pathways could represent an innovative strategy in this hematological malignancy. Here, we show that combined targeting of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway through ICG-001, a CBP/beta-catenin transcription inhibitor, and of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis through ZSTK-474, a PI3K inhibitor, downregulated proliferation, survival, and clonogenic activity of T-ALL cells. ICG-001 and ZSTK-474 displayed cytotoxic effects, and, when combined together, induced a significant increase in apoptotic cells. This induction of apoptosis was associated with the downregulation of Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. All these findings were confirmed under hypoxic conditions that mimic the bone marrow niche where leukemic stem cells are believed to reside. Taken together, our findings highlight potentially promising treatment consisting of cotargeting Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways in T-ALL settings.","['Evangelisti, Cecilia', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Cappellini, Alessandra', 'Paganelli, Francesca', 'Fini, Milena', 'Santi, Spartaco', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Neri, Luca M', 'Evangelisti, Camilla']","['Evangelisti C', 'Chiarini F', 'Cappellini A', 'Paganelli F', 'Fini M', 'Santi S', 'Martelli AM', 'Neri LM', 'Evangelisti C']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3531-9540'],"['Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'CNR Institute of Molecular Genetics ""Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza"", Bologna, Italy.', 'IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.', 'CNR Institute of Molecular Genetics ""Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza"", Bologna, Italy.', 'IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'LTTA-Electron Microscopy Center, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'CNR Institute of Molecular Genetics ""Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza"", Bologna, Italy.', 'IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200106,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,,"['Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics', 'Pyrimidinones/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Triazines/pharmacology', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/drug effects/genetics', 'beta Catenin/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*PI3K/Akt/mTOR', '*T-ALL', '*Wnt/beta-catenin', '*combination therapy', '*hypoxia', '*targeted therapy']",2020/01/07 06:00,2021/03/10 06:00,['2020/01/07 06:00'],"['2019/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.29429 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2020 Jun;235(6):5413-5428. doi: 10.1002/jcp.29429.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the prognostic role of CD38 as well as minimal residual disease (MRD) and other biological factors in T-ALL. METHODS: Immunophenotyping of bone marrow (BM) at diagnosis and MRD levels were determined using a standard panel of antibodies by 4-colour flow cytometry. A total of 96 children with T-ALL were enrolled. RESULTS: The results showed that 97.9% of T-ALL patients were positive for CD38 with a median level of 85.3%. CD38-high group had a worse early treatment response than the CD38-low group. However, CD38 levels were not associated with prognosis, albeit CD38-high group had a worse 5-year event free survival rate (55.1% vs. 66.6%, P> 0.05) and a higher 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (35.6% vs. 19.8%, P> 0.05). Very high MRD levels (> 10%) were related to the worse survival. Neither flow cytometry based minimal residual disease (MRD) levels nor CD38 expression levels showed significant relation to the hazard of relapse (P> 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that T-ALL has a high level of CD38 expression which is not associated with prognosis. Very high MRD level (> 10%) is related to the worse survival, however, FCM based MRD detection does not convey a significant prognostic value.","['Liao, Chan', 'Shen, Di-Ying', 'Xu, Xiao-Jun', 'Song, Hua', 'Xu, Wei-Qun', 'Zhao, Fen-Ying', 'Yang, Shi-Long', 'Tang, Yong-Min']","['Liao C', 'Shen DY', 'Xu XJ', 'Song H', 'Xu WQ', 'Zhao FY', 'Yang SL', 'Tang YM']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,IM,,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*biosynthesis', 'Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/immunology/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD38', 'T-ALL', 'childhood', 'relapse', 'survival']",2020/01/07 06:00,2020/07/28 06:00,['2020/01/07 06:00'],"['2020/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['CBM190946 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-190946 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2020;27(2):277-284. doi: 10.3233/CBM-190946.,,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the antileukemic properties of a novel MNK inhibitor, SEL201. Our studies provide evidence that SEL201 suppresses eIF4E phosphorylation on Ser209 in AML cell lines and in primary patient-derived AML cells. Such effects lead to growth inhibitory effects and leukemic cell apoptosis, as well as suppression of leukemic progenitor colony formation. Combination of SEL201 with 5'-azacytidine or rapamycin results in synergistic inhibition of AML cell growth. Collectively, these results suggest that SEL201 has significant antileukemic activity and further underscore the relevance of the MNK pathway in leukemogenesis.","['Kosciuczuk, Ewa M', 'Kar, Aroop K', 'Blyth, Gavin T', 'Fischietti, Mariafausta', 'Abedin, Sameem', 'Mina, Alain A', 'Siliezar, Rebekah', 'Rzymski, Tomasz', 'Brzozka, Krzysztof', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A', 'Beauchamp, Elspeth M', 'Eckerdt, Frank', 'Saleiro, Diana', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Kosciuczuk EM', 'Kar AK', 'Blyth GT', 'Fischietti M', 'Abedin S', 'Mina AA', 'Siliezar R', 'Rzymski T', 'Brzozka K', 'Eklund EA', 'Beauchamp EM', 'Eckerdt F', 'Saleiro D', 'Platanias LC']",,"['Robert H.

Among other functions, they downregulate immune-mediated tumor rejection by depriving lymphocytes of nutrients. The essential amino acid tryptophan is metabolized by the enzymes indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 is expressed in a large number of human tumors, and inhibitors are in development to improve immunotherapy. Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase was also found in human tumors and preclinical working models confirmed its immunosuppressive power. We explored a potential expression of TDO by macrophages. This enzyme could be induced in two human cell lines, THP-1 and U937, by incubation with phorbol myristate acetate, lipopolysaccharide, and interferon gamma. Phorbol-myristate-acetate-mediated induction was inhibited by rottlerin, a protein kinase C inhibitor. In contrast to these monocytic cell lines, other cell lines or fresh human monocytes isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and differentiated into proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory macrophages could not be induced to express TDO. Our results suggest that TDO might play an immunosuppressive role in human monocytic leukemias but not in untransformed macrophages.","['Hoffmann, Delia', 'Pilotte, Luc', 'Stroobant, Vincent', 'Van den Eynde, Benoit J']","['Hoffmann D', 'Pilotte L', 'Stroobant V', 'Van den Eynde BJ']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4995-3270'],"['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, UCLouvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, UCLouvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, UCLouvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, UCLouvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191226,United States,Int J Tryptophan Res,International journal of tryptophan research : IJTR,101513378,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['IFN-gamma', 'LPS', 'PKC', 'PMA', 'Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase', 'monocyte']",2020/01/07 06:00,2020/01/07 06:01,['2020/01/07 06:00'],"['2019/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1178646919891736 [doi]', '10.1177_1178646919891736 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Tryptophan Res. 2019 Dec 26;12:1178646919891736. doi: 10.1177/1178646919891736. eCollection 2019.,PMC6933542,"['Declaration of conflicting interests:Benoit Van den Eynde is the co-founder of,', 'has ownership interest in, and is an SAB member of iTeos Therapeutics.']",,,['(c) The Author(s) 2019.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This makes it challenging to determine the cause of AKI and the optimal chemotherapy regimen for AML. We describe two cases of AML (French-American-British classification: M2, M4) in patients with AKI requiring hemodialysis. We successfully identified the cause of AKI as primary leukemic infiltration and started induction chemotherapy in the setting of hemodialysis. This treatment significantly improved renal function and resulted in AML remission. In this report, we describe several clinical characteristics of AKI due to primary tumor infiltration. In addition, we emphasize the importance of onconephrology, a new subspecialty concerned with the complex relationship between the kidneys and cancer.","['Aratani, Sae', 'Aburakawa, Sho', 'Ryotokuji, Tsuyoshi', 'Marumo, Atsushi', 'Sakai, Yukinao', 'Inokuchi, Koiti', 'Tsuruoka, Shuichi']","['Aratani S', 'Aburakawa S', 'Ryotokuji T', 'Marumo A', 'Sakai Y', 'Inokuchi K', 'Tsuruoka S']",,"['Department of Nephrology, Graduate School of Medicine, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Nephrology, Graduate School of Medicine, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Nephrology, Graduate School of Medicine, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Nephrology, Graduate School of Medicine, Nippon Medical School.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20191227,Japan,J Nippon Med Sch,Journal of Nippon Medical School = Nippon Ika Daigaku zasshi,100935589,IM,,"['Acute Kidney Injury/*etiology/therapy', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*pathology', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Severity of Illness Index']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute kidney injury', 'acute myeloblastic leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'onco-nephrology', 'tumor infiltration']",2020/01/07 06:00,2020/08/18 06:00,['2020/01/07 06:00'],"['2020/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1272/jnms.JNMS.2020_87-108 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nippon Med Sch. 2020 Mar 11;87(1):43-48. doi: 10.1272/jnms.JNMS.2020_87-108.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the efficacy and safety of imatinib versus nilotinib as first-line therapy for patients with CML-CP. We also performed a comparative analysis of the efficacy of sustained imatinib versus a switch to nilotinib for patients with CML-CP with a warning or failure response or intolerance to imatinib. We also comparatively analyzed the efficacy between first-line nilotinib and first-line imatinib after standardized management in accordance with the European Leukemia Network (ELN) recommendations. A total of 344 patients were included in the present study. RESULTS: The proportion of patients achieving a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), major molecular response (MMR), and molecular response 4.0 (MR4.0) was greater with first-line nilotinib than with first-line imatinib at 0 to 24 and 0 to 36 months (P < .05). Of the 344 patients, 174 did not achieve an optimal response to first-line imatinib. A greater proportion of those patients who had switch to nilotinib had achieved a CCyR, MMR, and MR4.0 compared with those continuing imatinib for 12 months of subsequent treatment (P < .005). No difference was found in the proportion of patients with a CCyR, MMR, and MR4.0 between first-line nilotinib and first-line imatinib after standardized management in accordance with the ELN recommendations at 0 to 24 and 0 to 36 months (P > .05). CONCLUSION: First-line imatinib can result in efficacy similar to that with first-line nilotinib after standardized management in accordance with the ELN recommendations. Treatment with imatinib as first-line treatment, with a switch to nilotinib after standardized management is feasible and effective.","['Chen, Yilin', 'Yin, Hua', 'Chen, Lifeng', 'Xiong, Yingyuan', 'Meng, Li', 'Guo, Jingming', 'Wang, Haiyan', 'Li, Weiming']","['Chen Y', 'Yin H', 'Chen L', 'Xiong Y', 'Meng L', 'Guo J', 'Wang H', 'Li W']",,"['Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', ""Yichang Central People's Hospital and First Clinical Medical College of China, Three Gorges University, Yichang, Hubei, China."", ""Yichang Central People's Hospital and First Clinical Medical College of China, Three Gorges University, Yichang, Hubei, China.

Furthermore, t(2;11)(p23;q23)/KMT2A-ASXL2 fusion has been rarely described with only a single case reported to date. We report a 45-year-old male with a diagnosis of de novo AML harboring GATA2-MECOM rearrangement in conjunction with a related subclone with concomitant inv(3) and t(9;22). The patient was treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which lead to disappearance of the inv(3)/t(9;22) subclone and subsequent expansion of the inv(3) ancestral clone. The patient was started on a 7+3 induction regimen with TKI but had persistent disease. He was placed on several additional treatment protocols and only achieved morphologic remission with a combination of fludarabine, cytarabine and filgrastim with TKI. Approximately 11.5 months after diagnosis the patient relapsed with the inv(3) clone predominating initially, followed by return of the inv(3)/t(9;22) subclone and the emergence of a second subclone with concomitant inv(3) and t(2;11)(p23;q23). Mate-pair sequencing was performed and identified a KMT2A-ASXL2 in-frame fusion, which was only recently described in a single case of therapy-related AML. For BCR-ABL1 positive AML, which generally carries a poor prognosis, treatment with TKIs has been proposed in combination with standard chemotherapy. In our case, treatment with TKI alone led to initial response of the BCR-ABL1 positive clone, but the ancestral clone quickly expanded and subsequent standard AML therapy may have led to further clonal evolution and re-emergence of the BCR-ABL1 clone in the absence of therapeutic selection.","['Blackburn, Patrick R', 'Huang, Li', 'Dalovisio, Andrew', 'Pitel, Beth A', 'Chen, Dong', 'Oliveira, Jennifer L', 'Wood, Adam J', 'Smadbeck, James B', 'Johnson, Sarah H', 'Vasmatzis, George', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Greipp, Patricia T', 'Hoppman, Nicole L', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Baughn, Linda B', 'Peterson, Jess F']","['Blackburn PR', 'Huang L', 'Dalovisio A', 'Pitel BA', 'Chen D', 'Oliveira JL', 'Wood AJ', 'Smadbeck JB', 'Johnson SH', 'Vasmatzis G', 'Haferlach C', 'Greipp PT', 'Hoppman NL', 'Ketterling RP', 'Baughn LB', 'Peterson JF']",,"['Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine William G.

However, epidemiological studies showed controversial results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize the association between residential exposure to PICs and the risk of leukemia incidence, focusing on exposure-response effects. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for studies published before September 1st, 2019. Observational studies investigating residential exposure to PICs and the risk of leukemia were included. The outcome of interest was the incidence of leukemia comparing to reference groups. Relative risk (RR) was used as the summary effect measure, synthesized by characteristics of populations, distance to PICs, and calendar time in meta-regression. We identified 7 observational studies, including 2322 leukemia cases and substantial reference groups, in this meta-analysis. Residential exposure to PICs within a maximal 8-km distance had a 36% increased risk of leukemia (pooled RR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.14-1.62) compared to controls, regardless of sex and age. In terms of leukemia subtypes, residential exposure to PICs was associated with the risks of acute myeloid leukemia (AML, pooled RR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.12-2.31) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, pooled RR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.11-6.42). In meta-regression, the positive association occurred after 10 years of follow-up with a pooled RRs of 1.21 (95% CI = 1.02-1.44) and then slightly increased to 1.77 (95% CI = 1.35-2.33) at 30 years after follow-up.

Because the gut microbiota may be altered by immunomodulation resulting from viral infections, we hypothesized that latent BLV infection would change the gut (i.e., rumen and hindgut) microbiota of infected cattle. In this study, we compared the gut microbiota of 22 uninfected and 29 BLV-infected Holstein-Friesian cows kept on the same farm, by 16S rRNA amplicon sequence analysis of fecal samples. First, we found that the fecal microbial diversity of BLV-infected cows differed slightly from that of uninfected cows. According to differential abundance analysis, some bacterial taxa associated with ruminal fermentation, such as Lachnospiraceae and Veillonellaceae families, were enriched in the fecal microbiota of uninfected cows. Second, the virus propagation ability of BLV strains was examined in vitro, and the correlation of the fecal microbiota with this virus propagation ability was analyzed. Higher virus propagation was shown to lead to less diversity in the microbiota. Differential abundance analysis showed that one bacterial taxon of genus Sanguibacteroides was negatively correlated with the virus propagation ability of BLV strains. Considering these results, BLV infection was speculated to decrease energy production efficiency in the cows via modification of rumen and hindgut microbiota, which partly relies on the virus propagation ability of BLV strains. This may explain the secondary negative effects of BLV infections such as increased susceptibility to other infections and decreased lifetime milk production and reproductive efficiency.","['Uchiyama, Jumpei', 'Murakami, Hironobu', 'Sato, Reiichiro', 'Mizukami, Keijiro', 'Suzuki, Takehito', 'Shima, Ayaka', 'Ishihara, Genki', 'Sogawa, Kazuyuki', 'Sakaguchi, Masahiro']","['Uchiyama J', 'Murakami H', 'Sato R', 'Mizukami K', 'Suzuki T', 'Shima A', 'Ishihara G', 'Sogawa K', 'Sakaguchi M']",,"['School of Veterinary Medicine, Azabu University, Fuchinobe 1-17-71, Chuo-ku Sagamihara-shi, Kanagawa, Japan.

Our aims were to explore risk factors for early mortality in elderly AML patients and develop a new prognostic score. METHODS: We enrolled newly diagnosed AML patients age 60 and above at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between July 2008 and May 2017. The primary endpoint was early mortality, defined as death within two months after AML diagnosis. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to build a risk-scoring system incorporating significant risk factors for AML. RESULTS: The final cohort included 277 elderly AML patients. The median age was 74 (range 60-96), and 61.7% were male. The two-month mortality rate was 29.9%. Age >/= 80 (adjusted HR 1.88), myocardial infarction (adjusted HR 1.87), ECOG >/= 2 (adjusted HR 2.10), complex karyotype (adjusted HR 3.21), bone marrow blasts >/= 70% (adjusted HR 1.88), WBC >/= 100 x 10(9) /L (adjusted HR 3.31), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 45 (adjusted HR 2.60) were identified as independent predictors for early mortality in the multivariate analysis. A simplified score incorporating the seven factors was developed with good predictive ability measured by Harrell's C statistic [0.72 (95% CI 0.66-0.78)]. CONCLUSIONS: We identified seven potential risk factors for early mortality and built up a new prognostic score for elderly AML patients. The new score may help clinicians stratify patients and initiate appropriate management.

Many of these aberrations originate in utero and the cells transform in early childhood through acquired secondary mutations. In this review, we will discuss the most common prenatal lesions that can lead to childhood ALL, with a special emphasis on the most common translocation in childhood ALL, t(12;21), which results in the ETV6-RUNX1 gene fusion. The ETV6-RUNX1 fusion arises prenatally and at a 500-fold higher frequency than the corresponding ALL. Even though the findings regarding the frequency of ETV6-RUNX1 were originally challenged, newer studies have confirmed the higher frequency. The prenatal origin has also been proven for other gene fusions, including KMT2A, the translocations t(1;19) and t(9;22) leading to TCF3-PBX1 and BCR-ABL1, respectively, as well as high hyperdiploidy. For most of these aberrations, there is evidence for more frequent occurrence than the corresponding leukemia incidences. We will briefly discuss what is known about the cells of origin, the mechanisms of leukemic transformation through lack of immunosurveillance, and why only a part of the carriers develops ALL.","['Hein, Daniel', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Fischer, Ute']","['Hein D', 'Borkhardt A', 'Fischer U']",,"[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.

However, resistance to ABL TKIs can develop in CML patients due to BCR-ABL point mutations. Furthermore, CUDC-907 is an oral inhibitor of class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) as well as class I and II histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the effect of combination therapy of CUDC-907 and ABL TKIs, using BCR-ABL-positive cell lines and primary samples. RESULTS: CUDC-907 treatment for 72 h resulted in cell growth inhibition. Over the same period, an increase in histone acetylation and both caspase three and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzyme activity was observed. When ABL TKI treatment and CUDC-907 treatment were combined, significantly greater cytotoxicity was observed. Moreover, combined oral therapy with ponatinib (20 mg/kg/day) and CUDC-907 (30 mg/kg/day) greatly inhibited tumor growth compared to each drug alone. Lastly, CUDC-907 treatment also inhibited the growth of Ba/F3 ponatinib-resistant cells, K562 nilotinib-resistant cells, and T315I mutant primary samples. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results indicate that administration of CUDC-907, a dual PI3K and HDAC inhibitor, may be an effective strategy against ABL TKI-resistant cells, including cells harboring the T315I mutation. Moreover, CUDC-907 may enhance the cytotoxic effects of ABL TKI when a combined treatment strategy is used against Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia cells.","['Okabe, Seiichi', 'Tanaka, Yuko', 'Moriyama, Mitsuru', 'Gotoh, Akihiko']","['Okabe S', 'Tanaka Y', 'Moriyama M', 'Gotoh A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2727-658X'],"['Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, 6-7-1 Nishi-shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-0023, Japan. okabe@tokyo-med.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, 6-7-1 Nishi-shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-0023, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, 6-7-1 Nishi-shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-0023, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, 6-7-1 Nishi-shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-0023, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200104,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome/*drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyridazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Histone deacetylase', '*Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase', '*Resistant cell']",2020/01/07 06:00,2020/08/14 06:00,['2020/01/06 06:00'],"['2019/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-019-04022-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-019-04022-x [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2020 Feb;85(2):401-412. doi: 10.1007/s00280-019-04022-x.

Variant forms of t(8;21) are rare. Herein we describe a novel variant of t(8;21) AML in a 25-year-old pregnant woman who presented with intermittent fever. CASE REPORT: Her peripheral smear and bone marrow aspirate showed many myeloblasts. Chromosomal study revealed t(8;22;21)(q22;q12;q22) and loss of X chromosome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using whole chromosome painting probes confirmed the three-way translocation involving chromosomes 8, 21 and 22. RUNX1-RUNX1T1 rearrangement was identified in FISH and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirming the diagnosis of AML with variant t(8;21). The patient was treated with standard chemotherapy. She achieved morphological remission one month after induction chemotherapy. DISCUSSION: Although the clinical significance of variant t(8;21) is not well delineated, the evaluation of 31 such cases suggests patients with variant t(8;21) have similar prognosis to those with classical t(8;21).","['Tay Za, K', 'Shanmugam, H', 'Chin, E F M']","['Tay Za K', 'Shanmugam H', 'Chin EFM']",,"['University Malaya Medical Centre, Department of Pathology, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. kyawtayza79@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Malaysia,Malays J Pathol,The Malaysian journal of pathology,8101177,IM,,"['Adult', 'Chromosomes, Human', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",,,2020/01/07 06:00,2020/06/24 06:00,['2020/01/06 06:00'],"['2020/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Malays J Pathol. 2019 Dec;41(3):333-338.,,,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stable reference genes (RG) are essential for accurate and reliable reporting but no standard method for selection has been endorsed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated simple statistics and published model-based approaches. Multiplex-qPCR was conducted to determine the expression of 24 candidate RG in AMLs (N=9). Singleplex-qPCR was carried out on selected RG (SRP14, B2M and ATP5B) and genes of interest in AML (N=15) and healthy controls, HC (N=12). RESULTS: RG expression levels in AML samples were highly variable and coefficient of variance (CV) ranged from 0.37% to 10.17%. Analysis using GeNorm and Normfinder listed different orders of most stable genes but the top seven (ACTB, UBE2D2, B2M, NF45, RPL37A, GK, QARS) were the same. In singleplex-qPCR, SRP14 maintained the lowest CV in AML samples. B2M, one of most stable reference genes in AML, was expressed near significantly different in AML and HC. GeNorm selected ATP5B+SRP14 while Normfinder chose SRP14+B2M as the best two RG in combination. The median expressions of combined RG genes in AML compared to HC were less significantly different than individually implying smaller expression variation after combination. Genes of interest normalised with RG in combination or individually, displayed significantly different expression patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The selection of best reference gene in qPCR must consider all sample sets. Model-based approaches are important in large candidate gene analysis. This study showed combination of RG SRP14+B2M was the most suitable normalisation factor for qPCR analysis of AML and healthy individuals.","['Lee, C', 'Yiau, K X S', 'Lee, L J', 'Chong, P P', 'Chang, K M', 'Abdullah, M']","['Lee C', 'Yiau KXS', 'Lee LJ', 'Chong PP', 'Chang KM', 'Abdullah M']",,"['UPM-MAKNA Cancer Research Laboratory, Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, 43400 Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia. maha@upm.edu.my.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Malaysia,Malays J Pathol,The Malaysian journal of pathology,8101177,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondrial Proton-Translocating ATPases/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/07 06:00,2020/06/24 06:00,['2020/01/06 06:00'],"['2020/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Malays J Pathol. 2019 Dec;41(3):313-326.,,,,"['0 (ATP5F1B protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.3.- (Mitochondrial Proton-Translocating ATPases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HDAC8 is a class I HDAC that is implicated as a therapeutic target in various indication areas, including different types of cancer and particularly childhood neuroblastoma. Most previously described HDAC8-selective inhibitors contain a hydroxamate function as zinc binding group (ZBG) to confer potency. However, hydroxamate class HDAC inhibitors have raised increasing concerns about their mutagenic character. Therefore, non-hydroxamate based inhibitors could prove to be safer than hydroxamates. In the present work, a series of novel 5-naphthylidene-2,4-thiazolidinedione was designed and evaluated as potential antiproliferative agents targeting selectively HDAC8 enzyme. Eleven novel derivatives were synthesized, purified and characterized by spectroscopic techniques. Compounds 3k and 3h was found to be most potent selective inhibitors of HDAC8 with IC50 values of 2.7 muM and 6.3 muM respectively. 3a to 3i was found to be most cytotoxic in leukemic cell lines. 3a and 3 h both were found to induce apoptosis and cause cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase.","['Tilekar, Kalpana', 'Upadhyay, Neha', 'Jansch, Niklas', 'Schweipert, Markus', 'Mrowka, Piotr', 'Meyer-Almes, F J', 'Ramaa, C S']","['Tilekar K', 'Upadhyay N', 'Jansch N', 'Schweipert M', 'Mrowka P', 'Meyer-Almes FJ', 'Ramaa CS']",,"[""Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Pharmacy, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Pharmacy, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India."", 'Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Applied Sciences, Darmstadt, Germany.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Applied Sciences, Darmstadt, Germany.', 'Department of Biophysics and Human Physiology, Medical University of Warsaw, Chalubinskiego, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Applied Sciences, Darmstadt, Germany.

METHODS: Totally 221 de novo AML patients and 50 healthy donors were enrolled. The bone marrow samples were collected before treatment from AML patients and acquired after enrollment from healthy donors. And bone marrow mononuclear cells were separated for detecting the mRNA/protein expressions of PPM1D by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Complete remission (CR) was assessed after induction treatment, and event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated in AML patients. RESULTS: PPM1D mRNA (P < .001)/protein (P < .001) relative expressions were increased in AML patients compared with healthy donors, and receiver operating characteristic curve presented that PPM1D mRNA (AUC: 0.728, 95% CI: 0.651-0.806)/protein (AUC: 0.782, 95% CI: 0.707-0.857) relative expressions could differentiate AML patients from healthy donors. In AML patients, PPM1D mRNA (P < .001)/protein (P < .001) high relative expressions were correlated with poor-risk stratification. As for its association with prognosis, PPM1D mRNA (P < .001)/protein (P = .010) relative expressions were elevated in CR patients compared with non-CR patients. Patients with PPM1D mRNA (P < .001 for EFS; P = .004 for OS)/protein (P < .001 for EFS; P = .006 for OS) high relative expressions exhibited reduced EFS and OS compared with those with low expressions. CONCLUSION: PPM1D high expression correlates with poor-risk stratification and might serve as a potential biomarker for worse prognosis in AML patients, suggesting its potential to guide AML management.","['Yu, Meijia', 'Hu, Jie', 'He, Di', 'Chen, Qi', 'Liu, Suna', 'Zhu, Xiaoling', 'Li, Bin']","['Yu M', 'Hu J', 'He D', 'Chen Q', 'Liu S', 'Zhu X', 'Li B']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5608-6945'],"[""Department of Hematology, The Second People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200103,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,IM,,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Phosphatase 2C/*genetics/metabolism', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'complete remission', 'protein phosphatase Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1D', 'risk stratification', 'survival profile']",2020/01/05 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2020/01/05 06:00'],"['2019/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcla.23171 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2020 May;34(5):e23171. doi: 10.1002/jcla.23171.

We have discussed the key phase 3 trials of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) comparing with each other, treatment free remission (TFR) and selection of TKI. Upcoming concepts and related trials in the management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) along with future directions have been touched upon. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed, Embase, Google, Cochrane library and Medline were searched to identify relevant literature for the review. Clinicaltrial.gov was searched for upcoming data and trials. RESULTS: There are lot of gap in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TKI. Imatinib appears to be the safest TKI. Newer TKI's achieve better achievement of therapeutic milestones, deeper molecular response and less chances of progression of CML compared to imatinib. Newer TKI appears to be better choice for achieving TFR. When the objective is survival, imatinib is still the TKI of choice. Primary prophylaxis with antiplatelet drugs for TKI having cardiovascular and thromboembolic side effects should be considered. CONCLUSION: Pharmacogenetic data of TKI is still immature to guide in therapeutic decision making in clinical practice. There is need for further research in pharmacology and pharmacogenomics of newer TKI's. Randomized controlled trials are required to decide the optimum TKI for TFR. Safe and effective TKI for targeting T315I mutation, CML accelerated phase and blast crisis are an active area of research.","['Pushpam, Deepam', 'Bakhshi, Sameer']","['Pushpam D', 'Bakhshi S']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. B.

Past studies found that continuous exposure of human AML U937 cells to HQ selectively produces malignant U937/HQ cells in which FOXP3 upregulation modulates malignant progression. Other studies revealed that AMPK promotes TET2 activity on DNA demethylation and that TET2 activity is crucial for upregulating FOXP3 expression. This study was conducted to elucidate whether compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, blocked the AMPK-TET2-FOXP3 axis in AML and in HQ-selected malignant cells. We found higher levels of AMPKalpha, TET2, and FOXP3 expression in U937/HQ cells compared to U937 cells. Treatment of parental Original Article and HQ-selected malignant U937 cells with compound C induced ROS-mediated p38 MAPK activation, leading to a suppression of AMPKalpha, TET2, and FOXP3 expression. Moreover, compound C induced apoptosis and mTOR-independent autophagy. The suppression of the autophagic flux inhibited the apoptosis of compound C-treated U937 and U937/HQ cells, whereas co-treatment with rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, sensitized the two cell lines to compound C cytotoxicity. Overexpression of AMPKalpha1 or pretreatment with autophagic inhibitors abrogated compound C-induced autophagy and suppression of TET2 and FOXP3 expression. Restoration of AMPKalpha1 or FOXP3 expression increased cell survival after treatment with compound C. In conclusion, our results show that compound C suppresses AMPK/TET2 axis-mediated FOXP3 expression and induces autophagy-dependent apoptosis in parental and HQ-selected malignant U937 cells, suggesting that the AMPK/TET2/FOXP3 axis is a promising target for improving AML therapy and attenuating benzene exposure-induced AML progression.","['Chiou, Jing-Ting', 'Huang, Chia-Hui', 'Lee, Yuan-Chin', 'Wang, Liang-Jun', 'Shi, Yi-Jun', 'Chen, Ying-Jung', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Chiou JT', 'Huang CH', 'Lee YC', 'Wang LJ', 'Shi YJ', 'Chen YJ', 'Chang LS']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3204-5137'],"['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan.', 'Department of Fragrance and Cosmetic Science, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, 807, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan. lschang@mail.nsysu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, 807, Taiwan. lschang@mail.nsysu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200103,Netherlands,Cell Biol Toxicol,Cell biology and toxicology,8506639,IM,,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/drug effects/genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AMPK', '*FOXP3', '*Hydroquinone', '*Leukemia', '*TET2']",2020/01/05 06:00,2021/06/12 06:00,['2020/01/05 06:00'],"['2019/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10565-019-09495-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s10565-019-09495-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Toxicol. 2020 Aug;36(4):315-331. doi: 10.1007/s10565-019-09495-3.

The current study aimed to explore its exquisite carbohydrate specificity on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and leukemic T-cells. SRL, showed strong binding (>98%) to resting/activated PBMCs, leukemic Molt-4 and Jurkat cell lines. The glycans mediated binding to these cells was effectively blocked by mucin and fetuin, exhibiting 97% and 94% inhibition respectively. SRL showed mitogenic stimulation of PBMCs at 10 mug/ml as determined by thymidine incorporation assay. In contrast, lectin induced a dose dependent growth inhibition of Molt-4 cells with 58% inhibition at 25 mug/ml. Many common membrane receptors in activated PBMCs, Molt 4 and Jurkat cells were identified by lectin blotting. However, membrane receptors that are recognized by SRL in normal resting PBMCs were totally different and are high molecular weight glycoproteins. Treatment of membrane receptors with glycosidases prior to lectin probing, revealed that fucosylated Thomsen-Friedenreich(TF) antigen glycans are increasingly expressed on transformed Molt-4 leukemic cells compared to other cells. The findings highlight the opposite effects of SRL on transformed and normal hematopoietic cells by recognizing different glycan-receptors. SRL has promising potential for diagnostics and therapeutic applications in leukaemia.","['Chachadi, Vishwanath B', 'Pujari, Radha', 'Shastry, Padma', 'Swamy, Bale M', 'Inamdar, Shashikala R']","['Chachadi VB', 'Pujari R', 'Shastry P', 'Swamy BM', 'Inamdar SR']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1999-1900'],"['Post Graduate Department of studies in Biochemistry, Karnatak University, Dharwad, Karnataka, 580003, India.', 'National Centre for Cell Science, Ganeshkhind, Pune, 411007, India.', 'National Centre for Cell Science, Ganeshkhind, Pune, 411007, India.', 'Post Graduate Department of studies in Biochemistry, Karnatak University, Dharwad, Karnataka, 580003, India.', 'Post Graduate Department of studies in Biochemistry, Karnatak University, Dharwad, Karnataka, 580003, India. srinamdar2009@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200104,United States,Glycoconj J,Glycoconjugate journal,8603310,IM,,"['Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Basidiomycota/*chemistry', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fungal Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lectins/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Binding']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Leukemia', '*PBMCs', '*Sclerotium rolfsii lectin', '*TF antigen and Glycosidases']",2020/01/05 06:00,2021/02/03 06:00,['2020/01/05 06:00'],"['2019/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10719-019-09905-y [doi]', '10.1007/s10719-019-09905-y [pii]']",ppublish,Glycoconj J. 2020 Apr;37(2):251-261. doi: 10.1007/s10719-019-09905-y.

Most sialic acids are widely expressed in animal cells and they bind to siglec proteins. In this study, we demonstrate that 3SL specifically binds to CD33. It induces megakaryocyte differentiation and subsequent apoptosis by targeting cell surface protein siglec-3 (CD33) in human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells. The 3SL-bound CD33 was internalized to the cytosol via caveolae-dependent endocytosis. At the molecular level, 3SL-bound CD33 recruits the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP1). SOCS3 is degraded with CD33 by proteasome degradation, while SHP-1 activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) to induce megakaryocytic differentiation and subsequent apoptosis. The present study, therefore, suggests that 3SL is a potential anti-leukemia agent affecting differentiation and apoptosis.","['Ha, Sun-Hyung', 'Kwak, Choong-Hwan', 'Park, Jun-Young', 'Abekura, Fukushi', 'Lee, Young-Choon', 'Kim, Jong-Suk', 'Chung, Tae-Wook', 'Kim, Cheorl-Ho']","['Ha SH', 'Kwak CH', 'Park JY', 'Abekura F', 'Lee YC', 'Kim JS', 'Chung TW', 'Kim CH']",,"['Molecular and Cellular Glycobiology Unit, Department of Biological Sciences, SungKyunKwan University, 300 Chunchun-Dong, Jangan-Gu, Suwon City, Kyunggi-Do, 440-746, South Korea.', 'School of Korean Medicine, Healthy Aging Korean Medical Research Center, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Gyeongsangnam-do, 50612, Republic of Korea.', 'Molecular and Cellular Glycobiology Unit, Department of Biological Sciences, SungKyunKwan University, 300 Chunchun-Dong, Jangan-Gu, Suwon City, Kyunggi-Do, 440-746, South Korea.', 'Molecular and Cellular Glycobiology Unit, Department of Biological Sciences, SungKyunKwan University, 300 Chunchun-Dong, Jangan-Gu, Suwon City, Kyunggi-Do, 440-746, South Korea.', 'Faculty of Medicinal Biotechnology, Dong-A University, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute for Medical Sciences, Chonbuk National University Medical School, 567 Baekje-daero, Deokjin-gu, Jeonju, 54896, South Korea.', 'School of Korean Medicine, Healthy Aging Korean Medical Research Center, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Gyeongsangnam-do, 50612, Republic of Korea. twchung@pusan.ac.kr.', 'Molecular and Cellular Glycobiology Unit, Department of Biological Sciences, SungKyunKwan University, 300 Chunchun-Dong, Jangan-Gu, Suwon City, Kyunggi-Do, 440-746, South Korea. chkimbio@skku.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200104,United States,Glycoconj J,Glycoconjugate journal,8603310,IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Endocytosis', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism', 'Oligosaccharides/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/*metabolism', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"[""*3'-sialyllactose"", '*Apoptosis', '*CD33', '*Cancer', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Differentiation', '*SIGLEC-3']",2020/01/05 06:00,2021/02/03 06:00,['2020/01/05 06:00'],"['2019/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10719-019-09902-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s10719-019-09902-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Glycoconj J. 2020 Apr;37(2):187-200. doi: 10.1007/s10719-019-09902-1.

CASE PRESENTATION: We present a rare case of isolated myeloid sarcoma of the small bowel in a 54-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital with repeated symptoms of intestinal obstruction. A small bowel series via an ileus tube revealed severe jejunal obstruction. Computed tomography revealed that the obstruction was likely caused by a jejunal tumor. The patient underwent laparoscopy-assisted partial resection of the jejunum with lymphadenectomy. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen confirmed that MS had been responsible for the obstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS require systemic chemotherapy, as do patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Hence, an early, accurate diagnosis is imperative for treating this malignancy. It is also important to list MS in the differential diagnosis of a small bowel tumor, even in nonleukemic patients.","['Mizumoto, Rie', 'Tsujie, Masanori', 'Wakasa, Tomoko', 'Kitani, Kotaro', 'Manabe, Hironobu', 'Fukuda, Shuichi', 'Okada, Kaoru', 'Satoi, Shumpei', 'Ishikawa, Hajime', 'Kawasaki, Toshihiko', 'Hanamoto, Hitoshi', 'Yukawa, Masao', 'Inoue, Masatoshi']","['Mizumoto R', 'Tsujie M', 'Wakasa T', 'Kitani K', 'Manabe H', 'Fukuda S', 'Okada K', 'Satoi S', 'Ishikawa H', 'Kawasaki T', 'Hanamoto H', 'Yukawa M', 'Inoue M']",,"['Department of Surgery, Kindai University Nara Hospital, 1248-1 Otoda, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Kindai University Nara Hospital, 1248-1 Otoda, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Kindai University Nara Hospital, 1248-1 Otoda, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Kindai University Nara Hospital, 1248-1 Otoda, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Kindai University Nara Hospital, 1248-1 Otoda, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Kindai University Nara Hospital, 1248-1 Otoda, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Kindai University Nara Hospital, 1248-1 Otoda, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Kindai University Nara Hospital, 1248-1 Otoda, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Kindai University Nara Hospital, 1248-1 Otoda, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kindai University Nara Hospital, 1248-1 Otoda, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kindai University Nara Hospital, 1248-1 Otoda, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Kindai University Nara Hospital, 1248-1 Otoda, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0293, Japan. myukawa@med.kindai.ac.jp.', 'Department of Surgery, Kindai University Nara Hospital, 1248-1 Otoda, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0293, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200103,Germany,Surg Case Rep,Surgical case reports,101662125,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'Intestine', 'Myeloid sarcoma']",2020/01/05 06:00,2020/01/05 06:01,['2020/01/05 06:00'],"['2019/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40792-019-0759-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s40792-019-0759-6 [pii]']",epublish,Surg Case Rep. 2020 Jan 3;6(1):2. doi: 10.1186/s40792-019-0759-6.,PMC6942080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the immunophenotypic features of this sort of leukemic cells remain to be unclarified. We retrospectively analyzed the immunophenotype of 283 newly diagnosed AML patients with intermediated and poor cytogenetic risk to evaluate the correlation between phenotype and WT1 overexpression. EVI1 transcripts, KMT2A-PTD, FLT3-ITD, and NPM1 mutations were simultaneously assessed. Our results revealed that overexpressed WT1 was significantly associated with the expression of CD117, CD13, and CD123. Besides, leukemic cells with WT1 overexpression also lacked lymphoid and myeloid differentiation-related markers. FAB subtype M2 patients had higher WT1 levels, compared with other FAB subtype. Multivariate analysis was proved that NPM1 mutation, M2 subtype, and the expression of CD123 were independently associated with WT1 overexpression. These indicated that AML with overexpressed WT1 was proliferated and blocked in the early stage of AML development. It presumably provided some clues to detect overexpressed WT1 cells via multiparameter flow cytometry. CD123-targeted drugs might become one of the alternative treatments for patients with WT1 overexpression.","['Wang, Xiao-Rui', 'Chang, Yan', 'Yuan, Xiao-Ying', 'Wang, Ya-Zhe', 'Qin, Ya-Zhen', 'Ruan, Guo-Rui', 'Lai, Yue-Yun', 'Liu, Yan-Rong']","['Wang XR', 'Chang Y', 'Yuan XY', 'Wang YZ', 'Qin YZ', 'Ruan GR', 'Lai YY', 'Liu YR']",,"['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South St, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South St, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South St, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South St, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South St, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South St, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South St, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South St, Beijing, 100044, China. yrliu163@163.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200104,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Risk Factors', 'WT1 Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CD123', 'Immunophenotype', 'NPM1 mutation', 'WT1 expression']",2020/01/05 06:00,2020/01/30 06:00,['2020/01/05 06:00'],"['2019/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-019-03808-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-019-03808-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Feb;99(2):215-221. doi: 10.1007/s00277-019-03808-6.

Through its interaction with cereblon, a substrate receptor for the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, pomalidomide leads to selective ubiquitination of transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros thereby promoting immune modulation. In this phase I trial, 51 newly diagnosed non-favorable risk AML and high-risk MDS patients were enrolled and treated with AcDVP16 (cytarabine 667 mg/m(2)/day IV continuous infusion days 1-3, daunorubicin 45 mg/m(2) IV days 1-3, etoposide 400 mg/m(2) IV days 8-10) induction therapy followed by dose- and duration-escalation pomalidomide beginning at early lymphocyte recovery. Forty-three patients (AML: n = 39, MDS: n = 4) received pomalidomide. The maximum tolerated dose of pomalidomide was 4 mg for 21 consecutive days. The overall complete remission (CR + CRi) rate, median overall survival, and disease-free survival were 75%, 27.1 and 20.6 months, respectively. Subset analyses revealed 86% CR/CRi rate in AML patients with unfavorable-risk karyotype treated with pomalidomide. Pomalidomide significantly decreased Aiolos expression in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) peripheral blood and bone marrow T cells, promoted T cell differentiation, proliferation, and heightened their cytokine production. Finally, pomalidomide induced distinct gene expression changes in immune function-related ontologies in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells.","['Zeidner, Joshua F', 'Knaus, Hanna A', 'Zeidan, Amer M', 'Blackford, Amanda L', 'Montiel-Esparza, Raul', 'Hackl, Hubert', 'Prince, Gabrielle T', 'Gondek, Lukasz P', 'Ghiaur, Gabriel', 'Showel, Margaret M', 'DeZern, Amy E', 'Pratz, Keith W', 'Douglas Smith, B', 'Levis, Mark J', 'Gore, Steven', 'Coombs, Catherine C', 'Foster, Matthew C', 'Streicher, Howard', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Luznik, Leo', 'Gojo, Ivana']","['Zeidner JF', 'Knaus HA', 'Zeidan AM', 'Blackford AL', 'Montiel-Esparza R', 'Hackl H', 'Prince GT', 'Gondek LP', 'Ghiaur G', 'Showel MM', 'DeZern AE', 'Pratz KW', 'Douglas Smith B', 'Levis MJ', 'Gore S', 'Coombs CC', 'Foster MC', 'Streicher H', 'Karp JE', 'Luznik L', 'Gojo I']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9014-1514', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4055-3841', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0473-6982']","['University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Medicine I Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Division of Bioinformatics, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA. igojo1@jhmi.edu.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200103,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hexosamines/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*administration & dosage', 'Immunomodulation/drug effects', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/05 06:00,2020/10/08 06:00,['2020/01/05 06:00'],"['2019/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0693-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0693-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Jun;34(6):1563-1576. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0693-4.

Mucositis of the gastrointestinal tract is a common side effect in patients under chemotherapy. Anticancer drug busulfan, used for treating chronic myeloid leukemia especially in pediatric patients, causes mucositis of the gastrointestinal tract. Alginate oligosaccharides (AOS) are natural products with attractive pharmaceutical potentials. We aimed to investigate, at the single-cell level, AOS preventing small intestine mucositis induced by busulfan. We found that busulfan disturbed the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria of cells in the small intestine, damaged cell membranes especially cell junctions, and disrupted microvilli; all of which were rescued by AOS. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and functional enrichment analysis showed that AOS could recover small intestinal function. Deep analysis found that AOS improved the expression of transcriptional factors which explained AOS regulating gene expression to improve small intestine function. Further investigation in IPEC-J2 cells found that AOS acts its function through mannose receptor signaling pathway. Moreover, the improved blood metabolome confirmed small intestinal function was recovered by AOS. As a natural product with many advantages, AOS could be developed to assist in the recovery of intestinal functions in patients undergoing anticancer chemotherapy or other treatments.","['Zhao, Yong', 'Feng, Yanni', 'Liu, Ming', 'Chen, Liang', 'Meng, Qingshi', 'Tang, Xiangfang', 'Wang, Shukun', 'Liu, Lei', 'Li, Lan', 'Shen, Wei', 'Zhang, Hongfu']","['Zhao Y', 'Feng Y', 'Liu M', 'Chen L', 'Meng Q', 'Tang X', 'Wang S', 'Liu L', 'Li L', 'Shen W', 'Zhang H']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Institute of Animal Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100193, P.

Viburnum grandiflorum is a medicinal herb known for its wide spectrum of pharmacological activities, but its anti-cancer properties against lung cancer cells have not been previously investigated. The present study elucidated the antitumor effect and associated mechanism of methanol extract of Viburnum grandiflorum extract (VGE) against lung cancer cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS The viability of H1650, HCC827, and H1299 cells was measured using MTT assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle progression were determined by flow cytometry using annexin-V/PI and JC-1 stains, respectively. The Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) was used for transfection of caspase-9 plasmid to H1650 and H1299 cells. RESULTS The results showed decreased H1650, HCC827, and H1299 cell viability by VGE, which occurred in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The VGE treatment significantly increased the rate of apoptosis in H1650 (P<0.05) and H1299 (P<0.02) cells at 48 and 72 h. Treatment of H1650 and H1299 cells with 10 microM of VGE significantly enhanced the number of cells in sub-G1 phase. The VGE treatment cleaved pro-caspase-8/-9 and-3 in H1650 and HCC827 cells at 72 h. The VGE treatment of H1650 and HCC827 cells reduced Mcl-1 protein expression. Treatment of H1650 and HCC827 cells with VGE markedly decreased the level of p-Akt. However, dominant-negative caspase-9 (caspase-9 dN) plasmid transfection prevented the viability-inhibitory effect of VGE on H1650 and HCC827 cells. Treatment of H1650 and HCC827 cells with VGE increased levels of cytochrome c in the cytosol. CONCLUSIONS VGE inhibited lung carcinoma cell viability by apoptosis activation through a caspase-dependent pathway. Therefore, VGE is a potent anti-cancer agent against lung cancer cells.","['Han, Bing', 'Wu, Jianqiang', 'Huang, Lei']","['Han B', 'Wu J', 'Huang L']",,"[""Department of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, People's Hospital of Deyang City, Deyang, Sichuan, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, People's Hospital of Deyang City, Deyang, Sichuan, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, People's Hospital of Deyang City, Deyang, Sichuan, China (mainland).""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200104,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Viburnum/*metabolism']",,,2020/01/05 06:00,2020/06/06 06:00,['2020/01/05 06:00'],"['2020/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [medline]']","['920265 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.920265 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2020 Jan 4;26:e920265. doi: 10.12659/MSM.920265.,PMC6977709,,,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to improved oncological treatment and cancer survival rates, quality of life considerations post-treatment have become an important aspect in the treatment regime. The ability to have their own biological children is considered one of the most important indicators of quality of life by cancer survivors. As fertility following oncological treatment is often impaired, fertility preservation methods should be offered to these patients prior to the treatment. Here, we present a very rare case in which we can in vivo observe the impact of oncological treatment on female fertility when applied before and after puberty. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a very rare case of concordant AML in monozygotic twin sisters. Twin A became sick at the age of 21 months. She was treated with cytostatic medications and then underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT), the donor being her twin sister B. After 27 years, she is disease free and has regular periods. After trying to conceive for 4 years, she was seen by an infertility specialist. She underwent hysteroscopic uterine septum removal and laparoscopic enucleation of bilateral paraovarian cysts. Following those procedures, she immediately conceived naturally. Twin B became sick at 15 years of age. She was treated with chemotherapy and cranial radiation and relapsed after 10 years. She then received chemotherapy and had a BMT. Until relapse, she had normal menstrual cycles. After the second treatment she became amenorrhoeic and is now part of an oocyte donation program. CONCLUSIONS: This is a case of AML in monozygotic twins who, after treatment, have completely different reproductive potential. They both received oncological treatment, and one of them conceived conceived naturally while the other suffered premature ovarian failure and is not able to have a biological child. Based on the outcome of this case, it appears that the pre-pubertal state truly serves as protection against ovarian failure.","['Burnik Papler, Tanja', 'Vrtacnik Bokal, Eda', 'Jancar, Nina']","['Burnik Papler T', 'Vrtacnik Bokal E', 'Jancar N']",,"['Department of Human Reproduction, Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Medical Center Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia. papler.tanja@telemach.net.', 'Department of Human Reproduction, Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Medical Center Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Human Reproduction, Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Medical Center Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20200103,England,J Ovarian Res,Journal of ovarian research,101474849,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Fertility/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Oocyte Donation', 'Pregnancy', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/physiopathology', 'Quality of Life', 'Reproduction/*physiology', '*Siblings', '*Twins, Monozygotic']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cancer treatment', 'Fertility preservation', 'Premature ovarian failure', 'Twins']",2020/01/05 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/01/05 06:00'],"['2019/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13048-019-0607-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s13048-019-0607-0 [pii]']",epublish,J Ovarian Res. 2020 Jan 3;13(1):2. doi: 10.1186/s13048-019-0607-0.,PMC6941239,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, tumor cells recruit immunosuppressive cells [including regulatory T-cells (Treg), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC)] and express factors such as PD-L1. Molecularly targeted therapies, such as imatinib, have off-target effects that may influence immune function. Imatinib has been shown to modulate multiple cell types involved in anti-cancer immune surveillance, with potentially detrimental or favorable outcomes. Imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) have dramatically changed disease course. Our study aimed to characterize the different populations of the immune system in patients with CML affected by their treatment. METHODS: Forty-one patients with CML [33 treated with TKIs and 8 with TKIs plus interferon (IFN)-alpha] and 20 controls were enrolled in the present study. Peripheral blood populations of the immune system [referred to as the overview of immune system (OVIS) panel, Treg cells and MDSCs] and PD-1 expression were evaluated by flow cytometry. The immunological profile was assessed using the mRNA Pan-Cancer Immune Profiling Panel and a NanoString nCounter FLEX platform. RESULTS: Patients receiving combination therapy (TKIs + IFN-alpha) had lower numbers of lymphocytes, particularly T cells [838/microL (95% CI 594-1182)] compared with healthy controls [1500/microL (95% CI 1207 - 1865), p = 0.017]. These patients also had a higher percentage of Treg (9.1%) and CD4(+)PD-1(+) cells (1.65%) compared with controls [Treg (6.1%) and CD4(+)/PD-1(+)(0.8%); p </= 0.05]. Moreover, patients treated with TKIs had more Mo-MDSCs (12.7%) whereas those treated with TKIs + IFN-alpha had more Gr-MDSC (21.3%) compared to controls [Mo-MDSC (11.4%) and Gr-MDSC (8.48%); p </= 0.05]. CD56(bright) NK cells, a cell subset endowed with immune-regulatory properties, were increased in patients receiving TKIs plus IFN-alpha compared with those treated with TKIs alone. Interestingly, serum IL-21 was significantly lower in the TKIs plus IFN-alpha cohort. Within the group of patients treated with TKI monotherapy, we observed that individuals receiving 2nd generation TKIs had lower percentages of CD4(+) Treg (3.63%) and Gr-MDSC (4.2%) compared to patients under imatinib treatment (CD4(+) Treg 6.18% and Gr-MDSC 8.2%), but higher levels of PD-1-co-expressing CD4(+) cells (1.92%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that TKIs in combination with IFN-alpha may promote an enhanced immune suppressive state.","['Alves, Raquel', 'McArdle, Stephanie E B', 'Vadakekolathu, Jayakumar', 'Goncalves, Ana Cristina', 'Freitas-Tavares, Paulo', 'Pereira, Amelia', 'Almeida, Antonio M', 'Sarmento-Ribeiro, Ana Bela', 'Rutella, Sergio']","['Alves R', 'McArdle SEB', 'Vadakekolathu J', 'Goncalves AC', 'Freitas-Tavares P', 'Pereira A', 'Almeida AM', 'Sarmento-Ribeiro AB', 'Rutella S']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1970-7375'],"['Laboratory of Oncobiology and Hematology and University Clinic of Hematology/Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra (FMUC), Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research (iCBR) - Group of Environment Genetics and Oncobiology (CIMAGO), FMUC, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Center for Innovative Biomedicine and Biotechnology (CIBB), University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Clifton Campus, Nottingham, NG11 8NS, UK.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Clifton Campus, Nottingham, NG11 8NS, UK.', 'Laboratory of Oncobiology and Hematology and University Clinic of Hematology/Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra (FMUC), Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research (iCBR) - Group of Environment Genetics and Oncobiology (CIMAGO), FMUC, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Center for Innovative Biomedicine and Biotechnology (CIBB), University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Clinical Hematology Department, Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Coimbra (CHUC), Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research (iCBR) - Group of Environment Genetics and Oncobiology (CIMAGO), FMUC, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Internal Medicine Service, Hospital Distrital da Figueira da Foz (HDFF), Figueira da Foz, Portugal.', 'Hospital da Luz, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'CIIS (Centro de Investigacao Interdisciplinar em Saude, Universidade Catolica Portuguesa de Lisboa), Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Laboratory of Oncobiology and Hematology and University Clinic of Hematology/Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra (FMUC), Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research (iCBR) - Group of Environment Genetics and Oncobiology (CIMAGO), FMUC, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Center for Innovative Biomedicine and Biotechnology (CIBB), University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Clinical Hematology Department, Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Coimbra (CHUC), Coimbra, Portugal.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Clifton Campus, Nottingham, NG11 8NS, UK. sergio.rutella@ntu.ac.uk.', 'Centre for Health, Ageing and Understanding Disease (CHAUD), School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK. sergio.rutella@ntu.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200103,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,IM,,"['Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Transcriptome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Gene expression profiling', '*Immune monitoring', '*Immunotherapy', '*Interferon']",2020/01/05 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/01/05 06:00'],"['2019/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-019-02194-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-019-02194-x [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2020 Jan 3;18(1):2. doi: 10.1186/s12967-019-02194-x.,PMC6941328,,,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disturbed epigenetic regulation causes perturbations in the blood cell differentiation program that results in various types of haematopoietic disorders. Thus, accurate epigenetic regulation is essential for functional haematopoiesis. In this study, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 screening approach to identify new epigenetic regulators in myeloid differentiation. We designed a Chromatin-UMI CRISPR guide library targeting 1092 epigenetic regulators. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment of the chronic myeloid leukaemia cell line K-562 was used as a megakaryocytic myeloid differentiation model.

Currently known as oncomiR, real databases are collecting all the smaller fragments of RNA capable of participating in the oncogenesis. AIMS: With the aim to collect for the first time the most important acquisitions in literature about antagomiRs in oncology, our narrative review is born with the purpose of showing that specific antisense oligonucleotides, capable to bind and antagonise single or multiple miRNAs, are effective as therapeutic compounds. RESULTS: Peptide or locked nucleic acids, miRNA sponges or antagomiRs attached to plasmid or lentiviral vectors carrying miRNA sequences to its target are objects of our analysis, demonstrating their effectiveness in a large number and types of tumours. We have also tried how to overcome their high immunogenicity, which remains its greatest limit for clinical use. CONCLUSIONS: They are ambitious but fascinating promise to alter the promotion of the tumour growth by binding specific molecular targets, with high precision and low toxicity, leaving the scientists the chance of development as anti-cancer drugs and not just.","['Innao, Vanessa', 'Allegra, Alessandro', 'Pulvirenti, Nicolina', 'Allegra, Andrea Gaetano', 'Musolino, Caterina']","['Innao V', 'Allegra A', 'Pulvirenti N', 'Allegra AG', 'Musolino C']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7596-1912', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6156-8239']","['Division of Hematology, Dipartimento di Patologia Umana dell\'Adulto e dell\'Eta Evolutiva ""Gaetano Barresi"", University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Dipartimento di Patologia Umana dell\'Adulto e dell\'Eta Evolutiva ""Gaetano Barresi"", University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Dipartimento di Patologia Umana dell\'Adulto e dell\'Eta Evolutiva ""Gaetano Barresi"", University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Dipartimento di Patologia Umana dell\'Adulto e dell\'Eta Evolutiva ""Gaetano Barresi"", University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Dipartimento di Patologia Umana dell\'Adulto e dell\'Eta Evolutiva ""Gaetano Barresi"", University of Messina, Messina, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200103,England,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),European journal of cancer care,9301979,,,"['Antagomirs/*therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['antagomir', 'cancer', 'leukaemia', 'miRNA', 'therapy']",2020/01/04 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/01/04 06:00'],"['2019/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ecc.13208 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2020 Mar;29(2):e13208. doi: 10.1111/ecc.13208.

We registered 199 newly diagnosed de novo CBF-AML patients, aged 16 to 64 years, who achieved complete remission. They received 3 courses of high-dose cytarabine therapy and no further treatment until hematological relapse. Mutations in exons 8, 10-11, and 17 of the KIT gene were analyzed. Furthermore, we analyzed mutations in 56 genes that are frequently identified in myeloid malignancies and evaluated minimal residual disease (MRD). The primary end point was relapse-free survival (RFS) according to KIT mutations. The RFS in KIT-mutated patients was inferior to that in unmutated patients (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.00; P = .003). Based on subgroup analysis, KIT mutations had a prognostic impact in patients with RUNX1-RUNX1T1, but not in those with CBFB-MYH11, and only exon 17 mutation had a significant prognostic impact. Multivariate Cox regression analysis with stepwise selection revealed that the KIT exon 17 mutation and the presence of extramedullary tumors in patients with RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and loss of chromosome X or Y and NRAS mutation in patients with CBFB-MYH11 were poor prognostic factors for RFS. MRD was evaluated in 112 patients, and it was associated with a poorer RFS in the patients with CBFB-MYH11, but not in those with RUNX1-RUNX1T1. These results suggested that it is necessary to separately evaluate AML with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or CBFB-MYH11 according to appropriate prognostic factors.

To refine the 2014 NIH response algorithm, we analyzed multicenter prospective observational data from the Chronic GVHD Consortium. The training cohort included 209 patients and the replication cohort included 191 patients with joint/fascia involvement during their course of chronic GVHD. Linear mixed models with random patient effect were used to evaluate correlations between response categories and clinician- or patient-perceived changes in joint status as an anchor of response. Analysis of the training cohort showed that a 2-point change in total photographic range of motion (P-ROM) score was clinically meaningful. The results also suggested that a change from 0 to 1 on the NIH joint/fascia score should not be considered as worsening and suggested that both the NIH joint/fascia score and total P-ROM score, but not individual P-ROM scores, should be used for response assessment. On the basis of these results, we developed an evidence-based refined algorithm, the utility of which was examined in an independent replication cohort. Using the refined algorithm, approximately 40% of responses were reclassified, largely mitigating most divergent responses among individual joints and changes from 0 to 1 on the NIH joint/fascia score. The refined algorithm showed robust point estimates and tighter 95% confidence intervals associated with clinician- or patient-perceived changes, compared with the 2014 NIH algorithm. The refined algorithm provides a superior, evidence-based method for measuring therapeutic response in joint/fascia chronic GVHD.","['Inamoto, Yoshihiro', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Onstad, Lynn E', 'Flowers, Mary E D', 'Hamilton, Betty K', 'Jagasia, Madan H', 'Martin, Paul J', 'Pavletic, Steven Z', 'Pidala, Joseph A', 'Pusic, Iskra', 'Vogelsang, Georgia B', 'Wolff, Daniel', 'Carpenter, Paul A']","['Inamoto Y', 'Lee SJ', 'Onstad LE', 'Flowers MED', 'Hamilton BK', 'Jagasia MH', 'Martin PJ', 'Pavletic SZ', 'Pidala JA', 'Pusic I', 'Vogelsang GB', 'Wolff D', 'Carpenter PA']",,"['Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute/Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, H.

Such therapies, including blinatumomab and CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CD19CAR) T cells, yield high remission rates and can bridge to more definitive consolidation therapy with curative intent. Both treatments are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for r/r ALL (CD19CAR T-cell approval is restricted to patients </=25 years old). Although availability of blinatumomab and CD19CAR T cells has extended options for the treatment of r/r ALL, prioritizing the sequence of these agents on an individual-patient basis may be difficult for the treating physician. Considering each therapy's advantages, limitations, and challenges is necessary when choosing between them. Although patients may receive both blinatumomab and CD19CAR T cells sequentially in cases that fail to respond or subsequently relapse, a proportion of patients treated with CD19-targeted immunotherapy will lose expression of CD19 and will be excluded from receiving the alternative CD19-targeted therapy. Thus, weighing all considerations for each patient before selecting a CD19-targeted immunotherapy is crucial. Here, we discuss real-life scenarios of adults with r/r ALL, in which we selected either blinatumomab or CD19CAR T-cell therapy, and the rationale behind each decision.","['Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Forman, Stephen J']","['Aldoss I', 'Forman SJ']",,"['Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects/methods', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/04 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/01/04 06:00'],"['2019/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)62185-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019002132 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Mar 12;135(11):804-813. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019002132.,,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combination strategies that improve CAR T-cell potency, limit tumor environment-mediated immune dysfunction, and directly reduce tumor burden may increase the potential for durable clinical benefit of CAR T-cell therapy. Lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) is a product therapy candidate being tested in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This study assessed the in vitro and in vivo functionality of CAR T cells transduced to express the anti-CD19 CAR of liso-cel in combination with ibrutinib or acalabrutinib. In prolonged stimulation assays, the presence of ibrutinib or acalabrutinib improved the CAR T-cell effector function. RNA-Seq analysis and surface marker profiling of these CAR T cells treated with ibrutinib but not acalabrutinib revealed gene expression changes consistent with skewing toward a memory-like, type 1 T-helper, Bruton tyrosine kinase phenotype. Ibrutinib or acalabrutinib improved CD19 tumor clearance and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice when used in combination with CAR T cells. A combination of the defined cell product therapy candidate, liso-cel, with ibrutinib or acalabrutinib is an attractive approach that may potentiate the promising clinical responses already achieved in CD19 B-cell malignancies with each of these single agents.","['Qin, Jim S', 'Johnstone, Timothy G', 'Baturevych, Alex', 'Hause, Ronald J', 'Ragan, Seamus P', 'Clouser, Christopher R', 'Jones, Jon C', 'Ponce, Rafael', 'Krejsa, Cecile M', 'Salmon, Ruth A', 'Ports, Michael O']","['Qin JS', 'Johnstone TG', 'Baturevych A', 'Hause RJ', 'Ragan SP', 'Clouser CR', 'Jones JC', 'Ponce R', 'Krejsa CM', 'Salmon RA', 'Ports MO']",,"['Juno Therapeutics, a Celgene Company, Seattle, WA.', 'Juno Therapeutics, a Celgene Company, Seattle, WA.', 'Juno Therapeutics, a Celgene Company, Seattle, WA.', 'Juno Therapeutics, a Celgene Company, Seattle, WA.', 'Juno Therapeutics, a Celgene Company, Seattle, WA.', 'Juno Therapeutics, a Celgene Company, Seattle, WA.', 'Juno Therapeutics, a Celgene Company, Seattle, WA.', 'Juno Therapeutics, a Celgene Company, Seattle, WA.', 'Acerta Pharma, a member of the AstraZeneca Group, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Juno Therapeutics, a Celgene Company, Seattle, WA.', 'Juno Therapeutics, a Celgene Company, Seattle, WA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,IM,,"['Adenine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage', 'Biomarkers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/etiology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Piperidines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2020/01/04 06:00,2021/07/23 06:00,['2020/01/04 06:00'],"['2020/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CJI.0000000000000307 [doi]', '00002371-202005000-00001 [pii]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2020 May;43(4):107-120. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0000000000000307.,PMC7144752,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'I42748ELQW (acalabrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that intrauterine transmission of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) increased the embryo implantation rate. In this study using B6D2F1 (C57BL/6 x DBA2) mice, a fragment of the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Gm-csf) gene was cloned into an enhanced green fluorescent protein vector (pEGFP-N1) and then transfected into PBMC. The protein level of GM-CSF was evaluated in the transfected PBMC and untransfected PBMC by ELISA. Attachment of mouse embryos and the mRNA expression levels of leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif), vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp9), Gmcsf-receptor (Gmcsf-r) and interleukin 6 (Il6) in vitro were assessed by real-time PCR in endometrial cells. To determine the pregnancy rate and number of implantation sites in vivo, the mouse uterine horns were analyzed on Day 7.5 post coitum.

PT/Cy-haplo can give more patients the opportunity to undergo allo-HCT, because most patients have multiple available HLA-haploidentical related donor candidates. The optimal donor selection algorithm in the PT/Cy-haplo setting has not yet been established, however. To contribute to the establishment of a donor selection formula based on disease status and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genotype, we retrospectively analyzed 91 patients who underwent PT/Cy-haplo at our institution. In both patients and donors, HLA allele genotyping was performed for HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1, and 16 KIR genes were genotyped. Patients in complete remission (CR) who underwent PT/Cy-haplo from a KIR2DS1-positive donor had a significantly lower cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) than those who underwent PT/Cy-haplo from a KIR2DS1-negative donor (1-year CIR: 0% versus 32.6%, P = .037; 2-year CIR: 9.2% versus 42%, P = .037). Moreover, PT/Cy-haplo from a KIR2DS1-positive donor was significantly associated with improved overall survival (OS) (1-year OS: 91.7% versus 58.7%, P = .010; 2-year OS: 83% versus 34%, P = .010). In contrast, in non-CR individuals, PT/Cy-haplo from KIR2DS1-positive donors did not significantly improve CIR or OS (1-year CIR: 56.5% versus 64.7%, P = .973; 2-year CIR: not reached versus 64.7%, Pnot evaluable; 1-year OS: 25.4% versus 20.6%, P = .418; 2-year OS: 5.1% versus 20.6%, P = .418). In addition, lower infused CD34(+) cell dose, female-to-male transplantation, and acute myelogenous leukemia were significantly associated with increased risk of relapse and mortality. This study demonstrates that graft-versus-leukemia/tumor effects were exerted through donor KIR2DS1 at PT/Cy-haplo when patients have low tumor burdens. It would be worth examining the inclusion of donor KIR genotyping and disease status assessment in establishing optimal donor selection criteria for PT/Cy-haplo.","['Ido, Kentaro', 'Koh, Hideo', 'Hirose, Asao', 'Okamura, Hiroshi', 'Koh, Shiro', 'Nanno, Satoru', 'Nishimoto, Mitsutaka', 'Nakamae, Mika', 'Nakashima, Yasuhiro', 'Nakane, Takahiko', 'Hino, Masayuki', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa']","['Ido K', 'Koh H', 'Hirose A', 'Okamura H', 'Koh S', 'Nanno S', 'Nishimoto M', 'Nakamae M', 'Nakashima Y', 'Nakane T', 'Hino M', 'Nakamae H']",,"['Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.

HOTAIRM1 (HOXA transcript antisense RNA, myeloid-specific 1) plays an indispensable role in the development of AML. Hydroquinone (HQ) is one major metabolite of benzene and its ideal replacement in toxicology research. But the influence of benzene or HQ on HOTAIRM1 expression in AML associated pathway is still unclear. In the TK6 cells with short-term exposure to HQ (HQ-ST cells) or long term HQ exposure induced malignant transformed TK6 cells (HQ-MT cells), the relationship between DNMT3b and HOTAIRM1 was explored. Comparing to counterparts, HOTAIRM1 expression was increased firstly and then decreased in HQ-ST cells, and definitely decreased in HQ-MT cells; while the expression change tendency of DNMT3b was in contrast to that of HOTAIRM1. Moreover, the average HOTAIRM1 expression of 17 paired workers being exposed to benzene within 1.5 years was increased, but that of the remaining 92 paired workers with longer exposure time was decreased. Furthermore, in 5-AzaC (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) or TSA (histone deacetylation inhibitor) treated HQ-MT cells, the expression of HOTAIRM1 was restored by reduced DNA promoter methylation levels. HQ-MT cells with DNMT3b knockout by CRISPR/Cas9 displayed the promoter hypomethylation and the increase of HOTAIRM1, also confirmed in benzene exposure workers. These suggest that long term exposure to HQ or benzene might induce the increase of DNMT3b expression and the promoter hypermethylation to silence the expression of HOTAIRM1, a possible tumor-suppressor in the AML associated carcinogenesis pathway.","['Zhang, Haiqiao', 'Yuan, Qian', 'Pan, Zhijie', 'Ling, Xiaoxuan', 'Tan, Qiang', 'Wu, Minhua', 'Zheng, Dongyan', 'Xie, Peien', 'Xie, Daxiao', 'Liu, Linhua']","['Zhang H', 'Yuan Q', 'Pan Z', 'Ling X', 'Tan Q', 'Wu M', 'Zheng D', 'Xie P', 'Xie D', 'Liu L']",,"['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China; Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China.', 'Foshan Institute of Occupational Disease Prevention and Control, Foshan, Guangdong, 528000, PR China.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, PR China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China.', 'Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China; Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China.

METHODS: From August 2016 to March 2017, 43 newly diagnosed patients were recruited, which included 15 anemia patients (benign hemopathy) and 28 patients with acute leukemia (AL) (malignant hemopathy). All patients underwent IVIM in the lumbar marrow and the D, D*, f values were measured. The microvessel density (MVD) and cellularity of marrow were calculated from the sample of iliac crest biopsy. Pearson correlation analysis was used to study the relationship between IVIM-derived and histology-derived parameters. We performed unpaired t test to analyze the differences of all parameters between AL and anemia. RESULT: The MVD was positively correlated with f in patients with AL, anemia and both of them (r=0.692, P<0.001; r=0.595, P=0.019; r=0.673, P<0.001, respectively). But there was no correlation between D* and MVD in three groups. D was not related to bone marrow cellularity (BMC) in all groups. In addition, the f and MVD were higher in AL than anemia (t=3.546, P=0.001; t=6.695, P<0.001, respectively). The BMC was significantly higher in AL than in anemia (t=3.330, P=0.004), but D and D* value had no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The blood volume fraction f was positively correlated with the histological features of marrow in hematological disorders, while f can show the difference of vascularity between benign and malignant marrow disease.","['Fan, Rong', 'Zhu, Hong', 'Niu, Jinliang', 'Li, Jianting', 'Zheng, Rong', 'Song, Xiaoli']","['Fan R', 'Zhu H', 'Niu J', 'Li J', 'Zheng R', 'Song X']",,"['Department of Radiology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, 382 Wuyi Road, Taiyuan, Shanxi, 030001, China.', ""Department of Radiology, Children's Hospital of Shanxi, 13 Xinmin North Street, Taiyuan, Shanxi, 030001, China."", 'Department of Radiology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, 382 Wuyi Road, Taiyuan, Shanxi, 030001, China.

Due to its rarity, there have been only two reports of the concurrent cases undergoing detailed genetic analysis with whole-exome sequencing (WES), and the possible clonal relationship between the both tumors remained not fully elucidated. METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing analysis of mediastinal GCT and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples obtained from one young Japanese male adult patient with concurrent both tumors, and investigated the possible clonal relationship between them. RESULTS: Sixteen somatic mutations were detected in the mediastinal GCT sample and 18 somatic mutations in the AML sample. Mutations in nine genes, including TP53 and PTEN both known as tumor suppressor genes, were shared in both tumors. CONCLUSIONS: All in our case and in the previous two cases with concurrent mediastinal GCT and AML undergoing with whole-exome sequencing analysis, TP53 and PTEN mutations were commonly shared in both tumors. These data not only suggest that these tumors share a common founding clone, but also indicate that associated mediastinal GCT and AML harboring TP53 and PTEN mutations represent a unique biological entity.","['Akizuki, Keiichi', 'Sekine, Masaaki', 'Kogure, Yasunori', 'Kameda, Takuro', 'Shide, Kotaro', 'Koya, Junji', 'Kamiunten, Ayako', 'Kubuki, Yoko', 'Tahira, Yuki', 'Hidaka, Tomonori', 'Kiwaki, Takumi', 'Tanaka, Hiroyuki', 'Sato, Yuichiro', 'Kataoka, Hiroaki', 'Kataoka, Keisuke', 'Shimoda, Kazuya']","['Akizuki K', 'Sekine M', 'Kogure Y', 'Kameda T', 'Shide K', 'Koya J', 'Kamiunten A', 'Kubuki Y', 'Tahira Y', 'Hidaka T', 'Kiwaki T', 'Tanaka H', 'Sato Y', 'Kataoka H', 'Kataoka K', 'Shimoda K']",,"['Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Section of Oncopathology and Regenerative Biology, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Section of Oncopathology and Regenerative Biology, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Section of Oncopathology and Regenerative Biology, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan. kshimoda@med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200102,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Clonal Evolution/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/diagnosis/*genetics', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics', 'Radiography, Thoracic', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Whole Exome Sequencing']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Germ cell tumor', 'PTEN', 'TP53']",2020/01/04 06:00,2020/06/11 06:00,['2020/01/04 06:00'],"['2019/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-6497-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-6497-0 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2020 Jan 2;20(1):5. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-6497-0.,PMC6941398,,"['30-A-1/National Cancer Center Research and Development Funds', '30-GH-3/Grant-in-Aid for Clinical Research from University of Miyazaki Hospital']","['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is probable that genetic perturbations other than EWS-FLI1 cooperate with it to produce the tumor. Sequencing studies identified STAG2 mutations in approximately 15% of cases in humans. In the present study, we hypothesize that loss of Stag2 cooperates with EWS-FLI1 in generating sarcomas derived from murine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). METHODS: Mice bearing an inducible EWS-FLI1 transgene were crossed to p53(-/-) mice in pure C57/Bl6 background. MSCs were derived from the bone marrow of the mice. EWS-FLI1 induction and Stag2 knockdown were achieved in vitro by adenovirus-Cre and shRNA-bearing pGIPZ lentiviral infection, respectively. The cells were then treated with ionizing radiation to 10 Gy. Anchorage independent growth in vitro was assessed by soft agar assays. Cellular migration and invasion were evaluated by transwell assays. Cells were injected with Matrigel intramuscularly into C57/Bl6 mice to test for tumor formation. RESULTS: Primary murine MSCs with the genotype EWS-FLI1 p53(-/-) were resistant to transformation and did not form tumors in syngeneic mice without irradiation. Stag2 inhibition increased the efficiency and speed of sarcoma formation significantly in irradiated EWS-FLI1 p53(-/-) MSCs. The efficiency of tumor formation was 91% for cells in mice injected with Stag2-repressed cells and 22% for mice receiving cells without Stag2 inhibition (p < .001). Stag2 knockdown reduced survival of mice in Kaplan-Meier analysis (p < .001). It also increased MSC migration and invasion in vitro but did not affect proliferation rate or aneuploidy. CONCLUSION: Loss of Stag2 has a synergistic effect with EWS-FLI1 in the production of sarcomas from murine MSCs, but the mechanism may not relate to increased proliferation or chromosomal instability. Primary murine MSCs are resistant to transformation, and the combination of p53 null mutation, EWS-FLI1, and Stag2 inhibition does not confer immediate conversion of MSCs to sarcomas. Irradiation is necessary in this model, suggesting that perturbations of other genes beside Stag2 and p53 are likely to be essential in the development of EWS-FLI1-driven sarcomas from MSCs.","['El Beaino, Marc', 'Liu, Jiayong', 'Wasylishen, Amanda R', 'Pourebrahim, Rasoul', 'Migut, Agata', 'Bessellieu, Bryan J', 'Huang, Ke', 'Lin, Patrick P']","['El Beaino M', 'Liu J', 'Wasylishen AR', 'Pourebrahim R', 'Migut A', 'Bessellieu BJ', 'Huang K', 'Lin PP']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1460-4994'],"['Department of Orthopaedic Oncology - Unit 1448, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Bone and Soft Tissue Tumor, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, 52 Fu-Cheng Road, Hai-Dian District, Beijing, 100142, China.', 'Department of Genetics - Unit 1010, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia - Unit 428, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Oncology - Unit 1448, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Oncology - Unit 1448, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Oncology - Unit 1448, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Oncology - Unit 1448, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. plin@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200102,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, p53', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA-Binding Protein EWS/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/etiology/metabolism/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['EWS-FLI1', 'Ewing sarcoma', 'Mesenchymal stem cells', 'Mouse model', 'Stag2', 'p53']",2020/01/04 06:00,2020/06/11 06:00,['2020/01/04 06:00'],"['2019/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-6465-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-6465-8 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2020 Jan 2;20(1):3. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-6465-8.,PMC6941350,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'PS104386/The Triumph Over Kid Cancer Foundation']","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EWS-FLI fusion protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein EWS)', '0 (Stag2 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We performed a multicenter case-control study and reviewed medical records of children who initially presented with bone or joint pain lasting for at least 1 month, all of whom were given a secondary diagnosis of JIA or ALL, in four French University Hospitals. Each patient with ALL was paired by age with two children with JIA. Logistic regression was used to compare clinical and laboratory data from the two groups. RESULTS: Forty-nine children with ALL and 98 with JIA were included. The single most important feature distinguishing ALL from JIA was the presence of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy; at least one of these manifestations was present in 37 cases with ALL, but only in 2 controls with JIA, for an odds ratio (OR) of 154 [95%CI: 30-793] (regression coefficient: 5.0). If the presence of these findings is missed or disregarded, multivariate analyses showed that non-articular bone pain and/or general symptoms (asthenia, anorexia or weight loss) (regression coefficient: 4.8, OR 124 [95%CI: 11.4-236]), neutrophils < 2 x 10(9)/L (regression coefficient: 3.9, OR 50 [95%CI: 4.3-58]), and platelets < 300 x 10(9)/L (regression coefficient: 2.6, OR 14 [95%CI: 2.3-83.9]) were associated with the presence of ALL (area under the ROC curve: 0.96 [95%CI: 0.93-0.99]). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings we propose the following preliminary decision tree to be tested in prospective studies: in children presenting with at least 1 month of osteoarticular pain and no obvious ALL in peripheral smear, perform a bone marrow examination if hepatomegaly, splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy is present. If these manifestations are absent, perform a bone marrow examination if there is fever or elevated inflammatory markers associated with non-articular bone pain, general symptoms (asthenia, anorexia or weight loss), neutrophils < 2 x 10(9)/L or platelets < 300 x 10(9)/L.","['Louvigne, Mathilde', 'Rakotonjanahary, Josue', 'Goumy, Laurence', 'Tavenard, Aude', 'Brasme, Jean-Francois', 'Rialland,

The combination of ATO and ATRA has become the standard therapeutic protocol for induction therapy in non-high-risk APL. An oral arsenic realgar-indigo naturalis formula (RIF) has also showed high efficacy and it has a more convenient route of administration than the standard intravenous regimen. Unlike in previous trials, the arsenical agent was used simultaneously with ATRA during post-remission therapy in this trial. METHODS: This study was designed as a multicenter, randomized controlled trial. The trial has a non-inferiority design with superiority being explored if non-inferiority is identified. All patients receive ATRA-ATO during the induction therapy. After achieving hematologic complete remission (HCR), patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive treatment with ATRA-RIF (experimental group) or ATRA-ATO (control group) as the consolidation therapy. During the consolidation therapy, the two groups receive ATRA plus RIF or intravenous ATO 2 weeks on and 2 to ~ 4 weeks off until molecular complete remission (MCR), then ATRA and oral RIF 2 weeks on and 2 to ~ 4 weeks off giving a total of six courses. DISCUSSION: This trial aims to compare the efficacy of ATRA-ATO versus ATRA-RIF in non-high-risk patients with APL, to demonstrate that oral RIF application reduces the total hospitalization days and medical costs.

Although the application of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and the introduction of novel agents such as immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and proteasome inhibitors (PIs) have doubled the median overall survival to eight years, relapsed and refractory diseases are still frequent events in the course of MM. To achieve a durable and deep remission, immunotherapy modalities have been developed for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Among these approaches, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is the most promising star, based on the results of previous success in B-cell neoplasms. In this immunotherapy, autologous T cells are engineered to express an artificial receptor which targets a tumor-associated antigen and initiates the T-cell killing procedure. Tisagenlecleucel and Axicabtagene, targeting the CD19 antigen, are the two pacesetters of CAR T-cell products. They were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017 for the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Their development enabled unparalleled efficacy in combating hematopoietic neoplasms.

We have found that PTPN21 is mutated in relapsed Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. PTPN21 consists of three types of isoforms according to the length of the protein encoded. However, the roles of different isoforms in leukemic cells have not been elucidated. In the study, PTPN21 isoform constitution in five ALL cell lines were identified by transcriptome polymerase chain reaction combined with Sanger sequencing, and the relationship between PTPN21 isoforms and sensitivity to natural killer (NK) cells mediated killing in ALL cell lines were further assessed by knock-out of different isoforms of PTPN21 using CRISPR-Cas9 technique. Subsequently, we explored the functional mechanisms through RNA sequencing and confirmatory testing. The results showed that there was no significant change when all PTPN21 isoforms were knocked out in ALL cells, but the sensitivity of NALM6 cells with PTPN21-CDSlong knock-out (NALM6-PTPN21lk ) to NK-mediated killing was significantly increased. Whole transcriptome sequencing and further validation testing showed that human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules were significantly decreased, accompanied by a significantly downregulated expression of antigen presenting-related chaperones in NALM6-PTPN21lk cells. Our results uncovered a previously unknown mechanism that PTPN21-CDSlong and CDSshort isoforms may play opposite roles in NK-mediated killing in ALL cells, and showed that the endogenous PTPN21-CDSlong isoform inhibited ALL cells to NK cell-mediated lysis by regulating the KIR-HLA-I axis.","['Wang, Huafang', 'Zhu, Ni', 'Ye, Xiaohang', 'Wang, Limengmeng', 'Wang, Binsheng', 'Shan, Wei', 'Lai, Xiaoyu', 'Tan, Yamin', 'Fu, Shan', 'Xiao, Haowen', 'Huang, He']","['Wang H', 'Zhu N', 'Ye X', 'Wang L', 'Wang B', 'Shan W', 'Lai X', 'Tan Y', 'Fu S', 'Xiao H', 'Huang H']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2723-1621'],"['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Zhejiang Engineering Laboratory for Stem cell and Immunotherapy, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Zhejiang Engineering Laboratory for Stem cell and Immunotherapy, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Zhejiang Engineering Laboratory for Stem cell and Immunotherapy, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Zhejiang Engineering Laboratory for Stem cell and Immunotherapy, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Zhejiang Engineering Laboratory for Stem cell and Immunotherapy, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200102,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,,"['CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Gene Editing', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones/metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Non-Receptor/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'RNA-Seq']",['NOTNLM'],"['*NK killing', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*human leukocyte antigens class I molecules', '*isoform', '*protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 21']",2020/01/04 06:00,2021/07/10 06:00,['2020/01/04 06:00'],"['2019/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.29601 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2020 Jun;121(5-6):3298-3312. doi: 10.1002/jcb.29601.

Its role in children is not well established. We report four consecutive children with AIS due to BAO treated with ECR in Sydney, Australia. We reviewed the literature to characterize the 'natural course' of AIS due to BAO in children not treated with thrombolysis or ECR, and compared their outcome with our patients and reported children with BAO treated with ECR. Despite delays in diagnosis, ECR achieved recanalization in our four children. Three children had a good outcome (Paediatric Modified Rankin Score [PedmRS] 0-2). One child with acute leukaemia suffered recurrent basilar occlusion and died of brainstem dysfunction. Literature review identified 111 children exhibiting the natural course of AIS due to BAO, among whom 42% had good outcomes (PedmRS 0-2), 48% had significant residual disability (PedmRS 3-5), and 10% died. Of 34 children treated with ECR, 28 (82%) had good outcomes (PedmRS 0-2), five (15%) had significant residual disability (PedmRS 3-5), and one (3%) died. Complications of ECR were uncommon.

Several genes have been linked to EK and they encode a number of proteins that are important for the integrity of the keratinocyte layer of the epidermis. PERP is a transcription factor that is activated by both p53 and p63. However, its deficiency in a mouse model appears to only recapitulate p63-mediated role in skin development and organization. We report an extended multiplex consanguineous family in which an EK phenotype with a striking similarity to that observed in Perp(-/-) mice, is mapped to an autozygous region on chromosome 6 that spans PERP. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel variant in PERP that fully segregated with the phenotype. Functional analysis of patient- and control-derived keratinocytes revealed a deleterious effect of the identified variant on the intracellular localization of PERP. A previous report showed that PERP mutation causes a dominant form of keratoderma but a single patient in that report with a homozygous variant in PERP suggests that recessive inheritance is also possible. Our results, therefore, support the establishment of an autosomal recessive PERP-related EK phenotype in humans.","['Patel, Nisha', 'Alkeraye, Salim', 'Alobeid, Eman', 'Alshidi, Tarfa', 'Helaby, Rana', 'Abdulwahab, Firdous', 'Shamseldin, Hanan E', 'Alkuraya, Fowzan S']","['Patel N', 'Alkeraye S', 'Alobeid E', 'Alshidi T', 'Helaby R', 'Abdulwahab F', 'Shamseldin HE', 'Alkuraya FS']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4158-341X'],"['Department of Genetics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Dermatology Department, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Genetics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Genetics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Genetics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Genetics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Genetics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Genetics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200112,Denmark,Clin Genet,Clinical genetics,0253664,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epidermis/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Genes, Recessive/genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Whole Exome Sequencing', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*PERP', '*erythrokeratoderma', '*keratoderma', '*transgrediens']",2020/01/04 06:00,2021/06/04 06:00,['2020/01/04 06:00'],"['2019/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cge.13699 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Genet. 2020 Apr;97(4):661-665. doi: 10.1111/cge.13699.

Most tamoxifen-resistant patients retain ERalpha expression which may support growth and progression of breast cancers. Therefore, we investigated epigenetic regulation of ERalpha that may provide a rationale for targeting ERalpha in these patients. METHODS: Expression levels of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) family of proteins in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells and publicly available breast cancer patient data sets were analyzed. Histone methylation levels in ERalpha promoter regions were assessed using chromatin immunoprecipitation. Expression levels of ERalpha and its target gene were analyzed using western blotting and real-time qPCR. Cell-cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The expression of MLL3 and SET-domain-containing 1A (SET1A) were increased in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancers. An MLL3 chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing data analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments for MLL3 and SET1A suggested that these proteins bound to enhancer or intron regions of the ESR1 gene and regulated histone H3K4 methylation status. Depletion of MLL3 or SET1A downregulated the expression level of ERalpha and inhibited the growth of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. Additional treatment with fulvestrant resulted in a synergistic reduction of ERalpha levels and the growth of the cells. CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced expression of MLL3 and SET1A in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells supported the ERalpha-dependent growth of these cells by increasing ERalpha expression. Our results suggest that targeting these histone methyltransferases might provide an attractive strategy to overcome endocrine resistance.","['Kim, Seung-Su', 'Lee, Min-Ho', 'Lee, Mi-Ock']","['Kim SS', 'Lee MH', 'Lee MO']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1578-8211'],"['College of Pharmacy and Bio-MAX Institute, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08826, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy and Bio-MAX Institute, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08826, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy and Bio-MAX Institute, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08826, Korea. molee@snu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200102,Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histone Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Tamoxifen/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['Breast cancer', 'ERalpha', 'MLL3', 'SET1A', 'Tamoxifen resistance']",2020/01/04 06:00,2020/10/28 06:00,['2020/01/04 06:00'],"['2019/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10549-019-05517-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s10549-019-05517-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2020 Feb;180(1):45-54. doi: 10.1007/s10549-019-05517-0.

Due to the uncertainty of the effects of diabetes along with superovulation treatment on the infertility, we investigate the effects of ovulation induction treatment as therapeutic approach on the expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) as two main factors which are involved in the implantation in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic rats. Materials and Methods: Type 1 diabetes was induced by injections of STZ in Wistar rats. The animals were kept in diabetic conditions for 4 weeks, while some were treated with insulin for treatment. After treatment, the ovulation was induced by human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The rats were then sacrificed and the expression of LIF and VEGFA was checked by immunohistochemistry staining method, and the relative expression of LIF and VEGFA was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting methods. Results: It was observed that diabetes and insulin treatment for diabetes altered the expression of Lif and VEGFA in both mRNA and protein levels. However, superovulation treatment seems to ameliorate this alternation for both factors. Conclusion: According to our results, diabetes and insulin therapy could alter the expression of Lif and VEGFA genes and proteins that are effective in endometrial receptivity and implantation process. It seems in diabetic cases, the effect of hCG and hMG therapy by itself could regulate the level of expression and presence of these two genes and proteins.","['Zarei, Ronak', 'Nikpour, Parvaneh', 'Rashidi, Bahman', 'Eskandari, Nahid', 'Aboutorabi, Roshanak']","['Zarei R', 'Nikpour P', 'Rashidi B', 'Eskandari N', 'Aboutorabi R']",,"['Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Child Growth and Development Research Center, Research Institute for Primordial Prevention of Non-communicable Disease, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191127,India,Adv Biomed Res,Advanced biomedical research,101586897,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Embryo implantation', 'insulin', 'leukemia inhibitory factor', 'superovulation', 'vascular endothelial growth factor A']",2020/01/04 06:00,2020/01/04 06:01,['2020/01/04 06:00'],"['2019/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/abr.abr_159_19 [doi]', 'ABR-8-66 [pii]']",epublish,Adv Biomed Res. 2019 Nov 27;8:66. doi: 10.4103/abr.abr_159_19. eCollection 2019.,PMC6909543,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,['Copyright: (c) 2019 Advanced Biomedical Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic value of TP53 expression in childhood ALL. To achieve this, TP53 mRNA levels of 146 children with ALL and 23 child donors with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The results demonstrated that TP53 mRNA level in patients with ALL was higher compared with that in the ITP donors (P=0.019). Patients with highly-expressed TP53 exhibited lower percentages of peripheral blood blast, higher platelet counts and inferior complete remission rates compared with patients with low expression of TP53. Survival analyses revealed that high TP53 expression was associated with poor OS and RFS in childhood ALL (P=0.018 and P=0.028, respectively) and was an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis for poor RFS (P<0.001) and OS (P<0.001). In conclusion, high TP53 expression is associated with poor outcomes and may be used as a molecular prognostic marker to be incorporated into an improved risk classification system for childhood ALL.","['Weng, Wenwen', 'Zhang, Ping', 'Ruan, Jinfei', 'Zhang, Yao', 'Ba, Diandian', 'Tang, Yongmin']","['Weng W', 'Zhang P', 'Ruan J', 'Zhang Y', 'Ba D', 'Tang Y']",,"[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, P.R.

However, chemotherapeutic resistance is a difficult but common obstacle when treating leukaemia in the clinical setting. Studies have demonstrated that drug resistance is partly attributable to autophagy induced by multiple chemotherapeutic agents. As an evolutionarily conserved non-histone chromatin-binding protein, high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is considered to be an important factor in autophagy, and regulates autophagy at multiple levels via different subcellular localisations. In the present study, it was revealed that chemotherapeutic drugs induced autophagy in leukaemia cells and that translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is an important molecular event in this process. It was further demonstrated that poly (ADP-ribosylation) of HMGB1 facilitates its acetylation, thereby inducing HMGB1 translocation and ultimately promoting chemotherapy-induced autophagy in leukaemic cells. Targeted HMGB1 translocation may overcome chemotherapy-induced autophagy in leukaemia.","['Li, Yunyao', 'Xie, Jianwei', 'Li, Xinyu', 'Fang, Jianpei']","['Li Y', 'Xie J', 'Li X', 'Fang J']",,"['Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumour Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510120, P.R.

Recent studies have indicated that S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8) is associated with the occurrence and development of MDR. Traditional Chinese medicine may provide drugs with the potential to be used as multidrug resistance reversal agents with low toxicity and multi-target characteristics. The present study selected K562/DOX cells, a CML drug-resistant cell line, as a research model, and aimed to examine whether curcumin was able to reverse the resistance to doxorubicin (DOX), and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. An MTT cytotoxicity assay indicated that curcumin at 0.5-2 microM reversed DOX resistance with a reversal index of 1.3-9.3. Western blot analysis revealed that curcumin treatment caused a downregulation of the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and S100A8 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. To study the internal association between S100A8 and P-gp, and the S100A8 role in drug resistance reversal, an RNA knockdown assay was conducted; however, S100A8 did not regulate the expression of P-gp or vice versa. After inhibiting the expression of S100A8 with specific small interfering RNA (si-S100A8), the sensitivity of K562/DOX cells to DOX was enhanced. In addition, si-S100A8 did not increase the intracellular accumulation of DOX, but increased the intracellular free calcium ion content, and the expression and activity of apoptosis-associated proteins, thereby inducing apoptosis. In conclusion, the present study suggested that inhibition of S100A8 expression increased DOX-induced apoptosis, and curcumin acted independently on S100A8 and P-gp to exert its drug resistance reversal effects.","['Yang, Liu', 'Li, Duo', 'Tang, Peiyan', 'Zuo, Yunfei']","['Yang L', 'Li D', 'Tang P', 'Zuo Y']",,"['Center for Post-doctoral Research, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning 116044, P.R.

Prognostically-significant pathogenic KIT mutations also occur in 30-40% of core binding factor-associated acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML), but are uncommonly associated with concurrent SM. By comparison, the occurrence of SM in other myeloid neoplasms bearing pathogenic KIT mutations, particularly those with a chronic course, is poorly understood. Review of clinical next-generation sequencing (NGS) performed at our institutions in patients with known or suspected hematologic malignancies over an 8-year period revealed 64 patients with both a pathogenic KIT mutation detected at one or more timepoints and available bone marrow biopsy materials. Patients with KIT(D816V)-mutated myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), or overlap MDS/MPN (n = 22) accounted for approximately one-third of our cohort (34%). Comprehensive morphologic and immunophenotypic characterization revealed that nearly all cases (n = 20, 91%) exhibited concurrent SM. In contrast, of the 18 patients (28%) with AML and KIT(D816V), only eight (44%) showed evidence of SM at any point in their disease course (p = 0.0021); of these eight, the AML component was characterized as AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) in all but one instance (n = 7, 87%). Twelve patients (19%) had pathogenic KIT mutations other than p.D816V, all in the setting of AML (CFB-AML, n = 7; AML, not otherwise specified, n = 2; AML-MRC, n = 1; acute promyelocytic leukemia, n = 1); only two of these patients (17%), both with CBF-AML, exhibited concurrent SM.

This AML subtype is associated with a favorable prognosis; however, nearly half of CBF-rearranged patients cannot be cured with chemotherapy. This divergent outcome might be due to additional mutations, whose spectrum and prognostic relevance remains hardly defined. Here, we identify nonsilent mutations, which may collaborate with CBF-rearrangements during leukemogenesis by targeted sequencing of 129 genes in 292 adult CBF leukemia patients, and thus provide a comprehensive overview of the mutational spectrum ('mutatome') in CBF leukemia. Thereby, we detected fundamental differences between CBFB/MYH11- and RUNX1/RUNX1T1-rearranged patients with ASXL2, JAK2, JAK3, RAD21, TET2, and ZBTB7A being strongly correlated with the latter subgroup. We found prognostic relevance of mutations in genes previously known to be AML-associated such as KIT, SMC1A, and DHX15 and identified novel, recurrent mutations in NFE2 (3%), MN1 (4%), HERC1 (3%), and ZFHX4 (5%). Furthermore, age >60 years, nonprimary AML and loss of the Y-chromosomes are important predictors of survival. These findings are important for refinement of treatment stratification and development of targeted therapy approaches in CBF leukemia.","['Opatz, Sabrina', 'Bamopoulos, Stefanos A', 'Metzeler, Klaus

We conducted a systematic search for novel agents selectively toxic to cells of hematopoietic origin. Chemical library screenings followed by hit-to-lead optimization identified OT-82, a small molecule with strong efficacy against hematopoietic malignancies including acute myeloblastic and lymphoblastic adult and pediatric leukemias, erythroleukemia, multiple myeloma, and Burkitt's lymphoma in vitro and in mouse xenograft models. OT-82 was also more toxic towards patients-derived leukemic cells versus healthy bone marrow-derived hematopoietic precursors. OT-82 was shown to induce cell death by inhibiting nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage pathway of NAD synthesis. In mice, optimization of OT-82 dosing and dietary niacin further expanded the compound's therapeutic index. In toxicological studies conducted in mice and nonhuman primates, OT-82 showed no cardiac, neurological or retinal toxicities observed with other NAMPT inhibitors and had no effect on mouse aging or longevity. Hematopoietic and lymphoid organs were identified as the primary targets for dose limiting toxicity of OT-82 in both species. These results reveal strong dependence of neoplastic cells of hematopoietic origin on NAMPT and introduce OT-82 as a promising candidate for the treatment of hematological malignancies.","['Korotchkina, Lioubov', 'Kazyulkin, Denis', 'Komarov, Pavel G', 'Polinsky, Alex', 'Andrianova, Ekaterina L', 'Joshi, Sangeeta', 'Gupta, Mahima', 'Vujcic, Slavoljub', 'Kononov, Eugene', 'Toshkov, Ilia', 'Tian, Yuan', 'Krasnov, Peter', 'Chernov, Mikhail V', 'Veith, Jean', 'Antoch, Marina P', 'Middlemiss, Shiloh', 'Somers, Klaartje', 'Lock, Richard B', 'Norris, Murray D', 'Henderson, Michelle J', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Chernova, Olga B', 'Gudkov, Andrei V']","['Korotchkina L', 'Kazyulkin D', 'Komarov PG', 'Polinsky A', 'Andrianova EL', 'Joshi S', 'Gupta M', 'Vujcic S', 'Kononov E', 'Toshkov I', 'Tian Y', 'Krasnov P', 'Chernov MV', 'Veith J', 'Antoch MP', 'Middlemiss S', 'Somers K', 'Lock RB', 'Norris MD', 'Henderson MJ', 'Haber M', 'Chernova OB', 'Gudkov AV']",,"['Oncotartis, Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Oncotartis, Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Oncotartis, Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Oncotartis, Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Oncotartis, Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Oncotartis, Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Oncotartis, Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Oncotartis, Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Oncotartis, Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Oncotartis, Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Oncotartis, Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Oncotartis, Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, USA.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'University of New South Wales Centre for Childhood Cancer Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Oncotartis, Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, USA. andrei.gudkov@roswellpark.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200102,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NAD/*metabolism', 'Niacin/*pharmacology', 'Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2020/01/04 06:00,2020/10/28 06:00,['2020/01/04 06:00'],"['2019/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0692-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0692-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Jul;34(7):1828-1839. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0692-5.

A major clinical aim remains the identification and elimination of low-level disease persistence, termed ""minimal residual disease"". The phenomenon of disease persistence suggests that despite targeted therapeutic approaches, BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms exist which sustain the survival of leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Although other markers of a primitive CML LSC population have been identified in the preclinical setting, only CD26 appears to offer clinical utility. Here we demonstrate consistent and selective expression of CD93 on a lin(-)CD34(+)CD38(-)CD90(+) CML LSC population and show in vitro and in vivo data to suggest increased stem cell characteristics, as well as robust engraftment in patient-derived xenograft models in comparison with a CD93(-) CML stem/progenitor cell population, which fails to engraft. Through bulk and single-cell analyses of selected stem cell and cell survival-specific genes, we confirmed the quiescent character and demonstrate their persistence in a population of CML patient samples who demonstrate molecular relapse on TKI withdrawal. Taken together, our results identify that CD93 is consistently and selectively expressed on a lin(-)CD34(+)CD38(-)CD90(+) CML LSC population with stem cell characteristics and may be an important indicator in determining poor TKI responders.","['Kinstrie, Ross', 'Horne, Gillian A', 'Morrison, Heather', 'Irvine, David', 'Munje, Chinmay', 'Castaneda, Eduardo Gomez', 'Moka, Hothri A', 'Dunn, Karen', 'Cassels, Jennifer E', 'Parry, Narissa', 'Clarke, Cassie J', 'Scott, Mary T', 'Clark, Richard E', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Wheadon, Helen', 'Copland, Mhairi']","['Kinstrie R', 'Horne GA', 'Morrison H', 'Irvine D', 'Munje C', 'Castaneda EG', 'Moka HA', 'Dunn K', 'Cassels JE', 'Parry N', 'Clarke CJ', 'Scott MT', 'Clark RE', 'Holyoake TL', 'Wheadon H', 'Copland M']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9741-7352', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7355-2960', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6532-970X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7655-016X']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", 'Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.

International guidelines recommend monitoring for measurable residual disease every 3 months for 2 years after treatment. However, it is unknown if serial molecular monitoring can predict and prevent morphologic relapse. We conducted a retrospective single-center study of 114 patients in complete remission who underwent molecular monitoring with RT-qPCR of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or CBFB-MYH11 transcripts every 3 months. Morphologic relapse was defined as re-emergence of >5% blasts and molecular relapse as >/=1 log increase in transcript level between 2 samples. Over a median follow-up time of 3.7 years (range 0.2-14.3), remission persisted in 71 (62.3%) patients but 43 (37.7%) developed molecular or morphologic relapse. Patients who achieved <3 log reduction in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or CBFB-MYH11 transcripts at end of chemotherapy had a significantly higher risk of relapse compared to patients who achieved >/=3 log reduction (61.1% vs. 33.7%, p=0.004). The majority of relapses (74.4%, n=32) were not predicted by molecular monitoring and occurred rapidly with <100 days from molecular to morphologic relapse. Molecular monitoring enabled the detection of impending relapse and permitted pre-emptive intervention prior to morphologic relapse in only 11 (25.6%) patients. The current practice of molecular monitoring every 3 months provided insufficient lead-time to identify molecular relapses and prevent morphologic relapse in the majority of patients with core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia treated at our institution. Further research is necessary to determine the optimal monitoring strategies for these patients.","['Puckrin, Robert', 'Atenafu, Eshetu G', 'Claudio, Jaime O', 'Chan, Steven', 'Gupta, Vikas', 'Maze, Dawn', 'McNamara, Caroline', 'Murphy, Tracy', 'Shuh, Andre C', 'Yee, Karen', 'Sibai, Hassan', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Wei, Cuihong', 'Stockley, Tracy', 'Kamel-Reid, Suzanne', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Puckrin R', 'Atenafu EG', 'Claudio JO', 'Chan S', 'Gupta V', 'Maze D', 'McNamara C', 'Murphy T', 'Shuh AC', 'Yee K', 'Sibai H', 'Minden MD', 'Wei C', 'Stockley T', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Schimmer AD']",,"['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Deo. of Biostatistics, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210101,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Disease Progression', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2020/01/04 06:00,2021/05/22 06:00,['2020/01/04 06:00'],"['2020/01/02 00:00 [aheadofprint]', '2019/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3324/haematol.2019.235721 [doi]'],epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Jan 1;106(1):56-63. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.235721.,PMC7776265,,,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Vital status was updated through 2016 adding 7 years of follow-up. Cohort mortality compared with the US population was evaluated via life table analyses. Full risk-sets, matched on attained age, race, birthdate and fire department were created and analysed using the Cox proportional hazards regression to examine exposure-response associations between select mortality outcomes and exposure surrogates (exposed-days, fire-runs and fire-hours). Models were adjusted for a potential bias from healthy worker survivor effects by including a categorical variable for employment duration. RESULTS: Compared with the US population, mortality from all cancers, mesothelioma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and cancers of the oesophagus, intestine, rectum, lung and kidney were modestly elevated. Positive exposure-response relationships were observed for deaths from lung cancer, leukaemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). CONCLUSIONS: This update confirms previous findings of excess mortality from all cancers and several site-specific cancers as well as positive exposure-response relations for lung cancer and leukaemia. New findings include excess NHL mortality compared with the general population and a positive exposure-response relationship for COPD. However, there was no evidence of an association between any quantitative exposure measure and NHL.","['Pinkerton, Lynne', 'Bertke, Stephen J', 'Yiin, James', 'Dahm, Matthew', 'Kubale, Travis', 'Hales, Thomas', 'Purdue, Mark', 'Beaumont, James J', 'Daniels, Robert']","['Pinkerton L', 'Bertke SJ', 'Yiin J', 'Dahm M', 'Kubale T', 'Hales T', 'Purdue M', 'Beaumont JJ', 'Daniels R']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8669-487X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3915-7991']","['Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA jyiin@cdc.gov.', 'Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.', 'World Trade Center Health Program, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Washington, District of Columbia, USA.', 'Division of Safety Research, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Denver, Colorado, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California Davis, Davis, California, USA.', 'Education and Information Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20200102,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Chicago/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Firefighters', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality', 'Male', 'Mesothelioma/mortality', 'Mesothelioma, Malignant', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', '*Occupations', 'Philadelphia/epidemiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/mortality', 'San Francisco/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*dose-response', '*epidemiology', '*firefighters', '*longitudinal studies', '*mortality studies']",2020/01/04 06:00,2020/04/24 06:00,['2020/01/04 06:00'],"['2019/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['oemed-2019-105962 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2019-105962 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2020 Feb;77(2):84-93. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2019-105962.

Its anti-microbial, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-hyperglycemic effects have been investigated in previous studies. However, there have not been any studies examining the anti-degranulation effect of trigonelline. In this study, the anti-degranulation effect of trigonelline was evaluated in in vitro and in vivo models using a rat basophilic leukemia cell line, RBL-2H3 cells, and a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction in mice, respectively. In the beta-hexosaminidase release assay, trigonelline effectively suppressed antigen-induced degranulation of RBL-2H3 cells in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxicity. Trigonelline also inhibited FcepsilonRI-mediated intracellular signaling pathways, such as phosphorylation of PLCgamma1, PI3 K, and Akt, in antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells and suppressed the PCA response in mice. Moreover, trigonelline also inhibited the microtubule formation in RBL-2H3 cells, indicating that trigonelline could inhibit IgE-sensitized mast cell degranulation by attenuating both the intracellular calcium-dependent and independent pathways. These results revealed that trigonelline possesses the anti-degranulation effect against the development of allergic diseases.","['Nugrahini, Arita Dewi', 'Ishida, Momoko', 'Nakagawa, Toshifumi', 'Nishi, Kosuke', 'Sugahara, Takuya']","['Nugrahini AD', 'Ishida M', 'Nakagawa T', 'Nishi K', 'Sugahara T']",,"['Department of Applied Bioresource Science, The United Graduate School of Agricultural Sciences, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime 790-8566, Japan; Department of Agro-industrial Technology, Faculty of Agricultural Technology, Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia.', 'Department of Bioscience, Graduate School of Agriculture, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime 790-8566, Japan.', 'Forensic Science Laboratory, Ehime Prefectural Police Headquarters, Ehime 790-8573, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Bioresource Science, The United Graduate School of Agricultural Sciences, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime 790-8566, Japan; Department of Bioscience, Graduate School of Agriculture, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime 790-8566, Japan; Food and Health Sciences Research Center, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime 790-8566, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Bioresource Science, The United Graduate School of Agricultural Sciences, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime 790-8566, Japan; Department of Bioscience, Graduate School of Agriculture, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime 790-8566, Japan; Food and Health Sciences Research Center, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime 790-8566, Japan.

We report that ATRX deletion from mouse cells altered the repair of telomeric double-strand breaks (DSBs) and induced ALT-like phenotypes, including ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies (APBs), telomere sister chromatid exchanges (T-SCEs), and extrachromosomal telomeric signals (ECTSs). Mechanistically, we show that ATRX affects telomeric DSB repair by promoting cohesion of sister telomeres and that loss of ATRX in ALT cells results in diminished telomere cohesion. In addition, we document a role for DAXX in the repair of telomeric DSBs. Removal of telomeric cohesion in combination with DAXX deficiency recapitulates all telomeric DSB repair phenotypes associated with ATRX loss. The data reveal that ATRX has an effect on telomeric DSB repair and that this role involves both telomere cohesion and a DAXX-dependent pathway.","['Lovejoy, Courtney A', 'Takai, Kaori', 'Huh, Michael S', 'Picketts, David J', 'de Lange, Titia']","['Lovejoy CA', 'Takai K', 'Huh MS', 'Picketts DJ', 'de Lange T']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2631-8389', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9227-2016', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9267-367X']","['Laboratory for Cell Biology and Genetics, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Laboratory for Cell Biology and Genetics, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Laboratory for Cell Biology and Genetics, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200102,United States,PLoS Biol,PLoS biology,101183755,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Co-Repressor Proteins/*physiology', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Retardation, X-Linked/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Chaperones/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange/*genetics', 'Telomere/*genetics/metabolism', 'Telomere Homeostasis/genetics', 'X-linked Nuclear Protein/*physiology', 'alpha-Thalassemia/genetics/pathology']",,,2020/01/03 06:00,2020/04/25 06:00,['2020/01/03 06:00'],"['2019/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pbio.3000594 [doi]', 'PBIOLOGY-D-19-02887 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Biol. 2020 Jan 2;18(1):e3000594. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.3000594. eCollection 2020 Jan.,PMC6959610,"[""I have read the journal's policy and the authors of this manuscript have the"", 'following competing interests: TdL is a member of the Scientific Advisory Board', 'of Calico (San Francisco, CA).

The PGRN expression in hematological malignancies is limited to multiple myeloma, but its expression and survival prognostic role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still controversial.To evaluate the PGRN expression and estimate its survival prognostic role in AML patients.In this study, all patients were divided into three groups, which included 38 newly diagnosed adult AML patients, 33 complete remissions (CR-AML) patients, and 60 healthy control (HC) patients. The endpoints were relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). We investigated plasma PGRN levels by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Plasma PGRN levels in AML patients were higher than that in CR-AML and HC groups. After two chemo cycles, 16 patients had complete remission (CR). The level of plasma PGRN in non-CR patients compared to CR patients was obviously different (median 44.19 vs 21.10 ng/mL) (P = .025). In non-M3 (French-American-British classification) patients, 70% (21/30) patients relapsed in 1 year and 80% (24/80) patients died in the observed time. Using the value (median 19.95) as a ""cut-off"" value, we have divided non-M3 patients into low- and high-PGRN expression groups. High-PGRN expression patients had a poorer RFS with a median of 5.4 months (95% CI 3.7-7.1) and low-PGRN expression patients had a good RFS with a median of 8.9 months (95% CI 6.3-11.5; P = .027). In the survival analyses, high-PGRN expression of AML patients had shorter OS than low-PGRN expression of AML patients (6.2 vs 20.5 months, P = .008).PGRN is overexpressed in AML, which is a convenient and independent prognostic marker that is measured easily in AML patients.","['Qin, Jiajia', 'Huang, Shigao', 'Qian, Jiao', 'Xu, Chunyan', 'Li, Shixiao', 'Yu, Sufei', 'Yan, Haixi', 'Wu, Mingjiao', 'Chen, Jiaxi', 'Ren, Hanxing', 'Peng, Minfei']","['Qin J', 'Huang S', 'Qian J', 'Xu C', 'Li S', 'Yu S', 'Yan H', 'Wu M', 'Chen J', 'Ren H', 'Peng M']",,"['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group), Linhai, Zhejiang Province.', 'Cancer Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Taipa, Macao SAR.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group), Linhai, Zhejiang Province.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group), Linhai, Zhejiang Province.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group), Linhai, Zhejiang Province.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group), Linhai, Zhejiang Province.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group), Linhai, Zhejiang Province.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group), Linhai, Zhejiang Province.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Enze Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group).', 'Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group), Linhai, Zhejiang Province.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Progranulins/*blood', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/01/03 06:00,2020/01/15 06:00,['2020/01/03 06:00'],"['2020/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000018574 [doi]', '00005792-202001030-00039 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Jan;99(1):e18574. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000018574.,PMC6946396,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Progranulins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drugs that enhance erythropoiesis are urgently required to decrease transfusion rates and improve quality of life. Clinical studies have observed an unexpected improvement in hemoglobin and RBC transfusion-independence in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated with the isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutant-specific inhibitor enasidenib, leading to improved quality of life without a reduction in AML disease burden. Here, we demonstrate that enasidenib enhanced human erythroid differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors. The phenomenon was not observed with other IDH1/2 inhibitors and occurred in IDH2-deficient CRISPR-engineered progenitors independently of D-2-hydroxyglutarate. The effect of enasidenib on hematopoietic progenitors was mediated by protoporphyrin accumulation, driving heme production and erythroid differentiation in committed CD71+ progenitors rather than hematopoietic stem cells.

Here, we explored the function of this kinase in macrophages with studies of its regulation of the NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. We found that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from BTK-deficient mice or monocytes from patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) exhibited increased NLRP3 inflammasome activity; this was also the case for BMDMs exposed to low doses of BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib and for monocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia being treated with ibrutinib. In mechanistic studies, we found that BTK bound to NLRP3 during the priming phase of inflammasome activation and, in doing so, inhibited LPS- and nigericin-induced assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome during the activation phase of inflammasome activation. This inhibitory effect was caused by BTK inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A-mediated (PP2A-mediated) dephosphorylation of Ser5 in the pyrin domain of NLRP3. Finally, we show that BTK-deficient mice were subject to severe experimental colitis and that such colitis was normalized by administration of anti-IL-beta or anakinra, an inhibitor of IL-1beta signaling. Together, these studies strongly suggest that BTK functions as a physiologic inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and explain why patients with XLA are prone to develop Crohn's disease.","['Mao, Liming', 'Kitani, Atsushi', 'Hiejima, Eitaro', 'Montgomery-Recht, Kim', 'Zhou, Wenchang', 'Fuss, Ivan', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Strober, Warren']","['Mao L', 'Kitani A', 'Hiejima E', 'Montgomery-Recht K', 'Zhou W', 'Fuss I', 'Wiestner A', 'Strober W']",,"['Mucosal Immunity Section, Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Mucosal Immunity Section, Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Mucosal Immunity Section, Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Clinical Research Directorate/Clinical Monitoring Research Program, Leidos Biomedical Research Inc., National Cancer Institute (NCI) Campus at Frederick, Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'Theoretical Molecular Biophysics Laboratory, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), and.', 'Mucosal Immunity Section, Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Section, Hematology Branch, NHLBI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Mucosal Immunity Section, Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Agammaglobulinemia/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Child', '*Crohn Disease/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Genetic Diseases, X-Linked/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Inflammasomes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-1beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Gastroenterology', '*Inflammatory bowel disease', '*Innate immunity']",2020/01/03 06:00,2020/12/31 06:00,['2020/01/03 06:00'],"['2019/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['128322 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI128322 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2020 Apr 1;130(4):1793-1807. doi: 10.1172/JCI128322.,PMC7108929,,"['HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA AI000354/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (IL1B protein, human)', '0 (IL1B protein, mouse)', '0 (Inflammasomes)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein)', '0 (NLRP3 protein, human)', '0 (Nlrp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Btk protein, mouse)', 'Bruton type agammaglobulinemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objectives: To project long-term survival and assess whether life expectancy will improve among adult survivors of childhood cancer who were treated in more recent decades. Design, Setting, and Participants: A microsimulation model of competing mortality risks was developed using data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study on 5-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed between 1970 and 1999. The model included (1) late recurrence, (2) treatment-related late effects (health-related [subsequent cancers, cardiac events, pulmonary conditions, and other] and external causes), and (3) US background mortality rates. Exposures: Treatment subgroups (no treatment or surgery only, chemotherapy alone, radiotherapy alone, and radiotherapy with chemotherapy) and individuals with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during childhood by era (1970-1979, 1980-1989, and 1990-1999). Main Outcomes and Measures: Conditional life expectancy (defined as the number of years a 5-year survivor can expect to live), cumulative cause-specific mortality risk, and 10-year mortality risks conditional on attaining ages of 30, 40, 50, and 60 years. Results: Among the hypothetical cohort of 5-year survivors of childhood cancer representative of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study participants (44% female and 56% male; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 7.3 [5.6] years), conditional life expectancy was 48.5 years (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 47.6-49.6 years) for 5-year survivors diagnosed in 1970-1979, 53.7 years (95% UI, 52.6-54.7 years) for those diagnosed in 1980-1989, and 57.1 years (95% UI, 55.9-58.1 years) for those diagnosed in 1990-1999. Compared with individuals without a history of cancer, these results represented a gap in life expectancy of 25% (95% UI, 24%-27%) (16.5 years [95% UI, 15.5-17.5 years]) for those diagnosed in 1970-1979, 19% (95% UI, 17%-20%) (12.3 years [95% UI, 11.3-13.4 years]) for those diagnosed in 1980-1989, and 14% (95% UI, 13%-16%) (9.2 years [95% UI, 8.3-10.4 years]) for those diagnosed in 1990-1999. During the 3 decades, the proportion of survivors treated with chemotherapy alone increased (from 18% in 1970-1979 to 54% in 1990-1999), and the life expectancy gap in this chemotherapy-alone group decreased from 11.0 years (95% UI, 9.0-13.1 years) to 6.0 years (95% UI, 4.5-7.6 years). In contrast, during the same time frame, only modest improvements in the gap in life expectancy were projected for survivors treated with radiotherapy (21.0 years [95% UI, 18.5-23.2 years] to 17.6 years [95% UI, 14.2-21.2 years]) or with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (17.9 years [95% UI, 16.7-19.2 years] to 14.8 years [95% UI, 13.1-16.7 years]). For the largest group of survivors by diagnosis-those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia-the gap in life expectancy decreased from 14.7 years (95% UI, 12.8-16.5 years) in 1970-1979 to 8.0 years (95% UI, 6.2-9.7 years). Conclusions and Relevance: Evolving treatment approaches are projected to be associated with improved life expectancy after treatment for pediatric cancer, in particular among those who received chemotherapy alone for their childhood cancer diagnosis. Despite improvements, survivors remain at risk for shorter lifespans, especially when radiotherapy was included as part of their childhood cancer treatment.","['Yeh, Jennifer M', 'Ward, Zachary J', 'Chaudhry, Aeysha', 'Liu, Qi', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Armstrong, Gregory T', 'Gibson, Todd M', 'Howell, Rebecca', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Krull, Kevin R', 'Leisenring, Wendy M', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C', 'Diller, Lisa']","['Yeh JM', 'Ward ZJ', 'Chaudhry A', 'Liu Q', 'Yasui Y', 'Armstrong GT', 'Gibson TM', 'Howell R', 'Hudson MM', 'Krull KR', 'Leisenring WM', 'Oeffinger KC', 'Diller L']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Division of General Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Center for Health Decision Science, Harvard T.H.

Variants in genes coding for thiopurine S-methyl transferase (TPMT) and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) are known to influence 6-MP metabolism. We determined TPMT and ITPA genotype and enzyme activity and the mean 6-MP doses during maintenance treatment in 40 children treated for ALL according to the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG)-ALL11 protocol in the Radboudumc Amalia Children's Hospital, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Patients with genetic variants in TPMT (N=3) had significantly lower TPMT enzyme activity (mean 0.46 vs. 0.72 micromol/mmol hemoglobin/h, P=0.005). Although the difference was not statistically significant, they were treated with lower mean 6-MP doses (28.1 mg/m [SD 25.5 mg/m] vs. 41.3 mg/m [SD 17.2 mg/m], P=0.375).

Aberrant epigenetic states are induced by mutations in histones or epigenetic regulatory genes, aberrant expression of genes regulating chromatin complexes, altered DNA methylation patterns, or dysregulated expression of noncoding RNAs. Developmental contexts of dysregulated epigenetic states are equally important for initiation and progression of many childhood cancers. As an improved understanding of disease-specific roles and molecular consequences of epigenetic alterations in oncogenesis is emerging, targeting these mechanisms of disease in childhood cancers is increasingly becoming important. RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to disease-causing epigenetic events, DNA methylation patterns and specific oncohistone mutations are being utilized for the diagnosis of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) and solid tumors. These discoveries have improved the classification of poorly differentiated tumors and laid the foundation for future improved clinical management. On the therapeutic side, the first therapies targeting epigenetic alterations have recently entered clinical trials. Current clinical trials include pharmacological inhibition of histone and DNA modifiers in aggressive types of pediatric cancer. SUMMARY: Targeting novel epigenetic vulnerabilities, either by themselves, or coupled with targeting altered transcriptional states, developmental cell states or immunomodulation will result in innovative approaches for treating deadly pediatric cancers.","['Panditharatna, Eshini', 'Filbin, Mariella G']","['Panditharatna E', 'Filbin MG']",,"['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA.', ""Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorder Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,IM,,"['Child', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Epigenomics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Glioma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Histones/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/classification/*genetics']",,,2020/01/03 06:00,2020/10/28 06:00,['2020/01/03 06:00'],"['2020/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOP.0000000000000867 [doi]', '00008480-202002000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2020 Feb;32(1):67-75. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0000000000000867.,,,,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Over the last decades, several methods have been developed to trace MRD, with flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) being the most reliable. However, new technologies, such as digital PCR and Next-Generation Sequencing are emerging as particularly useful in AML. The 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations have incorporated MRD assessment to define the response criteria to therapy, and more recently, the ELN MRD Working Party has published guidelines for the use of MRD in clinical practice. SUMMARY: Morphologic complete remission (mCR) after induction therapy, has been consistently shown not only to have a critical prognostic role but also to fail in predicting relapse on an individual basis. Major attempts to improve our prediction capability have been made by measuring the residual levels of leukemic cells that persist in the bone marrow after chemotherapy. This number of cells, also called MRD, harbors in the bone marrow below the threshold of morphology and is responsible for leukemia recurrence. Therefore, the detection of MRD promises to help predict the risk of relapse, allowing a more proper patients' risk-stratification and the use of risk-tailored therapeutic strategy.","['Paterno, Giovangiacinto', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Venditti, Adriano']","['Paterno G', 'Del Principe MI', 'Venditti A']",,"['Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita Tor Vergata.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Onco-Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita Tor Vergata.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Onco-Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita Tor Vergata.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Onco-Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,,"['Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*etiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",,,2020/01/03 06:00,2020/06/04 06:00,['2020/01/03 06:00'],"['2020/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000566 [doi]', '00062752-202003000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2020 Mar;27(2):81-87. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000566.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, data regarding expression of CD49f protein in B lymphoblastic leukemia are limited, and whether CD49f protein expression varies among genetic subgroups of B lymphoblastic leukemia is unknown. METHODS: CD49f protein expression was characterized by flow cytometry in a series of 40 cases of B lymphoblastic leukemia, which included the genetic subgroups: KMT2A-rerranged, BCR-ABL1+, ETV6-RUNX1+, hypodiploidy, and hyperdiploidy. RESULTS: Expression of CD49f differed significantly among the five genetic subgroups studied, whether assessed by percentage of blasts positive for the antigen (p = .0001, Kruskal-Wallis) or median fluorescence intensity (MFI) (p = .0001, Kruskal-Wallis). Moreover, the percentage of CD49f+ blasts and MFI of CD49f were significantly lower in KMT2A-rearranged cases than in cases without KMT2A rearrangement (p = .0002 for both, Mann-Whitney). CONCLUSIONS: CD49f protein expression varies among genetic subgroups of B lymphoblastic leukemia, and is distinctly low in KMT2A-rearranged cases.","['Collins, Katrina', 'Cardinali, Jolene L', 'Mnayer, Laila O', 'DiGiuseppe, Joseph A']","['Collins K', 'Cardinali JL', 'Mnayer LO', 'DiGiuseppe JA']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9603-6731'],"['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Hartford Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Hartford Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Hartford Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Hartford Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200102,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

The pH of the mobile phase for AEX chromatography is typically set at half a unit below the isoelectric point (pI) of each mAb (i.e., pI - 0.5) or lower and, in combination with a low ionic strength, these conditions are usually satisfactory for both the recovery of the mAb and removal of impurities. However, we have recently encountered a tight binding of mAb1 to AEX resins under these standard chromatographic conditions. This anomalous adsorption behavior appears to be an effect of the asymmetric charge distribution on the surface of the mAb1. We found that mAb1 did not bind to the AEX resins if the mobile phase has a much lower pH and higher ionic strength, but those conditions would not allow adequate virus removal. We predicted that the use of membrane adsorbers might provide effective mAb1 purification, since the supporting matrix has a network structure that would be less susceptible to interactions with the asymmetric charge distribution on the protein surface. We tested the Natriflo HD-Q AEX membrane adsorber under standard chromatographic conditions and found that mAb1 flowed through the membrane adsorber, resulting in successful separation from murine leukemia virus. This AEX membrane adsorber is expected to be useful for process development because mAbs can be purified under similar standard chromatographic conditions regardless of their charge distributions.","['Masuda, Yumiko', 'Ogino, Yuka', 'Yamaichi, Kozo', 'Takahashi, Yusuke', 'Nonaka, Koichi', 'Wakamatsu, Kaori']","['Masuda Y', 'Ogino Y', 'Yamaichi K', 'Takahashi Y', 'Nonaka K', 'Wakamatsu K']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5548-7520'],"['Biologics Technology Research Laboratories, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd, Ohra-gun, Gunma, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Science and Technology, Gunma University, Kiryu-shi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Biologics Technology Research Laboratories, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd, Ohra-gun, Gunma, Japan.', 'Biologics Technology Research Laboratories, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd, Ohra-gun, Gunma, Japan.', 'Biologics Technology Research Laboratories, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd, Ohra-gun, Gunma, Japan.', 'Biologics Technology Research Laboratories, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd, Ohra-gun, Gunma, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Science and Technology, Gunma University, Kiryu-shi, Gunma, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200121,United States,Biotechnol Prog,Biotechnology progress,8506292,IM,,"['Adsorption/*genetics', 'Anion Exchange Resins/chemistry', 'Anions/chemistry', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/genetics/*isolation & purification', '*Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Humans', 'Viruses/chemistry/*isolation & purification']",['NOTNLM'],"['*anion exchange membrane adsorber', '*anomalous behavior', '*asymmetric charge distribution', '*monoclonal antibody', '*viral clearance']",2020/01/03 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2020/01/03 06:00'],"['2019/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/btpr.2955 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Prog. 2020 May;36(3):e2955. doi: 10.1002/btpr.2955.

Treatment-naive chronic phase CML cases were treated with dasatinib as frontline treatment. Dasatinib treatment was stopped for 26 patients who achieved deep molecular response (DMR) within 24 months and were able to maintain DMR for an additional 2 years. Ten patients (38.5%) achieved DMR maintenance after 12 months. Recurrence was confirmed in 16 patients, and the median recurrence-free survival time was 5.1 months. The cumulative DMR rates at six and 12 months after restarting treatment were 84.6% and 100%, respectively. The results of this study demonstrated that the DMR maintenance rate after 12 months was 38.5%, which was not significantly different from previous TKI stop trials. The 2-year dasatinib administration period after reaching DMR did not contribute to improve TFR rates.

However, LGLs expansion in nilotinib-treated patients is rare. We report the case of a 65-year-old patient with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who showed LGLs expansion during nilotinib treatment. The patient achieved complete remission (CR) after multi-agent chemotherapy combined with dasatinib treatment. However, ALL relapsed in the central nervous system and bone marrow when treatment was interrupted due to interstitial pneumonia. Nilotinib treatment was subsequently started and the patient achieved second CR. Marked peripheral blood lymphocytosis emerged after the start of nilotinib treatment. CD8 + CD57 + cytotoxic T cells were predominantly expanded and showed strong cytocidal activity against K562 Ph-positive leukemia cells. These results suggest that similar to dasatinib, nilotinib can induce LGLs expansion, possibly contributing to long-term remission in patients with Ph-ALL.","['Hagihara, Masao', 'Hua, Jian', 'Inoue, Morihiro', 'Uchida, Tomoyuki', 'Ide, Shiro', 'Ohara, Shin', 'Takaku, Tomoiku']","['Hagihara M', 'Hua J', 'Inoue M', 'Uchida T', 'Ide S', 'Ohara S', 'Takaku T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7143-4813'],"['Department of Hematology, Eiju General Hospital, 2-23-16 Higashi-Ueno, Taito-ku, Tokyo, 110-8645, Japan. hagihara@eijuhp.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Eiju General Hospital, 2-23-16 Higashi-Ueno, Taito-ku, Tokyo, 110-8645, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Eiju General Hospital, 2-23-16 Higashi-Ueno, Taito-ku, Tokyo, 110-8645, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Eiju General Hospital, 2-23-16 Higashi-Ueno, Taito-ku, Tokyo, 110-8645, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Eiju General Hospital, 2-23-16 Higashi-Ueno, Taito-ku, Tokyo, 110-8645, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Eiju General Hospital, 2-23-16 Higashi-Ueno, Taito-ku, Tokyo, 110-8645, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200101,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'CD57 Antigens', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*immunology', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD57', 'LGLs', 'Nilotinib', 'Ph-ALL', 'Remission']",2020/01/03 06:00,2020/09/08 06:00,['2020/01/03 06:00'],"['2019/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02789-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02789-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2020 May;111(5):719-723. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02789-6.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of Tan IIA in combination with imatinib (IM) on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of acute T lymphocytic leukemia TIB152 cells in vivo and in vitro, and analyze the potential underlying mechanism. Tan IIA and IM, alone and in combination, significantly inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of TIB152 cells, and promoted apoptosis; the effect of cotreatment with Tan IIA plus IM was enhanced. IGF1 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of TIB152 cells and inhibited apoptosis, while Tan IIA treatment significantly reversed these effects. In vivo experiments demonstrated that treatment with Tan IIA and IM, alone or in combination, significantly inhibited tumor growth in TIB152 xenograft mice; the growth inhibition of Tan IIA plus IM was the strongest observed. Western blot analysis revealed that the combination of Tan IIA and IM resulted in significantly lower levels of pPI3K, pAKT and pmTOR in cells and tissues compared with the IM and Tan alone treatment groups. In addition, the combination of Tan IIA and IM significantly decreased the levels of Ki67, cleaved caspase3, VEGF and MMP9 in cells and tissues, and the level of caspase3 was significantly increased. Taken together, the results revealed that Tan IIA enhanced the inhibitory effect of imatinib on TIB152 cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced apoptosis, which may be associated with inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.","['Teng, Zhi', 'Xu, Shijuan', 'Lei, Qin']","['Teng Z', 'Xu S', 'Lei Q']",,"['Department of Hematology, 215 Hospital of Shanxi Nuclear Industry, Xianyang, Shanxi 712000, P.R.

Thus, novel treatment strategies are urgently required. While the oncogenic kinase, proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 2 (PIM2), has been shown to be overexpressed in liver cancer, little is known about the role of PIM2 in this tumor entity. In this study, we explored the functional relevance and therapeutic potential of PIM2 in liver cancer. Using PIM2specific siRNAs, we examined the effects of PIM2 knockdown on proliferation (WST1 assays and spheroid assays), 3Dcolony formation and colony spread, apoptosis (flow cytometry and caspase 3/caspase 7 activity), as well as cell cycle progression (flow cytometry, RTqPCR and western blot analysis) in the two liver cancer cell lines, HepG2 and Huh7. In subcutaneous liver cancer xenografts, we assessed the effects of PIM2 knockdown on tumor growth via the systemic delivery of polyethylenimine (PEI)complexed siRNA. The knockdown of PIM2 resulted in potent antiproliferative effects in cells grown on plastic dishes, as well as in spheroids. This was due to G0/G1 cell cycle blockade and the subsequent downregulation of genes related to the S phase as well as the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, whereas the apoptotic rates remained unaltered. Furthermore, colony formation and colony spread were markedly inhibited by PIM2 knockdown. Notably, we found that HepG2 cells were more sensitive to PIM2 knockdown than the Huh7 cells. In vivo, the therapeutic nanoparticlemediated delivery of PIM2 siRNA led to profound antitumor effects in a liver cancer xenograft mouse model. On the whole, the findings of this study underscore the oncogenic role of PIM2 and emphasize the potential of targeted therapies based on the specific inhibition of PIM2 in liver cancer.","['Kronschnabl, Pia', 'Grunweller, Arnold', 'Hartmann, Roland K', 'Aigner, Achim', 'Weirauch, Ulrike']","['Kronschnabl P', 'Grunweller A', 'Hartmann RK', 'Aigner A', 'Weirauch U']",,"['RudolfBoehmInstitute for Pharmacology and Toxicology, Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Leipzig, D04107 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, PhilippsUniversity Marburg, D35037 Marburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, PhilippsUniversity Marburg, D35037 Marburg, Germany.', 'RudolfBoehmInstitute for Pharmacology and Toxicology, Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Leipzig, D04107 Leipzig, Germany.', 'RudolfBoehmInstitute for Pharmacology and Toxicology, Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Leipzig, D04107 Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191210,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Nanoparticles/administration & dosage', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Spheroids, Cellular', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2020/01/03 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/01/03 06:00'],"['2019/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.2019.4936 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2020 Feb;56(2):448-459. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2019.4936.

The translation initiation factor, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), is induced in a number of cancer cell lines and is one such candidate for therapeutic intervention. Friend leukemia integration 1 (FLI1) is a potent oncogenic transcription factor that promotes various types of cancer by promoting several hallmarks of cancer progression. FLI1 has recently been implicated in protein translation through yet unknown mechanisms. This study identified a positive association between FLI1 expression and mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK)interacting serine/threonine kinase1 (MKNK1), the immediate upstream regulator of the eIF4E initiation factor. The short hairpin RNA (shRNA)mediated silencing or overexpression of FLI1 in leukemic cell lines downregulated or upregulated MKNK1 expression, respectively. Promoter analysis identified a potent FLI1 binding site in the regulatory region of the MKNK1 promoter. In transient transfection experiments, FLI1 increased MKNK1 promoter activity, which was blocked by mutating the FLI1 binding site. FLI1 specifically affected the expression of MKNK1, but not that of MKNK2. The siRNAmediated downregulation of MKNK1 downregulated the expression of survivin (BIRC5) and significantly suppressed cell proliferation in culture. FLI1 inhibitory compounds were shown to downregulate this oncogene through the suppression of MAPK/extracellularregulated kinase (ERK) signaling and the subsequent activation of miR145, leading to a lower MKNK1 expression and the suppression of leukemic growth. These results uncover a critical role for FLI1 in the control of protein translation and the importance of targeting its function and downstream mediators, such as MKNK1, for cancer therapy.","['Wang, Chunlin', 'Song, Jialei', 'Liu, Wuling', 'Yao, Yao', 'Kapranov, Philipp', 'Sample, Klarke M', 'Gajendran, Babu', 'Zacksenhaus, Eldad', 'Hao, Xiaojiang', 'Ben-David, Yaacov']","['Wang C', 'Song J', 'Liu W', 'Yao Y', 'Kapranov P', 'Sample KM', 'Gajendran B', 'Zacksenhaus E', 'Hao X', 'Ben-David Y']",,"['State Key Laboratory for Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Province Science City, High Tech Zone, Baiyun, Guiyang, Guizhou 550014, P.R.

Methods Lentivirus was used to infect NB4 and U937 cells to overexpress NLS-RARalpha. Fluorescent microscope, real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were performed to measure the mRNA and protein expression of NLS-RARalpha, CD11b and CEBPbeta. Modified Wright staining was used to observe the cell morphology. Results NLS-RARalpha was overexpressed successfully after the lentivirus infection. Overexpressed NLS-RARalpha could repress the expression of CD11b and CEBPbeta. NLS-RARalpha could be degraded by ATRA in a concentration- and time-dependent manner; ATRA promoted cell differentiation in both negative control cells and NLS-RARalpha-overexpressing cells.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed between June 2006 and June 2017 at a tertiary care center in Canada. Potential predictors of venous thromboembolism were evaluated using logistic regression and a risk score was derived based on weighed variables and compared using survival analysis. Internal validation was conducted using nonparametric bootstrapping. A total of 501 leukemia patients (427 myeloid and 74 lymphoblastic) were included. Venous thromboembolism occurred in 77(15.3%) patients with 71 events occurring in the first year. A prediction score was derived and validated and it included: previous history of venous thromboembolism (3 points), lymphoblastic leukemia (2 points), and platelet count > 50 x 10(9)/L at the time of diagnosis (1 point). The overall cumulative incidence of venous thromboembolism was 44% in the high-risk group (>/= 3 points) versus 10.5% in the low-risk group (0-2 points) and it was consistent at different follow-up periods (log-rank p < 0.001).

In the tumor microenvironment, immune cells are one of the most important niche factors, capable of mounting dynamic innate or adoptive responses against leukemic cells. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a systemic cancer accompanied by immune disruption. In order to exploit the enhanced activity of immune cells in AML treatment, the use of syngeneic mouse models is necessary. Studies of crosstalk between cancer blast cells and immune cells in syngeneic mouse models are beneficial, as the absence of immune functions in syngeneic models enables focus on cancer-associated immune reactions. Once AML is induced, innate and adoptive immune cells respond differently, ultimately resulting in suppression of the immune cells. Murine AML models are commonly induced by intravenous or subcutaneous injection of C1498 cells. Despite the popularity of murine models, they have not yet resulted in the elucidation of distinct differences in immune cells by the injection method. Here, we investigated the frequency of immune cells and survival rate of mice with AML induced using both injection methods.","['Kim, Dae Yong', 'Lee, Sarah', 'Kim, Dong Yu', 'Lee, Ji Yoon']","['Kim DY', 'Lee S', 'Kim DY', 'Lee JY']",,"['Department of Pharmaceutical Science & Engineering, Seowon University, Chungbuk, Cheongju, South Korea. dykim@seowon.ac.kr.', 'Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science, College of Health Sciences, Sangji University, Gangwon, Wonju, Republic of Korea.', 'Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Gangwon, Wonju, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, CHA Stem Cell Institute, CHA University, Gyeonggi-do, Seongnam, Republic of Korea. leejiyoon@cha.ac.kr.', 'Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science, College of Health Sciences, Sangji University, Gangwon, Wonju, Republic of Korea. leejiyoon@cha.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Tumor Microenvironment/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Immune cells', 'Intravenous injection', 'Leukemia', 'Murine model', 'Subcutaneous injection']",2020/01/02 06:00,2020/01/09 06:00,['2020/01/02 06:00'],"['2020/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-3-030-34461-0_53 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2020;1232:415-420. doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-34461-0_53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results: Based on independent prognostic membrane genes, we constructed a regression model for CN-AML prognosis prediction: score = (0.0492 * CD52) - (0.0018 * CD96) + (0.0131 * EMP1) + (0.2058 * TSPAN2) + (0.0234 * STAB1) - (0.3658 * MBTPS1), which was named as MPG6 (6-Membrane Protein Gene) score. Tested in multiple CN-AML datasets, consistent results showed that CN-AML patients with high MPG6 score had poor survival, higher WBC count and shorter EFS. Comparing with other reported scoring models, the benchmark result of MPG6 achieved better association with survival in multiple cohorts. Moreover, by combining with other clinical indicators in CN-AML, MPG6 could improve the performance of survival prediction and serve as a robust prognostic factor. Conclusions: We identified the MPG6 score as a stable indicator with great potential for clinical application in risk stratification and outcome prediction in CN-AML.","['Lin, Sheng-Yan', 'Miao, Ya-Ru', 'Hu, Fei-Fei', 'Hu, Hui', 'Zhang, Qiong', 'Li, Qiubai', 'Chen, Zhichao', 'Guo, An-Yuan']","['Lin SY', 'Miao YR', 'Hu FF', 'Hu H', 'Zhang Q', 'Li Q', 'Chen Z', 'Guo AY']",,"['Hubei Bioinformatics & Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics & Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics & Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics & Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics & Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics & Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200101,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia', 'MPG6 (6-Membrane Protein Gene) score', 'membrane protein genes', 'outcome prediction.', 'risk stratification']",2020/01/02 06:00,2020/01/02 06:01,['2020/01/02 06:00'],"['2019/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.35382 [doi]', 'jcav11p0251 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2020 Jan 1;11(1):251-259. doi: 10.7150/jca.35382. eCollection 2020.,PMC6930412,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,['(c) The author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective, longitudinal cohort study set between January 2010 and December 2016. RESULTS: Generally, high-dose cytarabine Ied to better survival compared to anthracycline-containing consolidation therapy, as expected. However, for patients not undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), anthracycline use was not necessarily associated with worse survival, depending on the number of consolidation cycles. Post-remission, pre-HSCT consolidation with high-dose cytarabine did not negatively affect survival compared to previous reports. For those without FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutation, anthracycline use was associated with a worse survival, but for those with mutation, anthracycline use did not negatively affect survival. CONCLUSION: For patients who are ineligible for HSCT, selective use of anthracycline consolidation can be a viable option, while for patients with the intention of HSCT, post-remission high-dose cytarabine is a reasonable option in the absence of available donors.","['Byun, Ja Min', 'Lee, Jeong-Ok', 'Suh, Koung Jin', 'Lee, Jiyun', 'Shin, Dong-Yeop', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Hong, Junshik', 'Bang, Soo-Mee', 'Kim, Inho', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo']","['Byun JM', 'Lee JO', 'Suh KJ', 'Lee J', 'Shin DY', 'Koh Y', 'Hong J', 'Bang SM', 'Kim I', 'Yoon SS']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea jeongok77@gmail.com.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anthracyclines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'anthracycline', 'consolidation']",2020/01/02 06:00,2020/01/11 06:00,['2020/01/02 06:00'],"['2019/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['40/1/357 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.13960 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2020 Jan;40(1):357-366. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.13960.,,,,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']","['Copyright(c) 2020, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deregulated JAK-STAT signaling causes myeloproliferative neoplasms, leukaemia, and lymphomas, as well as autoimmune diseases. Thereby JAKs have gained significant relevance as therapeutic targets. However, there is still a clinical need for better JAK inhibitors and novel strategies targeting regions outside the conserved kinase domain have gained interest. In-depth knowledge about the molecular details of JAK activation is required. For example, whether the function and regulation between receptors is conserved remains an open question. We used JAK-deficient cell-lines and structure-based mutagenesis to study the function of JAK1 and its pseudokinase domain (JH2) in cytokine signaling pathways that employ JAK1 with different JAK heterodimerization partner. In interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced STAT5 activation JAK1 was dominant over JAK3 but in interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) and interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) signaling both JAK1 and heteromeric partner JAK2 or TYK2 were both indispensable for STAT1 activation. Moreover, IL-2 signaling was strictly dependent on both JAK1 JH1 and JH2 but in IFNgamma signaling JAK1 JH2 rather than kinase activity was required for STAT1 activation. To investigate the regulatory function, we focused on two allosteric regions in JAK1 JH2, the ATP-binding pocket and the alphaC-helix. Mutating L633 at the alphaC reduced basal and cytokine induced activation of STAT in both JAK1 wild-type (WT) and constitutively activated mutant backgrounds. Moreover, biochemical characterization and comparison of JH2s let us depict differences in the JH2 ATP-binding and strengthen the hypothesis that de-stabilization of the domain disturbs the regulatory JH1-JH2 interaction. Collectively, our results bring mechanistic understanding about the function of JAK1 in different receptor complexes that likely have relevance for the design of specific JAK modulators.","['Raivola, Juuli', 'Haikarainen, Teemu', 'Silvennoinen, Olli']","['Raivola J', 'Haikarainen T', 'Silvennoinen O']",,"['Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences, Tampere University, 33014 Tampere, Finland.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences, Tampere University, 33014 Tampere, Finland.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences, Tampere University, 33014 Tampere, Finland.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, Helsinki Institute of Life Science HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, 00014 Helsinki, Finland.', 'Fimlab Laboratories, Fimlab, 33520 Tampere, Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191227,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK', 'STAT', 'cancer', 'cytokine', 'cytokine receptor', 'inflammation']",2020/01/02 06:00,2020/01/02 06:01,['2020/01/02 06:00'],"['2019/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/02 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12010078 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12010078 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Dec 27;12(1). pii: cancers12010078. doi: 10.3390/cancers12010078.,PMC7016850,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dietary intake and redox measures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 32 pediatric leukemia and lymphoma patients were collected over six months during treatment. Baseline measures when patients were off chemotherapy and subsequent assessments were collected after one, two and six months. Oxidative stress increased over time in all patients, consistent with chemotherapy-induced redox effects. Older and younger children showed significantly different baseline levels of reactive oxygen species, which increased over time in all age ranges. Diet was assessed at points proximal to oxidative stress measurements and revealed a novel association with consumption of animal protein, vegetable protein, and total protein intake. Our findings demonstrate that chemotherapy increases oxidative stress in pediatric leukemia patients, and raises the possibility that dietary protein or altered protein metabolism could contribute to clinical outcomes.","['Raber, Margaret', 'Wu, Jimin', 'Donnella, Hayley', 'Knouse, Phillip', 'Pise, Mayurika', 'Munsell, Mark', 'Liu, Diane', 'Chandra, Joya']","['Raber M', 'Wu J', 'Donnella H', 'Knouse P', 'Pise M', 'Munsell M', 'Liu D', 'Chandra J']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2403-9607'],"['Department of Pediatric Research, University of Texas MD Anderson, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Research, University of Texas MD Anderson, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Research, University of Texas MD Anderson, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Research, University of Texas MD Anderson, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Research, University of Texas MD Anderson, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191227,Switzerland,Nutrients,Nutrients,101521595,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dietary Proteins/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*blood/drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/chemistry/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*blood/diet therapy', 'Male', 'Nutritional Status/*physiology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects/physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/blood']",['NOTNLM'],"['childhood cancer', 'nutrition', 'oxidative stress']",2020/01/02 06:00,2020/08/21 06:00,['2020/01/02 06:00'],"['2019/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['nu12010075 [pii]', '10.3390/nu12010075 [doi]']",epublish,Nutrients. 2019 Dec 27;12(1). pii: nu12010075. doi: 10.3390/nu12010075.,PMC7019785,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'not applicable/Gerber Foundation', 'P30-CA16672/NH/NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dietary Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current analysis examined VOD/SOS risk and outcomes in a cohort of patients who in recent years were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. Adults with AML who had GO exposure before myeloablative alloHCT were matched 1:4 by age and disease status at transplant to recipients without GO exposure (control subjects). One hundred thirty-seven patients with GO exposure and 548 matched control subjects who underwent alloHCT between 2008 and 2011 were included in this analysis. With a median approximately 8-year follow-up of survivors, the 5-year overall survival probability was similar in the 2 cohorts: 38% and 38% in the GO-exposed versus control groups (P = .97). Incidence of VOD/SOS and severe VOD/SOS, respectively, at 100 days was 4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1% to 7%) and 3% (95% CI, 1% to 6%) in GO-exposed patients and 3% (95% CI, 2% to 5%) and 1% (95% CI, 0% to 2%) in control subjects. Correspondingly, among patients who developed VOD/SOS, 1-year survival probability after VOD/SOS diagnosis was 33% (95% CI, 5% to 72%) and 27% (95% CI, 11% to 47%; P = .78). In multivariate analyses, GO exposure before alloHCT was not associated with an increased risk of VOD/SOS (odds ratio, 1.10; P = .85) or death (hazard ratio, 1.08; P = .57). Three deaths (3%) in the GO group and 3 deaths (<1%) in the control group were attributed to VOD/SOS.

AIM OF THE STUDY: Present work was conducted to isolate and identify the active compounds of the selected herbal drugs using bio-assay guided fractionation and also to investigate their anticancer mechanism in leukemia cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bio-assay guided fractionation was used for the isolation of active constituents such as myricitrin, vitexin and vanillin from the aqueous extracts of M. longifolia, P. cineraria and F. indica, respectively using liquid partitioning and column chromatography and the compounds were characterized by HPLC, MS and NMR. Dose and time-dependent cytotoxicity of isolated compounds were studied against leukemia cells and their anticancer mechanism such as cell wall damage, nuclear damage, ROS and NO generation, SOD level, LDH release and lipid peroxidation were investigated. RESULTS: Aqueous extract of M. longifolia, P. cineraria and F. indica exhibited maximum anti-proliferative activity against HL-60 (Acute myeloid leukemia, AML, 72.06%), K-562 (Chronic myeloid leukemia, CML, 42.14%) and Jurkat (Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL, 51.71%) cells. Myricitrin, vitexin and vanillin exhibited dose-dependent (IC-50 values 164.4, 147 & 29.22 mug/ml) and time-dependent activity with maximum cytotoxicity at 48 h. All these three compounds caused apoptosis in leukemia cells by inducing free radicals such as ROS (1.33-2.65 Arbitrary units) and NO (11.17-18.53 muM), cell membrane damage and nuclear condensation which were evidenced by increased release of LDH (1326-1439 U/L), improved lipid peroxidation (10.19-14.41 nM/mg protein) and reduced SOD level (6.2-9.21 U/mg protein) in leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: Based on anti-proliferative activity, the isolated phyto-compounds myrcitrin, vitexin and vanillin from M. longifolia, P. cineraria and F. indica could be developed as natural drugs for treating AML, CML and ALL leukemia types, respectively.","['Sarkar, Monaj Kumar', 'Mahapatra, Santanu Kar', 'Vadivel, Vellingiri']","['Sarkar MK', 'Mahapatra SK', 'Vadivel V']",,"['Chemical Biology Lab (ASK-II-409), School of Chemical and Biotechnology (SCBT), SASTRA Deemed University, Thanjavur, Tamilnadu, India.', 'Medicinal Chemistry and Immunology Lab (ASK-II-406), School of Chemical and Biotechnology (SCBT), SASTRA Deemed University, Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India.

Many studies have provided evidence that both genetic and environmental factors induce atherosclerosis, leading thus to cardiovascular complications. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease, and aging is strongly associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Recent experimental evidence suggests that clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an emerging cardiovascular risk factor that contributes to the development of atherosclerosis and cardiac dysfunction and exacerbates cardiovascular diseases. CH is caused by somatic mutations in recurrent genes in hematopoietic stem cells, leading to the clonal expansion of mutated blood cell clones. Many of the mutated genes are known in the context of myeloid neoplasms. However, only some individuals carrying CH mutations develop hematologic abnormalities. CH is clearly age dependent and is not rare: at least 10%-20% of people >70 years old carry CH. The newly discovered association between myeloid leukemia-driver mutations and the progression of CVDs has raised medical interest. In this review, we summarize the current view on the contribution of CH in different cardiovascular diseases, CVD risk assessment, patient stratification, and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.","['Pardali, Evangelia', 'Dimmeler, Stefanie', 'Zeiher, Andreas M', 'Rieger, Michael A']","['Pardali E', 'Dimmeler S', 'Zeiher AM', 'Rieger MA']",,"['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Cardiovascular Regeneration, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany; Partner Site Rhine-Main, German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Berlin, Germany.', 'Partner Site Rhine-Main, German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Berlin, Germany; Department of Medicine, Cardiology, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; Frankfurt Cancer Institute, Frankfurt, Germany.

Herein, novel 2D arsenene nanosheets were synthesized and shown to be effective against NB4 promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) cells (82 % inhibition) as well as inducing apoptosis while showing no toxicity towards normal cells. The high zeta potential, small size, and the planar structure were crucial to the toxicity of the materials. Label-free proteomic profiling analysis suggested that arsenene affected nuclear DNA replication, nucleotide excision repair, and pyrimidine metabolism pathways by downregulating the DNA polymerases POLE, POLD1, POLD2, and POLD3. Mass spectrometric studies showed that arsenene bound mainly to nuclear nucleotide acid binding proteins in NB4 cells and further cellular fluorescence studies revealed that the arsenene destroyed the nuclei.

We retrospectively evaluated 234 MDS patients treated with azacytidine (AZA). The total number of AZA cycles was 2886 (median 8 cycles per patient). There were 111 episodes of PI (3.8% of AZA cycles) in 81 patients (34.6%). PIs were considered of fungal origin in 27 cases (24.3%), associated to bacteremia in 11 cases (9.9%), to influenza infection in two cases (1.8%) and of unknown origin in the remaining 71 cases (64.0%). Forty-five PI episodes were documented in cycles 1 to 4 of AZA (5.1% of 875 cycles) and the remaining 66 episodes beyond the fourth cycle (3.2% of 2011 cycles) (P = .017). Overall, a fungal PI was documented in 13/875 (1.5%) cycles 1 to 4 and in 13/2011 (0.6%) cycles beyond the fourth cycle (P = .001). A baseline chronic pulmonary disease was significantly associated to a higher risk of severe PIs. In the survival analysis, cases of PI in patients who progressed to acute leukemia (PAL) were excluded, in view of the predominant influence of PAL on the outcome of the patients. A PI unrelated to PAL documented during the first 4 AZA cycles was an independent factor predicting lower survival (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.37-3.33; P = .001). In conclusion, PIs are common in MDS patients receiving AZA, in particular during the first cycles of treatment and are associated with an unfavorable outcome.

Here we report the discovery and characterization of a novel long noncoding RNA, Hmrhl, which shares synteny and partial sequence similarity with the mouse lncRNA, Mrhl. The human homolog, Hmrhl, transcribed from intron 14 of phkb gene, is 5.5kb in size, expressed in all tissues examined and is associated with chromatin. Analysis of Hmrhl locus using ENCODE database revealed that it exhibits hallmarks of enhancers like the open chromatin configuration, binding of transcription factors, enhancer specific histone signature etc. in the K562 Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) cells. We compared the expression of Hmrhl in the normal lymphoblast cell line, GM12878, with that of K562cells and lymphoma samples and show that it is highly upregulated in leukemia as well as several cases of lymphoma. Further, we validated the enhancer properties of Hmrhl locus in K562cells with the help of ChIP-qPCR and Luciferase assay. Moreover, siRNA mediated down-regulation of Hmrhl in K562cells leads to a concomitant down regulation of its parent gene, phkb, showing that Hmrhl functions as an enhancer RNA and positively regulates its host gene, phkb, in chronic myelogenous leukemia. This study is significant in view of the fact that a better understanding of mechanism of gene regulation under normal conditions and its perturbation in cancer could in turn help in its therapeutic intervention through molecular medicine/RNA based drug discovery.","['Fatima, Roshan', 'Choudhury, Subhendu Roy', 'T R, Divya', 'Bhaduri, Utsa', 'Rao, M R S']","['Fatima R', 'Choudhury SR', 'T R D', 'Bhaduri U', 'Rao MRS']",,"['Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bangalore, India.', 'Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bangalore, India.', 'Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bangalore, India.', 'Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bangalore, India.', 'Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bangalore, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190808,Netherlands,Noncoding RNA Res,Non-coding RNA research,101688191,,,,,,2020/01/01 06:00,2020/01/01 06:01,['2020/01/01 06:00'],"['2019/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.ncrna.2019.08.001 [doi]', 'S2468-0540(19)30009-5 [pii]']",epublish,Noncoding RNA Res. 2019 Aug 8;4(3):96-108. doi: 10.1016/j.ncrna.2019.08.001. eCollection 2019 Sep.,PMC6926186,,,,"['(c) 2019 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of KeAi Communications', 'Co., Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, the term auto-induction describes cell culture media which eliminates the need for manual induction of protein expression. Culturing Clearcoli cells in autoinduction media significantly reduces the hands-on time required during extract preparation, and the resulting ""endotoxin-free"" cell extract maintained the same cell-free protein synthesis capability as extract produced with traditional induction as demonstrated by the high-yield expression of crisantaspase, an FDA approved leukemia therapeutic.

Poor oral health can complicate oncology treatment, negatively affecting a child's health. In children undergoing chemotherapy or bone marrow transplant, odontogenic infections can progress to life-threatening sepsis. The aim of this study is to investigate the oral health among children attending an oncology clinic in Trinidad. Material and Methods: Sample population included paediatric oncology patients attending a children's hospital in Trinidad. Subsequent to obtaining informed consent, a 14-item questionnaire was administered to parents/caregivers. An intra-oral examination was undertaken by two dentists to assess soft tissues, gingival health, and dentition status, using visual examination only. Results: Seventy-one children and their caregivers participated in the study. The children consisted of both patients warded or attending as outpatients; 53.5% of patients were male and the mean age 6.64 (SD 3.33) years with a range of 1 to 15 years. Gingivitis and mucositis were present among 41.3% and 3% of patients, respectively. The prevalence of visible dental caries was 54.3%. Caries experience (dmft) was 2.28 (SD 3.63), and for those children with some caries experience (dmft > 0), this was 5.59 (SD 3.72). The majority (62.5%) had never visited a dentist. The most common dental treatment needs were dental prophylaxis (98.4%) and restorative treatment (50.8%). Acute lymphocytic leukaemia (39.1%) was the most common malignancy among this sample, and patients were at varying stages of cancer treatment. Conclusions: Oral health among this sample of paediatric oncology patients was generally poor, with untreated caries being common, and the majority of children not having had any previous dental care. Preventive dental care for these patients should include oral hygiene instruction, dietary advice, topical fluoride application along with management of carious lesions, and odontogenic infections. This preliminary study highlights the need for closer collaboration between general dental practitioners, paediatric dentists, and paediatric oncology physicians, in caring for these patients.","['Kowlessar, Anne', 'Naidu, Rahul', 'Ramroop, Visha', 'Nurse, Janelle', 'Dookie, Kavita', 'Bodkyn, Curt', 'Lalchandani, Sanjay']","['Kowlessar A', 'Naidu R', 'Ramroop V', 'Nurse J', 'Dookie K', 'Bodkyn C', 'Lalchandani S']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7588-9877'],"['School of Dentistry University of the West Indies, St. Augustine Campus St. Augustine Trinidad and Tobago.', 'School of Dentistry University of the West Indies, St. Augustine Campus St. Augustine Trinidad and Tobago.', 'School of Dentistry University of the West Indies, St. Augustine Campus St. Augustine Trinidad and Tobago.', 'School of Dentistry University of the West Indies, St. Augustine Campus St. Augustine Trinidad and Tobago.', 'School of Dentistry University of the West Indies, St. Augustine Campus St. Augustine Trinidad and Tobago.', 'School of Dentistry University of the West Indies, St. Augustine Campus St. Augustine Trinidad and Tobago.', 'Department of Medical Sciences Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex Mt Hope Trinidad and Tobago.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190816,United States,Clin Exp Dent Res,Clinical and experimental dental research,101692332,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Caregivers/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dental Caries/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Oral Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Oral Hygiene/*statistics & numerical data', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Prevalence', 'Trinidad and Tobago/epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*neoplasm', '*oral health', '*paediatrics']",2020/01/01 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/01/01 06:00'],"['2019/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1002/cre2.232 [doi]', 'CRE2232 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Exp Dent Res. 2019 Aug 16;5(6):665-669. doi: 10.1002/cre2.232. eCollection 2019 Dec.,PMC6934352,['The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.'],,,"['(c)2019 The Authors.

We aimed to clarify the role of macrophages in oral leukoplakia, which is the most common oral potentially malignant disorder from immunotolerance viewpoint. Materials and methods: The study included 24 patients who underwent surgical resection for tongue leukoplakia. The relationships between macrophage markers and clinicopathological factors were assessed. Conditioned medium was harvested from the CD163(+) human monocytic leukaemia cell line, THP-1. The phenotypic alteration of human oral keratinocytes by the conditioned medium treatment was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, the clinical samples were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Results: Tongue leukoplakia tissues with high CD163(+) macrophage infiltration were associated with significantly higher degrees of epithelial dysplasia, abnormal Ki-67 expression and cytokeratin13 loss when compared with the tissues with low CD163(+) macrophage infiltration. In vitro, CD163(+) THP-1 conditioned medium induced immunosuppressive molecules, especially interleukin-10 (IL-10) in human oral keratinocytes. The IL-10 expression levels showed significant positive correlations with not only the numbers of FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells but also that of CD163(+) macrophages.

Since data related to the importance of HIF1 and 2 in hematopoietic stem and progenitors is conflicting, we investigated the chromatin binding profiles of HIF1 and HIF2 and linked that to transcriptional networks and the cellular metabolic state. Methods: Genome-wide ChIPseq and ChIP-PCR experiments were performed to identify HIF1 and HIF2 binding sites in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and healthy CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Transcriptome studies were performed to identify gene expression changes induced by hypoxia or by overexpression of oxygen-insensitive HIF1 and HIF2 mutants. Metabolism studies were performed by 1D-NMR, and glucose consumption and lactate production levels were determined by spectrophotometric enzyme assays. CRISPR-CAS9-mediated HIF1, HIF2, and ARNT(-/-) lines were generated to study the functional consequences upon loss of HIF signaling, in vitro and in vivo upon transplantation of knockout lines in xenograft mice. Results: Genome-wide ChIP-seq and transcriptome studies revealed that overlapping HIF1- and HIF2-controlled loci were highly enriched for various processes including metabolism, particularly glucose metabolism, but also for chromatin organization, cellular response to stress and G protein-coupled receptor signaling. ChIP-qPCR validation studies confirmed that glycolysis-related genes but not genes related to the TCA cycle or glutaminolysis were controlled by both HIF1 and HIF2 in leukemic cell lines and primary AMLs, while in healthy human CD34(+) cells these loci were predominantly controlled by HIF1 and not HIF2. However, and in contrast to our initial hypotheses, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of HIF signaling did not affect growth, internal metabolite concentrations, glucose consumption or lactate production under hypoxia, not even in vivo upon transplantation of knockout cells into xenograft mice. Conclusion: These data indicate that, while HIFs exert control over glycolysis but not OxPHOS gene expression in human leukemic cells, this is not critically important for their metabolic state. In contrast, inhibition of BCR-ABL did impact on glucose consumption and lactate production regardless of the presence of HIFs. These data indicate that oncogene-mediated control over glycolysis can occur independently of hypoxic signaling modules.","['Wierenga, Albertus T J', 'Cunningham, Alan', 'Erdem, Aysegul', 'Lopera, Nuria Vilaplana', 'Brouwers-Vos, Annet Z', 'Pruis, Maurien', 'Mulder, Andre B', 'Gunther, Ulrich L', 'Martens, Joost H A', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob']","['Wierenga ATJ', 'Cunningham A', 'Erdem A', 'Lopera NV', 'Brouwers-Vos AZ', 'Pruis M', 'Mulder AB', 'Gunther UL', 'Martens JHA', 'Vellenga E', 'Schuringa JJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8452-8555'],"['Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, Groningen, 9700RB The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, 9700RB Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, Groningen, 9700RB The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, Groningen, 9700RB The Netherlands.', '3Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.0000 0004 1936 7486grid.6572.6', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, Groningen, 9700RB The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, Groningen, 9700RB The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, 9700RB Groningen, The Netherlands.', '3Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.0000 0004 1936 7486grid.6572.6', '4Department of Molecular Biology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (RIMLS), Nijmegen, The Netherlands.grid.461760.2', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, Groningen, 9700RB The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, Groningen, 9700RB The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191227,England,Cancer Metab,Cancer & metabolism,101607582,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'BCR-ABL', 'Glycolysis', 'Human hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hypoxia', 'Hypoxia induced factors (HIFs)']",2020/01/01 06:00,2020/01/01 06:01,['2020/01/01 06:00'],"['2019/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40170-019-0206-y [doi]', '206 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Metab. 2019 Dec 27;7:11. doi: 10.1186/s40170-019-0206-y. eCollection 2019.,PMC6935105,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,['(c) The Author(s). 2019.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EBV plays an important role promoting lymphomagenesis, although the precise mechanisms remain elusive. EBV-positive lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) are more common in East Asia (China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan), and Latin America suggesting a strong genetic predisposition. The revised 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) lymphoma classification recognizes the following malignant NK- and T-cell lymphomas; extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTCL), aggressive NK-cell leukemia (ANKL), and the provisional entity within the group of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS) ""primary EBV-positive nodal T or NK cell lymphoma"". Disorders presenting mainly in children and young adults include chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV) - systemic and cutaneous forms - which are not considered malignant disorders but were included in the WHO classification for the first time because of the differential diagnosis with other T- or NK-cell lymphomas. CAEBV, cutaneous form, includes hydroa vacciniforme-like LPD (HV-LPD) and severe mosquito bite allergy (SMBA). Finally, systemic EBV-positive T-cell lymphoma of childhood was recognized as lymphoma because of its fulminant clinical course. Given the shared pathogenesis of these disorders, overlapping features are common demanding a close clinical, morphological and molecular correlation for an accurate diagnosis. This review summarizes the clinical, histopathological and molecular features of EBV-associated T and NK-cell LPD, highlighting the main features that might aid in the differential diagnosis.","['Montes-Mojarro, Ivonne A', 'Kim, Wook Youn', 'Fend, Falko', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia']","['Montes-Mojarro IA', 'Kim WY', 'Fend F', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L']",,"['Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology and Comprehensive Cancer Center Tubingen, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard-Karls-University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology and Comprehensive Cancer Center Tubingen, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard-Karls-University, Tubingen, Germany; Department of Pathology, Konkuk University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology and Comprehensive Cancer Center Tubingen, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard-Karls-University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology and Comprehensive Cancer Center Tubingen, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard-Karls-University, Tubingen, Germany.

METHODS: A national cohort of ALL patients (2-18 years) was included. Sleep-wake rhythms were measured using actigraphy and generated the following variables: Interdaily stability (IS): higher IS reflects higher stability; intradaily variability (IV): lower IV indicates less fragmentation; L5 and M10 counts: activity counts during the five least and 10 most active hours, respectively; and relative amplitude (RA): the ratio of L5 and M10 counts (higher RA reflects a more robust rhythm). The melatonin metabolite, 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s), was assessed in urine. Cancer-related fatigue was assessed with the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale. Using regression models sleep-wake rhythms, aMT6s, and cancer-related fatigue were compared to healthy children and associations between sleep-wake outcomes and cancer-related fatigue were assessed in ALL patients. RESULTS: In total, 126 patients participated (response rate: 67%). IS, RA, and M10 counts were lower in patients compared to healthy children (p < 0.001). aMT6s levels were comparable to healthy children (p = 0.425). Patients with ALL were more fatigued compared to healthy children (p < 0.001). Lower IS, RA and M10 counts and higher IV were significantly associated with more parent-reported cancer-related fatigue. Associations between sleep-wake rhythms and self-reported cancer-related fatigue were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep-wake rhythm impairment is associated with more cancer-related fatigue in pediatric ALL patients. Interventions aimed to improve sleep hygiene and encourage physical activity may reduce cancer-related fatigue.","['Steur, Lindsay M H', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Van Someren, Eus J W', 'Van Eijkelenburg, Natasha K A', 'Van der Sluis, Inge M', 'Dors, Natasja', 'Van den Bos, Cor', 'Tissing, Wim J E', 'Grootenhuis, Martha A', 'Van Litsenburg, Raphaele R L']","['Steur LMH', 'Kaspers GJL', 'Van Someren EJW', 'Van Eijkelenburg NKA', 'Van der Sluis IM', 'Dors N', 'Van den Bos C', 'Tissing WJE', 'Grootenhuis MA', 'Van Litsenburg RRL']",,"[""Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Sleep and Cognition, Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (An Institute of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Integrative Neurophysiology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Center for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research (CNCR), VU University Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Psychiatry, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Sophia Children's Hospital, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Amalia Children's Hospital, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', ""Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Sleep,Sleep,7809084,IM,,"['Actigraphy', 'Child', '*Circadian Rhythm', 'Fatigue/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Sleep']",['NOTNLM'],"['*actigraphy', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*cancer-related fatigue', '*children sleep-wake rhythms', '*physical activity']",2020/01/01 06:00,2021/04/15 06:00,['2020/01/01 06:00'],"['2019/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['5691200 [pii]', '10.1093/sleep/zsz320 [doi]']",ppublish,Sleep. 2020 Jun 15;43(6). pii: 5691200. doi: 10.1093/sleep/zsz320.,PMC7294409,,,,"['(c) Sleep Research Society 2019.

After infecting the host, EBV establishes a latent infection, with low levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression, evolved to evade immune recognition. Conversely, EBV microRNAs (miRNA) are expressed ubiquitously and abundantly within infected cells. Their role in tumor biology and clinical outcomes across the spectrum of cancer is not fully explained. Here, we applied our bioinformatics pipeline for quantitative EBV miRNA detection to examine sequencing data of 8,955 individual tumor samples across 27 tumor types representing the breadth of cancer. We uncover an association of intermediate levels of viral miRNA with decreased survival in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (P = 0.00013). Prognostic modeling of this association suggests that increased EBV miRNA levels represent an independent risk factor for poor patient outcomes. Furthermore, we explore differences in expression between elevated and absent viral miRNA loads in adult AML tumors finding that EBV positivity was associated with proinflammatory signals. Together, given no associations were found for pediatric AML, our analyses suggests EBV positivity has the potential for being a prognostic biomarker and might represent a surrogate measure related to immune impairment in adult patients.","['Movassagh, Mercedeh', 'Oduor, Cliff', 'Forconi, Catherine', 'Moormann, Ann M', 'Bailey, Jeffrey A']","['Movassagh M', 'Oduor C', 'Forconi C', 'Moormann AM', 'Bailey JA']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6899-8204'],"['Department of Bioinformatics and Integrative Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Center for Global Health Research, Kenya Medical Research Institute, Kisumu, Kenya.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Technology, Maseno University, Maseno, Kenya.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Integrative Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA. jeffrey_bailey@brown.edu.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA. jeffrey_bailey@brown.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191230,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,,"['Computational Biology/methods', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications/*virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/etiology/*mortality/pathology', '*MicroRNAs', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*RNA, Viral', 'ROC Curve']",,,2020/01/01 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/01/01 06:00'],"['2019/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-56472-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-56472-1 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Dec 30;9(1):20321. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-56472-1.,PMC6937232,,"['R01 CA134051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA189806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000161/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Persons with intellectual disability (ID) are especially vulnerable to somatic and mental illnesses. METHODS: This review is based on pertinent literature retrieved by selective searches in PubMed and the Cochrane Library. RESULTS: Genetic abnormalities are a frequent cause of diseases that affect multiple organs and need interdisciplinary treatment. A number of somatic diseases are more common in persons with ID than in the general population, including epilepsy (30-50% in persons with severe or very severe ID, vs. 0.5% in the general popu- lation) and dementia (five times more common than in the general population). Patients with Down syndrome are 20 times more likely than the general population to develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Some mental illnesses, too, are more common in persons with ID, e.g., autism spectrum disorders (7.5-15% vs. 1% in the general population). The history and the findings of the physical and psychiatric examination are assessed in accordance with the biopsychosocial model of disease, and in the light of the patient's mental developmental age. Structured instruments for behavioral evaluation and diagnosis are an important additional component of the diagnostic assessment. A holistic approach is required that takes multiple life areas into account and involves the patient's familial and social environment, while obeying the rules of simple language. Psychotherapeutic and psychosocial measures must be adapted to the patient's cognitive abilities and mental developmental age. CONCLUSION: Intellectually disabled persons can be treated in a multimodal, multiprofessional approach. As of early 2019, there were 38 medical centers for adults with intellectual disability or severe multiple disabilities in Germany (Medizinische Behandlungszentren fur Erwachsene mit geistiger Behinderung oder schweren Mehrfachbehinderungen, MZEB), where they can be cared for with due attention to their special needs.","['Sappok, Tanja', 'Diefenbacher, Albert', 'Winterholler, Martin']","['Sappok T', 'Diefenbacher A', 'Winterholler M']",,"['Berlin Treatment Center for adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) and mental disorders, Evangelisches Krankenhaus Konigin Elisabeth Herzberge, Berlin; Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomaticsk, Evangelisches Krankenhaus Konigin Elisabeth Herzberge, Berlin; Department of Neurology, Krankenhaus Rummelsberg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,IM,,"['Germany', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability/*therapy']",,,2018/11/29 00:00,2020/01/09 06:00,['2020/01/01 06:00'],"['2019/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['arztebl.2019.0809 [pii]', '10.3238/arztebl.2019.0809 [doi]']",ppublish,Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2019 Nov 29;116(48):809-816. doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2019.0809.,PMC6947689,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, most techniques still use special couches, translational tables, or other self-made immobilization devices for dose delivery. Aim of the present study was to report the first results of a newly developed rotatable tabletop designed for VMAT-TBI. METHODS: The VMAT-TBI technique theoretically allows the use of any standard positioning device at the linear accelerator. Nevertheless, the main problem is that patients taller than 120 cm cannot be treated in one position due to the limited cranial-caudal couch shift capacities of the linac. Therefore, patients are usually turned from a head-first supine position (HFS) to a feet-first supine position (FFS) to overcome this limitation. The newly developed rotatable tabletop consists completely of carbon fiber, including the ball bearing within the base plate of the rotation unit. The patient can be turned 180 degrees from a HFS to a FFS position within a few seconds, without the need of repositioning. RESULTS: The first 20 patients had a median age of 47 years, and received TBI before bone marrow transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia. Most patients (13/20) received a TBI dose of 4 Gy in 2 fractions, twice daily. The mean number of applied monitor units (MU) was 6476 MU using a multi-arcs and multi-isocenter VMAT-TBI technique. The tabletop has been successfully used in daily clinical practice and helped to keep the treatment times at an acceptable level. During the first treatment fraction, the mean overall treatment time (OTT) was 57 min. Since no additional image guidance was used in fraction 2 of the same day, the OTT was reduced to mean 38 min. CONCLUSIONS: The easy and reproducible rotation of the patient on the treatment couch using the rotatable tabletop, is time-efficient and overcomes the need of repositioning the patient after turning from a HFS to a FFS position during VMAT TBI. Furthermore, it prevents couch-gantry collisions, incorrect isocenter shifts and beam mix-up due to predicted absolute table coordinates, which are recorded to the R + V system with the corresponding beams.","['Losert, Christoph', 'Shpani, Roel', 'Kiessling, Robert', 'Freislederer, Philipp', 'Li, Minglun', 'Walter, Franziska', 'Niyazi, Maximilian', 'Reiner, Michael', 'Belka, Claus', 'Corradini, Stefanie']","['Losert C', 'Shpani R', 'Kiessling R', 'Freislederer P', 'Li M', 'Walter F', 'Niyazi M', 'Reiner M', 'Belka C', 'Corradini S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8709-7252'],"['Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377, Munich, Germany. stefanie.corradini@med.uni-muenchen.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191230,England,Radiat Oncol,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",101265111,IM,,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organs at Risk/*radiation effects', 'Particle Accelerators/*instrumentation', 'Patient Positioning/*methods', 'Patient Selection', 'Phantoms, Imaging', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*methods', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)', 'Leukemia', 'Positioning device', 'Tabletop', 'Tomotherapy', 'Total body irradiation', 'Total marrow irradiation', 'Treatment time', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)']",2020/01/01 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2020/01/01 06:00'],"['2019/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13014-019-1445-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13014-019-1445-3 [pii]']",epublish,Radiat Oncol. 2019 Dec 30;14(1):244. doi: 10.1186/s13014-019-1445-3.,PMC6937701,,['na/IT-V'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to employ high throughput meta-analysis to find major genes that are possibly involved in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP. RESULTS: High-throughput statistical analyses identified 832, 49, and 22 differentially expressed genes for normal vs. ACs, normal vs. HAM/TSP, and ACs vs. HAM/TSP groups, respectively. The protein-protein interactions between DEGs were identified in STRING and further network analyses highlighted 24 and 6 hub genes for normal vs. HAM/TSP and ACs vs. HAM/TSP groups, respectively. Moreover, four biologically meaningful modules including 251 genes were identified for normal vs. ACs. Biological network analyses indicated the involvement of hub genes in many vital pathways like JAK-STAT signaling pathway, interferon, Interleukins, and immune pathways in the normal vs. HAM/TSP group and Metabolism of RNA, Viral mRNA Translation, Human T cell leukemia virus 1 infection, and Cell cycle in the normal vs. ACs group. Moreover, three major genes including STAT1, TAP1, and PSMB8 were identified by network analysis. Real-time PCR revealed the meaningful down-regulation of STAT1 in HAM/TSP samples than AC and normal samples (P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively), up-regulation of PSMB8 in HAM/TSP samples than AC and normal samples (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01, respectively), and down-regulation of TAP1 in HAM/TSP samples than those in AC and normal samples (P = 0.008 and P = 0.02, respectively). No significant difference was found among three groups in terms of the percentage of T helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (P = 0.55 and P = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: High-throughput data integration disclosed novel hub genes involved in important pathways in virus infection and immune systems. The comprehensive studies are needed to improve our knowledge about the pathogenesis pathways and also biomarkers of complex diseases.","['Mozhgani, Sayed-Hamidreza', 'Piran, Mehran', 'Zarei-Ghobadi, Mohadeseh', 'Jafari, Mohieddin', 'Jazayeri, Seyed-Mohammad', 'Mokhtari-Azad, Talat', 'Teymoori-Rad, Majid', 'Valizadeh, Narges', 'Farajifard, Hamid', 'Mirzaie, Mehdi', 'Khamseh, Azam', 'Rafatpanah, Houshang', 'Rezaee, Seyed-Abdolrahim', 'Norouzi, Mehdi']","['Mozhgani SH', 'Piran M', 'Zarei-Ghobadi M', 'Jafari M', 'Jazayeri SM', 'Mokhtari-Azad T', 'Teymoori-Rad M', 'Valizadeh N', 'Farajifard H', 'Mirzaie M', 'Khamseh A', 'Rafatpanah H', 'Rezaee SA', 'Norouzi M']",,"['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Alborz University of Medical Sciences, Karaj, Iran.', 'Non-communicable Diseases Research Center, Alborz University of Medical Sciences, Karaj, Iran.', 'Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia - IGC, Rua da Quinta Grande, 6, 2780-156, Oeiras, Portugal.', 'Department of Virology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Research Program in Systems Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Virology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Research Center for Clinical Virology, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Virology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Research Center for Clinical Virology, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Virology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology-Microbiology Department, School of Medicine, Qom University of Medical Sciences, 14155-6447, Qom, Iran.', 'Pediatric Cell Therapy Research Center, Children Medical Center Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Applied Mathematics, Faculty of Mathematical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Virology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. rezaeer@mums.ac.ir.', 'Department of Virology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. mnorouzi@tums.ac.ir.', 'Research Center for Clinical Virology, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. mnorouzi@tums.ac.ir.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191230,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,,"['Data Interpretation, Statistical', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*genetics/*virology', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/virology', 'Viral Load']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HAM/TSP', '*HTLV-1', '*HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis', '*High-throughput data integration', '*Meta-analysis', '*Microarray']",2020/01/01 06:00,2020/05/20 06:00,['2020/01/01 06:00'],"['2019/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-019-0508-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-019-0508-8 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2019 Dec 30;16(1):46. doi: 10.1186/s12977-019-0508-8.,PMC6937958,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To overcome modeling biases and directional insensitivity, a recent statistical functional chi-squared test (FunChisq) detects directional association via model-free functional dependency. FunChisq examines patterns pointing from independent to dependent variables arising from linear, non-linear, or many-to-one functional relationships. Meanwhile, the Functional Annotation of Mammalian Genome 5 (FANTOM5) project surveyed gene expression at over 200,000 transcription start sites (TSSs) in nearly all human tissue types, primary cell types, and cancer cell lines. The data cover TSSs originated from both coding and noncoding genes. For the vast uncharacterized human TSSs that may exhibit complex patterns in cancer versus normal tissues, the model-free property of FunChisq provides us an unprecedented opportunity to assess the evidence for a gene's directional effect on human cancer. RESULTS: We first evaluated FunChisq and six other methods using 719 curated cancer genes on the FANTOM5 data. FunChisq performed best in detecting known cancer driver genes from non-cancer genes. We also show the capacity of FunChisq to reveal non-monotonic patterns of functional association, to which typical differential analysis methods such as t-test are insensitive. Further applying FunChisq to screen unannotated TSSs in FANTOM5, we predicted 1108 putative cancer driver noncoding RNAs, stronger than 90% of curated cancer driver genes. Next, we compared leukemia samples against other samples in FANTOM5 and FunChisq predicted 332/79 potential biomarkers for lymphoid/myeloid leukemia, stronger than the TSSs of all 87/100 known driver genes in lymphoid/myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the advantage of FunChisq in revealing directional association, especially in detecting non-monotonic patterns. Here, we also provide the most comprehensive catalog of high-quality biomarkers that may play a causative role in human cancers, including putative cancer driver noncoding RNAs and lymphoid/myeloid leukemia specific biomarkers.","['Zhong, Hua', 'Song, Mingzhou']","['Zhong H', 'Song M']",,"['Department of Computer Science, New Mexico State University, University Ave, Las Cruces, 88003, NM, USA.', 'Department of Computer Science, New Mexico State University, University Ave, Las Cruces, 88003, NM, USA.', 'Molecular Biology Graduate Program, New Mexico State University, University Ave, Las Cruces, 88003, NM, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20191230,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,IM,,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'RNA, Untranslated/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Initiation Site']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Biomarker', '*Cancer driver gene', '*FunChisq', '*Human cancer', '*Leukemia', '*Non-monotonic directional association', '*Noncoding RNA']",2020/01/01 06:00,2020/07/02 06:00,['2020/01/01 06:00'],"['2019/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12920-019-0565-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12920-019-0565-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2019 Dec 30;12(Suppl 7):129. doi: 10.1186/s12920-019-0565-9.,PMC6936152,,"['U54 CA132383/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA132381/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combined chemotherapy remains the standard of care for these virus-associated lymphomas; however, frequent chemoresistance is a barrier to achieving successful long-term disease-free survival. There is increasing evidence that indicates virus-associated lymphomas display more resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents than that observed in solid tumors. Although the tumor microenvironment and genetic changes, such as key oncogene mutations, are closely related to chemoresistance, some studies demonstrate that the components of oncogenic viruses themselves play pivotal roles in the multidrug chemoresistance of lymphoma cells. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the understanding of the mechanisms through which oncogenic viruses mediate lymphoma cell chemoresistance, with a particular focus on KSHV and EBV, two major oncogenic viruses. We also discuss the current challenges to overcome these obstacles in the treatment of virus-associated lymphomas.","['Chen, Jungang', 'Kendrick, Samantha', 'Qin, Zhiqiang']","['Chen J', 'Kendrick S', 'Qin Z']",,"['Department of Pathology, Winthrop P.

HTLV-1-associated diseases, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraperesis (HAM/TSP), as well as frequent coinfections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Strongyloides stercoralis were associated to increased morbidity and mortality of HTLV-1 infection. Objective: To determine the mortality rate and its associated variables from an open cohort started in July 1997 at the HTLV Clinic, Emilio Ribas Institute (IIER), a major infectious disease hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: Since inception up to September 2018, we admitted 727 HTLV-1-infected individuals, with a rate of 30-50 new admissions per year. All patient data, including clinical and laboratory data, were regularly updated throughout the 21-year period, using a dedicated REDCap database. The Ethical Board of IIER approved the protocol. Results: During 21 years of clinical care to people living with HTLV-1 in the Sao Paulo region, we recruited 479 asymptomatic HTLV-1-infected individuals and 248 HAM/TSP patients, of which 632 remained under active follow-up. During a total of 3800 person-years of follow-up (maximum follow-up 21.5 years, mean follow-up 6.0 years), 27 individuals died (median age of 51.5 years), of which 12 were asymptomatic, one ATLL patient and 14 HAM/TSP patients. HAM/TSP diagnosis (but neither age nor gender) was a significant predictor of increased mortality by univariate and multivariate (hazard ratio (HR) 5.03, 95% CI [1.96-12.91], p = 0.001) Cox regression models. Coinfection with HIV/HCV was an independent predictor of increased mortality (HR 15.08; 95% CI [5.50-41.32]; p < 0.001), with AIDS-related infections as a more frequent cause of death in asymptomatics (6/13; p = 0.033). HIV/HCV-negative fatal HAM/TSP cases were all female, with urinary tract infection and decubitus ulcer-associated sepsis as the main cause of death (8/14, p = 0.002). Conclusions: All-cause mortality among people living with HTLV-1 in Sao Paulo differs between asymptomatic (2.9%) and HAM/TSP patients (7.3%), independent of age and gender. We observe a dichotomy in fatal cases, with HAM/TSP and HIV/HCV coinfection as independent risk factors for death. Our findings reveal an urgent need for public health actions, as the major causes of death, infections secondary to decubitus ulcers, and immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related infections, can be targeted by preventive measures.","['Marcusso, Rosa Maria N', 'Van Weyenbergh, Johan', 'de Moura, Joao Victor Luisi', 'Dahy, Flavia Esper', 'de Moura Brasil Matos, Aline', 'Haziot, Michel E J', 'Vidal, Jose E', 'Fonseca, Luiz Augusto M', 'Smid, Jerusa', 'Assone, Tatiane', 'Casseb, Jorge', 'de Oliveira, Augusto Cesar Penalva']","['Marcusso RMN', 'Van Weyenbergh J', 'de Moura JVL', 'Dahy FE', 'de Moura Brasil Matos A', 'Haziot MEJ', 'Vidal JE', 'Fonseca LAM', 'Smid J', 'Assone T', 'Casseb J', 'de Oliveira ACP']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8396-0263', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1854-2575', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4553-2559', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4084-7973']","['Institute of Infectious Diseases ""Emilio Ribas"" (IIER) of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-000, Brazil.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Institute of Infectious Diseases ""Emilio Ribas"" (IIER) of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-000, Brazil.', 'Institute of Infectious Diseases ""Emilio Ribas"" (IIER) of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-000, Brazil.', 'Institute of Tropical Medicine of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 05403-000, Brazil.', 'Institute of Infectious Diseases ""Emilio Ribas"" (IIER) of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-000, Brazil.', 'Institute of Infectious Diseases ""Emilio Ribas"" (IIER) of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-000, Brazil.', 'Institute of Tropical Medicine of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 05403-000, Brazil.', 'Institute of Tropical Medicine of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 05403-000, Brazil.', 'Institute of Infectious Diseases ""Emilio Ribas"" (IIER) of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-000, Brazil.', 'Institute of Tropical Medicine of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 05403-000, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Dermatology and Immunodeficiencies, Department of Dermatology, Medical School, University of Sao Paulo Brazil, Sao Paulo 05403-000, Brazil.', 'Institute of Tropical Medicine of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 05403-000, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Dermatology and Immunodeficiencies, Department of Dermatology, Medical School, University of Sao Paulo Brazil, Sao Paulo 05403-000, Brazil.', 'Institute of Infectious Diseases ""Emilio Ribas"" (IIER) of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-000, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191226,Switzerland,Pathogens,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",101596317,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Brazil', 'HAM/TSP', 'HTLV-1', 'mortality']",2020/01/01 06:00,2020/01/01 06:01,['2020/01/01 06:00'],"['2019/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/01 06:01 [medline]']","['pathogens9010025 [pii]', '10.3390/pathogens9010025 [doi]']",epublish,Pathogens. 2019 Dec 26;9(1). pii: pathogens9010025. doi: 10.3390/pathogens9010025.,PMC7168659,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present multicenter Phase 1B study was to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety profile of OXi4503 and cytarabine (ARA-C) administered in combination (OXA). At four centers, 29 patients with R/R AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were treated with OXA. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were febrile neutropenia (28%), hypertension (17%), thrombocytopenia (17%), and anemia (14%). There were no treatment-emergent grade 5 AEs. Drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) developed in 4/29 patients (14%) and included febrile neutropenia (N = 2), pneumonia/acute respiratory failure (N = 1), and hypotension (N = 1). 9.76 mg/m(2) was defined as the MTD of OXi4503 when administered in combination with 1 g/m(2) ARA-C. In 26 evaluable AML patients, there were 2 complete remissions (CR), 2 complete remissions with incomplete count recovery (CRi) and one partial response (PR), for an overall response rate (ORR) of 19%. The median overall survival (OS) time for the four patients who achieved a CR/CRi was 528 days (95% CI: 434-NA), which was significantly longer than the median OS time of 113 days (95% CI: 77-172) for the remaining 22 patients who did not achieve a CR/CRi (Log Rank Chi Square = 11.8, p-value = 0.0006). The safety and early evidence of efficacy of the OXA regimen in R/R AML patients warrant further investigation in a Phase 2 clinical study.","['Uckun, Fatih M', 'Cogle, Christopher R', 'Lin, Tara L', 'Qazi, Sanjive', 'Trieu, Vuong N', 'Schiller, Gary', 'Watts, Justin M']","['Uckun FM', 'Cogle CR', 'Lin TL', 'Qazi S', 'Trieu VN', 'Schiller G', 'Watts JM']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5422-6863', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0242-6449']","['Immuno-Oncology Program, Mateon Therapeutics, Agoura Hills, CA 91301, USA.', 'Ares Pharmaceuticals, St. Paul, MN 55110, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine & University of Florida Health Cancer Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, University of Kansas Cancer Center and Medical Pavillon, Westwood, KS 66205, USA.', 'Bioinformatics Program and Department of Biology, Gustavus Adolphus College, St Peter, MN 56082, USA.', 'Immuno-Oncology Program, Mateon Therapeutics, Agoura Hills, CA 91301, USA.', 'Bone Marrow/Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191226,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'OXA', 'clinical study', 'combretastatin', 'leukemia']",2020/01/01 06:00,2020/01/01 06:01,['2020/01/01 06:00'],"['2019/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12010074 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12010074 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Dec 26;12(1). pii: cancers12010074. doi: 10.3390/cancers12010074.,PMC7016810,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, our understanding of human monocyte heterogeneity and their immunophenotypic features under healthy and inflammatory conditions is still evolving. RATIONALE: In this study, we sought to investigate the immunophenome of circulating human monocyte subsets. METHODS: Multiplexed, high-throughput flow cytometry screening arrays and computational data analysis were used to analyze the expression and hierarchical relationships of 242 specific surface markers on circulating classical (CD14(++)CD16(-)), intermediate (CD14(++)CD16(+)), and nonclassical (CD14(+)CD16(++)) monocytes in healthy adults. RESULTS: Using generalized linear models and hierarchical cluster analysis, we selected and clustered epitopes that most reliably differentiate between monocyte subsets. We validated existing transcriptional profiling data and revealed potential new surface markers that uniquely define the classical (e.g., BLTR1, CD35, CD38, CD49e, CD89, CD96), intermediate (e.g., CD39, CD275, CD305, CDw328), and nonclassical (e.g., CD29, CD132) subsets. In addition, our analysis revealed phenotypic cell clusters, identified by dendritic markers CMRF-44 and CMRF-56, independent of the traditional monocyte classification. CONCLUSION: These results reveal an advancement of the clinically applicable multiplexed screening arrays that may facilitate monocyte subset characterization and cytometry-based biomarker selection in various inflammatory disorders.","['Hoffmann, Jedrzej', 'Fiser, Karel', 'Liebetrau, Christoph', 'Staubach, Nora', 'Kost, David', 'Voss, Sandra', 'Heiden, Annkathrin Zur', 'Dorr, Oliver', 'Lipps, Christoph', 'Nef, Holger M', 'Mollmann, Helge', 'Hamm, Christian W', 'Keller, Till', 'Troidl, Christian']","['Hoffmann J', 'Fiser K', 'Liebetrau C', 'Staubach N', 'Kost D', 'Voss S', 'Heiden AZ', 'Dorr O', 'Lipps C', 'Nef HM', 'Mollmann H', 'Hamm CW', 'Keller T', 'Troidl C']",,"['Department of Medicine III, Cardiology, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner site Rhine-Main, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukemia Investigation Prague, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner site Rhine-Main, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology, Kerckhoff Heart and Thorax Center, Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology, Kerckhoff Heart and Thorax Center, Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology, Kerckhoff Heart and Thorax Center, Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner site Rhine-Main, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology, Kerckhoff Heart and Thorax Center, Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology, Kerckhoff Heart and Thorax Center, Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner site Rhine-Main, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology, Kerckhoff Heart and Thorax Center, Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Giessen, Germany.', 'German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner site Rhine-Main, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology, Kerckhoff Heart and Thorax Center, Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Giessen, Germany.', 'German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner site Rhine-Main, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology, Kerckhoff Heart and Thorax Center, Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Giessen, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology, Kerckhoff Heart and Thorax Center, Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology, St.-Johannes-Hospital Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany.', 'German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner site Rhine-Main, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology, Kerckhoff Heart and Thorax Center, Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Giessen, Germany.', 'German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner site Rhine-Main, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology, Kerckhoff Heart and Thorax Center, Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner site Rhine-Main, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology, Kerckhoff Heart and Thorax Center, Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Giessen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191230,Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,IM,,"['Atherosclerosis/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Biodiversity', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Inflammation/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism']",,,2019/12/31 06:00,2020/07/07 06:00,['2019/12/31 06:00'],"['2019/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-0039-1700871 [doi]'],ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 2020 Jan;120(1):141-155. doi: 10.1055/s-0039-1700871.

In our research, we revealed the molecular mechanisms that were sufficient to improve sensitivity of AML cells to the anthracycline daunorubicin (DNR). METHODS: We evaluated the effects of autophagy and apoptosis induced by DNR using two AML cell lines HL60 and U937.Western blot was preformed to analyze the apoptotic pathway protein expression and flow cytometric analysis was used to detect the level of apoptosis in AML cells. The levels of autophagy-related proteins were detected by western blotting and autophagic vesicles were observed by electron microscopy. RESULTS: DNR effectively induced autophagy in two AML cell lines HL60 and U937 confirming by upregulation of LC3-II lipidation, formation of autophagosomes. Inhibition of autophagy by pharmacologic inhibitor HCQ promoted apoptosis induced by DNR, suggesting that autophagy played a vital role in pro-survival in AML. Furthermore, ULK1 inhibition by a highly selective kinase inhibitor SBI-0206965 and shRNA enhanced cytotoxicity of DNR against AML cells. Independent of mTOR -ULK1 signaling pathway, activation of autophagy of DNR was proved to be mediated by AMPK (pThr172)/ULK1 pathway. CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that pro-survival autophagy induced by ULK1 activation was one of the potential mechanisms of AML resistance to DNR. Targeting ULK1 selectively could be a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance sensitivity of DNR for AML therapy.","['Qiu, Li', 'Zhou, Gan', 'Cao, Shan']","['Qiu L', 'Zhou G', 'Cao S']",,"['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, China; Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, China; Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China; National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China; National Institution of Drug Clinical Trial, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 110 Xiang Ya Road, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China; Engineering Research Center of Applied Technology of Pharmacogenomics, Ministry of Education, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410078, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, China; Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China; National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China; National Institution of Drug Clinical Trial, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 110 Xiang Ya Road, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China.

We previously reported high NE expression in peripheral blood neutrophils from acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients. The present study aimed to elucidate the specific role and mechanisms of NE in APL development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NE expression was detected in APL bone marrow samples and analyzed in the BloodSpot database. CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry were used to assess cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution, respectively. The expression levels of proliferation and differentiation markers were measured by Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR. The co-expression and interaction of NE and p200 cut-like homeobox 1 (CUX1) were evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, and in situ proximity ligation assay. KEY FINDINGS: NE was highly expressed in APL bone marrow and blood neutrophils. NE overexpression promoted the proliferation and inhibited the differentiation of NB4 cells, whereas NE downregulation achieved the opposite results in U937 cells. Mechanistically, NE interacted with and effectively hydrolyzed the tumor suppressor p200 CUX1. Rescue experiments revealed that p200 CUX1 upregulation reversed the functional influence of NE on APL cells. SIGNIFICANCE: NE-mediated proteolysis of the tumor suppressor p200 CUX1 promotes APL progression. NE/p200 CUX1 axis is a novel and promising therapeutic target for APL treatment.","['Yu, Lihua', 'Zhong, Liang', 'Xiong, Ling', 'Dan, Wenran', 'Li, Jian', 'Ye, Jiao', 'Wan, Peng', 'Luo, Xu', 'Chu, Xuan', 'Liu, Chen', 'He, Cui', 'Mu, Fenglin', 'Liu, Beizhong']","['Yu L', 'Zhong L', 'Xiong L', 'Dan W', 'Li J', 'Ye J', 'Wan P', 'Luo X', 'Chu X', 'Liu C', 'He C', 'Mu F', 'Liu B']",,"['Clinical Laboratory of Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China; Central Laboratory of Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.

Here, we show that an inducible pathway of myeloid regeneration involving the remodeling of the multipotent progenitor (MPP) compartment downstream of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is commonly hijacked in myeloid malignancies. We establish that differential regulation of Notch and Wnt signaling transiently triggers myeloid regeneration from HSCs in response to stress, and that constitutive low Notch and high Wnt activity in leukemic stem cells (LSCs) maintains this pathway activated in malignancies. We also identify compensatory crosstalk mechanisms between Notch and Wnt signaling that prevent damaging HSC function, MPP production, and blood output in conditions of high Notch and low Wnt activity. Finally, we demonstrate that restoring Notch and Wnt deregulated activity in LSCs attenuates disease progression. Our results uncover a mechanism that controls myeloid regeneration and early lineage decisions in HSCs and could be targeted in LSCs to normalize leukemic myeloid cell production.","['Kang, Yoon-A', 'Pietras, Eric M', 'Passegue, Emmanuelle']","['Kang YA', 'Pietras EM', 'Passegue E']",,"['Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University, New York, NY.', 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology Division, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology Division, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University, New York, NY.', 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology Division, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Cells/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', 'Regeneration/*physiology', 'Stem Cell Niche/physiology', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*physiology']",,,2019/12/31 06:00,2020/10/30 06:00,['2019/12/31 06:00'],"['2019/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['133549 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20190787 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2020 Mar 2;217(3). pii: 133549. doi: 10.1084/jem.20190787.,PMC7062512,['Disclosures: The authors declare no competing interests exist.'],"['R01 HL092471/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 HL106989/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 DK098315/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 HL135763/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL111266/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Receptors, Notch)']",['(c) 2019 Kang et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reported an extremely rare case of MS with concurrent bone marrow (BM) involvement that invaded into a preexisting sebaceous lymphadenoma in the parotid gland and neck lymph nodes. Prompted by this case, we also present a literature review of MS invasion into salivary glands. A 62-year-old man was initially diagnosed with carcinoma that arose in a sebaceous lymphadenoma in the parotid gland, through a total parotidectomy with neck dissection. After an extensive histopathological review that included immunohistochemistry, a pathologic diagnosis of MS with infiltration into the sebaceous lymphadenoma with concurrent BM involvement was confirmed. MS is difficult to diagnose accurately; herein, we analyzed the clinical presentations and effectiveness of the various diagnostic methods with a review of the literature. There are 17 cases, including our case, reported in 13 studies. Of the cases in which the salivary glands were affected, 10 involved the parotid gland, six involved the submandibular gland, and one involved both. Isolated invasion of the salivary gland was found in one case of parotid gland invasion and three cases of submandibular gland invasion. In 13 cases, the salivary glands were affected by various other lesions. Although there were no incidences of isolated MS, six patients were diagnosed with secondary MS and eight patients with MS with BM involvement, including this case. The diagnosis of MS is difficult given its rarity, and a high index of suspicion and integrated radiologic and careful histopathologic evaluation are required. Most cases of MS infiltrating the salivary gland might be indicated by the possibility of BM involvement. MS with BM involvement predicts poor prognosis and the need for intensive systemic treatment.","['Jo, Sunmi', 'Shim, Hye-Kyung', 'Kim, Joo Yeon', 'Bae, Sang Kyun', 'Kim, Mi Ra']","['Jo S', 'Shim HK', 'Kim JY', 'Bae SK', 'Kim MR']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1761-8953', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3740-0492', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4259-667X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0174-8734', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2875-0738']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20191122,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,,"['*Adenolymphoma/diagnosis/pathology/surgery', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parotid Gland/diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery', '*Parotid Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/secondary/surgery', '*Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnosis/pathology/surgery', '*Sebaceous Gland Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/surgery', 'Sebaceous Glands/diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery', 'Young Adult']",,,2019/12/31 06:00,2020/05/14 06:00,['2019/12/31 06:00'],"['2019/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/9869406 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2019 Nov 22;2019:9869406. doi: 10.1155/2019/9869406. eCollection 2019.,PMC6893249,"['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the', 'publication of this study.']",,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Sunmi Jo et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PCR2). It is a histone methyltransferase, that targets lysine 27 of histone 3. This methylated H3-K27 is usually associated with the silencing of genes that are involved in fundamental cellular processes, such as cell proliferation and differentiation. There are only few studies showing the status of EZH2 expression in patients with MDS and they were performed in adult MDS patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the EZH2 expression in pediatric patients with MDS and its association with karyotypes and evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We conducted the first study of EZH2 expression in pediatric patients with MDS. Considering the EZH2 expression levels in 42 patients and 17 healthy pediatric donors, it was possible to define three groups of expression in patients: low, intermediate, and high. The intermediate level encompassed patients with normal karyotypes, low level included patients with monosomy 7 and del(7q) and high level included patients with trisomy 8 and del(11q) (p < 0.0001). Comparing the leukemic evolution, the low expression group presented disease evolution in 100% (8/8) of the cases, the intermediate expression group showed disease evolution in 4.34% (1/23) and in the high expression group, 63.63% (7/11) patients showed evolution from MDS to AML (p < 0.0001). It is important to note that low and high EZH2 expression are associated with leukemic evolution, however low expression showed a stronger association with evolution from MDS to AML than the high expression. Our results suggest a scale of measure for EZH2 expression in pediatric MDS, where aberrant EZH2 expression may be a potential biomarker of disease evolution.","['de Souza Fernandez, Teresa', 'Fonseca Alvarenga, Tatiana', 'Almeida Antonio de Kos, Elaiza', 'Lamim Lovatel, Viviane', 'Tavares, Rita de Cassia', 'da Costa, Elaine Sobral', 'de Souza Fernandez, Cecilia', 'Abdelhay, Eliana']","['de Souza Fernandez T', 'Fonseca Alvarenga T', 'Almeida Antonio de Kos E', 'Lamim Lovatel V', 'Tavares RC', 'da Costa ES', 'de Souza Fernandez C', 'Abdelhay E']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1299-4666', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5119-0129', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8493-5855', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5340-5816', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5166-0832']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, National Cancer Institute (INCA), 20230-130 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Pathological Anatomy Department (DIPAT), National Cancer Institute (INCA), 20230-130 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, National Cancer Institute (INCA), 20230-130 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, National Cancer Institute (INCA), 20230-130 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, National Cancer Institute (INCA), 20230-130 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Pediatrics Department, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, 21941-590 RJ, Brazil.', 'Mathematical and Statistical Institute of Federal Fluminense University (UFF), 24020-140 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, National Cancer Institute (INCA), 20230-130 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20191210,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",,,2019/12/31 06:00,2020/05/14 06:00,['2019/12/31 06:00'],"['2019/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/3176565 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2019 Dec 10;2019:3176565. doi: 10.1155/2019/3176565. eCollection 2019.,PMC6925750,"['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interests regarding the', 'publication of this paper.']",,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)']",['Copyright (c) 2019 Teresa de Souza Fernandez et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On day 33 of the third consolidation, white blood cell and neutrophil counts were 320/muL and 20/muL, respectively. After she developed epigastralgia and hematemesis, she developed septic shock. Gastroendoscopy revealed markedly thickened folds and diffusely damaged mucosa with blood oozing. Computed tomography revealed thickened walls of the antrum and the pylorus. Despite emergency treatments, she died. Bacterial culture of the gastric fluid yielded Enterobacter cloacae and enterococci growth. Collectively, she was diagnosed with phlegmonous gastritis. Retrospective examination of serial bone marrow biopsy specimens demonstrated progressive bone marrow fibrosis, which may have caused prolonged myelosuppression. Thus, evaluation of bone marrow fibrosis by bone marrow biopsy after each treatment cycle might serve as a predictor of persistent myelosuppression induced by chemotherapy.","['Inagawa, Yuta', 'Komeno, Yukiko', 'Saito, Satoshi', 'Maenohara, Yuji', 'Yamagishi, Tetsuro', 'Kawashima, Hiroyuki', 'Saito, Taku', 'Abe, Keiko', 'Iihara, Kuniko', 'Hatada, Yasumasa', 'Ryu, Tomiko']","['Inagawa Y', 'Komeno Y', 'Saito S', 'Maenohara Y', 'Yamagishi T', 'Kawashima H', 'Saito T', 'Abe K', 'Iihara K', 'Hatada Y', 'Ryu T']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7910-8641', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9511-9773']","['Department of Hematology, Japan Community Healthcare Organization (JCHO) Tokyo Yamate Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, JCHO Tokyo Yamate Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japan Community Healthcare Organization (JCHO) Tokyo Yamate Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, JCHO Tokyo Yamate Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Orthopedic Surgery, Department of Regenerative and Transplant Medicine, Niigata University Graduate School of Medicine and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.', 'Division of Orthopedic Surgery, Department of Regenerative and Transplant Medicine, Niigata University Graduate School of Medicine and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, JCHO Tokyo Yamate Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, JCHO Tokyo Yamate Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, JCHO Tokyo Yamate Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japan Community Healthcare Organization (JCHO) Tokyo Yamate Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20191127,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,,,2019/12/31 06:00,2019/12/31 06:01,['2019/12/31 06:00'],"['2019/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/1616237 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2019 Nov 27;2019:1616237. doi: 10.1155/2019/1616237. eCollection 2019.,PMC6900957,"['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the', 'publication of this article.']",,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Yuta Inagawa et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NANOG-a well-known core transcription factor-plays an important role in maintaining the self-renewal and pluripotency of stem cells. Unfortunately, the mechanism that NANOG delays mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) senescence is not well-known until now. In our study, we showed that both ectopic NANOG expression and PBX1 overexpression (i) significantly upregulated phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and PARP1; (ii) promoted cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and osteogenesis; (iii) reduced the number of senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase- (SA-beta-gal-) positive cells; and (iv) downregulated the expression of p16, p53, and p21. Western blotting and dual-luciferase activity assays showed that ectopic NANOG expression significantly upregulated PBX1 expression and increased PBX1 promoter activity. In contrast, PBX1 knockdown by RNA interference in hair follicle- (HF-) derived MSCs that were ectopically expressing NANOG resulted in the significant downregulation of p-AKT and the upregulation of p16 and p21. Moreover, blocking AKT with the PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002 or knocking down AKT via RNA interference significantly decreased PBX1 expression, while increasing p16 and p21 expression and the number of SA-beta-gal-positive cells. In conclusion, our findings show that NANOG delays HF-MSC senescence by upregulating PBX1 and activating AKT signaling and that a feedback loop likely exists between PBX1 and AKT signaling.","['Liu,

Our previous research demonstrated that non-receptor-typed PTP21 (PTPN21), a member of the PTP family, played a critical role in the proliferation, cell cycle, and chemosensitivity of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. However, the role of PTPN21 in the bone marrow microenvironment has not yet been elucidated. In the study, we explored the effects of PTPN21 on human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) via lentiviral-mediated overexpression and knock-down of PTPN21 in vitro. Overexpressing PTPN21 in BM-MSCs inhibited the proliferation through arresting cell cycle at the G0 phase but rendered them a higher osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential. In addition, overexpressing PTPN21 in BM-MSCs increased their senescence levels through upregulation of P21 and P53 and dramatically changed the levels of crosstalk with their typical target cells including immunocytes, tumor cells, and vascular endothelial cells. BM-MSCs overexpressing PTPN21 had an impaired immunosuppressive function and an increased capacity of recruiting tumor cells and vascular endothelial cells in a chemotaxis transwell coculture system. Collectively, our data suggested that PTPN21 acted as a pleiotropic factor in modulating the function of human BM-MSCs.","['Wang, Huafang', 'Ye, Xiaohang', 'Xiao, Haowen', 'Zhu, Ni', 'Wei, Cong', 'Sun, Xiang', 'Wang, Limengmeng', 'Wang, Binsheng', 'Yu, Xiaohong', 'Lai, Xiaoyu', 'Fu, Shan', 'Huang, He']","['Wang H', 'Ye X', 'Xiao H', 'Zhu N', 'Wei C', 'Sun X', 'Wang L', 'Wang B', 'Yu X', 'Lai X', 'Fu S', 'Huang H']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4217-7341', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6924-7835', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2723-1621']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310000, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310000, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Zhejiang Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunotherapy, Hangzhou 310000, China.', 'Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute, International Campus Zhejiang University, Haining 314400, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310000, China.', 'Zhejiang Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunotherapy, Hangzhou 310000, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310000, China.', 'Zhejiang Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunotherapy, Hangzhou 310000, China.', 'Zhejiang Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunotherapy, Hangzhou 310000, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310000, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310000, China.', 'Zhejiang Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunotherapy, Hangzhou 310000, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191121,United States,Stem Cells Int,Stem cells international,101535822,,,,,,2019/12/31 06:00,2019/12/31 06:01,['2019/12/31 06:00'],"['2019/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/4686132 [doi]'],epublish,Stem Cells Int. 2019 Nov 21;2019:4686132. doi: 10.1155/2019/4686132. eCollection 2019.,PMC6907062,['The authors declare that they had no conflict of interests.'],,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Huafang Wang et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown in our previous data the association of some pre-miRs-B' (for BLV miRNA) alleles with leukocyte (WBC - white blood cell) number in BLV-infected cows. Multifunctional properties of Tax protein have led us to an assumption that tax gene/Tax protein could have too population variations related to WBC counts. Here we report about several tax alleles/Tax protein variants, which have a highly significant association with an increase or a decrease of WBC number in BLV-infected cows. We have provided evidence that Tax A, H variants (tax b, c, d, f, e alleles) are correlated with reduced WBC counts at the level of BLV-negative groups of animals and thus could be the feature of the aleukemic (AL) form of BLV infection. We suggest this finding could be used in BLV testing for the presence of Tax A, H in the proviral DNA consider such strains of BLV as AL ones, and because of this, minimize the clinical losses due to BLV infection in cattle.","['Zyrianova, Irina M', 'Kovalchuk, Svetlana N']","['Zyrianova IM', 'Kovalchuk SN']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1871-8750', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5029-0750']","['Department of Molecular Biotechnology, Federal State Budget Scientific Institution Center of Experimental Embryology and Reproductive Biotechnologies, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology, Federal State Budget Scientific Institution Center of Experimental Embryology and Reproductive Biotechnologies, Moscow, Russian Federation.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Virulence,Virulence,101531386,IM,,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/virology', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*genetics/*virology', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Female', 'Gene Products, tax/classification/*genetics', '*Genes, pX', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bovine leukemia virus (BLV)', '*Enzootic Bovine Leukosis (EBL)', '*Tax protein', '*polymorphism', '*tax gene']",2019/12/31 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2019/12/31 06:00'],"['2019/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/21505594.2019.1708051 [doi]'],ppublish,Virulence. 2020 Dec;11(1):80-87. doi: 10.1080/21505594.2019.1708051.,PMC6961721,,,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

De novo B-ALL cases with JAK2 rearrangements are suggested to be appropriately considered as BCR-ABL1-like B-ALL, but its partners varied. METHODS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), whole-genome sequencing, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed to identify the pathogenic fusion gene in a 29-year-old woman with relapsed B-ALL and rare t(1;9)(p13;p22) translocation. RESULTS: We identified RNPC3 as a new JAK2 fusion partner in the patient. She was treated with a combination of chemotherapy and targeted drug ruxolitinib and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, but failed to achieve complete remission.

We conducted a nationwide multicentre study to investigate the characteristics of mucormycosis in children with haematological malignancies. The cohort included 39 children with mucormycosis: 25 of 1136 children (incidence 2.2%) with acute leukaemias prospectively enrolled in a centralized clinical registry in 2004-2017, and an additional 14 children with haematological malignancies identified by retrospective search of the databases of seven paediatric haematology centres. Ninety-two percent of mucormycosis cases occurred in patients with acute leukaemias. Mucormycosis was significantly associated with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (OR 3.75; 95% CI 1.51-9.37; P = 0.004) and with increasing age (OR 3.58; 95% CI 1.24-9.77; P = 0.01). Fifteen patients (38%) died of mucormycosis. Rhinocerebral pattern was independently associated with improved 12-week survival (OR 9.43; 95% CI 1.47-60.66; P = 0.02) and relapsed underlying malignancy was associated with increased 12-week mortality (OR 6.42; 95% CI, 1.01-40.94; P = 0.05). In patients receiving frontline therapy for their malignancy (n = 24), one-year cumulative mucormycosis-related mortality was 21 +/- 8% and five-year overall survival was 70 +/- 8%. This largest paediatric population-based study of mucormycosis demonstrates that children receiving frontline therapy for their haematological malignancy are often salvageable.","['Elitzur, Sarah',

Commonly used forms of asparaginase are native E. coli-derived asparaginase (native asparaginase) and pegaspargase in first-line combination therapy, and native Erwinia chrysanthemi-derived asparaginase (Erwinia asparaginase) as second-line treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pegaspargase versus native asparaginase in first-line combination therapy for patients with newly diagnosed ALL. A combined decision tree and health-state transition Markov cost-effectiveness model was developed to assess the relative costs and health outcomes of pegaspargase versus native asparaginase in the UK setting. RESULTS: In base case analyses, first-line pegaspargase (followed by Erwinia asparaginase in cases of hypersensitivity) dominated first-line native asparaginase followed by Erwinia asparaginase; i.e. resulted in lower costs and more quality-adjusted life year gain. The favourable hypersensitivity rates and administration profile of pegaspargase led to lifetime cost savings of pound4741 versus native asparaginase. Pegaspargase remained cost-effective versus all treatment strategies in all scenario analyses, including use of the 2500 IU/m(2) dose, recommended for patients </=21 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Pegaspargase, as part of multi-drug chemotherapy, is a cost-effective option for the treatment of newly diagnosed ALL. Based on this study, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Technology Appraisal Committee concluded that it could recommend pegaspargase as a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources in England & Wales for treating ALL in children, young people and adults with untreated, newly diagnosed disease.
