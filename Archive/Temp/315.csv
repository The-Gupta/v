The enzyme is practically inactive at concentrations of calcium below 10 microM and expresses maximal activity in the presence of 0.12-0.15 mM Ca2+. The affinity for Ca2+ cannot be reduced by exposure of the enzyme to conditions known to promote autoproteolysis of calpain. Expression of catalytic activity at lower concentrations of Ca2+, is promoted by the interaction with phospholipid vesicles or plasma membranes. Conditions that promote activation of calpain, induce also the self-inactivation of the enzyme. During terminal differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells induced by HMBA, the intracellular level of calpain activity undergoes significative reduction. Similar decrease in calpain activity progressively occurs during the loss of sensitivity to HMBA as a result of density growth arrest.","['Salamino, F', 'Passalacqua, M', 'Patrone, M', 'Viotti, P L', 'Sparatore, B']","['Salamino F', 'Passalacqua M', 'Patrone M', 'Viotti PL', 'Sparatore B']","['Institute of Biological Chemistry, University of Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Biochem Int,Biochemistry international,8100311,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Acetamides', 'Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calpain/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Int. 1990 Aug;21(5):901-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show some novel effects of activin on murine embryonal carcinoma cells (EC cells). First, activin acts as a growth factor on undifferentiated P19 cells, a well characterized EC cell line for the study of mammalian development. Second, activin inhibits the retinoic acid (RA) induced differentiation of P19 cells to neurons and glial cells. The inhibitory effect of activin on neural differentiation, which has yet to be proved in other physiological peptides, is confirmed also on the differentiation of various neuroblastoma cell lines. Our results suggest a possible role of activin as a negative regulator of neural differentiation in mammalian development.","['Hashimoto, M', 'Kondo, S', 'Sakurai, T', 'Etoh, Y', 'Shibai, H', 'Muramatsu, M']","['Hashimoto M', 'Kondo S', 'Sakurai T', 'Etoh Y', 'Shibai H', 'Muramatsu M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['104625-48-1 (Activins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)']",IM,"['Activins', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Inhibins/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurons/*cytology/drug effects', 'Teratoma', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1990/11/30 00:00,1990/11/30 00:01,['1990/11/30 00:00'],"['1990/11/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/30 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1990 Nov 30;173(1):193-200. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(05)81040-x.,"['S0006-291X(05)81040-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(05)81040-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normal thymus and lymph node specimens with reactive lymphadenitis were also investigated. Subcortical thymocytes and the majority of deep cortical thymocytes showed reactivity of alpha-/beta-/gamma- approximately +/- -enolases, and medullary thymocytes and small lymphocytes in T zone areas of lymph node showed reactivity of alpha-/beta+/gamma- approximately +/- -enolases. Seven of the 8 cases with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed reactivity of alpha-/beta-/gamma(-)-enolases or alpha+/beta-/gamma(-)-enolases in leukemic lymphocytes, 7 of the 8 cases with T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma showed reactivity of beta(+)-enolase, and all 14 cases with peripheral T-cell lymphomas showed reactivity of alpha-/beta- approximately +/gamma(+)-enolases in lymphoma cells. All the 12 cases with Hodgkin's disease showed reactivity of alpha-/beta+/gamma(+)-enolases in Reed-Sternberg and Hodgkin's cells. These results indicate the following: (a) The neoplastic cells of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and peripheral T cell lymphomas present different expressions in each of these three categories. This may imply a difference of maturation and differentiation or activation among neoplastic T lymphocytes. (b) T lymphocytes may switch from alpha- to beta-enolase and from alpha- to gamma-enolase in the course of differentiation and activation.

Mitozolomide was additionally studied in vivo in nine human tumor xenografts. The comparison of in vitro/in vivo activity allows an assessment of the relevant in vitro dose based on in vivo pharmacological behavior of a compound. Both compounds showed clear dose/response effects in vitro. A dose of 3 micrograms/ml mitozolomide, given by continuous exposure, was active (colony number of test less than 30% of the control group) in 12/42 (29%) human tumor xenografts as well as in the four murine tumors, P388, L1210, B16 melanoma and colon carcinoma 38, whereas the two human bone marrows showed no significant suppression of the ability to form colonies in culture. The comparison of in vitro with in vivo activity suggests that the in vitro dose of 3 micrograms/ml corresponds best to the activity observed in animal experiments. The highest activity was observed in small-cell cancer of the lung (4/5), followed by melanomas (2/7) and non-small-cell cancer of the lung (2/9). Furthermore, activity was found in a cancer of the large bowel, stomach, breast and in one sarcoma. In the treatment of nine human tumor xenografts growing subcutaneously in nude mice, mitozolomide effected a complete or partial remission in 6 out of 9 tumors. In comparison to standard drugs mitozolomide is one of the most effective compounds in these tumors. These data indicate that mitozolomide possesses potent broad-spectrum activity in human tumor xenografts. Sparsomycin (0.1 micrograms/ml, continuous exposure) was active in 11/46 (24%) human tumor xenografts and in 4/5 of the murine tumors, whereas the colony-forming capacity of four human bone-marrows showed no inhibition, suggesting that this dose level may be the relevant in vitro dose. However, the high in vitro activity in murine tumors is incompatible with the in vivo activity. In mice the only responsive tumor was leukemia P388, whereas the L1210, B16 melanoma and colon carcinoma 38 were resistant. At the dose level of 0.03 microgram/ml only 3/30 (10%) of the human tumor xenografts were sensitive. In an earlier clinical phase I study the dose-limiting adverse effect was eye toxicity and not bone-marrow suppression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Fiebig, H H', 'Berger, D P', 'Kopping, K', 'Ottenheijm, H C', 'Zylicz, Z']","['Fiebig HH', 'Berger DP', 'Kopping K', 'Ottenheijm HC', 'Zylicz Z']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Freiburg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '6C940P63E7 (Sparsomycin)', 'E3U7286V3W (mitozolomide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sparsomycin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1990;116(6):550-6. doi: 10.1007/BF01637073.,['10.1007/BF01637073 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, inhibition of lysosomal proteinases and calpains or depletion of ATP did not affect the thermal inactivation of prolyl endopeptidase. This specific inactivation of prolyl endopeptidase was also observed following the addition to the culture medium of menadione or diamide, compounds known to increase intracellular oxidized glutathione levels. The activity of prolyl endopeptidase in the cell lysate was also dose-dependently decreased by the addition of glutathione disulfide and the decrease of the activity was prevented by coexistence of reduced glutathione. Furthermore, the level of intracellular oxidized glutathione was increased during incubation at 45 degrees C for 15 min, but not at 42 degrees C for 30 min.

Relapse is one of the main complications, and its frequency increases with disease status and the use of T cell depletion and the subsequent loss of the graft versus leukemia effect of transplanted allogeneic cells. New agents such as high dose ARA-C, VP 16, Myleran, and Melphalan have been studied in Phase I-II studies. Different modalities of total body irradiation, that is, single dose or fractionated or hyperfractionated doses, have been used. None of these new modalities has modified significantly the long-term disease-free survival rate because of the toxicity of any attempt to diminish the rate of relapse with intensified regimens.

Almost all types of cancer have been associated with radiotherapy. The breast, thyroid, and bone marrow are the organs most susceptible to radiation carcinogenesis. The bone marrow is also most frequently involved by chemotherapy and the leukemia risk is much higher than after radiotherapy. The combination of intensive radiotherapy and chemotherapy is particularly leukemogenic. The latent period between radiotherapy/chemotherapy and the appearance of a second primary cancer ranges from a few years to several decades. The risk for a second primary cancer following radiotherapy or chemotherapy emphasizes the need for life long follow-up of patients receiving such treatments. This is particularly the case in individuals with long life expectancy, for example, patients treated for childhood neoplasms.

In the absence of both radiotherapy and chemotherapy, there was four times the expected number of subsequent cancers. The risk of an SPT associated with radiotherapy but not chemotherapy and both radiotherapy and chemotherapy were 6 and 9 times that expected, respectively. There is evidence that radiotherapy was involved in the development of many of the SPT's observed.

When BH-AC was added to the suspension culture of leukemic cells, BH-AC gradually decreased in concentration in the culture media and was rapidly taken into the cellular fraction. The conversion from BH-AC to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine was noted in both the culture media and the cellular fraction. The concentration of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine converted from BH-AC in the culture medium gradually increased during 7 days of culture, although the rate of conversion was variable among the samples. BH-AC suppressed primary and secondary blast colony formation in a dose responsive manner. BH-AC also suppressed the recovery of clonogenic cells in suspension culture. The suppression by BH-AC was more prominent in secondary blast colony formation and the recovery of clonogenic cells in suspension culture than in primary blast colony formation. Secondary blast colony formation and the recovery of clonogenic cells in suspension are considered to reflect the self-renewal of blast progenitors, while primary blast colony formation is considered to reflect the terminal divisions of blast progenitors. The results obtained in the present study suggest that BH-AC is more effective to suppress the self-renewal of blast progenitors than the terminal divisions.

The mechanism of action of this compound is not clear at this time. We have recently shown that hepsulfam was more toxic to L1210 leukemia cells than was busulfan. Consistent with the difference in toxicity, we found that hepsulfam induced DNA interstrand cross-links in L1210 mouse leukemia cells, whereas busulfan did not. In the present study, we have found that hepsulfam was more cytotoxic to two human leukemia cell lines (HL-60 and K562) and to two human colon carcinoma cell lines (BE and HT-29) than was busulfan. As in L1210 cells, hepsulfam induced a higher level of DNA interstrand cross-links than busulfan. Both compounds induced DNA-protein cross-links. Hepsulfam was also more cytotoxic to the human leukemia cell lines when the concentrations were reduced 10-fold and the duration of drug exposure was increased to 12-h This more accurately reflects the drug exposures that human leukemia cells may encounter in vivo. Under these 12-h drug exposures, hepsulfam was still able to form DNA interstrand and DNA-protein cross-links, whereas busulfan was only able to form DNA-protein cross-links. These results show that busulfan and hepsulfam react with DNA differently and that hepsulfam is a more potent cytotoxic agent.","['Pacheco, D Y', 'Cook, C', 'Hincks, J R', 'Gibson, N W']","['Pacheco DY', 'Cook C', 'Hincks JR', 'Gibson NW']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology, AMC Cancer Research Center, Denver, Colorado 80214.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Sulfonic Acids)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '971DU2GQ51 (hepsulfam)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Busulfan/toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Sulfonic Acids/*toxicity']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Dec 1;50(23):7555-8.,,,,,['CA 50582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

We studied the membrane transport and the growth-inhibitory effects of the two thymidylate synthase inhibitors on human CCRF-CEM leukemia cells with different transport properties for folic acid, reduced folates, and methotrexate (MTX). Membrane transport of [3H]ICI-198,583 can proceed via the high affinity/low capacity reduced folate carrier as supported by findings that (a) uptake of [3H]ICI-198,583 was significantly impaired in CEM cells which have a transport defect for MTX, (b) variants of CEM cells which overproduce the reduced folate carrier system showed a concomitant increase in the uptake of [3H]ICI-198,583 as for [3H]MTX, (c) MTX inhibited transport of [3H]ICI-198,583, and (d) uptake of [3H]ICI-198,583 was inhibited after treatment of CEM cells with an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of MTX, which is a potent inhibitor of MTX transport. However, a membrane-associated folate-binding protein (FBP) offers another route for entry of CB3717 and ICI-198,583. CEM-FBP cells that have an elevated amount of FBP and do not have a functional reduced folate carrier were 640- and 61-fold more sensitive to CB3717 and ICI-198,583, respectively, compared to control CEM cells expressing the reduced folate/MTX carrier. This high sensitivity was related to a high affinity of the FBP for CB3717 and ICI-198,583 (Kd 2-3 nM), which is only 3-fold lower than for folic acid (Kd 1 nM) but significantly higher than for MTX (Kd 100 nM). Furthermore, after incubation of CEM-FBP cells for 24 h at 10 nM [3H]ICI-198,583, the high affinity binding of the FBP for ICI-198,583 allowed a 600-fold concentrative uptake of [3H]ICI-198,583 and its conversion to polyglutamate forms. These results indicate that multiple folate transport systems may be involved in the uptake of folate-based thymidylate synthase inhibitors.","['Jansen, G', 'Schornagel, J H', 'Westerhof, G R', 'Rijksen, G', 'Newell, D R', 'Jackman, A L']","['Jansen G', 'Schornagel JH', 'Westerhof GR', 'Rijksen G', 'Newell DR', 'Jackman AL']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '76849-19-9 (CB 3717)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'N8VP1Y24AU (ICI 198583)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Carriers', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacokinetics', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Dec 1;50(23):7544-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of six platelet activating factor antagonists tested, four were found to protect WEHI-3B leukemic cells against cell death induced by ET-18-OCH3. Certain other compounds, not platelet activating factor antagonists, had similar protective effects. The protective compounds were all lipophilic weak bases. We describe experiments that indicate that these compounds protect by inhibition of endocytic uptake of ET-18-OCH3. Sensitive cells showed rapid endocytic uptake, whereas in resistant cells, uptake was slow. Uptake of ET-18-OCH3 could be suppressed by inhibitors of endocytosis such as chloroquine, monensin, and vinblastine. We conclude that one of the principal determinants of sensitivity or resistance to ether lipids may be the rate at which cells take them up by endocytosis.","['Bazill, G W', 'Dexter, T M']","['Bazill GW', 'Dexter TM']","['Department of Experimental Haematology, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Triazoles)', '105219-56-5 (WEB 2086)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', '30S50YM8OG (Hydroxyzine)', '5XZM1R3DKF (brotizolam)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', '8ZYQ1474W7 (Sodium Fluoride)', '93363-02-1', '(N-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-(3-pyridinyl)-1H,3H-pyrrolo(1,2-c)thiazole-7-carboxamide)', '99103-35-2 (2,5-bis(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)tetrahydrofuran)', 'A7V27PHC7A (Quinine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EE92BBP03H (Diltiazem)', 'I9ZF7L6G2L (Nifedipine)', 'ITX08688JL (Quinidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azepines/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Diltiazem/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endocytosis/*drug effects', 'Furans/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyzine/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Nifedipine/pharmacology', 'Phospholipid Ethers/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Quinidine/pharmacology', 'Quinine/pharmacology', 'Sodium Fluoride/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Triazoles/pharmacology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Dec 1;50(23):7505-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were no side effects related to the infusion of Pentaglobin and in all cases the serum concentrations of IgA, IgG and IgM at least doubled. Improvement of GVHD was seen in five patients with grade II GVHD. Conversely, in three patients with grade II and two patients with grade III GVHD, the disease either progressed during Pentaglobin infusion and required steroid treatment or showed no change and required steroids later in the course. Pentaglobin, therefore, might have some effect on mild and moderate GVHD. Randomized trials should be able to determine whether Pentaglobin could be considered as part of the GVHD prophylaxis or as adjunct treatment for acute GVHD together with low doses of steroids.","['Klingemann, H G', 'Barnett, M J', 'Reece, D E', 'Shepherd, J D', 'Phillips, G L']","['Klingemann HG', 'Barnett MJ', 'Reece DE', 'Shepherd JD', 'Phillips GL']","['Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (Immunoglobulin M)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Immunoglobulin M/*therapeutic use']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1990 Sep;6(3):199-202.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABM was found to be superior to LAK cells against all tumor cells tested. The recovery of bone marrow (BM) cells dropped with passage of time in culture but their clonogenic potential was not impaired (with or without IL-2). BM contaminated with CEM cells and treated with IL-2 showed significant ability to purge itself of the leukemic cells in semisolid agar culture; the purging ability of 3- and 1-day ABM was comparable. IL-2 alone or BM alone had no influence on the growth of CEM cells.

These lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells can discriminate between neoplastic and normal bone marrow cells and may represent a useful means of purging bone marrow prior to autologous transplantation. We demonstrate that LAK cells can successfully remove four distinctly different malignant hematopoietic cell types from normal bone marrow grafts. The LAK purging technique is capable of a 2-3 log10 reduction in tumor cells in the bone marrow graft without compromising hematological recovery or survival. Our results also suggest, however, that an inhibitory effect on stem cell function by allogeneic LAK cells exists, and this form of purging may be used only if greater levels of bone marrow are transferred in an allogeneic setting. The ability to detect and eliminate malignant cells in bone marrow prior to use for autologous transplantation suggests that LAK cells, alone or in conjunction with current methods of bone marrow purging, could be useful for the in vitro treatment of bone marrow in patients who require high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation.","['Long, G S', 'Cramer, D V', 'Harnaha, J B', 'Hiserodt, J C']","['Long GS', 'Cramer DV', 'Harnaha JB', 'Hiserodt JC']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/pathology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN/immunology', 'Rats, Inbred F344/immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/pathology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1990 Sep;6(3):169-77.,,,,,"['AI 26364/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 38804/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Although several clinical trials have suggested a direct relationship between GVL effects and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), it is not yet known whether GVL can be separated from GVHD. However, several investigations in murine models of human leukemia indicate that the two may be at least partially separable. Moreover, analysis of clinical data from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry suggest that allogeneic BMT may be more advantageous than syngeneic BMT, regardless of the GVHD. Likewise, T lymphocyte depletion is associated with an increased incidence of relapse, independently of GVHD. Recent investigations in murine leukemia suggest that GVL-like effects may be inducible following syngeneic BMT by recombinant cytokines with no overt GVHD. Taken together, current data in experimental animals and man suggest that GVL may be at least partially separable from GVHD. Hence, further understanding of effector and target cells of GVL as well as our ability to induce antitumor effector cells, especially those that are MHC nonrestricted, may lead to new approaches for potentiating anti-tumor effector mechanisms without inducing severe, clinically overt GVHD. Successful attempts in these directions may also lead to improved results following autologous BMT as a result of activation of GVL-like effects by recombinant cytokines that are capable of activating effector cells with anti-leukemic activity in vivo, such as recombinant human IL2, alpha interferon or perhaps a synergistic combination of factors.","['Slavin, S', 'Ackerstein, A', 'Naparstek, E', 'Or, R', 'Weiss, L']","['Slavin S', 'Ackerstein A', 'Naparstek E', 'Or R', 'Weiss L']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation & Cancer Immunobiology, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', '*Graft vs Host Reaction/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', '*Models, Biological', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1990 Sep;6(3):155-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six consecutive patients with transfusion-dependent MDS seen in a medical school hospital and outpatient clinic from 1981 to 1988 were studied. The first 21 patients were treated with 13-CRA alone and the next 45 patients with 13-CRA plus alpha-tocopherol (AT). We compared responses to and toxicities of therapy, rates of transformation, and survival from onset of therapy in 20 evaluable patients treated with 13-CRA alone and 43 patients treated with 13-CRA plus AT. RESULTS: Four patients responded (20%) at 4 to 8 months to 13-CRA alone, but this response was associated with considerable toxicity and resulted in cessation of therapy. Among the responders, only one continued therapy and is currently in remission, whereas three discontinued therapy because of toxicity and have had a relapse and died. In the 13-CRA plus AT group, we observed one prolonged complete remission and 10 partial remissions (26%), with a decrease in skin and constitutional toxicities by the addition of AT, which enabled the continuation of 13-CRA indefinitely. Although the response rates were similar in both groups, fewer patients (28% versus 60%) experienced progression to acute leukemia in the 13-CRA plus AT group than in the group receiving 13-CRA alone, who terminated treatment (p = 0.018). A twofold increase in median survival of the RA/RARS and RAEB/CMML patient groups was observed with 13-CRA plus AT but was not significant (p greater than 0.5). CONCLUSION: This study shows a 20% to 26% response rate to 13-CRA and suggests that 13-CRA, if given continuously, decreases the rate of progression or transformation to acute leukemia in patients with MDS. The addition of AT ameliorates the toxicity of 13-CRA and allows for long-term treatment with 13-CRA. Since the standard treatment for MDS is currently unsatisfactory, these findings indicate that longer treatment with a non-marrow-suppressive agent such as 13-CRA is important, and further trials to determine the role of 13-CRA plus AT in combination with new recombinant growth factors in the therapy for transfusion-dependent MDS should offer a new approach to a disease common in the elderly population.","['Besa, E C', 'Abrahm, J L', 'Bartholomew, M J', 'Hyzinski, M', 'Nowell, P C']","['Besa EC', 'Abrahm JL', 'Bartholomew MJ', 'Hyzinski M', 'Nowell PC']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19129.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isotretinoin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Vitamin E/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1990 Dec;89(6):739-47. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(90)90215-y.,"['0002-9343(90)90215-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(90)90215-y [doi]']",,,,['CA-42232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Overall actuarial survival was 57% at 7 yr. Four patients recovered while receiving conventional therapy, and four died before treatment with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) could be initiated. Nineteen patients (median age 19.6 yr) were treated with allogeneic BMT (11 as initial therapy, eight after ATG). Incidence of acute and chronic graft versus host disease was high, occurring in 14/16 and 4/11 patients at risk, respectively. Survival of BMT patients (18/19 transfused) was 32% at 7 yr. Of 63 patients treated with ATG, survival was 63% at 7 yr but decreased to 43% at 11 yr. The 2.5 yr survival following ATG was influenced by pretreatment disease severity (defined by percentage reticulocytes, granulocyte and platelet counts), age and--in patients under 45 yr of age--by sex. However, pretreatment disease severity was less in patients aged between 20 and 45 yr and in females. Concomitant androgen therapy, animal source of ATG, interval diagnosis--ATG (which was in general rather short) and aetiology did not influence survival. Thirty-four patients became transfusion independent for up to 26 months after ATG. A gradual increase in granulocyte and platelet counts could be observed over a period of many years, and 26 patients recovered to show a normal haemoglobin level, granulocytes greater than or equal to 1.0 X 10(9)/l and platelets greater than or equal to 100 X 10(9)/l). Late complications (paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, myelodysplastic syndrome/acute leukaemia, hepatocellular carcinoma) were observed in nine patients who survived with autologous marrow function.

HMBA is currently being studied in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Previous phase I trials have demonstrated that HMBA produces hematologic toxicity in morphologically normal bone marrows of patients with solid tumors. Because of concern that HMBA may produce more severe myelotoxicity in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome since these patients have limited hematopoietic reserves, we studied the effects of HMBA on myelodysplastic and normal hematopoietic progenitors in vitro. HMBA concentrations that are optimal for differentiation in vitro (2 to 5 mmol/L) and HMBA concentrations that are being achieved in clinical trials (1 to 2 mmol/L) inhibited the growth of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units and erythroid burst-forming units from all 15 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and all 4 normal subjects, HMBA did not induce proliferation of myelodysplastic or normal progenitors at any concentration; rather, it produced nearly identical inhibition of normal and myelodysplastic hematopoietic progenitors. HMBA also produced quantitatively similar inhibition of clonogenic leukemic growth of two myeloid leukemia cell lines. For a differentiating agent to be effective, it will likely have to either produce both differentiation and proliferation of abnormal hematopoietic progenitors or show selective inhibitory effects on abnormal as compared with normal progenitors. Although the mechanisms responsible for the antiproliferative effects of HMBA cannot be determined from this study, similar inhibitory effects of HMBA on normal and abnormal hematopoietic progenitors suggest that HMBA may be of limited utility in producing and sustaining elevations of peripheral blood cell counts in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.","['Rowinsky, E K', 'Donehower, R C', 'Spivak, J L', 'Burke, P J', 'Griffin, C A', 'Jones, R J']","['Rowinsky EK', 'Donehower RC', 'Spivak JL', 'Burke PJ', 'Griffin CA', 'Jones RJ']","['Division of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Hematinics)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Hematinics/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy']",1990/12/19 00:00,1990/12/19 00:01,['1990/12/19 00:00'],"['1990/12/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/19 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1990 Dec 19;82(24):1926-31. doi: 10.1093/jnci/82.24.1926.,['10.1093/jnci/82.24.1926 [doi]'],,,,['N01-CM-57738/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

More recently, CBP35 (epsilon BP) was found to be equivalent to Mac-2, a surface marker on activated macrophages. Using rat epsilon BP cDNA, we have succeeded in expressing recombinant epsilon BP in Escherichia coli. Milligram quantities of homogeneous epsilon BP could be obtained from bacterial lysate in a one-step affinity purification procedure utilizing lactosyl-Sepharose 4B and elution with a lactose gradient. The recombinant epsilon BP (r epsilon BP) binds mouse IgE and retains reactivity to anti-peptide antibodies specific for a sequence within rat epsilon BP. The purified r epsilon BP exhibits binding activity to various saccharides, with affinity for N-acetyllactosamine greater than thiodigalactoside greater than lactose much greater than D-galactose greater than L-arabinose, an order identical to that exhibited by native epsilon BP isolated from RBL cells. The recombinant lectin displayed hemagglutination activity when tested with rabbit erythrocytes. Although epsilon BP shares sequence homology to other lectins containing S-type (thiol-dependent) carbohydrate-recognition domains, r epsilon BP is resistant to air oxidation and does not require reducing agents for maintaining its activity. Furthermore, the single cysteine residue appears to be unexposed and can be alkylated only when the protein is denatured in 5.6 M guanidinium hydrochloride. The availability of a source for a large quantity of epsilon BP should facilitate the analysis of biological function(s) and structure-activity relationships of this lectin.","['Frigeri, L G', 'Robertson, M W', 'Liu, F T']","['Frigeri LG', 'Robertson MW', 'Liu FT']","['Medical Biology Institute, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Prostatic Secretory Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (beta-microseminoprotein)', '0 (immunoglobulin-binding factors)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Escherichia coli/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphokines/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', '*Prostatic Secretory Proteins', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism']",1990/12/05 00:00,1990/12/05 00:01,['1990/12/05 00:00'],"['1990/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Dec 5;265(34):20763-9.,['S0021-9258(17)45281-1 [pii]'],,,,"['AI-19747/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-20958/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Each patient received marrow from a family member who shared one HLA haplotype with the patient but differed to a variable degree for the HLA-A, -B, and -D antigens of the haplotype not shared; 29 were phenotypically identical, 119 were incompatible for one locus, 104 for two loci, and 29 for three loci. These 281 patients were compared with 967 patients who received marrow from siblings with identical HLA genotypes. All patients were treated with cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation followed by the infusion of unmodified donor marrow cells. Occurrence of severe acute graft-versus-host disease was evaluated in patients who achieved sustained engraftment. In recipients of haploidentical grafts occurrence of severe acute graft-versus-host disease was associated with (1) graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis containing the combination of methotrexate plus cyclosporine versus standard methotrexate, relative risk = 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.57, p less than 0.0001; and (2) the degree of recipient HLA incompatibility, relative risk = 1.95 for each locus incompatible; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-2.50, p less than 0.0001; (3) patient age, relative risk = 1.23 per decade; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.44, p = 0.0094. Acute graft-versus-host disease was associated with lower leukemic relapse after transplant in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, and chronic graft-versus-host disease was associated with lower relapse after transplant for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in relapse or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis. After transplantation for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in remission, the rate of leukemic relapse was 22% in 61 recipients of ""one-locus"" (A, B, or D)-incompatible grafts compared to 37% in 561 recipients of HLA-identical sibling grafts.

After contact with monolayer cells, NK activity of both PBL and LGL was significantly reduced. When these effector cells were preincubated with 0.1 U/ml of OK-432 for 18 h and then tested for the sensitivity to contact-mediated inhibition, the inhibition was significantly reduced. The pretreatment of monolayer cells with OK-432 or the addition of OK-432 into the coculture wells (of effector cells and monolayer cells) also significantly reduced the contact-mediated inhibition. Moreover, OK-432 (0.1 U/ml) reestablished the inhibited NK activity of PBL.

Comparison of IL-2R alpha promoter activities has revealed that the transcriptional activation of the promoter alone cannot explain the large numbers of IL-2R alpha expressed on HTLV-1 infected cells. We found that the rates of the IL-2R alpha mRNA degradation were greatly reduced in pX-positive cells as compared with pX-negative cells. Simultaneous transfection of the expression vector plasmid containing IL-2R alpha cDNA and similar plasmids containing various pX sequences showed that p27rex elongated the half life of IL-2R alpha mRNA. As p27rex did not affect the transport of the IL-2R alpha mRNA from nucleus to cytoplasm, prolongation of the IL-2R alpha mRNA half life by p27rex is ascribed to stabilization of the mRNA. Experiments using deletion mutants and chimeric constructs of the IL-2R alpha cDNA demonstrated that the coding sequence but not the 5' or 3' untranslated region of the IL-2R alpha mRNA sequence is responsible for its protection by p27rex.","['Kanamori, H', 'Suzuki, N', 'Siomi, H', 'Nosaka, T', 'Sato, A', 'Sabe, H', 'Hatanaka, M', 'Honjo, T']","['Kanamori H', 'Suzuki N', 'Siomi H', 'Nosaka T', 'Sato A', 'Sabe H', 'Hatanaka M', 'Honjo T']","['Department of Medical Chemistry, Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, rex/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1990 Dec;9(12):4161-6.,,,,,,,PMC552191,,,,,,,

The procedure includes DNA isolation from leukemic cells, quantification of DNA concentrations, breakdown by enzymatic digestion of DNA to nucleosides and a radioimmunoassay (RIA) using an antibody against Ara-C. Different techniques for quantification of DNA concentrations are compared. A fluorimetric technique using Hoechst 33258 is preferred because it is the most specific method. Comparison of this RIA assay with measurement of [3H]-Ara-C/DNA formation under similar conditions in HL-60 cells showed a correlation of 0.99. Ara-C incorporation into DNA of leukemic cells was studied using two rat-leukemia cell lines, one of which is sensitive to Ara-C and the other is an Ara-C-resistant wild type: BNML-Cl/0 and BNML-Cl/Ara-C, respectively. The results showed that Ara-C is incorporated when the cells are incubated at concentrations equal to or higher than the Ara-C concentration that induces 50% growth inhibition after 48 h incubation (IC50). This implies that at lower Ara-C concentration, i.e. levels that do not induce cytotoxicity, Ara-C is not incorporated into DNA. Similar results were obtained with human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. The detection limit of this assay is 2 pmol/ml Ara-C; therefore, the assay is more sensitive than measurement of Ara-C triphosphate (Ara-CTP), the only metabolite that can be measured in leukemic cells from patients after in vivo Ara-C administration.

The incorporation of ara-C into DNA was also higher in Molt-3 cells than in either HL-60 or RPMI-8392 cells. The mean intracellular half-life of ara-CTP was 31.7, 59.4, and 155 min for RPMI-8392, HL-60, and Molt-3 leukemic cells, respectively. The Km and Vmax values of ara-C for deoxycytidine kinase and the feedback inhibition of this enzyme by ara-CTP in the different leukemic cell lines could not explain the differences in metabolism of this analogue in these cells. These data indicate the increased sensitivity of T-lymphoid leukemic cells to ara-C than as compared with B-lymphoid and myeloid leukemic cells was due to an increased rate of formation and a longer half-life of ara-CTP in the T-cells.","['Momparler, R L', 'Onetto-Pothier, N', 'Bouffard, D Y', 'Momparler, L F']","['Momparler RL', 'Onetto-Pothier N', 'Bouffard DY', 'Momparler LF']","['Department de pharmacologie, Universite de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1990;27(2):141-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00689099.,['10.1007/BF00689099 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS: 2676 Patients entered into Hodgkin's disease studies between February 1970 and November 1986. Data accrued up to November 1988 were analysed, ensuring a minimum follow up period of two years. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of multicentre trial data by case-control and life table methods. RESULTS: 17 Cases of secondary leukaemia were recorded in this group of 2676 patients, giving an overall risk at 15 years of 1.7%. The risks of leukaemia after chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy with radiotherapy were not significantly different. The risk of leukaemia increased sharply with the amount of treatment given as measured by the number of attempts at treatment. The 15 year risks of leukaemia were 0.2%, 2.3%, and 8.1% for patients receiving one, two, or three or more attempts at treatment. The highest risk, 22.8% at 15 years, was observed in patients treated with lomustine (CCNU), and a case-control study suggested that this was an independent risk factor. The risk of secondary leukaemia was largely related to the overall quantity of treatment, although exposure to lomustine seemed to be an important risk factor. Treatment with both drugs and radiation was not more leukaemogenic than treatment with drugs alone. The greatest risk of secondary leukaemia was seen in multiply treated patients who were unlikely to be cured of Hodgkin's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Avoidance of secondary leukaemia should be a minor factor in the choice of treatment for Hodgkin's disease.","['Devereux, S', 'Selassie, T G', 'Vaughan Hudson, G', 'Vaughan Hudson, B', 'Linch, D C']","['Devereux S', 'Selassie TG', 'Vaughan Hudson G', 'Vaughan Hudson B', 'Linch DC']",['Kent and Canterbury Hospital.'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,['7BRF0Z81KG (Lomustine)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Hodgkin Disease/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Life Tables', 'Lomustine/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk']",1990/11/10 00:00,1990/11/10 00:01,['1990/11/10 00:00'],"['1990/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,BMJ. 1990 Nov 10;301(6760):1077-80. doi: 10.1136/bmj.301.6760.1077.,['10.1136/bmj.301.6760.1077 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC1664202,,,,,,,

WM-66 was shown to react with virtually all normal T and B lymphocytes from peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues, as well as blood monocytes and approximately 40% of bone marrow mononuclear cells. The antibody also bound to the majority of cases of chronic B-cell malignancies, including chronic lymphatic leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but not to cases of acute leukaemia or to the majority of leukaemic and lymphoblastoid cell lines. WM-66 also reacted with epithelium of bronchus and salivary gland ducts. A single band of relative molecular mass 65,000 Daltons was immunoprecipitated from membrane extracts of normal lymphocytes and the B-cell line Daudi. Treatment of a number of WM-66-negative B-cell lines with neuraminidase resulted in WM-66 binding, indicating that the antigen exists in a covert form masked by sialic acid residues on a wider spectrum of cell types than was initially apparent. The reactivity pattern of WM-66 indicates that it recognises a previously undescribed surface membrane molecule with broad non-lineage-specific distribution on leucocytes. This has recently been confirmed at the Fourth International Workshop on Human Leucocyte Differentiation Antigens. Although the biological function of the molecule recognised by WM-66 is unknown, the lytic properties of the antibody suggest a possible in vivo therapeutic role as an immunosuppressant or for treatment of lymphoid malignancy.","['Henniker, A J', 'Bradstock, K F', 'Grimsley, P', 'Atkinson, K']","['Henniker AJ', 'Bradstock KF', 'Grimsley P', 'Atkinson K']","['Department of Haematology, Westmead, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/chemistry/*immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/chemistry/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Lymphoid Tissue/cytology/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Macrophages/cytology/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Precipitin Tests']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 1990 Jul;36(1):25-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.1990.tb01794.x.,['10.1111/j.1399-0039.1990.tb01794.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the start of the decade, the role of cytogenetics in clinical medicine was still unclear. Many felt that such investigations were largely of academic interest. Today, cytogenetic investigations are considered essential in many cancers, where they contribute in diagnosis, staging, choice of therapeutic protocol, and monitoring of the effects of therapy. The number of primary chromosome changes in human cancer exceeds 100, and while the majority of these changes are associated with haematological malignancies, the contribution from the solid tumours is now growing rapidly. Closer ties between scientists and physicians involved in laboratory and clinical medicine have resulted in the emergence of many well-defined cytogenetic-clinicopathological entities. With the advances in molecular biology that characterized the 1980s came the disappearance of all scepticism about the critical role played by chromosome change in oncogenesis. To date, we have learned more about the details of cancer biology in chronic myeloid leukaemia and the lymphoid malignancies through the molecular dissection of primary chromosome changes than through any other approach. Further studies will, no doubt, lead us to an understanding of the molecular basis of many of the primary and secondary chromosome changes that are non-randomly acquired in human cancer.","['Dube, I D', 'Carter, R F', 'Pinkerton, P H']","['Dube ID', 'Carter RF', 'Pinkerton PH']","['Department of Pathology, University of Toronto, Ont., Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 1990;11 Suppl 1:3-24.,,,,151,,,,,,,,,,

Anterior and posterior chest wall electron ""boosts"" were given to the areas blocked (600 cGy in 2 fractions) on the last two days of treatment. Since then, we have treated over 600 patients with HFTBI, the majority for allogeneic BMT. Several modifications have occurred over the years. We have added a ""boost"" electron dose of 400 cGy to the testes in all male leukemic patients; this reduced testicular relapses from a rate of 14% (4/28) to 0%. In an attempt to increase engraftment of T-depleted BMTs, we added one additional fraction; since our present dose/fraction was also increased to 125 cGy, we now deliver a total dose of 1500 cGy in 12 fractions over 4 days for allogeneic transplants. Tolerance to HFTBI has been excellent relative to the single dose (SD) regimen utilised prior to May, 1979. The incidence of fatal interstitial pneumonitis (IP) decreased from 50% in the SD regimen to 18% after the introduction of HFTBI. In children, the incidence of IP was only 4% with HFTBI. With the introduction of T-depleted marrows, fatal IP in adults has decreased also, e.g. to less than 10% in CML patients. With conventional BMT after HFTBI, relapse at 5 years has been exceedingly low (e.g. in children, 13% for ALL, 2nd remission and 0% for AML, 1st remission) and engraftment has been 100%. With matched T-depleted BMT, rejections have occurred in 15% overall; the incidence of graft failure has not been reduced by the higher dose of HFTBI. Relapses in this setting are equivalent to relapses with conventional BMT for AML, but appear to be increased for ALL.

However, a most troublesome complication was GVHD which occurred in a high proportion of patients. In spite of the application of immunosuppressive drugs after the transplantation, GVHD caused 25% mortality in these patients. Depletion of T lymphocytes from the donor bone marrow prior to grafting has proved to be highly effective in preventing GVHD. Experiments with monkeys and dogs demonstrated that engraftment of T cell depleted marrow requires an increase of the TBI dose for conditioning. Most clinical transplant teams that did not adjust their conditioning regimen reported a high incidence of graft rejections following the use of T cell depleted marrow, as well as an increased relapse rate. Transplant teams that increased their conditioning dose of TBI report an excellent take of T cell depleted marrow. On the basis of the relation between leukemia cell kill and probability of relapse, taking into account the radiosensitivity of leukemia cells, it can be calculated that the graft-versus-leukemia effect experienced with unmodified bone marrow grafts equals 1 log leukemic cell kill. This extra anti-leukemic effect is provided by the larger TBI dose employed to achieve full engraftment of T cell depleted marrow. However, increasing the immunosuppression by conditioning with anti-lymphocyte sera or TLI is not expected to prevent an increased relapse rate, since these conditioning modalities do not provide the necessary extra killing of leukemic cells.","['van Bekkum, D W', 'Hagenbeek, A']","['van Bekkum DW', 'Hagenbeek A']","['Radiobiological Institute TNO, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Radiother Oncol,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,8407192,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/immunology/*radiotherapy/surgery', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiother Oncol. 1990;18 Suppl 1:30-6. doi: 10.1016/0167-8140(90)90176-w.,"['0167-8140(90)90176-W [pii]', '10.1016/0167-8140(90)90176-w [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A culture system that allows primitive normal and leukemic hematopoiesis to be maintained for many weeks has been developed. This system has been found to reproduce the cardinal features of primitive hematopoietic cell regulation in vivo and its use has allowed important progress to be made in characterizing the molecular basis of stromal cell regulation of primitive hematopoietic cells. Nevertheless, a large gap still remains between our knowledge of the genes that are altered in CML (or other malignancies) and the biological changes underlying the deregulation of growth that is characteristic of malignancy in general.

In a previous study, we mutated the UAG codon to UAA or UGA and demonstrated that both of these termination codons could be suppressed in reticulocyte lysates and in infected cells with the same efficiency as UAG. We now report the identity of the amino acids inserted in vitro in response to UAA and UGA in fusion products containing the gag-pol junction region. The results show that UAA, like UAG, directs the incorporation of glutamine, whereas UGA directs the incorporation of three amino acids, arginine, cysteine, and tryptophan. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating misreading of UAA as glutamine and UGA as arginine and cysteine in higher eukaryotes. Interestingly, although our protein synthesis system presumably contains other known UAG and UGA suppressors, these tRNAs did not suppress the termination codons in our experiments.

However, another major type of HTLV, HTLV-II, has been isolated only sporadically, and little is known of disease associations, transmission routes, and risk factors for HTLV-II infection. Recent studies indicate that a high percentage of certain groups of i.v. drug users and blood donors are infected with HTLV-II. Seroepidemiologic studies have found an elevated rate of seroreactivity to HTLV among Guaymi Indians from Bocas del Toro Province, Panama. To identify the cause of seroreactivity among this unique population we used HTLV-II-specific polymerase chain reaction techniques to detect HTLV genetic sequences from blood leukocytes of three seropositive Guaymi Indians.

An autoimmune mucocutaneous disease associated with neoplasia.,1729-35,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We describe five patients with underlying neoplasms in whom painful mucosal ulcerations and polymorphous skin lesions developed, usually with progression to blistering eruptions on the trunk and extremities. Histologic examination showed vacuolization of epidermal basal cells, keratinocyte necrosis, and acantholysis. Immunofluorescence testing revealed atypical pemphigus-like autoantibodies in perilesional epithelium and serum from all five patients. We studied the antigenic specificities of the autoantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, using extracts of 14C-labeled human keratinocytes. IgG purified from the serum of one patient was passively transferred to four neonatal mice to test for pathogenicity. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence testing showed that the autoantibodies bound to the surface of tissues containing desmosomes, including complex and simple epithelia, and myocardium. An identical and unique complex of four polypeptides with molecular weights of 250, 230, 210, and 190 was immunoprecipitated by all serum samples. The 250-kd polypeptide comigrated with desmoplakin I (a protein found in the desmosomes of all epithelia), and the 230-kd antigen comigrated with the antigen of bullous pemphigoid. Cutaneous blisters, a positive Nikolsky's sign, and epidermal and esophageal acantholysis developed in all mice into which the autoantibody was injected. Electron microscopy showed epidermal acantholysis similar to lesions of experimentally induced pemphigus vulgaris. CONCLUSION: These five patients with cancer had a novel acantholytic mucocutaneous disease characterized by autoantibodies that were pathogenic after passive transfer. The autoantibodies from these patients reacted with an antigen complex composed of desmoplakin I and the 230-kd antigen of bullous pemphigoid and two as yet unidentified epithelial antigens. We suggest the term ""paraneoplastic pemphigus"" for this disease.","['Anhalt, G J', 'Kim, S C', 'Stanley, J R', 'Korman, N J', 'Jabs, D A', 'Kory, M', 'Izumi, H', 'Ratrie, H 3rd', 'Mutasim, D', 'Ariss-Abdo, L']","['Anhalt GJ', 'Kim SC', 'Stanley JR', 'Korman NJ', 'Jabs DA', 'Kory M', 'Izumi H', 'Ratrie H 3rd', 'Mutasim D', 'Ariss-Abdo L', 'et al.']","['Department of Dermatology, Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Autoantigens)']",IM,"['Acantholysis/immunology', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Autoantibodies/analysis', 'Autoantigens/isolation & purification', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*etiology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Keratinocytes/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/complications', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/complications', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucous Membrane/pathology', '*Paraneoplastic Syndromes/pathology', 'Pemphigus/*etiology/immunology', 'Thymoma/complications', 'Thymus Neoplasms/complications']",1990/12/20 00:00,1990/12/20 00:01,['1990/12/20 00:00'],"['1990/12/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/20 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1990 Dec 20;323(25):1729-35. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199012203232503.,['10.1056/NEJM199012203232503 [doi]'],,,,"['KO4-AR-01686/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AR-32490/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

To inhibit replication of the virus, we stably introduced chimeric tRNA genes encoding antisense templates into NIH 3T3 cells via a retroviral vector. Efficient expression of hybrid tRNA-MoMLV antisense transcripts and inhibition of MoMLV replication were dependent on the use of a particular type of retroviral vector, the double-copy vector, in which the chimeric tRNA gene was inserted in the 3' long terminal repeat. MoMLV replication was inhibited up to 97% in cells expressing antisense RNA corresponding to the gag gene and less than twofold in cells expressing antisense RNA corresponding to the pol gene. RNA and protein analyses suggest that inhibition was exerted at the level of translation. These results suggest that RNA polymerase III-based antisense inhibition systems can be used to inhibit highly expressed viral genes and render cells resistant to viral replication via intracellular immunization strategies.","['Sullenger, B A', 'Lee, T C', 'Smith, C A', 'Ungers, G E', 'Gilboa, E']","['Sullenger BA', 'Lee TC', 'Smith CA', 'Ungers GE', 'Gilboa E']","['Program of Molecular Biology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (RNA, Antisense)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chimera', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Antisense/*genetics', 'RNA, Transfer/*genetics', 'Templates, Genetic', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Virus Replication']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1990 Dec;10(12):6512-23. doi: 10.1128/mcb.10.12.6512-6523.1990.,['10.1128/mcb.10.12.6512-6523.1990 [doi]'],,,,['AI28771-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC362928,,,,,,,

Cells cultured without growth factors failed to divide and those initiated in the presence of IL-2 or GM-CSF underwent maturation and terminal T lymphoid or myelomonocytic differentiation, respectively. In contrast, a permanent growth factor-dependent cell line, designated TALL-103/3, was established upon culture in IL-3. The TALL-103/3 cells gradually lost the T cell-specific markers and acquired a myeloid phenotype (CD15+, CD33+). Switching of the IL-3-dependent cells at an early passage to medium containing only human rIL-2 resulted in the establishment of a subline, named TALL-103/2, with a T lymphoid phenotype (CD3+, CD8+, TCR-gamma delta +, CD7+). The TALL-103/2 cells strictly require IL-2 for growth, are irreversibly committed to the lymphoid lineage, and cannot survive in the presence of any other hemopoietic growth factor tested so far. In contrast, the IL-3-dependent TALL-103/3 cells could be adapted to grow in synthetic (serum-free) medium also in the presence of either GM-CSF or IL-5, in which they retain a myeloid phenotype. Interestingly, after 18 mo in culture in IL-3, the TALL-103/3 cells can still be phenotypically converted to the lymphoid lineage upon addition of IL-2, thus maintaining its bipotentiality. Despite the marked phenotypic differences, the TALL-103/2 and TALL-103/3 cell lines show the same karyotypes with multiple abnormalities present in the primary malignant clone and have identical rearrangements of the TCR-gamma and -delta loci, thus confirming their derivation from a common precursor cell. Together, these findings indicate that the phenotype of immature T-ALL cells can be drastically modified by the presence of specific hemopoietic growth factors in the environment, leading to either lymphoid or myeloid lineage commitment while leaving their karyotype and genotype intact.","[""O'Connor, R"", 'Cesano, A', 'Kreider, B L', 'Lange, B', 'Clark, S C', 'Nowell, P C', 'Finan, J', 'Rovera, G', 'Santoli, D']","[""O'Connor R"", 'Cesano A', 'Kreider BL', 'Lange B', 'Clark SC', 'Nowell PC', 'Finan J', 'Rovera G', 'Santoli D']","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genotype', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Dec 1;145(11):3779-87.,,,,,"['CA-25875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

The doses and the sequence were chosen to mimic conditions that produced greater than additive antineoplastic activity with these two drugs in preclinical studies. To assess the potential for the drug combination to exhibit greater than additive effect in vivo, we investigated several biochemical parameters that had been associated with synergism in vitro. Because the patients were in remission, the intracellular parameters could only be measured in cytologically normal hematopoietic cells. We observed that (1) the mean plasma concentrations of MTX and araC were above those required to obtain a greater than additive cytotoxicity with the two drugs in tissue culture; (2) MTX did not have a significant antipurine effect in bone marrow mononuclear cells; (3) the mean intracellular concentration of deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) was significantly lower after treatment with the drug combination than after therapy with araC alone; and (4) the ratio of araC triphosphate (araCTP) to dCTP was 2.6 times higher after treatment with the combination than after araC alone.

Using a radioenzymatic assay, the authors measured plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the biologically active form of B6, in 11 newly diagnosed untreated children with leukemia and 11 age-matched controls. The children with leukemia had significantly lower PLP levels than the controls. In 26 additional leukemia patients and 26 additional controls, a high-performance liquid chromatography assay also demonstrated lower plasma PLP levels in childhood leukemia compared with controls. These differences were significant for both acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and for acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). The PLP values did not correlate with indices of leukemia cell burden, but did correlate with reported B6 intake, suggesting that illness-related diet changes are at least partially responsible for the low PLP levels. Before any chemotherapy, overall nutritional status was suboptimal in 53% of ALL cases and 57% of ANLL cases.

Clinical, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical analyses.",2380-6,"An important disease entity distinct from cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in Japan is adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), which usually shows the same phenotype as CTCL, i.e., a helper/inducer T-cell phenotype (CD4+CD8-), and usually involves the skin. Clinically, both CTCL and ATL are heterogeneous in nature. In this study, we demonstrated differences between CTCL and ATL in terms of clinical and immunopathologic cell surface features. In patients with ATL, the predominant clinical findings were peripheral lymph node involvement, skin lesions, hepatosplenomegaly, leukemic manifestations, and an aggressive course. In patients with CTCL, by contrast, only skin lesions predominated at the onset of the disease and a relatively good prognosis was demonstrated. Phenotypic heterogeneity of ATL in the skin, i.e., CD4-CD8-, CD4+CD8-, and CD4-CD8+, was demonstrated. Expression of Leu8, CD7 (Leu9), and CD45RA (2H4) was high in both the skin-infiltrating ATL cells and peripheral blood and lymph node ATL cells compared with that in the skin-infiltrating CTCL cells. Expression of CD25 (IL-2R), CD71 (OKT9), HLA-DR, and HLA-DQ was higher in the skin-infiltrating ATL cells than in CTCL cells. Expression of CD29 (4B4) was high, and that of CD45RA (2H4) was low in both the skin-infiltrating ATL and CTCL cells compared with the peripheral blood and lymph node ATL cells. Expression of CD45RO (UCHL-1) was not significantly high in the skin-infiltrating CTCL cells compared with that in ATL cells. The most significant phenotypic difference between ATL cells and CTCL cells was the expression of Leu8 (lymph node homing receptor), CD7 and CD25 antigens on the cell surface, and the main phenotypic difference between skin-infiltrating ATL and CTCL cells and peripheral blood and lymph node ATL cells was the expression of CD29 and CD45RA. These findings confirm that the difference in antigen expression on the cell surface might reflect the clinical features of ATL and CTCL, and suggest that the predominant phenotype of peripheral blood and lymph node ATL cells is that of naive, relatively immature or activated T-cells, and that CTCL cells are previously activated (memory) T-cells. In other words, CTCL cells do not share the same origin as ATL cells. These observations support the concept that ATL is a disease distinct from CTCL.","['Nagatani, T', 'Matsuzaki, T', 'Iemoto, G', 'Kim, S', 'Baba, N', 'Miyamoto, H', 'Nakajima, H']","['Nagatani T', 'Matsuzaki T', 'Iemoto G', 'Kim S', 'Baba N', 'Miyamoto H', 'Nakajima H']","['Department of Dermatology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/mortality/*pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Phenotype', 'Survival Rate']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1990 Dec 1;66(11):2380-6. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19901201)66:11<2380::aid-cncr2820661122>3.0.co;2-h.,['10.1002/1097-0142(19901201)66:11<2380::aid-cncr2820661122>3.0.co;2-h [doi]'],,,34,,,,,,,,,,

These workers were occupationally exposed to the working environment in the industry, which included exposure to styrene. Cause specific mortality analyses were performed based on the standardised mortality ratio (SMR) with the United States population as a comparison. No significant excess of cause specific mortality was found for the total cohort. Mortality from cancer was slightly less than expected (SMR = 88.1). For cancer of the respiratory system, a small non-significant excess was detected (SMR = 116.1). For lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer, a non-significant deficit was found (SMR = 73.3). The observed mortality from leukaemia was similar to that expected (five observed v 4.76 expected deaths). The plants with hot processes (injection moulding, centrifugal casting, compression moulding, continuous lamination, and pultrusion) experienced a significantly increased SMR (177.9) for respiratory cancer, which was more than twice that (78.3) for those with cold processes (resin mixing, lay up and spray up, bag moulding, and filament winding). As potential exposure to styrene from hot processes is considerably less than that from the cold processes, this finding could not be attributed to occupational exposures. A subsequent nested case-control study consisting of 40 cases of deaths from respiratory cancer was conducted. Further information on detailed work history, occupational exposures, and smoking history was collected. The case-control study did not show any significant association between respiratory cancer and direct exposure to styrene (contained in polyester resins), duration of exposure to styrene, the type of process (hot or cold), or whether a resin was used. A statistically significant association (relative risk = 7.33) was found between cigarette smoking and respiratory cancer among the study subjects.","['Wong, O']",['Wong O'],"['ENSR Health Sciences, Alameda, CA 94501.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Ind Med,British journal of industrial medicine,0370637,"['0 (Plastics)', '0 (Styrenes)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cause of Death', '*Chemical Industry', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Plastics/*adverse effects', 'Respiratory Tract Neoplasms/mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Styrenes/*adverse effects', 'Time Factors']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Ind Med. 1990 Nov;47(11):753-62. doi: 10.1136/oem.47.11.753.,['10.1136/oem.47.11.753 [doi]'],,,,,['Br J Ind Med. 1991 Aug;48(8):575-6.

A total of 67% of patients entered remission using these drugs. An anthracycline was added for those patients not in remission. The overall remission rate (CR) was 86.5% (45/52), with a minimum follow-up of 90 days. Patients are hospitalised for relatively short periods, and consequently require less blood product and antibiotic support. Patients in continuing first remission following induction with Ara-C and etoposide are similar in number to those in continuing first remission who initially received an anthracycline. This would imply that the efficiency of Ara-C and etoposide in inducing long-term disease-term survival is comparable with anthracycline-containing regimens.

LDL has therefore been proposed as a carrier for anti-cancer agents. In the current study, a water-insoluble mitoclomine derivative (WB 4291) was incorporated into LDL. The WB 4291-LDL complex contained about 1,500 drug molecules per LDL particle and showed receptor-mediated toxicity in vitro as judged from the difference in growth inhibitory effect on normal and mutant (LDL-receptor-negative) cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. However, cellular drug uptake did not exclusively occur by the receptor pathway since mutant cells were also affected to some extent. The LDL part of the complex had the same plasma clearance and organ distribution as native LDL after i.v. injection in mice and rabbits. Therapeutic effects were observed when Balb-C mice with experimental leukaemia were treated with the complex. After i.p. administration to mice with i.p. leukaemia median survival time was prolonged 2.5-fold and 40% became long time survivors.

The factor is a protein that stimulates the activity of PKC alpha and beta isozymes isolated from MEL cells, rat and mouse brain approximately 2 to 2.5 fold over the Vmax, respectively. AF promotes an identical activation in the presence of all the effectors but also when the amount of Ca2+ is reduced to microM concentration and in the absence of diacylglycerol (DAG). The factor shows a greater activating efficiency with PKC beta isozymes. AF binds to PKC presumably at the DAG binding site as suggested by the competition between phorbol dibutyrate and AF for binding to the kinase. Moreover, AF promotes the selective binding of PKC beta to natural or artificial membranes in the presence of microM concentrations of Ca2+. Altogether these results suggest the presence in MEL cells of a protein factor that can promote association of PKC to the membranes together with activation of the kinase, without the requirement for DAG formation.

In the setting of a routine molecular diagnostics laboratory, samples from 68 patients with active CML were evaluated for bcr rearrangements, with the use of a variety of enzymes and two probes. The data have been used to develop an efficient strategy for bcr screening and breakpoint determination. Screening with the universal bcr (UBCR) probe on Xba I and BgI II digests yielded bcr rearrangements in 100% of the Ph1-positive patients and three of the seven Ph1-negative patients, giving bcr analysis a sensitivity of 100%. A single-enzyme screen using the UBCR probe would have resulted in a false negative rate of 10%. The false negative rate was determined during the breakpoint site analysis from additional digests hybridized to both the 3' and UBCR probes. The false negative rate for the 3' probe was 26.5%, because of deletions or 5' rearrangements. The method of breakpoint site determination was dependent on screening results. In 78% of cases, one additional hybridization with two enzyme digests was required. During breakpoint site analysis, a rare false negative result was also demonstrated with Bam HI and Eco RI. This screening strategy has made bcr analysis competitive with cytogenetic analysis at the authors' institution; although turnaround time may be slightly longer, bcr analysis can yield information (such as detecting bcr-positive/Ph1-negative patients and determining breakpoint site) that cannot be obtained by cytogenetics.","['Haber, L M', 'Childs, C C', 'Hirsch-Ginsberg, C', 'Nellis, K', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Cork, A', 'Trujillo, J M', 'Stass, S A']","['Haber LM', 'Childs CC', 'Hirsch-Ginsberg C', 'Nellis K', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Cork A', 'Trujillo JM', 'Stass SA']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas, M.

Bone image on MR scans is due to bone marrow, with its different components of red and yellow marrow. Since red marrow is mostly liquid and yellow marrow contains large amounts of fat, the signal will vary, on T1-weighted images, according to their different proportions. There is a gradual change from red marrow to yellow marrow from birth to adulthood: this change determines the MR appearance of bone marrow, the different features of which should be known for a correct evaluation of pathologic findings. MRI is extremely effective in the evaluation of infiltrative disorders of bone marrow, such as leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, primary and metastatic skeletal tumors, and infections. MRI allows depletive disorders of bone marrow and ischemic processes to be studied.

Recently we have demonstrated that unspecific DNA-fingerprint (DNA-F) changes can be detected in blastic phase of leukemia by DNA-F analysis. These changes can be used as molecular markers of the disease and in the follow-up studies of acute leukemia karyotyping and DNA-F analysis are complementary. The comparative analyses of leukemia samples with both these methods could help to localize minisatellite loci in chromosomes and reveal new DNA areas related to leukemia. New, more specific probes targeted to specific chromosomes could consequently be developed. We compared the DNA-F to the karyotypes of 50 acute leukemia patients. In blastic phase, 19 patients had DNA-F alterations and 31 patients abnormal karyotypes, 12 patients had both DNA-F alterations and karyotypic abnormalities. DNA-F changes were detected in six of the 16 patients with normal karyotypes and 19 patients with normal DNA-F had abnormal karyotypes at the time of diagnosis. Eleven patients showed neither DNA-F changes nor abnormal karyotypes in blastic phase. Three acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with DNA-F changes in blastic phase had trisomy eight as a sole abnormality or combined with balanced translocation, which suggests that there might be AML associated minisatellite locus in chromosome 8. In other cases the karyotypes were complicated and no clear evidence of the relationship of DNA-F changes with other chromosomes could be found.","['Pakkala, S', 'Knuutila, S', 'Helminen, P', 'Ruutu, T', 'Saarinen, U M', 'Peltonen, L']","['Pakkala S', 'Knuutila S', 'Helminen P', 'Ruutu T', 'Saarinen UM', 'Peltonen L']","['Transplantation Laboratory, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Dec;4(12):866-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To analyse the tumor cell Ig in more detail, we have prepared somatic cell hybridomas from two patients with HCL. In both cases we found that the tumor cell derived hybridomas secreted IgM, IgG, or IgA indicating that a class-switch event does occur within the monoclonal tumor cell population. However these hybridomas expressed only single isotypes. The clonal relatedness of the tumor-derived Ig was shown by Ig gene analysis and by reactivity with a panel of idiotype specific antibodies. The tumor Ig of one patient analysed showed a striking variability in idiotope expression, indicative of somatic mutations of the expressed Ig genes.

In this in vitro study, we tested the hypothesis that treatment with cytokines and subsequent chemotherapy (ARA-C, daunorubicin) can increase proliferation and enhance leukemic cell kill. We evaluated the effects of recombinant human interleukin-3 (rh-IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) alone and in combination on AML (N = 11) and blastic phase CML (N = 3) samples. Cellular DNA and RNA, incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), cell growth fraction, cell viability, and differentiation markers were evaluated in vitro. A decrease of the quiescent cell population (p = 0.003) and an increase in S-phase cells (p = 0.001) was observed in 8/11 AML samples treated with cytokine combinations. Pronounced heterogeneity or proliferative response was seen between individual cases and different cytokines, but in the majority of the samples IL-3 was most effective. Significantly increased Ki67 expression (p = 0.009) and BrdU incorporation (p = 0.01) were also found after exposure to cytokines indicating an increase in growth fraction. DNA synthesis time was unaffected. Eight samples of AML were treated for 24 hr with ara-C following 2 days of in vitro cytokine incubation. Evaluation of leukemic cell kill showed increased cytotoxicity in three of those five samples which had significant depletions of G0 cells and increases in S-phase. None of the leukemic samples without recruitment from G0 had an increase in ARA-C cytotoxicity.

We present evidence that human T lymphoid cells productively coinfected by HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) or HTLV-II generate a progeny of phenotypically mixed viral particles that allow the penetration of HIV-1 into previously nonsusceptible CD4- human cells, including mature CD8+ T lymphocytes, B lymphoid cells, epithelial cells, and skeletal muscle cells. The infection is independent of the major HIV-1 receptor, (i.e., the CD4 glycoprotein) since OKT4a, a neutralizing anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody, fails to block the penetration of HIV-1. Similarly, infection is not inhibited by monoclonal antibody M77, directed toward the neutralizing loop of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1. In contrast, pretreatment of the virus stock with HTLV-I-neutralizing human serum completely abolishes the penetration of phenotypically mixed HIV-1 into CD4- cells. These results suggest that HTLV-I or HTLV-II may increase the pathogenicity of HIV-1 by broadening the spectrum of its cellular tropism and, thus, favoring its spread within the organism of coinfected hosts.","['Lusso, P', 'Lori, F', 'Gallo, R C']","['Lusso P', 'Lori F', 'Gallo RC']","['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*CD4 Antigens', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Dec;64(12):6341-4. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.12.6341-6344.1990.,['10.1128/JVI.64.12.6341-6344.1990 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC248817,,,,,,,

These proteins require additional sequences, which may stabilize the structure of the RRE or may contain additional sequence-specific elements. Internal RRE deletions revealed that the targets for Rev and Rex can be separated, since mutants responding to Rev and not Rex and vice versa were identified. Tev was active on both types of mutants, suggesting that it has a more relaxed specificity than do both Rev and Rex proteins. Although Rev and Rex targets within the RRE appear to be distinct, the trans-dominant mutant RevBL prevents the RRE interaction with Rex. RevBL cannot inhibit the function of Rex on RRE deletions that lack the Rev-responsive portion. These results indicate the presence of distinct sites within the RRE for interaction with these proteins. The binding sites for the different proteins do not function independently and may interfere with one another.

Jolicoeur, Nature (London) 338:505-508, 1989). We raised a specific antibody to the unique p12 domain of this gag fusion precursor, Pr60gag. We found that Pr60gag was indeed encoded by the defective viral genome both in cell-free translation reticulocyte extracts and in infected mouse fibroblasts. Pr60gag was found to be myristylated, phosphorylated, and attached to the cell membrane, like other helper murine leukemia virus (MuLV) gag precursors. Pr60gag was not substantially cleaved within the nonproducer cells and was not released from these cells. However, in the presence of helper MuLV proteins, it formed phenotypically mixed particles. In these particles, Pr60gag was only partially cleaved. In helper MuLV-producing cells harboring the defective virus, a gag-related p40 intermediate was generated both intracellularly and extracellularly. In these cells, Pr60gag appeared to behave as a dominant negative mutant, interfering with proper cleavage of helper Pr65gag. Our data indicate that Pr60gag is a major (and possibly the only) gene product of the defective murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome virus and is likely to harbor some determinants of pathogenicity of this virus.","['Huang, M', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Huang M', 'Jolicoeur P']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Myristic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '0I3V7S25AW (Myristic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Defective Viruses/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*microbiology', 'Myristic Acid', 'Myristic Acids/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Reticulocytes/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Dec;64(12):5764-72. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.12.5764-5772.1990.,['10.1128/JVI.64.12.5764-5772.1990 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC248725,,,,,,,

From a review of the literature on HIV regulatory genes and from preliminary mathematical models of HIV dynamics at four levels (host population epidemiology, the immune system, gene regulation within infected cells, and selection of mutants) we have arrived at the theory that in the etiology of HIV the HIV cytopathic effect may actively be caused by a viral regulatory gene product. The most likely candidate is the rev regulatory protein. Rev and the analogous rex protein from HTLV-I (human T cell leukemia virus) both have two active sites with similar function: one site locates the protein in the nucleus/nucleolus, and the other site interacts with viral mRNAs, facilitating their export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Rev seems to have a third functional site near the 3' end. We conjecture that this site may be responsible for the cytopathic effect. We think that rev acts on cellular genes that normally induce senescence and cell death during development, or T-cell maturation, or on terminal differentiation. We propose that mathematical and computer models of the immune system could be used to explore whether suppression of the cytopathic action of the rev protein could be of therapeutic benefit in restoring the ability of the immune system to clear HIV or at least to extend latency. We also suggest how immune deficiency disease might be created as laboratory artifact in animal populations.","['Bremermann, H J', 'Anderson, R W']","['Bremermann HJ', 'Anderson RW']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley 94720.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988),Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,8812597,['0 (CD4 Antigens)'],IM,"['CD4 Antigens/immunology', '*Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genes, Regulator', 'Genes, Viral', 'HIV/genetics/*physiology', 'HIV Infections/transmission', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/physiology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988). 1990;3(12):1119-28.,,,,,['RR07006-24/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Tax trans-activation is mediated via cellular factors that interact with the TGACGT motifs in the 21-bp repeats. Gel mobility shift assay and UV cross-linking analysis show that two proteins of 52 and 46 kDa in size bind the 21-bp repeat specifically. Base substitutions in the TGACGT motif which abolished Tax trans-activation abrogated factor binding whereas the repeats containing mutations that did not affect Tax trans-activation supported factor binding as the wild-type repeat. The 52- and 46-kDa factors are present in human T-cell lines Jurkat and MT4 (HTLV-I transformed) and in HeLa cells but are undetectable in a human placental cell line JEG-3, which gave a reduced level of trans-activation. JEG-3 extracts contain a distinct DNA binding activity that shows analogous sequence requirements as the 52- and 46-kDa proteins in interacting with the various 21-bp repeats. c-Jun and CREB (cAMP-responsive element binding factor) can stimulate transcription from HTLV-I long terminal repeats in JEG-3 cells. At least two copies of the 21-bp repeats are required for optimal trans-activation by c-Jun and CREB. Most single point mutations in the TGACGT motif that abolished Tax trans-activation, however, did not affect c-Jun- or CREB-directed transcriptional enhancement. These data indicate that many transcription factors including c-Jun and CREB exert stimulatory effects on HTLV-I transcription although they do not directly respond to Tax. The 52- and 46-kDa cellular proteins most likely are involved directly in Tax-mediated trans-activation, and they are tentatively named Tax activation factors I and II, respectively.","['Xu, Y L', 'Adya, N', 'Siores, E', 'Gao, Q S', 'Giam, C Z']","['Xu YL', 'Adya N', 'Siores E', 'Gao QS', 'Giam CZ']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Nebraska Medical Center, College of Medicine, Omaha 68198-4525.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', '*Genes, pX', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Plasmids', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1990/11/25 00:00,1990/11/25 00:01,['1990/11/25 00:00'],"['1990/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Nov 25;265(33):20285-92.,['S0021-9258(17)30502-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that human TGF-beta inhibits the activation of the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 for killing of the L1210 tumour cell line. RAW 264.7 cells, like normal macrophages, require sequential interaction with priming and triggering stimuli for full activation of cytolytic activity. TGF-beta inhibits this cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner at both the priming and the triggering stage. Addition of as little as 1 ng/ml TGF-beta when added with either the priming signal, recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), or the triggering signal, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), completely abrogated tumouricidal activity. Incubation with TGF-beta also inhibited the morphological changes normally observed in activated RAW 264.7 cells. However, TGF-beta was unable to inhibit the cytotoxic activity of RAW 264.7 cells against the target cell line WEHI 164, which is sensitive to tumour necrosis factor. In contrast to the effects on cytotoxic activity, the cytostatic activity of activated RAW 264.7 cells was not inhibited by TGF-beta at doses of up to 5 ng/ml. In addition, pretreatment of the L1210 target cells with TGF-beta made them refractory to both the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of RAW 264.7 cells. These data suggest that TGF-beta may be an important mediator in the regulation of macrophage tumouricidal activity.","['Haak-Frendscho, M', 'Wynn, T A', 'Czuprynski, C J', 'Paulnock, D']","['Haak-Frendscho M', 'Wynn TA', 'Czuprynski CJ', 'Paulnock D']","['Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Wisconsin, Madison.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,['0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', '*Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1990 Nov;82(2):404-10. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.1990.tb05461.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2249.1990.tb05461.x [doi]'],,,,"['AI 21274/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 21343/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC1535113,,,,,,,

Enrichment for tumor cells was confirmed with intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin (Ig) staining, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, and staining using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) directed at B, T, myeloid, and monocytoid antigens (Ags) in indirect immunofluorescence assays. Tumor cells were B1(CD20)+ B2(CD21)- B4(CD19)+ IL-2R(CD25)+ PCA-1 +/- TRAP+.

However, a proliferative response (stimulation index greater than or equal to 3.0) without Ig secretion was triggered in HCLs by mitogens or combinations of GFs. Specifically, DNA synthesis was induced at 3 days in three of four HCL samples cultured with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan A (SAC) or the combination of phorbol ester (TPA) and the calcium ionophore A 23187 (Ca2+); DNA synthesis was triggered later (day 7) by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or by IL-4 and IL-5. In contrast, the fourth patient, a nonresponder to SAC or TPA/Ca2+, demonstrated increased DNA synthesis at day 3 when cocultured with IL-4 and IL-5. Both autoradiography and staining with antibromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) MoAb conjugated to fluorescein confirmed DNA synthesis by only a minority (5% to 23%) of tumor cells within each patient. Dual staining confirmed that responsive cells were both BrdU+ and TRAP+. DNA synthesis induced by TPA/Ca2+ was blocked specifically by anti-IL-6 Ab; in contrast, the HCL proliferative response to SAC, TNF, or IL-4 and IL-5 was not inhibited by anti-IL-6 Ab. alpha-Interferon inhibited the response to TPA/Ca2+, TNF, or IL-4 and IL-5 without any effect on response to SAC. Finally, peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining demonstrated that HCLs are induced by TPA/Ca2+, but not by SAC, to produce intracytoplasmic IL-6.

In contrast, bcl-1 rearrangements were not found in other types of low grade B-cell lymphoma, specifically in 36 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and 27 cases of follicular lymphoma (FL). To further assess the molecular pathology of IDL, we analyzed these cases for rearrangements of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene, which is associated primarily with follicular lymphomas. None of the 19 cases of IDL had rearrangements. Furthermore, none of the 36 cases of CLL/SLL showed bcl-2 rearrangements, whereas, as expected, 21 of 27 cases of FL had rearrangements of the bcl-2 locus.

We found that the LAK cells were mainly activated natural killer cells, but some were CD3+ T cells. In the 51Cr release assay LAK cells from 20 of 33 (61%) allogeneic and 2 of 4 syngeneic recipients killed recipient CML cells and in 22 of 37 (60%) cases also killed the HLA disparate CML cells. In the CFU-GM assay the LAK cells incubated together with the CML cells in liquid culture before plating inhibited (P less than .05) colony growth in 16 of 22 allogeneic and 2 of 2 syngeneic recipients. Cell-cell contact was necessary for optimal effect. There was little or no inhibition of proliferation of donor marrow CFU-GM. This in vitro graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect could also be demonstrated after LAK effectors were depleted of CD3+ T cells. It was inducible in recipients of both T cell-depleted and T cell-replete donor marrow and in recipients with or without graft-versus-host disease. These results suggest that a major histocompatibility complex-unrestricted GVL effect is inducible following allogeneic and syngeneic BMT. The use of IL-2/LAK cells after BMT could reduce the risk of relapse.","['Mackinnon, S', 'Hows, J M', 'Goldman, J M']","['Mackinnon S', 'Hows JM', 'Goldman JM']","['MRC/LRF Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Graft vs Host Disease/pathology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/drug effects/pathology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/physiopathology/*surgery', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/pathology/physiology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/immunology', 'Phenotype']",1990/11/15 00:00,1990/11/15 00:01,['1990/11/15 00:00'],"['1990/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Nov 15;76(10):2037-45.,['S0006-4971(20)82114-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone films showed no lytic lesions, and AHPrBP, which is a potent inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption was well tolerated and induced a rapid and sustained fall in plasma Ca (from 3.42 to 2.07 mM in 5 days). Plasma magnesium and alkaline phosphatase remained normal. The results could have been affected by other drugs [vincristine, cyclophosphamide, zorubicin (Rubidazone) L-asparaginase and prednisone] which were simultaneously administered. However, the observation that: (1) the response curve of plasma Ca was similar to that reported when AHPrBP was used alone, (2) there was complete inhibition of urinary Ca excretion and (3) hypocalcaemia occurred suggests that AHPrBP was the major cause of the reduction in plasma Ca.

Dolastatin 10 consists of four amino acids (in order from the amino terminus: dolavaline, valine, dolaisoleucine, and dolaproine), three unique to D. auricularia, linked to an unusual primary amine (dolaphenine, probably derived from phenylalanine) at what would otherwise be its carboxyl terminus. Dolastatin 10 has nine asymmetric carbon atoms, and available isomers included alternate configurations at five positions (positions 9 and 10 in the dolaproine moiety and positions 18, 19 and 19a in the dolaisoleucine moiety). For tubulin polymerization, only alterations at positions 18 and 19 resulted in loss of inhibitory activity of the isomer. In addition, a tripeptide containing dolavaline, valine and dolaisoleucine with all asymmetric carbons identical configurationally to those in dolastatin 10 was found to be about 30% as effective as dolastatin 10 in inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Cytotoxic effects were much more sensitive to alterations in the dolastatin 10 structure. The only modification which did not lead to reduced cytotoxicity was reversal of configuration at position 19a in the dolaisoleucine moiety. Both this isomer and dolastatin 10 had IC50 values of less than 1 nM. Several other isomers had IC50 values with the L1210 cells in the range of 30-90 nM, but these did not correlate well with their inhibitory effects on tubulin polymerization.

The HAG derivatives [RCH=NNHC(=NH)NHOH-tosylate] studied could be grouped as: (1) hydroxybenzylidines; (2) methoxybenzylidines; and (3) nitrobenzylidines substituted at the R position. 2'-Hydroxybenzylidine-HAG, the lead compound, was relatively active in both HT-29 cells and L1210 cells (20 +/- 5 and 13 +/- 4 microM for 50% inhibition of HT-29 and L1210 cell growth respectively). The monohydroxybenzylidene compounds were generally more active than the dihydroxy- and trihydroxybenzylidene-HAG derivatives. The methoxybenzylidene-HAGs were as active as the monohydroxybenzylidene-HAGs. 2'-Hydroxy-4'-methoxybenzylidene-HAG was much more active than 2',4'-dihydroxybenzylidene-HAG. The mononitrobenzylidene-HAGs were more active than the dinitrobenzylidene-HAG compound. In general, L1210 cells were more sensitive to the effects of the HAG compounds than were HT-29 cells. There was good agreement between the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of HT-29 cells and that required to inhibit the growth of L1210 cells. There was also good correlation between the ability of HAG derivatives to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase activity and to inhibit tumor cell growth. Some derivatives, such as 2',3',4'- and 3',4',5'-trihydroxybenzylidene-HAG inhibited L1210 cell growth by 50% at lower concentrations (7.8 and 11.9 microM respectively) than the concentrations needed for 50% inhibition of HT-29 cell growth (196 and 234 microM respectively) and ribonucleotide reductase activity (122 and 188 microM respectively). The studies of nucleic acid synthesis in L1210 cells using [3H]cytidine as a precursor showed that 2',3',4'-trihydroxybenzylidine-HAG inhibited DNA synthesis at a lower concentration (29 microM for 50% inhibition) than was needed for the inhibition of RNA synthesis and formation of [3H]deoxycytidine nucleotides in the acid-soluble fraction (320 and 820 microM for 50% inhibition respectively). These results indicate that 2',3',4'-trihydroxybenzylidine-HAG inhibits DNA synthesis in L1210 cells through other mechanisms rather than exclusively through the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity.","['Matsumoto, M', 'Fox, J G', 'Wang, P H', 'Koneru, P B', 'Lien, E J', 'Cory, J G']","['Matsumoto M', 'Fox JG', 'Wang PH', 'Koneru PB', 'Lien EJ', 'Cory JG']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of South Florida College of Medicine, H.

The induction of antizyme only partially accounted for the decrease of ODC activity by a direct inhibition of the enzyme. However, the antizyme induction was accompanied by a marked reduction of the half-life of ODC. Shift of the cells to an ATP-depleting medium prevented the spermidine-elicited decay of ODC activity as well as the accumulation of ODC-antizyme complex. However, ODC appeared to be stabilized even when ATP depletion was performed 40 min after spermidine addition, in the presence of high levels of antizyme. Similar results were obtained by treating the cells with phenanthroline, a heavy metal chelator and protease inhibitor. These findings indicate that ATP and some metalloprotease(s) may be involved in the degradation pathway of ODC, even in the presence of high levels of polyamines.","['Flamigni, F', 'Marmiroli, S', 'Guarnieri, C', 'Caldarera, C M']","['Flamigni F', 'Marmiroli S', 'Guarnieri C', 'Caldarera CM']","['Dipartimento di Biochimica, Universita di Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'W4X6ZO7939 (1,10-phenanthroline)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Intercalating Agents/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*metabolism', 'Phenanthrolines/*pharmacology', 'Spermidine/*pharmacology']",1990/10/30 00:00,1990/10/30 00:01,['1990/10/30 00:00'],"['1990/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1990 Oct 30;172(2):939-44. doi: 10.1016/0006-291x(90)90766-g.,"['0006-291X(90)90766-G [pii]', '10.1016/0006-291x(90)90766-g [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term treatment with TPA, which depletes the cells of their endogenous PKC, eliminates both Ca2(+)-ionophore- and TPA- as well as IgE-dependent secretion, but it potentiates by 1.7-fold IgE-induced inositol phosphate formation. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that the dual actions of TPA on IgE-dependent responses are both mediated by PKC. The opposing effects of TPA are differentially down-regulated. Following TPA treatment, the rate by which the cells lose their ability to undergo exocytosis is faster than the rate at which inhibition of inositol phosphates formation is relieved and their production potentiated. In addition, both processes show different sensitivities to inhibitors of PKC action. Whereas IgE-dependent secretion is completely blocked by the PKC inhibitors K252a, H-7 and sphingosine [concns. causing 50% inhibition (IC50 values) = 25 ng/ml 80 microns and 30 microns respectively], these inhibitors do not relieve inhibition of inositol phosphate formation by TPA, nor do they potentiate this response. These results may imply that the bidirectional control exerted by PKC on IgE-dependent responses is mediated by its different isoenzymes.","['Gat-Yablonski, G', 'Sagi-Eisenberg, R']","['Gat-Yablonski G', 'Sagi-Eisenberg R']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Exocytosis', 'Immunoglobulin E/*physiology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/*physiopathology', 'Mast Cells/physiology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Immunologic/physiology', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Sphingosine/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/09/15 00:00,1990/09/15 00:01,['1990/09/15 00:00'],"['1990/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1990 Sep 15;270(3):679-84. doi: 10.1042/bj2700679.,['10.1042/bj2700679 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC1131785,,,,,,,

Evolving evidence in larger patient populations supports data from smaller series: febrile neutropenic patients who have failed to respond to a 4- to 7-day course of broad-spectrum antibacterials may benefit from the early initiation of antifungal therapy. Patients with fungal colonization or pulmonary infiltrates and adult patients who have not received previous fungal prophylaxis may especially benefit from the early use of antifungal drugs.

BEPH inhibited the growth of HeLa cells with an IC50 of 0.25 microM during a four day culture period.

Only marginal changes in intracellular polyamine concentrations were observed during incubation with 0.25 microM BEPH. In both HeLa cells and L1210 cells in culture, incorporation of radioactive precursors into DNA, RNA and protein were reduced by BEPH. Inhibition of protein synthesis was discernible prior to inhibition of RNA and DNA in these cells. In mice inoculated i.p. with 10(5) L1210 cells on day 0, i.p. administration of 10.0 mg/kg of BEPH qd(X5) beginning on day 1 prolonged the survival time by 84% compared to controls. The same dose of the compound, in combination with 10.0 mg/kg of N,N'-bis-2-3-butadienylputrescine, an inhibitor of the polyamine catabolizing enzyme polyamine oxidase (PAO), produced a 100% cure rate. Similar results were obtained when BEPH was combined with N-methyl-N'-2-3-butadienylputrescine, another PAO inhibitor. Furthermore, animals cured of the leukemia by the combination chemotherapy were resistant to a subsequent challenge with L1210 cells, indicating the development of tumor ""immunity"". The striking antitumor activity along with the development of tumor immunity indicate that synthetic polyamine analogues have potential for development as antineoplastic agents.","['Prakash, N J', 'Bowlin, T L', 'Edwards, M L', 'Sunkara, P S', 'Sjoerdsma, A']","['Prakash NJ', 'Bowlin TL', 'Edwards ML', 'Sunkara PS', 'Sjoerdsma A']","['Merrell Dow Research Institute, Cincinnati, Ohio 45215.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biogenic Polyamines)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Polyamines)', ""132004-62-7 (N,N'-bis(3-(ethylamino)propyl)-1,7-heptanediamine)"", 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.5.3.- (polyamine oxidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biogenic Polyamines/analysis/metabolism', 'Diamines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'HeLa Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acids/biosynthesis', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Polyamines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Biosynthesis']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1990 Sep-Oct;10(5A):1281-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Review of recent studies and current recommendations.",359-66,"Childhood non-Hodgkin's lymphomas can be divided into two broad groups based on histologic findings: lymphoblastic and nonlymphoblastic. Lymphoblastic lymphomas often appear with a mediastinal mass and have a propensity for relapse in the bone marrow and CNS. Nonlymphoblastic lymphomas occur primarily in the abdomen and head-neck region. Relapses tend to occur within the first year and may be either local or systemic. Marrow and/or CNS involvement at diagnosis, bulk disease (reflected as elevated serum lactic dehydrogenase levels), and mediastinal occurrences are adverse prognostic features for nonlymphoblastic lymphomas. Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for both types of childhood non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. In general, radiation therapy is not necessary for optimal treatment of these tumors. Localized non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of either histologic type are highly curable with short-course chemotherapy. Disseminated non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, particularly those with marrow and/or CNS involvement, remain a major treatment challenge.","['Nachman, J']",['Nachman J'],"['Section of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago Medical Center, Illinois 60637.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'APO protocol 2', 'CHOP protocol', 'COMP protocol', 'LSA2-L2 protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1990 Fall;12(3):359-66.,,,,13,,,,,,,,,,

These purging techniques can be classified as immunological or pharmacological. The immunomagnetic technique has been widely used in neuroblastoma patients. It depends on an interaction between target neuroblastoma cells in the marrow and a complex of specific monoclonal antibodies and magnetized microspheres, the target cells being selectively removed by passage through a magnetic field. Laboratory studies with neuroblastoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells have shown the high efficiency of this technique in selectively removing cancer cells while retaining adequate numbers of normal hematopoietic cells for subsequent reinfusion into the patient. Clinical studies in several hundred neuroblastoma patients, as well as small numbers of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, breast cancer, and myeloma patients, suggest that this is a clinically safe and effective technique.

Laboratory and clinical observations.,245-56,"The application of autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) in treating acute leukemias in children has been limited by the presence of residual occult viable leukemic cells in the marrow cell suspension. One approach to this problem is the ex vivo treatment (""purging"") of the autograft to eradicate these tumor cells yet spare the normal lymphohematopoietic stem cells. Initial studies of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a rodent model demonstrated that incubation with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4HC), a congener of cyclophosphamide and an active alkylating agent in aqueous solution, could effectively eliminate viable AML cells from marrow cell suspensions without apparent toxicity to normal stem cells. We have conducted clinical trials of ABMT with 4HC-treated marrow in children with acute leukemia in remission; marrow was collected, treated ex vivo with 4HC (100 micrograms/ml), and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until reinfusion. Children received pre-ABMT conditioning with either high-dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (CY-TBI) for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or high-dose busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BU-CY) for AML. Of nine children who underwent ABMT with 4HC-treated marrow for ALL in second complete remission (CR2), all relapsed (eight in the marrow, one in the central nervous system) at a median of 5 months (range, 2-17) after ABMT and all have died with relapsed ALL or as a consequence of its treatment. Twenty-nine children with AML (five in CR1, 24 in CR2) received autografts with chemopurged marrow at a median remission duration of 3 months (range, 2-15). Three patients died from sepsis during aplasia; 10 children (one in CR1 and nine in CR2) relapsed with AML at a median of 7 months (range, 2-23) after ABMT, for an actuarial relapse rate of 47%. Sixteen patients with AML (four in CR1, 12 in CR2) are in unmaintained remission at a median of 16 months (range, 6-102) after ABMT, for an actuarial disease-free survival of 49%. Although ABMT with 4HC-treated marrow appears to have a limited role in the treatment of children with ALL who lack a suitable related donor, the results in AML are encouraging and compare favorably with both syngeneic and allogeneic BMT in similar groups of patients.","['Yeager, A M', 'Rowley, S D', 'Kaizer, H', 'Santos, G W']","['Yeager AM', 'Rowley SD', 'Kaizer H', 'Santos GW']","['Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Busulfan/pharmacology', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1990 Fall;12(3):245-56. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199023000-00001.,['10.1097/00043426-199023000-00001 [doi]'],,,45,"['P01 CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA40282/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Light microscopy reveals a progressive increase in chromosomal damage (condensation, pulverization). At or above 10 mumol/l MeHg, progression through all the phases of the cell cycle is blocked and mitotic cells are arrested irreversibly in anaphase, with most exhibiting arrangement of chromosomes in a wreathlike ring formation. Also the cells exhibit both nuclear propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence (indicative of loss of viability) and concurrent cytoplasmic carboxyfluorescein (CF) fluorescence (viable cells exhibit CF fluorescence and exclude PI). In addition, there is a dose-dependent increase in cellular refractive index (90 degrees light scatter), an apparent decrease in cell volume (axial light loss), and progressive resistance to detergent (NP-40)-mediated cytolysis. Resistance to detergent-mediated cytolysis is indicative of fixation (protein denaturation, cross-linking, and so on) of the plasma membrane/cytoplasm complex.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 105 patients with a documented morphologic diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia were reviewed for the purpose of this analysis. All patients had an extensive workup at presentation, and cytogenetic analysis was performed in 103 patients, using the Giemsa banding technique with trypsin pretreatment on 24-hour cultured cells. RESULTS: The specific cytogenetic classification in the 103 patients who had the karyotypic analysis was as follows: diploid 27%; Philadelphia chromosome-positive 13%; hyperdiploid 12%; B-cell karyotype 6%; 6q- and 14q+ abnormalities 4%; pseudodiploid 8%; hypodiploid 2%; and insufficient metaphases 28%. B-cell, 6q- or 14q+, and Philadelphia chromosome-positive karyotypes tended to correlate with other known negative prognostic factors. Patients with diploid, hyperdiploid, pseudodiploid, and hypodiploid karyotypes or with insufficient metaphases could be combined into one group with a favorable prognosis. In this group, the remission rate with induction chemotherapy was 89%, the median complete remission duration was 26 months, and the median survival was 25 months, with a 3-year survival rate of 45%. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive, B-cell, and 6q- or 14q+ abnormalities collectively had an unfavorable prognosis. Their response rate to induction chemotherapy was 65%, the median response duration was 7 months, and the median survival was 8 months, with a 3-year survival rate of less than 10%. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the pretreatment bone marrow karyotype is an important part of the evaluation of adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia and provides significant prognostic information.","['Walters, R', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Keating, M J', 'Estey, E H', 'Trujillo, J', 'Cork, A', 'McCredie, K B', 'Freireich, E J']","['Walters R', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Keating MJ', 'Estey EH', 'Trujillo J', 'Cork A', 'McCredie KB', 'Freireich EJ']","['Department of Hematology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1990 Nov;89(5):579-87. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(90)90175-d.,"['0002-9343(90)90175-D [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(90)90175-d [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this investigation, the ultrastructural localization of both proteins were observed in order to make the outline of M4 clear. The leukemic cells in acute myeloid leukemia (M2) were also examined in comparison with those in M4. The leukemic cells in M4 showed the double stainability of lactoferrin and lysozyme, and the positive reactions were localized in the cytoplasmic matrix and in the granules. The staining pattern was similar to that in M2. The coexistence of lactoferrin and lysozyme in the leukemic cells in M4, which has ultrastructurally the monocytic characteristics, implied that the leukemic cells also possess the characteristics of the cells in the granulocytic lineage. This suggests that the presence of the various leukemic cells in the granulocytic lineage.

To investigate this issue with regard to adult ALL, the authors reviewed the immunophenotyping data from 39 cases analyzed in their clinical laboratory. Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood and/or bone marrow was performed with the use of a panel of 21 B-cell, T-cell, and myeloid monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). The surface antigen profiles of the leukemic cells were compared with those of normal bone marrow and thymic counterparts, as defined by current models. Twenty-six cases were B-precursor ALL, 8 were T-ALL, and 3 were B-ALL (Burkitt's leukemia). Only two cases coexpressed lymphoid and myeloid antigens. In contrast, intralineage aberrancy was quite common. Immunophenotypes from 13 of 26 B-precursor ALL cases deviated from normal B-lineage marrow cells as defined by a recent classification. The T-ALL cases were also immunophenotypically heterogeneous. This high incidence of aberrant antigen expression in adult ALL suggests that leukemogenesis also involves aberrant differentiation rather than purely a process of maturational arrest.","['Ross, C W', 'Stoolman, L M', 'Schnitzer, B', 'Schlegelmilch, J A', 'Hanson, C A']","['Ross CW', 'Stoolman LM', 'Schnitzer B', 'Schlegelmilch JA', 'Hanson CA']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Hospitals, Ann Arbor.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Blood Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/epidemiology/immunology/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/immunology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1990 Nov;94(5):590-9. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/94.5.590.,['10.1093/ajcp/94.5.590 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mitoxantrone, 12 mg/m2 daily for 3 days, was combined with three dose levels of etoposide, 100, 150 and 200 mg/m2 daily by constant infusion for 5 days. There were 19 male and 13 female patients, with a median age of 46 (range, 21-74). Of these, nine were primarily refractory to daunorubicin and ara-C; 17 had one prior complete remission (CR), five had two prior CR, and one had three prior CR. Thirteen patients were entered at the first dose level, 11 were entered at the second, and eight at the third. All but one patient, whose death occurred within the first 2 days of treatment, are evaluable for toxicity. There were five CR (four at the first and one at the second dose level) and six partial remissions (PR) (three at the first dose level and three at the second). Unmaintained responses lasted 6-33 weeks. Median survival for all patients was 12.6 weeks. Anti-leukemic effects with severe marrow hypoplasia were observed in all patients; severe nausea and vomiting were seen in four. Severe mucositis, often indistinguishable from superimposed candidiasis, occurred in 40% of all patients; it was associated with dose-limiting esophagitis (three of seven evaluable patients) at the highest etoposide dose. Hepatic and renal dysfunction was severe in three patients; no treatment-related severe pulmonary or cardiac toxicity was observed. Posttreatment infectious complications were severe in 11 patients. In three cases, they were fatal--an incidence not dissimilar from that of other reinduction regimens in heavily pretreated patients. The regimen appears to be active; the combination of mitoxantrone, 12 mg/m2 daily for 3 days, with etoposide, 150 mg/m2/day for 5 days, by constant intravenous infusion is now being explored by the CALGB in a randomized phase II study against mitoxantrone plus diazoquinone and diazoquinone plus etoposide.","['Paciucci, P A', 'Davis, R B', 'Holland, J F', 'Martelo, O', 'Schiffer, C A']","['Paciucci PA', 'Davis RB', 'Holland JF', 'Martelo O', 'Schiffer CA']","['Cancer and Leukemia Group B, Brookline, MA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 1990 Dec;13(6):516-9. doi: 10.1097/00000421-199012000-00013.,['10.1097/00000421-199012000-00013 [doi]'],,,,"['CA-11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Common to all forms of mucormycosis is vascular invasion with production of necrotic tissue. The diagnosis is achieved by demonstrating broad, non-septate hyphae with right-angle branching in a tissue biopsy specimen. Successful treatment consists of early diagnosis, intensive systemic antifungal therapy with amphotericin B, aggressive surgical debridement and control of the underlying disease.

West Japan Pediatric Oncology Group.,299-307,"The West Japan Pediatric Oncology Group studied the treatment of pediatric malignant tumors with VP-16 from December 1984 to March 1988. Study subjects were divided into two groups. One group received only VP-16, while the other received VP-16 combined with other anti-tumor agents. VP-16 evaluation was possible in a total of 116 cases. The efficacy rate was calculated by considering both complete and partial remission as effective. The efficacy rate for VP-16 alone was 87.5% for primary cases of ANLL and 100% for primary cases of histiocytosis. The efficacy rates for combination therapy were as follows: 92.6% for primary cases of ANLL, 66.7% for primary cases of histiocytosis, 45.5% for relapsed cases of ANLL and 66.7% for relapsed cases of ALL. Bone marrow suppression was seen in the form of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia for 2 to 3 weeks after VP-16 administration. Alopecia, mucositis and gastrointestinal symptoms were also observed, but they presented no significant problem. From our results, we believe that chemotherapy including VP-16 is effective for remission induction therapy in primary cases of ANLL and for salvage therapy in relapsed leukemia.

Overall proliferation of cells which were trypan blue negative after exposure exceeded 70% of the proliferation of sham treated controls, except after 1000 shocks at 25 kV, where proliferation was reduced to 42%. The latter reduction in proliferation was found to be due to a reduced growth for 24 h after exposure, with a return to normal proliferation during the following days. Limiting dilution analysis revealed that the reduced growth was mainly due to a transitory increase of the doubling time and not to a reduction of the number of proliferating cells.

Our case demonstrates the importance of a curative approach to Hodgkin's disease even in the face of a coexistent disease with a long or unknown natural history.","['Vukelja, S J', 'Krishnan, J', 'Ward, F T', 'Redmond, J 3rd']","['Vukelja SJ', 'Krishnan J', 'Ward FT', 'Redmond J 3rd']","['Hematology-Oncology Service, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,South Med J,Southern medical journal,0404522,,IM,"['Hodgkin Disease/*complications/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*complications/pathology', 'Sarcoma/*pathology', 'Spinal Cord Diseases/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,South Med J. 1990 Nov;83(11):1317-20. doi: 10.1097/00007611-199011000-00024.,['10.1097/00007611-199011000-00024 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The functions of these proteins can be antagonized by several methods, each with specific limitations. Inhibition of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins was achieved with double-stranded (ds) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained octamer or kappa B consensus sequences. The phosphorothioate oligonucleotides specifically bound either octamer transcription factor or nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B. The modified oligonucleotides accumulated in cells more effectively than standard ds oligonucleotides and modulated gene expression in a specific manner. Octamer-dependent activation of a reporter plasmid or NF-kappa B-dependent activation of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enhancer was inhibited when the appropriate phosphorothioate oligonucleotide was added to a transiently transfected B cell line. Addition of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained the octamer consensus to Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion to a degree similar to that observed with a mutated octamer site in the IL-2 enhancer. The ds phosphorothioate oligonucleotides probably compete for binding of specific transcription factors and may provide anti-viral, immunosuppressive, or other therapeutic effects.","['Bielinska, A', 'Shivdasani, R A', 'Zhang, L Q', 'Nabel, G J']","['Bielinska A', 'Shivdasani RA', 'Zhang LQ', 'Nabel GJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor 48109-0650.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HCFC1 protein, human)', '0 (Host Cell Factor C1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-1)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (POU2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HIV Enhancer', 'Host Cell Factor C1', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-1', 'Oligonucleotides/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Thionucleotides/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/11/16 00:00,1990/11/16 00:01,['1990/11/16 00:00'],"['1990/11/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/16 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Science. 1990 Nov 16;250(4983):997-1000. doi: 10.1126/science.2237444.,['10.1126/science.2237444 [doi]'],,,,['AI26865/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used with probes from portions of the bcr and abl genes to detect the bcr-abl fusion in individual blood and bone marrow cells from six patients.

However, Southern blot analysis suffers from a number of technical disadvantages, including the time necessary to obtain results, the use of radioactivity, and the susceptibility of the method to various artifacts. We have investigated an alternative approach for assessing the clonality of antigen receptor gene rearrangements in lymphoid tissue biopsy specimens. This approach involves the amplification of rearranged gamma T-cell receptor genes by the polymerase chain reaction and analysis of the polymerase chain reaction products by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. By use of this approach, clonal rearrangements from neoplastic lymphocytes constituting as little as 0.1-1% of the total cells in the tissue are detected as discrete bands in the denaturing gel after the gel is stained with ethidium bromide and viewed under ultraviolet light. In contrast, polyclonal rearrangements from reactive lymphocytes appear as a diffuse smear along the length of the gel. Our findings suggest that polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis may offer a rapid, nonradioactive, and sensitive alternative to Southern blot analysis for the diagnostic evaluation of lymphoid tissue biopsy specimens.","['Bourguin, A', 'Tung, R', 'Galili, N', 'Sklar, J']","['Bourguin A', 'Tung R', 'Galili N', 'Sklar J']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reference Values', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Nov;87(21):8536-40. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.21.8536.,['10.1073/pnas.87.21.8536 [doi]'],,,,['CA38621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC54991,,,,,,,

Anti-Tac binds to the p55 subunit of the human interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor, and anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 kills human or monkey cell lines that contain either the intact IL-2 receptor or its p55 subunit alone. To assess the usefulness of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 in treatment of IL-2 receptor-positive leukemia, we tested peripheral blood mononuclear cells from six patients with adult T-cell leukemia. In each of the six patients, anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 was extremely cytotoxic to the malignant cells. Metabolic activity and sensitivity of the fresh cells improved when a small amount of IL-2 (10 units per ml) was present during incubation. The toxin concentration necessary to inhibit protein synthesis by 50% after 16-hr incubation of cells with immunotoxin varied from 1.6 to 16 ng/ml (2.5-25 x 10(-11) M). In every case, binding was by means of the Tac antigen because anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 cytotoxicity was prevented by adding excess anti-Tac antibody. Moreover, anti-Tac alone or an inactive mutant of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 without ADP-ribosylation activity had very little cytotoxic activity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal controls, from a patient with Tac-negative leukemia, and from adult T-cell leukemia patients without significant peripheral blood involvement were not sensitive to anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40.

Despite the currently successful therapy for some malignancies (e.g., 70% 4-year disease-free survival in acute lymphocytic leukemia), many children die without known reason. Recent advances in the clinical pharmacology of anticancer drugs have identified relationships between dose intensity and response (efficacy, toxicity). Traditional methods of measuring dose intensity (prescribed dose) have evolved to more sophisticated approaches in maximizing the intensity of treatment, with good response rates. Other methods of optimizing chemotherapy for individual patients include bone marrow support procedures and therapy with biologic response modifiers. Relatively few clinically useful new anticancer drugs have been discovered in the past several years.

The same sites are now shown to bind the erythroid specific protein, NF-E2. Inducibility of the HS II enhancer depends on NF-E2 binding, even in the presence of another hypersensitive site. Further, increased activity of the enhancer in induced K562 cells correlates with the presence of NF-E2, which appears to be present in a modified form. NF-E2 is distinct from some enhancer binding proteins in K562 nuclear extracts, in that it does not contain Fos or Fra-1 protein. Thus, binding by NF-E2 may be the mechanism, whereby tandem AP-1 binding sites confer erythroid specificity on the HS II enhancer.","['Ney, P A', 'Sorrentino, B P', 'Lowrey, C H', 'Nienhuis, A W']","['Ney PA', 'Sorrentino BP', 'Lowrey CH', 'Nienhuis AW']","['Clinical Hematology Branch, NHLBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",1990/10/25 00:00,1990/10/25 00:01,['1990/10/25 00:00'],"['1990/10/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/25 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1990 Oct 25;18(20):6011-7. doi: 10.1093/nar/18.20.6011.,['10.1093/nar/18.20.6011 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC332398,,,,,,,

In situ staining for the ras gene product, p21, has been demonstrated in carcinomas of several sites. High levels of p21 expression have been associated with histologic anaplasia in prostate cancer and regional lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. We examined 16 marrow aspirates and blood smears from patients with acute leukemia, predominantly ANLL, and eight controls. Marrow aspirates or blood were smeared on glass slides and fixed immediately in 10% buffered formalin. p21 was examined with avidin-biotin linked immunoperoxidase visualization. Particular attention must be paid to antibody selection and fixation protocol to demonstrate p21, owing to its rapid degradation ex vivo. Three of 16 patients exhibited occasional high p21 expression primarily in leukemic blasts, but in no case were more than 10% of blast cells positive. Normal reticuloendothelial and myeloid cells occasionally exhibited mild to moderately heavy staining, but megakaryocytes, erythroid precursors, lymphocytes and plasma cells were consistently negative. Most patients, 5 normal volunteers and 3 patients with non-malignant disease, exhibited no reactivity, or only a faint blush. These data suggest that while point mutation and concomitant activation of c-N-ras occurs regularly in ANLL, high levels of ras p21 expression are rarely found with this technique.","['Needleman, S W', 'Gutheil, J C', 'Kapil, V', 'Cimino, E F', 'Chana, G', 'Mane, S M']","['Needleman SW', 'Gutheil JC', 'Kapil V', 'Cimino EF', 'Chana G', 'Mane SM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Maryland Hospital, Baltimore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,"['0 (Fixatives)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*chemistry', '*Fixatives', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*analysis/blood']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathology. 1990 Apr;22(2):77-81. doi: 10.3109/00313029009063784.,['10.3109/00313029009063784 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

A brief review.,245-50,"There is considerable evidence that certain ether lipids represent a new class of antineoplastic agents. The activity of some of these structures is partially mediated through non-specific host resistance cells. In addition, more importantly, these ether lipids have been shown to be cytotoxic for cells from a wide variety of tumors and leukemias. The site of the cytotoxic action of ether lipids appears to be the cell membrane. They inhibit the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine as well as the activity of protein kinase C and might interfere with some growth factor receptors. Higher concentrations of some of these compounds are not compatible with the lipid bilayer matrix of the membrane. However, it remains uncertain whether or not these effects represent the only mechanisms for the cytotoxic action of this material. Further experiments elucidating the molecular mechanisms in the cytotoxicity of these compounds are necessary. In vivo a wide variety of mouse and rat tumors have been found to be sensitive to the therapeutic activity of ether lipids, with other tumor and leukemia models, however, being resistant to this material. Clinical phase I pilot trials have been completed, showing tumor response in a small number of patients treated, and 3 drugs are currently in phase II studies. Some of these ether lipids are preferentially cytotoxic to leukemic cells in comparison with normal bone marrow cells within a certain dose range. Thus, they are suitable for purging residual leukemic cells from remission bone marrow used for autologous bone marrow transplantation. A phase I/II study of autologous bone marrow transplantation in acute leukemia using bone marrow cells treated with ether lipids is in progress.","['Berdel, W E']",['Berdel WE'],"['Department of Medicine I, Technische Universitat, Munich, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*therapeutic use', 'Pilot Projects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 1990 Aug;13(4):245-50. doi: 10.1159/000216771.,['10.1159/000216771 [doi]'],,,71,,,,,,,,,,

The recent demonstration that Hermes, a glycoprotein implicated in the adhesion of lymphocytes to endothelium, belongs to the CD44 cluster raises interesting questions concerning the role of this molecule on astrocytes and on non-lymphoid cells. To obtain confirmation of the identity of p85 glycoprotein and CD44, p85 glycoprotein was purified from B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by affinity to monolonal 50B4-IgG and electrophoretic elution, digested with trypsin or CNBr and fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC. The sequences of three peptides were obtained which could be aligned with the amino acid sequence deduced from the CD44 cDNA at residues 49-54, 59-66 and 309-323. These constitute the first reported peptide sequences for antigens of the CD44 cluster and confirm that p85 glycoprotein is indeed the product of the CD44 gene. Since two different cDNA clones encoding molecules with cytoplasmic tails of 72 and 5 amino acids have been isolated, the isolation of peptide 309-323 confirms the existence of a processed protein with the longer cytoplasmic domain. Using a cDNA probe, we have characterized the expression of CD44 in several normal and malignant cell types. The level of CD44 mRNA was correlated with the surface expression of CD44 antigens (50B4) in several leukemic cell lines, in astrocytoma lines and in normal granulocytes. Negative cells included the Y79 retinoblastoma line, the NALM-6 leukemic line and endothelial cells. Identical mRNA species of 5.0, 2.3 and 1.7 kb were present in all CD44-positive samples, including normal granulocytes, astrocytoma, melanoma and leukemia cell lines and leukemic cells from patients. The highest level of expression of CD44 was observed on astrocytoma lines and on acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells of immature phenotype. The presence of high levels of CD44 on malignant cells could increase the ability of these cells to adhere to matrix proteins and/or to interact with endothelium, thus potentially altering their capacity for invasiveness and metastasis.","['Quackenbush, E J', 'Vera, S', 'Greaves, A', 'Letarte, M']","['Quackenbush EJ', 'Vera S', 'Greaves A', 'Letarte M']","['Research Institute Division of Immunology and Cancer, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'OS382OHJ8P (Cyanogen Bromide)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Astrocytoma/chemistry', 'Cell Adhesion/immunology', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Cyanogen Bromide', 'Glioma/chemistry', 'Granulocytes/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Melanoma/chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*chemistry', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*analysis/chemistry/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Trypsin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1990 Oct;27(10):947-55. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(90)90117-i.,['10.1016/0161-5890(90)90117-i [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these (NF-E1) is a tissue-restricted factor that has recently been cloned. The binding sites of these factors identify DNA sequence elements that might mediate the tissue-specific and inducible transcription of the alpha-globin gene. This possibility was tested in a series of in vitro transcription experiments. An examination of 5' truncated templates and synthetic promoters constituted from individual factor-binding sites apposed to the alpha-TATAA box showed that the binding elements of three factors (alpha-CP1, alpha-IRP, and NF-E1) mediate four- to sixfold activation of transcription in vitro. In contrast, one element (alpha-CP2) stimulated transcription less than twofold. The 5- to 10-fold stimulation of these latter templates upon addition of a DNA sequence affinity-purified factor suggests that alpha-CP2 is functionally limiting in nuclear extracts. Additional experiments further tested the effect of supplementing extracts with factors purified from erythroid cell nuclear extracts or, in the case of NF-E1, enriched from a bacterial cDNA expression system. Each factor tested stimulated transcription in vitro in a binding-site-dependent manner. Our results provide a comprehensive functional view of the murine alpha-globin promoter and suggest possible mechanisms for activation of alpha-globin gene transcription during induced differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells.","['Kim, C G', 'Swendeman, S L', 'Barnhart, K M', 'Sheffery, M']","['Kim CG', 'Swendeman SL', 'Barnhart KM', 'Sheffery M']","['DeWitt Wallace Research Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1990 Nov;10(11):5958-66. doi: 10.1128/mcb.10.11.5958-5966.1990.,['10.1128/mcb.10.11.5958-5966.1990 [doi]'],,,,"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-37513/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC361393,,,,,,,

Etoposide was included because of its known efficacy in relapsed Hodgkin's disease and to evaluate for synergy with an alkylating agent and vincristine. Cytosine arabinoside and methotrexate were included to evaluate their effectiveness in rapidly growing resistant disease. Forty-two patients with previously treated Hodgkin's disease were entered, of which 37 are evaluable for response and toxicity. All patients had at least 2 prior regimens of chemotherapy and 59% had additional radiation therapy. Complete and partial response was observed in 61%; there were 32% complete responders. Duration of complete response was a median of 8 months (range 2-28+ months). Duration of partial response was 7 months (range 1-17 months). Three patients remain in complete remission at 19, 19, and 28 months. Major toxicity was hematologic with severe or life-threatening toxicity in 54%. There was one patient with a fatal infection. Non-hematologic toxicity, save for nausea and vomiting, was mild and uncommon. There were two fatal and one severe pulmonary toxicities reported in patients who had previous exposure to bleomycin and mediastinal radiation. Three had interstitial pneumonitis and one pulmonary emboli. The interstitial pneumonitis was thought to be drug related. Survival of the entire group is estimated at 61% at 12 months. We conclude that MOPLACE is an effective regimen with an appreciable complete response rate in this heavily pretreated group of patients. Hematologic and pulmonary toxicities are severe and may necessitate dose modifications. The use of etoposide containing combinations requires further study as primary therapy in untreated patients.","['Schulman, P', 'McCarroll, K', 'Cooper, M R', 'Norton, L', 'Barcos, M', 'Gottlieb, A J']","['Schulman P', 'McCarroll K', 'Cooper MR', 'Norton L', 'Barcos M', 'Gottlieb AJ']","['Department of Medicine, North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, NY 11030.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'MOPLACE protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1990;18(6):482-6. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950180609.,['10.1002/mpo.2950180609 [doi]'],,,,"['CA-03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-07968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

These patients were treated between May 1975 and June 1988. Median age was 8 years (range, 1 month to 43 years). Initially, patients were given transplants late in their disease but, as the programme progressed, patients were given transplants earlier and while in remission from their disease. The types of disease considered for treatment by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) expanded from leukaemia, and aplastic anaemia to include neuroblastoma, thalassaemia and immune deficiency. Initially matched donors were used but the source of marrow broadened to include mismatched family members, matched unrelated donors and autologous marrow. Problems after BMT were rejection (11%), acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (45%), interstitial pneumonitis (22%) and relapse (36%). Recurrence of disease was the cause of half the deaths. GVHD was less frequent with the use of methotrexate and cyclosporin, T-cell depleted marrow or matched donors. Interstitial pneumonitis was more commonly associated with the use of mismatched donors and the development of GHVD. Relapse was less likely when BMT was undertaken in the first remission. At least one long-term side effect was seen in all patients treated with total body irradiation whereas no patient treated without irradiation had long-term side effects. The rate of disease free survival of patients at 24 months was 56% for matched, 48% for closely matched, 46% for autologous and 29% for mismatched transplants. For matched transplants mortality within the first 6 months after transplantation decreased from 28% before 1984 to 5% since 1984. Fifty-one patients have survived to June 1989, 49 of them disease free, for periods ranging from 12 to 123 months (median 29 months).","['Vowels, M R', 'Lam-Po-Tang, R', 'Brown, R']","['Vowels MR', 'Lam-Po-Tang R', 'Brown R']","[""Department of Haematology, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Randwick, NSW.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Med J Aust,The Medical journal of Australia,0400714,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality/*standards', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Prognosis', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors/supply & distribution']",1990/11/19 00:00,1990/11/19 00:01,['1990/11/19 00:00'],"['1990/11/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/19 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med J Aust. 1990 Nov 19;153(10):580-4. doi: 10.5694/j.1326-5377.1990.tb126265.x.,['10.5694/j.1326-5377.1990.tb126265.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trisomy 13 appears to represent another rare but nonrandom cytogenetic abnormality in acute leukemia.

Half-maximal growth of MDS CFU-E and BFU-E was detected at a 4-fold higher rhEPO concentration than required by control erythroid progenitors. Nine of the patients evaluated exhibited maximal growth of erythroid colonies at 5- to 20-fold higher than control saturating rhEPO concentrations. Circulating EPO levels in MDS patients were elevated, with a mean value approximately 35-fold higher than that of controls. The frequency of MDS marrow CFU-E and BFU-E was 57 +/- 42% and 18 +/- 9% of the mean control values, respectively. Correlation analysis of the relationships between MDS EPO levels and erythroid progenitors indicated that the anemia in MDS is not attributable to an abnormality in the capacity of EPO to induce the generation of CFU-E, but may be influenced by the BFU-E population, whose severe deficiency results in insufficient influx of EPO-responsive cells. Our findings therefore suggest that treatment of MDS patients with rhEPO may be of limited benefit, since the generation of BFU-E from more primitive ancestors and the initial growth requirements of these cells are not under the regulatory influence of this hormone.","['Merchav, S', 'Nielsen, O J', 'Rosenbaum, H', 'Sharon, R', 'Brenner, B', 'Tatarsky, I', 'Scigalla, P', 'Wieczorek, L']","['Merchav S', 'Nielsen OJ', 'Rosenbaum H', 'Sharon R', 'Brenner B', 'Tatarsky I', 'Scigalla P', 'Wieczorek L']","['Department of Haematology, Technion Faculty of Medicine, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/blood/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/blood/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Nov;4(11):771-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A broad interpatient variation of metabolic parameters has further complicated interpretation of the results. The present study compares ara-C metabolism in leukemic blasts of two patients with newly diagnosed disease, before and after repeated treatment with ara-C containing chemotherapy regimens in vivo. Membrane transport of ara-C was unchanged after treatment. In addition, cell-free extracts of blasts obtained after treatment failure showed an unchanged cytidine deaminase activity. Though deoxycytidine kinase activity in cell extracts was unaltered or increased after treatment failure, the activity in situ, measured as the rate of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine triphosphate (ara-CTP) formation, was decreased. This could be shown to be due to an expansion of the deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) pool. The severalfold increase in dCTP pool was accompanied by a decrease in thymidine triphosphate (dTTP) pool and correlated with a decrease in deoxycytidylate deaminase (dCMP-deaminase) activity in cell free extracts. Low dCMP-deaminase activity had been shown to confer an ara-C resistant phenotype to cell lines in vitro. Data presented in this paper show that a selection for leukemic blasts with low dCMP-deaminase activity can also be favored by ara-C containing treatment regimens in vivo. Our data suggest that this mechanism might contribute to treatment failure.","['Chiba, P', 'Tihan, T', 'Szekeres, T', 'Salamon, J', 'Kraupp, M', 'Eher, R', 'Koller, U', 'Knapp, W']","['Chiba P', 'Tihan T', 'Szekeres T', 'Salamon J', 'Kraupp M', 'Eher R', 'Koller U', 'Knapp W']","['Institute of Medical Chemistry, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.5.4.12 (DCMP Deaminase)', ""QOP4K539MU (thymidine 5'-triphosphate)""]",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'DCMP Deaminase/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Pyrimidines/*metabolism', 'Thymine Nucleotides/metabolism']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Nov;4(11):761-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LMW-BCGF dependent proliferation of these malignant cells is inhibited by the anti-B8.7 monoclonal antibody (anti-B8.7 MoAb), in the same line as that of normal B cells. These results obtained with monoclonal B cells confirm that the B8.7 molecule is involved in the signalling pathway of the LMW-BCGF.","['Karray, S', 'Leprince, C', 'Merle-Beral, H', 'Debre, P', 'Richard, Y', 'Galanaud, P']","['Karray S', 'Leprince C', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Debre P', 'Richard Y', 'Galanaud P']","['Unite INSERM U 131, Clamart, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (B8.7 antigen, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1990;14(9):809-14. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(90)90075-k.,"['0145-2126(90)90075-K [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(90)90075-k [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells from a patient with near-haploid ALL (karyotype: 27 XY, DNA index = 0.5) were investigated by multiparameter flow cytometry at relapse and at multiple time-points during reinduction chemotherapy. The cell cycle of these near-haploid leukemic blasts and their chromatin structure was studied by acridine orange (AO) DNA/RNA flow cytometric assays. Most leukemic cells were in ""G0"", and no recruitment of the bone marrow cells into the G1 phase of the cell cycle was found during reinduction therapy with high dose cytosine arabinoside. After two cycles of chemotherapy, the patient achieved clinical remission, but persistent haploid cells were identified by flow cytometry and he relapsed after 8 weeks and died after 16.7 weeks. The leukemic blasts expressed very high levels of a 180 kd p-glycoprotein associated with multidrug resistance and daunomycin efflux could be blocked by verapamil. Expression of gp 180 and the verapamil effect on intracellular daunomycin concentration indicate multidrug resistance. We conclude that cell kinetic quiescence and multidrug resistance may both be factors responsible for the poor prognosis of this patient with near-haploid ALL. Further studies of this patient group should determine if these mechanisms are indeed responsible for the poor prognosis associated with near-haploid leukemia.","['Redner, A', 'Hegewisch, S', 'Haimi, J', 'Steinherz, P', 'Jhanwar, S', 'Andreeff, M']","['Redner A', 'Hegewisch S', 'Haimi J', 'Steinherz P', 'Jhanwar S', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (elastin microfibril interface located protein)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics', '*Drug Resistance', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1990;14(9):771-7. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(90)90070-p.,['10.1016/0145-2126(90)90070-p [doi]'],,,,"['CA-38980/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-41305/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood lymphocytes of 27 patients (54%) demonstrated significant autologous tumor-killing activity in 6-hour 51Cr-release assays. Twenty-three of the 27 patients with autologous tumor-killing activity remained tumor free and survived more than 5 years after curative surgery, while all 23 who were negative for autologous tumor-killing activity relapsed by 18 months after surgery and died within 42 months after surgery. The differences in survival curves for the two groups were highly significant (P less than .00003). Autologous tumor-killing activity was not correlated with natural killer (NK) cell activity against K562 human myeloid leukemia cells or proliferation of lymphocytes stimulated with autologous, freshly isolated tumor cells in mixed culture. There were no differences in total survival between patients with positive results and those with negative results in tests of NK cell activity and autologous mixed lymphocyte-tumor culture reaction. These results indicate that autologous tumor-killing activity is a meaningful prognostic indicator and provide evidence for immunological control of tumor growth and metastasis. According to our preliminary data, it is unlikely that lung cancer patients who remain tumor free after 60 months of follow-up will develop recurrence or die from the disease. We are conducting a study to determine whether induction of autologous tumor-killing activity before surgery, by treatment with biological response modifiers,can improve the clinical outcome in patients who do not naturally have this potential.","['Uchida, A', 'Kariya, Y', 'Okamoto, N', 'Sugie, K', 'Fujimoto, T', 'Yagita, M']","['Uchida A', 'Kariya Y', 'Okamoto N', 'Sugie K', 'Fujimoto T', 'Yagita M']","['Department of Late Effect Studies, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromium Radioisotopes', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Lung Neoplasms/blood/*immunology/surgery', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Period', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/11/07 00:00,1990/11/07 00:01,['1990/11/07 00:00'],"['1990/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1990 Nov 7;82(21):1697-701. doi: 10.1093/jnci/82.21.1697.,['10.1093/jnci/82.21.1697 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The anilines were attached to the DNA-intercalating acridine chromophores by link groups (-O-, -CH2-, -S-, and -SO2-) of widely varying electronic properties, providing four series of widely differing mustard reactivity where the alkyl chain linking the acridine and mustard moieties was varied from two to five carbons. Relationships were sought between chain length and biological properties. Within each series, increasing the chain length did not alter the reactivity of the alkylating moiety but did appear to position it differently on the DNA, since cross-linking ability (measured by agarose gel assay) altered with chain length, being maximal with the C4 analogue. The in vivo antitumor activities of the compounds depended to some extent on the reactivity of the mustard, with the least reactive SO2 compounds being inactive. However, DNA-targeting did appear to allow the use of less reactive mustards, since the S-linked acridine mustards showed significant activity whereas the parent S-mustard did not. Within each active series, the most active compound was the C4 homologue, suggesting some relationship between activity and extent of DNA alkylation.","['Valu, K K', 'Gourdie, T A', 'Boritzki, T J', 'Gravatt, G L', 'Baguley, B C', 'Wilson, W R', 'Wakelin, L P', 'Woodgate, P D', 'Denny, W A']","['Valu KK', 'Gourdie TA', 'Boritzki TJ', 'Gravatt GL', 'Baguley BC', 'Wilson WR', 'Wakelin LP', 'Woodgate PD', 'Denny WA']","['School of Medicine, Department of Pathology, University of Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'CUJ6745Z9J (Aniline Mustard)']",IM,"['Acridines/*chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Alkylating Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Alkylation', 'Aniline Mustard/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'Intercalating Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1990 Nov;33(11):3014-9. doi: 10.1021/jm00173a016.,['10.1021/jm00173a016 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Synthesis and biological activity of platinum complexes linked to 9-anilinoacridine.,3008-14,"Two different classes of cis-diaminedichloroplatinum(II) complexes linked to the DNA-intercalating chromophore 9-anilinoacridine have been synthesized and evaluated as DNA-targeted antitumor agents. Two different Pt chelating ligands were investigated (based on 1,2-ethanediamine and 1,3-propanediamine), designed to deliver the Pt in an orientation likely to respectively enhance either intrastrand or interstrand cross-linking. Although both sets of ligands were somewhat unstable under neutral or basic conditions with respect to disproportionation, the corresponding Pt complexes, once prepared, appeared to be quite stable. All the Pt complexes were monitored for purity by TLC, HPLC, and FAB mass spectra, and the mode of Pt coordination was established by 195Pt NMR spectroscopy. The complexes appeared to cause simultaneous platination and intercalative unwinding of plasmid DNA. In vitro studies were carried out with both wild-type and cisplatin-resistant P388 cell lines. Whereas cisplatin itself and the ethylenediamine and 1,3-propanediamine complexes used as standards were about 10-fold less active against the resistant line, the ethylenediamine-linked Pt complexes showed no differential toxicity between the two lines and the propanediamine-linked complexes showed significant differentials (up to 8-fold) in favor of the cisplatin-resistant line. However, these were no greater than those shown by the unplatinated ligands themselves. The majority of the acridine complexes were inactive in vivo against the wild-type P388 leukemia. They were very insoluble, and although a suitable formulation was found, this may have been a factor. It is also possible that these compounds bind in such a way as to direct the Pt away from the major groove.","['Palmer, B D', 'Lee, H H', 'Johnson, P', 'Baguley, B C', 'Wickham, G', 'Wakelin, L P', 'McFadyen, W D', 'Denny, W A']","['Palmer BD', 'Lee HH', 'Johnson P', 'Baguley BC', 'Wickham G', 'Wakelin LP', 'McFadyen WD', 'Denny WA']","['Cancer Research Laboratory, University of Auckland School of Medicine, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Ethylenediamines)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '3340-22-5 (9-anilinoacridine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Amsacrine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Chelating Agents/chemical synthesis', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'Diamines/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Ethylenediamines/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1990 Nov;33(11):3008-14. doi: 10.1021/jm00173a015.,['10.1021/jm00173a015 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was an increase in free MTX fraction during TMP-SMX therapy in all patients, from (mean +/- SD) 37.4 +/- 11% without TMP-SMX to 52.2 +/- 6.4% with TMP-SMX (p less than 0.01). Plasma clearance of total MTX did not change significantly, whereas clearance of free MTX decreased significantly (from 12.5 +/- 4 to 7.6 +/- 1.5 ml/kg/min; p less than 0.05). There was a consistent decrease in the renal clearance of free MTX (from 12.1 +/- 6.8 to 5.6 +/- 2.4 ml/kg/min; p less than 0.05). Elimination half-life of MTX was not affected significantly by TMP-SMX. There was a significant correlation between serum concentrations of TMP-SMX and the percentage of decrease in the renal clearance of free MTX (r = 0.91; p less than 0.05). These changes in protein binding and tubular clearance of MTX, caused by competition with TMP-SMX, result in a mean 66% increase in systemic exposure to MTX and may explain the myelotoxicity often observed with the coadministration of the two drugs.","['Ferrazzini, G', 'Klein, J', 'Sulh, H', 'Chung, D', 'Griesbrecht, E', 'Koren, G']","['Ferrazzini G', 'Klein J', 'Sulh H', 'Chung D', 'Griesbrecht E', 'Koren G']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,"['8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Protein Binding', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1990 Nov;117(5):823-6. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(05)83351-7.,"['S0022-3476(05)83351-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(05)83351-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were 14 cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 2 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 23 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (M1-M7), 5 cases of chronic myelocytic leukemia in blast crisis (CML-BC) and 2 mixed leukemias. In almost all of the cases examined, after TPA exposure cells from patients with proven myeloid leukemia became adherent to the substrate, while lymphoid leukemia cells remained in suspension, allowing the differentiation of lymphoid from myeloid blasts. The only exception was in one case of CLL, which had cells that became adherent with long filamental projections. In addition, increased phagocytosis following TPA exposure permitted characterization of M7 as this was the only myeloid leukemia negative for phagocytosis. Further discrimination between the subtypes of myeloid leukemia could be based on the increased lysozyme production seen after TPA in M4 and M5. Esterase positivity allowed the discrimination of M1 cells, which were negative before and after TPA treatment. In agreement with the results of other authors, TPA and RA led to independent ways of differentiation, granulocytic-like lineage and monocytic-like cells being favored by RA and TPA, respectively. The capacity of the same cell to differentiate into more than one lineage, depending on whether RA or TPA was used, was only seen in the present study with M3 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Marques-Silva, V M', 'De Souza, M H', 'Teixeira, M C', 'Arcuri, R A', 'Rumjanek, V M']","['Marques-Silva VM', 'De Souza MH', 'Teixeira MC', 'Arcuri RA', 'Rumjanek VM']","['Basic Research Centre, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis', '*Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 1990;4(5):342-9. doi: 10.1002/jcla.1860040506.,['10.1002/jcla.1860040506 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional practice dictates that parenteral antibiotics be continued until the patient is afebrile and has recovered from neutropenia, ie, until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) exceeds 500 cells per cubic millimeter. However, the practice in our center has been to discontinue parenteral antibiotic therapy and discharge many such patients before resolution of neutropenia. Since the feasibility and safety of this approach has not been studied, we reviewed the records of 114 consecutive hospitalizations for fever and neutropenia in 61 patients during a 13-month period. Seventy-seven children (68%) were discharged to their homes while still neutropenic after they had been afebrile for 1 to 2 days on parenteral antibiotics, had negative blood cultures, appeared well, and usually had some evidence of bone marrow recovery. Five patients (4.4%) developed recurrent fever and required rehospitalization within 7 days of discharge. Only three of the 77 patients (3.9%) who were sent home with neutropenia had recurrent fever. Each had a brief and uneventful second hospitalization. Two of the 37 children discharged with an ANC over 500 cells per cubic millimeter required rehospitalization. A declining ANC and advanced malignancy were risk factors in predicting recurrence of fever following discharge. A rising monocyte count was a predictor of imminent recovery from neutropenia. These results suggest that ""early"" discharge of an afebrile yet still neutropenic patient is safe when the patient is in remission, has no evidence of serious infection, appears clinically stable, and has indications of bone marrow recovery. The conventional approach of routinely continuing the hospitalization until resolution of neutropenia may be unnecessary in such low-risk patients.","['Mullen, C A', 'Buchanan, G R']","['Mullen CA', 'Buchanan GR']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9063.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Bacterial Infections/*complications', 'Child', 'Fever/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/diagnosis', 'Neutropenia/*therapy', '*Patient Discharge', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1990 Dec;8(12):1998-2004. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1990.8.12.1998.,['10.1200/JCO.1990.8.12.1998 [doi]'],,,,['CA-33625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Distinctive features of this disorder at the time of diagnosis include leukopenia coexisting with a marrow replaced with granulated dysplastic promyelocytes, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, lack of Ia (HLA-DR) antigen expression, and translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17 (t[15;17]). Heparin is widely but not universally used to interfere with the coagulopathy during the initial phases of treatment. Serial bone marrow examinations during the induction period demonstrate the achievement of remission despite the persistence of malignant-appearing promyelocytes. Patients with APL are generally younger than those with other subtypes of AML, have a 70% to 80% likelihood of entering remission, and are thought to have a more favorable prognosis than other individuals with AML. Remission may be achieved with a conventional anthracycline-cytarabine combination, anthracycline alone, or, apparently, all-trans retinoic acid. Genes potentially important in myeloid differentiation such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and myeloperoxidase are located close to the breakpoint in the t(15;17) but have not been conclusively shown to be rearranged in the translocation.

The T alpha 1 binding site contains a consensus cAMP response element (CRE), and binds a set of ubiquitous nuclear proteins. The T alpha 2 binding site does not contain known transcriptional enhancer motifs. However, it binds at least two nuclear protein complexes, one of which is T cell specific. We now report that although the T alpha 2 nuclear protein binding site displays transcriptional activator activity in the context of the TCR-alpha enhancer, this site alone can function as a potent, T cell-specific transcriptional repressor when positioned either upstream, or downstream of several heterologous promoter and enhancer elements.

Similarities between feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection in the cat and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in man have prompted immunotherapeutic studies in the cat. To develop baseline data on hematological responses to infused IL-2, cats were given daily (1-14 days) i.v. injections of 5 x 10(4) U/kg of recombinant human IL-2 (rHulL-2). Complete blood cell (CBC) counts were done weekly. Red blood cell (RBC), neutrophil, and lymphocyte numbers did not change appreciably over the course of the study. In contrast, rHulL-2 caused an eosinophilia in all but the 1 day treatment group. Treatment for 3 days generated a transient eosinophilia on day 7 that returned to baseline by 3 weeks. Five day and 7 day treatments generated an eosinophilia by day 7 that peaked on day 14 and returned to normal values by day 28. Treatment of cats for 14 days did not increase the magnitude or duration of the eosinophilia beyond the 5 or 7 day treatments. Bone marrow (BM) biopsies from rHulL-2-treated cats revealed a marked selective hyperplasia of eosinophil precursors. In the 5 day treatment group, all maturation stages of eosinophils were elevated by week 1 of treatment. By week 2, the early stages had returned to normal, whereas the late stage cells remained elevated, suggesting an ordered maturation response. Numbers of all eosinophil precursors approximated pretreatment numbers by weeks 3-4. Thus the BM hyperplasia preceded the blood eosinophilia by 1 week, suggesting that an enhanced maturation response of BM eosinophil precursors is a major contributor to the rHulL-2-induced blood eosinophilia. In addition to a maturation signal, rHulL-2 induces a potent activation signal for eosinophils as measured by a decrease in density and an increase in longevity in culture. The significance of the activated eosinophil in the therapeutic or toxicologic response to rHulL-2 infusion is discussed.","['Tompkins, M B', 'Novotney, C', 'Grindem, C B', 'Page, R', 'English, R', 'Nelson, P', 'Tompkins, W A']","['Tompkins MB', 'Novotney C', 'Grindem CB', 'Page R', 'English R', 'Nelson P', 'Tompkins WA']","['Department of Microbiology, Pathology and Parasitology, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh 27606.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cats', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Eosinophilia/chemically induced', 'Eosinophils/*drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/drug effects', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1990 Dec;48(6):531-40. doi: 10.1002/jlb.48.6.531.,['10.1002/jlb.48.6.531 [doi]'],,,,"['AI-27665/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43676/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Size estimation studies based on TSK HPLC columns showed that this protein has a mass of 8 to 12 kDa. The amino acid composition analysis of the CAP-2 protein calculated from HPLC chromatograms shows that this protein contains around 108 amino acids. Subsequent gas phase sequence analysis, however, was hampered because the N terminus of this protein was blocked and therefore unsuitable for sequencing by Edman degradation. The functional studies showed that the NK lysis-resistance activity of the CAP-2 protein is mediated by interaction with and nonspecific binding to NK target cells. The lymphokine-activated killer and macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity and mitogen-induced proliferation is not affected. Unexpectedly, the CAP-2 protein appears to be mitogenic to its own cell line.

Primary CTCL and ATL tend to involve papillary dermis with or without epidermotropism, whereas PTL and angioinvasive T cell lymphoma predominantly affect skin adnexae, vessels, and subcutis. Cutaneous lesions in type V PTL are heterogeneous and may be confused with panniculitis, vasculitis, or an eczematous eruption.

Despite this, coagulase-negative staphylococci have remained susceptible to vancomycin in recent years. This report describes a strain of Staphylococcus haemolyticus with increased resistance to vancomycin (MIC, 8.0 to 16 micrograms/ml). S. haemolyticus was initially isolated from a patient with acute leukemia and neutropenia in surveillance throat and stool cultures. The microdilution vancomycin MICs for these isolates were 1.0 to 2.0 micrograms/ml. Subsequent S. haemolyticus isolates from the bloodstream and tracheal aspirate occurred in the setting of prolonged empirical vancomycin therapy. MICs for these isolates were 8.0 to 16 micrograms/ml. Further vancomycin resistance (MIC, 32 micrograms/ml) could be selected for in vitro in all four isolates. Restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid DNA indicated that the isolates were very closely related and likely to be of the same strain. We conclude that colonization with a vancomycin-susceptible strain of S. haemolyticus was subsequently linked to a nosocomial bloodstream infection with an apparently identical strain with intermediate levels of vancomycin resistance. Prolonged empirical vancomycin therapy was temporally associated with this episode.","['Veach, L A', 'Pfaller, M A', 'Barrett, M', 'Koontz, F P', 'Wenzel, R P']","['Veach LA', 'Pfaller MA', 'Barrett M', 'Koontz FP', 'Wenzel RP']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,['6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bacterial Typing Techniques', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Sepsis/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Staphylococcal Infections/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Staphylococcus/classification/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Vancomycin/*pharmacology']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 1990 Sep;28(9):2064-8. doi: 10.1128/jcm.28.9.2064-2068.1990.,['10.1128/jcm.28.9.2064-2068.1990 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC268104,,,,,,,

An important side-effect is cardiomyopathy, common to all anthracyclines. Since anthracycline metabolites are thought to contribute to the observed cardiotoxicity, a method for the quantitative determination of all metabolites in plasma as well as in tissues is needed as a basis for the further investigation of the correlation between toxicity and the amount of each metabolite formed. Using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges we were able to extract daunorubicin and its five metabolites, including the aglycones, with recoveries in the range 50-90%. Depending on the chemical properties of each metabolite, fluorescence detection following high-performance liquid chromatographic separation permitted detection limits as low as 0.2-0.9 nM in plasma and 0.8-3.10(-11) mol/g in tissue, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 2, which compare favourably with literature data. The method showed linearity in the ranges 1-250 nM in plasma and 0.04-4.0 nmol/g in tissue (r greater than or equal to 0.998). The accuracy determined at 10 and 100 nM for plasma and at 0.1 and 1.0 nmol/g for tissue, was in the range 86-103 and 85-110% for plasma and tissue, respectively. The within-day and between-day repeatability values were acceptable (between 2 and 12%). Because of large inter-compound differences, separate calibration curves were used for each anthracycline. Application of the assay to the analysis of plasma and tissue samples of mice after intravenous injection of daunorubicin proved successful.","['de Jong, J', 'Maessen, P A', 'Akkerdaas, A', 'Cheung, S F', 'Pinedo, H M', 'van der Vijgh, W J']","['de Jong J', 'Maessen PA', 'Akkerdaas A', 'Cheung SF', 'Pinedo HM', 'van der Vijgh WJ']","['Department of Oncology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Chromatogr,Journal of chromatography,0427043,['ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Daunorubicin/*analysis/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myocardium/chemistry', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",1990/08/03 00:00,1990/08/03 00:01,['1990/08/03 00:00'],"['1990/08/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/03 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Chromatogr. 1990 Aug 3;529(2):359-68. doi: 10.1016/s0378-4347(00)83842-6.,['10.1016/s0378-4347(00)83842-6 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison to labeling by palmitic and myristic acids.,19158-62,"Recent studies suggest that a retinoic acid (RA) nuclear receptor or a retinoylated nuclear protein may be involved in the action of RA. We showed previously (Takahashi, N., and Breitman, T. R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5159-5163) that retinoylation involves the formation of a thioester bond and occurs on protein in newly formed cells and in pre-existing cells. In this study, we saw at least 14 retinoylated proteins in HL-60 cells. Greater than 90% of the retinoylation was associated with the nuclear protein described previously. This protein, partially purified from isolated nuclei, bound to DNA-cellulose and was eluted with NaCl. Retinoylation occurred in HL-60 cells exposed to cycloheximide. Thus, retinoylation resembled palmitoylation, both in the covalent bond and the exchangeable reaction involving preformed protein. These similarities prompted us to compare retinoylation with two other fatty acylations in growing HL-60 cells. We found that the major retinoylated protein was labeled by either radioactive palmitic acid or myristic acid.

We have proposed a list of strict criteria, limiting the term acute mixed-lineage leukemia to those patients whose blast cells co-express lymphoid and myeloid characteristics. This system includes cytochemical, immunologic, molecular, and cytogenetic characteristics that are strongly associated with either lymphoid or myeloid lineages. As more information becomes available, the criteria for mixed-lineage leukemia will undoubtedly change. Identification of patients with mixed-lineage leukemia and metachronous leukemia (lineage switch) is important for determining the prognostic implications of these findings. Care must be taken in identifying cases of metachronous leukemia because of the increased incidence of second malignancies following aggressive therapy. Evidence of a recurrence of the original clone must be obtained before metachronous leukemia can be diagnosed. As with mixed-lineage and metachronous leukemias, the potential clinical and prognostic implications of lymphoid leukemias with antigenic asynchrony should be identified. The asynchronous antigen expression in leukemic lymphoblasts may provide a means for detecting minimal residual disease. Detection of minimal residual leukemia is possible because these blasts differ from the predominant population of normal lymphoid cells in their expression of cell surface markers. Study of the mechanisms that lead to these unusual leukemias may result in better understanding of the processes that underlie both normal hematopoietic differentiation and leukemogenesis. An understanding of these leukemias may also permit identification of cases that are destined to fail current therapies so that more intensive or selective therapy can be instituted for such children.

We propose this last category to be called ""CML-like disease"", not to be confused anymore with true CML, and consequently to be studied as a separate entity.","['Huret, J L']",['Huret JL'],"[""Department d'Hematologie et Oncologie Medicale, CNRS URA 1338, Hopital Jean Bernard, Poitiers, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Hum Genet,Human genetics,7613873,,IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Genet. 1990 Oct;85(6):565-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00193575.,['10.1007/BF00193575 [doi]'],,,39,,,,,,,,,,

We now report on a technique in which we used cryostat-cut, fresh-frozen sections (CCFFS) prepared from tissues in a manner that allows DNA hybridization studies to be coordinated readily with routine morphologic and immunohistologic studies. Thirty-seven cases representing a broad spectrum of reactive and malignant LPD were examined with this method. Samples of DNA were extracted from frozen sections, subjected to Southern blot hybridization, and probed for rearrangements of the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain and the kappa and lambda light-chain genes, as well as for the T-cell receptor beta-chain gene. We also evaluated the effects of (1) diagnostic category of LPD, (2) volume of the tissue sample, and (3) fibrosis, necrosis, and ice crystal artifacts in the sample on the recovery of DNA. Ice artifact and sample size had the greatest negative impacts on the quantity and condition of DNA recovered. Of 19 samples involved by B-cell LPD, the results of immunogenetic studies were consistent with the immunophenotypes in all but one case. Of the T-cell lymphomas from which sufficient DNA was available (three out of five of the T-cell cases), all showed rearrangements of the T-cell beta-chain gene. In order to reduce sample processing time, we evaluated alternate blot hybridization methods, rapid alkaline transfers, and direct hybridization of synthetic oligonucleotides in dried agarose gels, and found that they decreased the time required for hybridization studies. In summary, the use of CCFFS as the source of DNA allows study of gene rearrangements and, at the same time, preserves frozen-tissue blocks in tumor banks for further immunologic studies. The development of time-effective methods will make the routine use of molecular-genetic analysis more practical in the diagnostic hematopathology laboratory.","['Wu, A M', 'Winberg, C D', 'Sheibani, K', 'Colombero, A M', 'Wallace, R B', 'Rappaport, H']","['Wu AM', 'Winberg CD', 'Sheibani K', 'Colombero AM', 'Wallace RB', 'Rappaport H']","['James Irvine Center for the Study of Leukemia and Lymphoma, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Gels)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Culture Techniques', 'DNA/*analysis', 'DNA Probes', 'Freezing', 'Gels', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Phenotype']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1990 Nov;21(11):1132-41. doi: 10.1016/0046-8177(90)90150-4.,"['0046-8177(90)90150-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0046-8177(90)90150-4 [doi]']",,,,"['CA-09308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

However, less than half of all monotypic SLIs disseminated. In this study, we applied a large panel of monoclonal antibodies to cryostat sections of orbital and conjunctival SLIs to address two questions. First, might immunohistologic results other than immunoglobulin staining predict which patients with monotypic SLIs will develop disseminated lymphoma? Second, what is the usefulness of these findings in the diagnosis of orbital and conjunctival SLIs? We found that immunohistologic results did not significantly predict or correlate with disseminated lymphoma in patients with monotypic SLIs, either at time of presentation (ie, staging evaluation positive) and/or subsequently. However, three monotypic infiltrates (10%) had a proliferative rate (Ki-67-positive) of 20% or greater, and all three cases disseminated. Regarding the usefulness of the antibody panel, a B to T cell ratio of 4 or greater (76%), anomalous pan-T cell antigen expression by B cells (38%), and pan-B cell antigen loss (15%) were found exclusively in monotypic SLIs. Combining these results, 80% of monotypic SLIs had additional immunophenotypic criteria of lymphoma. Thus, these findings appear to be useful, although less helpful than immunoglobulin staining, and provide another means of immunophenotypic diagnosis when the results of immunoglobulin staining are technically unsatisfactory or difficult to interpret. We were unable to detect anomalous antigen expression or antigen loss in polytypic infiltrates, including one lesion which locally recurred 30 months later as a histologically indistinguishable, clearly monotypic SLI. We attribute the absence of these findings in polytypic SLIs to their relatively infrequent occurrence in monotypic infiltrates and/or to our inability to detect small clones of malignant cells (if present) by our immunohistologic methods.","['Medeiros, L J', 'Harris, N L']","['Medeiros LJ', 'Harris NL']","['Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Conjunctival Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Orbital Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1990 Nov;21(11):1126-31. doi: 10.1016/0046-8177(90)90149-y.,"['0046-8177(90)90149-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0046-8177(90)90149-y [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relations with the in vitro cytotoxicity.,71-4,"UV-absorption and circular dichroism (CD) experiments showed that ellipticine derivatives may interact with DNA according to 3 possible binding modes depending on their structure and concentration. The first mode concerned intercalation of 1-methyl-9-hydroxyellipticine (1-Me-HE) with its long axis perpendicular to the long axis of base pairs. The same drug was able to bind to external sites (second mode) once the intercalation sites were saturated at high concentration. The third mode illustrated by 1,2-dimethyl-9-hydroxyisoellipticinium (1-Me-isoNMHE), concerned self-stacked molecules interacting at the surface of DNA.

Our previous studies had indicated marrow stromal deficiency in murine AML. In the current investigation, separate stromal cells were cultured and the results obtained have shown that, while marrow stromal macrophages are normal in leukemia and express adequate amounts of IL-1, the fibroblasts are markedly reduced. However, if sufficient fibroblasts are pooled in vitro, they produce adequate amounts of CSF. Test of TNF alpha in leukemic cells CM, as possible cause of marrow stromal inhibition in leukemia, had not disclosed this cytokine. Further, it was observed that total body lethal irradiation of leukemic mice aggravates the stromal deficiency, confirming results of our previous investigations.

VP-16 was selectivity toxic to the parental leukemic cells, with IC-50 values of 2 microM for CEM cells, 1.5 microM for K562 cells, and 12 microM for normal marrow CFU-GM. This selectivity was lost in the MDR variant leukemia cells, with IC-50s of 20 microM in K562/DOX and 8 microMs in CEM/VLB. Cyclosporine, 6 microMs, and verapamil, 20 microM, alone were nontoxic to bone marrow CFU-GM, and did not significantly increase the toxicity of VP-16 to normal marrow cells or to the two drug-sensitive leukemic cell lines. However, cyclosporine specifically enhanced the cytotoxicity of VP-16 in the MDR leukemia cells, reducing the IC-50 to the same level as the parental sensitive cells. Verapamil was considerably less effective. In a mixing experiment that included K562/DOX cells and normal bone marrow, cyclosporine increased the toxicity of VP-16 to the resistant leukemic cells by nearly 20-fold. Because the cytotoxic effect of cyclosporine is additive for resistant tumor cells, its combination with VP-16 may be useful in the purging of contaminating tumor cells prior to autologous bone marrow transplantation.","['Chao, N J', 'Aihara, M', 'Blume, K G', 'Sikic, B I']","['Chao NJ', 'Aihara M', 'Blume KG', 'Sikic BI']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Hematology Division, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclosporins/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1990 Dec;18(11):1193-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 parallels its suppression of cell proliferation and its induction of cell differentiation into monocyte-like cells. The changes in [Ca2+]i are dose and time dependent. The concentration of 1,25(OH)2D3 (10(-7) M) that induced maximal differentiation also caused the maximal increase in intracellular Ca2+. The rise in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration was not immediate and reached statistical significance only after 24 h. The [Ca2+]i reached its peak at 48 h (134 +/- 4 nM vs 101 +/- 3 nM in controls) and remained stable at this level. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ was found to be related to new protein synthesis, because it was inhibited in the presence of specific RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors. The rise in [Ca2+]i was not observed during incubation of HL-60 cells with 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25[OH]2D3), a vitamin D metabolite that does not induce the differentiation of HL-60 cells. In contrast, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OH-D3) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA), both of which induce differentiation in this cell line, also increase [Ca2+]i.

The activity of all three compounds against the multidrug-resistant subline was equal to or higher than that against the parent line. The same result was found for their activity against a human leukemic lymphoblastic cell line (CEM/O) and its methotrexate-resistant subline (CEM/MTX). In contrast, two multidrug-resistant cell lines selected for resistance to Adriamycin, the mouse leukemia cell line P388/ADR and the murine sarcoma cell line S180/ADR, expressed modest cross-resistance to the lipids as measured by thymidine uptake. Experiments performed using the trypan-blue dye-exclusion assay yielded comparable results, although this system revealed a slightly different sensitivity in showing the cytotoxicity of the drugs. By this assay, modest cross-resistance for ET-18-OCH3 and BM41.440 to Adriamycin was found only after 24 h incubation and decreased after 48 h incubation, with almost equal sensitivity to both drugs being shown by the parental (P388/W) and resistant lines (P388/ADR). Furthermore, findings from a human tumor-cloning assay were in accordance with these data, although they did not indicate cross-resistance for the P388/ADR cell line. These results suggest that certain ether lipids and derivatives might represent valuable anticancer drugs warranting further study in the setting of resistant disease.","['Himmelmann, A W', 'Danhauser-Riedl, S', 'Steinhauser, G', 'Busch, R', 'Modest, E J', 'Noseda, A', 'Rastetter, J', 'Vogler, W R', 'Berdel, W E']","['Himmelmann AW', 'Danhauser-Riedl S', 'Steinhauser G', 'Busch R', 'Modest EJ', 'Noseda A', 'Rastetter J', 'Vogler WR', 'Berdel WE']","['Department of Medicine I, Technische Universitat Munchen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Culture Media', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Phospholipids/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1990;26(6):437-43. doi: 10.1007/BF02994095.,['10.1007/BF02994095 [doi]'],,,,"['CA-29850/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-41314/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

For investigation of the role of glutathione (GSH) in the metabolism of 4-HC, GSH levels of K-562 cells were modulated by exposing the cells to buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a specific inhibitor of GSH synthesis, and/or to GSH ethyl esters. Both the mono- and diethyl esters of GSH were synthesized in our laboratories and their identities were determined by chromatographic methods and fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry. An HPLC method including electrochemical detection used for thiol determination was applied for the measurement of GSH esters. Incubation of the cells with BSO depleted GSH levels to approximately 11% of control values and potentiated the cytotoxicity of 4-HC. By contrast, exposure to GSH esters approximately doubled GSH levels and protected the cells against the toxicity of 4-HC. Moreover, when cellular GSH levels were first depleted by BSO exposure and then replenished by incubation with GSH esters, the BSO-associated potentiation of 4-HC cytotoxicity was abolished. The work described herein extends the application of an HPLC method used for thiol determination to the measurement of GSH ethyl esters. In addition, it established that GSH acts as a competitive protecting agent against the in vitro toxicity of 4-HC in the K-562 cell line.","['Peters, R H', 'Ballard, K', 'Oatis, J E', 'Jollow, D J', 'Stuart, R K']","['Peters RH', 'Ballard K', 'Oatis JE', 'Jollow DJ', 'Stuart RK']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '7W95D60F4J (S-ethyl glutathione)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites/pharmacology', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Glutathione/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/chemical synthesis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/analysis/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1990;26(6):397-402. doi: 10.1007/BF02994088.,['10.1007/BF02994088 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

These aberrations are of three different kinds: primary abnormalities, which are essential in establishing the tumor; secondary abnormalities, which develop only after the neoplasm is established but which nevertheless may be important in tumor progression; and cytogenetic noise, which is the background level of nonconsequential aberrations. These latter changes are, in contrast to the primary and secondary aberrations, randomly distributed throughout the genome. The primary abnormalities, of which more than 100 have been identified, are strictly correlated with particular neoplastic disorders and even with histopathological subgroups within a given tumor type. To these purely cytogenetic data implicating specific genetic changes in carcinogenesis may now be added the growing evidence of molecular specificity emerging from recombinant DNA studies. It appears that both currently known classes of directly cancer-relevant genes, the dominant oncogenes and the recessive anti-oncogenes, are located at precisely those genomic sites that are visibly involved in neoplasia-associated chromosomal rearrangements. The molecular genetic data thus support the cytogenetic conclusion that the distribution of consistently cancer-associated breakpoints reflects the genomic position of genes that, either directly or through the control function they exert, are essential in the proliferation and differentiation of human cells.","['Mitelman, F', 'Heim, S']","['Mitelman F', 'Heim S']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Hematologic Diseases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 1990;14(5):527-37.,,,,50,,,,,,,,,,

These results suggest that c-myb is required for DNA synthesis in cells of many but not all T-leukemia patients and that leukemia cells in which DNA synthesis is not inhibited despite down-regulation of c-myb expression may have undergone some genetic change(s) that obviate(s) the requirement for myb protein.","['Venturelli, D', 'Mariano, M T', 'Szczylik, C', 'Valtieri, M', 'Lange, B', 'Crist, W', 'Link, M', 'Calabretta, B']","['Venturelli D', 'Mariano MT', 'Szczylik C', 'Valtieri M', 'Lange B', 'Crist W', 'Link M', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Pathology, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'DNA Polymerase II/genetics', 'DNA, Antisense/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/genetics']",1990/11/15 00:00,1990/11/15 00:01,['1990/11/15 00:00'],"['1990/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Nov 15;50(22):7371-5.,,,,,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Addition of this agent to HL-60 cells causes a rapid internalization of surface transferrin receptor, followed by long-term receptor down-regulation at the level of gene expression. These effects precede the inhibition of proliferation and the acquisition of differentiation markers, and it has been suggested that transferrin receptor down-regulation may play a mediating role in these later events. Here we show that HL-60 cells will grow indefinitely in serum-free medium supplemented with either 5 micrograms ml-1 transferrin or 300 microM ferric citrate and that TPA inhibits cell proliferation (assayed by cell density and rate of thymidine incorporation) and induces macrophage-like differentiation (assayed by induction of cell adhesion and increased nonspecific esterase activity) with identical dose curves in both media. Furthermore, a neutralizing anti-transferrin antibody completely inhibits transferrin-dependent cell proliferation but has no effect on differentiation in the presence or absence of transferrin. We conclude that TPA-induced down-regulation of transferrin binding and internalization does not mediate the subsequent growth arrest and differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['Trayner, I D', 'Clemens, M J']","['Trayner ID', 'Clemens MJ']","[""Department of Cellular and Molecular Sciences, St. George's Hospital Medical School, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '63G354M39Z (ferric citrate)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Ferric Compounds/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology']",1990/11/15 00:00,1990/11/15 00:01,['1990/11/15 00:00'],"['1990/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Nov 15;50(22):7221-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of tumors are known to have altered concentrations of ether-linked lipids compared to normal tissues. However, no through examination of the ether-lipid content of human leukemia cells has been reported despite the importance of these lipids in normal leukocyte function. In the present study samples were obtained from adults with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic granulocytic leukemia in blast crisis, and acute lymphocytic leukemia and from healthy human donors. The cellular lipids were extracted, the individual phospholipid classes were isolated, lipid phosphorus content was determined, and the lipids were converted to diglyceride benzoate derivatives for separation and quantitation of the subclasses by high performance liquid chromatography. The data indicate that all the leukemic cells analyzed have an altered phospholipid composition compared to their respective normal leukocytes. Furthermore, among the AML patients both the percentage of the choline-containing phosphoglyceride fraction (PC) which is alkyl linked and the nmoles alkyl-PC/10(6) cells differ significantly by FAB subtype. A positive correlation between the levels of alkyl-PC and the degree of cellular differentiation is observed. Although no differences are observed between chronic granulocytic leukemia in blast crisis and AML lipids, the leukemic cells contain dramatically lower levels of alkyl-linked PC than do normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In contrast, no differences are observed between the alkyl-PC content of normal and leukemic lymphocytes. In light of the relations among ether-lipids, protein kinase C, and cell differentiation, these data suggest the ether-linked lipids are important in myeloid cell function and differentiation.","['Chabot, M C', 'Greene, D G', 'Brockschmidt, J K', 'Capizzi, R L', 'Wykle, R L']","['Chabot MC', 'Greene DG', 'Brockschmidt JK', 'Capizzi RL', 'Wykle RL']","['Department of Medicine, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27103.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*chemistry', 'Phosphatidylcholines/analysis', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/analysis/chemistry', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*analysis/metabolism', 'Sphingomyelins/analysis/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/11/15 00:00,1990/11/15 00:01,['1990/11/15 00:00'],"['1990/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Nov 15;50(22):7174-8.,,,,,"['CA 12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-26818/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the authors performed a clinicopathologic study to determine the biologic course of diffuse ILL (40 cases) and compared it with small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL; 51 cases) and diffuse small cleaved cell lymphoma (DSCCL; 14 cases). They found that patients with diffuse ILL having pseudofollicular proliferation centers (PC) had a significantly longer median survival (84 months) than those without PC (46.5 months; P = 0.03). The median survival of patients with SLL was 72 months, whereas those with DSCCL had a median survival of only 18 months. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that diffuse ILL with PC should be included in the low-grade category of SLL for clinical purposes, whereas diffuse ILL without PC (true diffuse ILL) should be considered an intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. True diffuse ILL is similar to centrocytic lymphoma in the Kiel classification and should be accorded a similar status in a modified Working Formulation.","['Perry, D A', 'Bast, M A', 'Armitage, J O', 'Weisenburger, D D']","['Perry DA', 'Bast MA', 'Armitage JO', 'Weisenburger DD']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sex Factors']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1990 Nov 1;66(9):1995-2000. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19901101)66:9<1995::aid-cncr2820660925>3.0.co;2-q.,['10.1002/1097-0142(19901101)66:9<1995::aid-cncr2820660925>3.0.co;2-q [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly, such adaptive modulation occurred on the level of accessible cell surface receptors, monitored by neoglycoenzymes. These binding sites can be involved in mediation of cellular interactions, as revealed in a model system by the interference of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine in cell adhesion. Overall, the results support the idea that glycobiological recognition may contribute to the functional integrity of the stromal cell layer as well as provide the basis for further analysis.","['Gabius, S', 'Gabius, H J']","['Gabius S', 'Gabius HJ']","['Medizinische Universitatsklinik, Abteilung Hamatologie-Onkologie, Gottingen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '0 (glycoprotein receptor GPIb-IX)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex', '*Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Receptors, Immunologic/physiology', 'Receptors, Mitogen/*physiology']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blut. 1990 Oct;61(4):232-9. doi: 10.1007/BF01744137.,['10.1007/BF01744137 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include (a) a single dose of total body irradiation (8.5 Gy TBI delivered at a dose rate of 0.2 Gy/min), (b) fractionated TBI (12 Gy administered in six fractions, 2 Gy twice a day in 3 days, delivered at a dose rate of 0.1 Gy/min, and (c) hyperfractionated TBI (14.4 Gy administered in 12 fractions, 1.2 Gy three times a day in 3 days, delivered at a dose rate of 0.1 Gy/min). Donor-type chimerism 6 to 8 weeks after BMT and hematologic reconstitution on day 12 after BMT found in these groups were compared with results obtained in mice conditioned with 8 Gy TBI delivered at a dose rate of 0.67 Gy/min, routinely used in this murine model. The results in both parameters showed a marked advantage for the single dose 8.5 Gy TBI over all the other treatments. This advantage was found to be equivalent to three- to fourfold increment in the BM inoculum when compared with hyperfractionated radiation, which afforded the least favorable conditions for development of donor-type chimerism. The fractionated radiation protocol was equivalent in its efficacy to results obtained in mice irradiated by single-dose 8 Gy TBI, both of which afforded a smaller but not significant advantage over the hyperfractionated protocol. This model was also used to test the effect of radiation dose rate on the development of donor-type chimerism. A significant enhancement was found after an increase in dose rate from 0.1 to 0.7 Gy/min. Further enhancement could be achieved when the dose rate was increased to 1.3 Gy/min, but survival at this high dose rate was reduced. These results demonstrated indirectly that dose rate affects the expression of host-type pluripotent stem cells, the progeny of which appear 3 to 6 weeks after treatment with 8 Gy TBI delivered at a dose rate of 0.1 Gy/min, but which are eradicated if radiation is delivered at a dose rate of 1.3 Gy/min.","['Salomon, O', 'Lapidot, T', 'Terenzi, A', 'Lubin, I', 'Rabi, I', 'Reisner, Y']","['Salomon O', 'Lapidot T', 'Terenzi A', 'Lubin I', 'Rabi I', 'Reisner Y']","['Department of Biophysics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology/*radiotherapy/surgery', 'Mice', '*Radiation Chimera', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology/radiation effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Nov 1;76(9):1872-8.,['S0006-4971(20)83109-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

After treatment of human bone marrow with L-phenylalanine methylester (PME), macrophage-colonies (CFU-M) were induced by M-CSF in a dose-dependent fashion. The optimal concentration of recombinant human-macrophage colony stimulating factor (rhM-CSF) was 1,000 U/mL. Purified human urine M-CSF had colony stimulating activity similar to rhM-CSF. Further studies were performed to determine the factors responsible for the enhanced CFU-M formation from PME treated marrow. Compared with nylon wool and carbonyl iron monocyte depletion methods, PME eliminated significantly more monocytes and myeloid cells. This observation suggested that these cells may release hematopoietic inhibitory factors for CFU-M. Low concentrations (1%) but not normal (10%) concentrations of blood monocytes were inhibitory (mean inhibition, 48%) to CFU-M. High concentrations of monocytes (50%) augmented CFU-M colonies. HL-60 conditioned media was used to simulate secretory products of early myeloid cells. HL-60 conditioned media (1%) inhibited CFU-M formation but not granulocyte macrophage or granulocyte colonies.

Purified HN immobilized on plastic substrates promoted serum-free attachment of normal granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cells (CFC-GM), using an in situ attachment assay in which cell attachment is inhibited by specific polyclonal antisera. When unfractionated BM cells were allowed to attach to purified HN and stained in situ, HN preferentially bound cells at earlier stages of granulocytic differentiation. These observations were confirmed using cells of the HL-60 progranulocytic cell line which mirrored this differentiation-stage specific binding to HN. HN promoted attachment of 60% of uninduced HL-60 cells which were arrested at the progranulocyte stage, whereas only 15% of uninduced HL-60 cells attached to uncoated plastic and 4% to attached plastic coated with equal microgram quantities of bovine serum albumin (BSA). When HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate along the granulocytic pathway by incubation with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), attachment to hemonectin was reduced. Thus, both primary BM granulocytic cells and a granulocytic cell line show preferential attachment of those cells at earlier stages of differentiation.

We used a novel quantitative minimal residual disease (MRD) detection assay, which combines fluorescence activated multiparameter flow cytometry and cell sorting with leukemic progenitor cell (LPC) assays, to analyze remission bone marrow (BM) samples from T-lineage ALL patients for the presence of residual LPCs. Notably, high numbers of residual LPC detected in remission BM before BMT constituted a poor prognostic indicator, providing the first evidence for the biologic significance and clinical value of in vitro T-lineage ALL LPC assays. The median value for the residual leukemia burden before BMT, was approximately 8.6 x 10(3) LPC/10(8) mononuclear cells (MNC) (approximately 0.0086% LPC). Patients with a residual leukemia burden less than this median value appeared to have a better outlook for remaining free of relapse after autologous BMT than patients with a greater leukemia burden (53 +/- 25% v 14 +/- 13%, P = .006, Mantel-Cox). By comparison, the log kill efficacy of purging, the remaining numbers of LPC in purged autografts, or the estimated numbers of reinfused LPC, did not correlate with the probability of disease-free survival (DFS).

Clinical results.,1704-9,"Twenty-two patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were treated with all-trans retinoic acid (RA, 45 mg/m2 per day) for 90 days. Of the 22, four patients were previously untreated, two were resistant after conventional chemotherapy, and 16 were in first (n = 11), second (n = 4), or third (n = 1) relapse. We observed 14 complete response, four transient responses, one failure, and three early deaths. Length of hospitalization and number of transfusions were notably reduced in complete responders. Correction of coagulation disorders and an increase of WBCs were the first signs of all-trans RA efficacy. Morphologic analysis performed at days 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 showed that complete remissions were obtained without bone marrow (BM) hypoplasia. Presence of Auer rods in the maturing cells confirmed the differentiation effect of the treatment. At remission, the t(15;17) initially present in 20 patients was not found. The in vitro studies showed a differentiation in the presence of all-trans RA in 16 of the 18 tested cases. The single nonresponder to all trans RA in vitro did not respond in vivo. Adverse effects of RA therapy--skin and mucosa dryness, hypertriglyceridemia, and increase of hepatic transaminases--were frequently noted. We also observed bone pain in 11 patients and hyperleukocytosis in four patients. Whether maintenance treatment consisted of low-dose chemotherapy or all-trans RA, early relapses were observed. Five patients are still in complete remission (CR) at 4 to 13 months. Our study confirms the major efficacy of all-trans RA in M3, even in relapsing patients. Remissions are obtained by a differentiation process.","['Castaigne, S', 'Chomienne, C', 'Daniel, M T', 'Ballerini, P', 'Berger, R', 'Fenaux, P', 'Degos, L']","['Castaigne S', 'Chomienne C', 'Daniel MT', 'Ballerini P', 'Berger R', 'Fenaux P', 'Degos L']","[""Departement d'Hematologie, Hopital St Louis, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Nov 1;76(9):1704-9.,['S0006-4971(20)83086-9 [pii]'],,,,,"['Blood. 1992 Jan 15;79(2):534-5.

The abundance of numatrin was shown to be correlated with entry and progression through the S-phase. Thus, experiments were undertaken to examine whether numatrin also has DNA binding activity. Using whole nuclear extract, we showed that numatrin binds to both double-stranded (DS) DNA and to single-stranded (SS) DNA cellulose columns. Purified numatrin, which was extracted either under native conditions (in oligomeric form) or under urea conditions (in monomeric form), demonstrated significant binding to either [3H]DS-DNA or [3H]DS-DNA as shown by nitrocellulose filter binding assay. However, numatrin binding to DS-DNA was qualitatively and quantitatively different from its binding to SS-DNA. Thus, the binding of numatrin was several fold higher to DS-DNA as compared to SS-DNA. The binding to DS-DNA was reduced by 77% in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl, while the binding to SS-DNA was not affected under this condition. Furthermore, treatment of the native numatrin under conditions which caused monomerization of the protein resulted in a significant enhancement of numatrin binding to SS-DNA but did not affect the binding to DS-DNA. Following heparin-Sepharose chromatography purification (under native conditions), numatrin at picomole amounts showed significant binding to both DS-DNA and SS-DNA. Finally, numatrin was found to copurify with the complex of DNA polymerase alpha primase together with other proteins required for SV-40 in vitro replication activity. These results demonstrate that numatrin has DNA binding activity, and imply a possible role for numatrin/B23 in DNA-associated processes.","['Feuerstein, N', 'Mond, J J', 'Kinchington, P R', 'Hickey, R', 'Karjalainen Lindsberg, M L', 'Hay, I', 'Ruyechan, W T']","['Feuerstein N', 'Mond JJ', 'Kinchington PR', 'Hickey R', 'Karjalainen Lindsberg ML', 'Hay I', 'Ruyechan WT']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Primase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Nucleotidyltransferases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Primase', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Nuclear Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'RNA Nucleotidyltransferases/isolation & purification', 'Sodium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/10/23 00:00,1990/10/23 00:01,['1990/10/23 00:00'],"['1990/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1990 Oct 23;1087(2):127-36. doi: 10.1016/0167-4781(90)90196-9.,"['0167-4781(90)90196-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4781(90)90196-9 [doi]']",,,,"['AI18449/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R0-AI24273/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA48667-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

French Cooperative Group on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia.,45-57,"In chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), stage A was defined in 1979 as the best prognostic group of the three-stage (A, B, C) classification which was thereafter adopted by an International Workshop on CLL. Recently, the question of whether or not all stage A patients should be treated was raised by authors who described potential harmful effects of treatment among stage A patients and heterogeneity of stage A with respect to survival and disease progression. In this work, we studied the natural history of stage A-CLL in order to determine on which grounds a decision to treat should be made. We performed a prognostic study on 309 untreated stage A-CLL patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial from 1980 to 1985. Our aim was to segregate a subgroup with a low probability of disease progression and death. We used three endpoints: overall survival (50 deaths), disease progression to stage B or C (78 events) and disease progression to stage C (39 events). Multivariate analyses, using Cox's model, selected nine variables as having a prognostic value for at least one endpoint, namely age, sex, general symptoms, involved axillary lymph node, splenomegaly, haemoglobin, platelets, lymphocyte count and bone-marrow infiltration. By considering the three endpoints jointly, we obtained a proposed definition of smouldering CLL based on four variables, namely haemoglobin level, lymphocyte count, the number of enlarged areas and bone-marrow infiltration. However, we did not succeed in better defining smouldering CLL than in a previous proposal, based on haemoglobin level and lymphocyte count.

In addition, alternative splicing of the mRNA transcribed from the BCR/ABL fusion gene has been reported and it has been suggested that this may play a role in the generation of the acute phase of Philadelphia positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). We have examined the fusion RNA present in 24 cases of chronic phase CML and 21 cases of patients with CML in blast crisis using the polymerase chain reaction. In no case was it possible to detect the presence of the e1a2 junction which encodes the p190 hybrid protein product. We conclude that the acquisition of the p190 does not play a significant role in the generation of the blast crisis of CML. Neither could we detect a significant difference in the number of cases which simultaneously express both b2a2 and b3a2 junction products in samples isolated from chronic phase and blast crisis. In the series analysed by ethidium bromide stained gels, there was, however, an increase in the percentage of cases expressing the b3a2 junction in the mononuclear cells of blast crisis patients as compared to the white blood cells of patients in chronic phase.","['Morgan, G J', 'Hernandez, A', 'Chan, L C', 'Hughes, T', 'Martiat, P', 'Wiedemann, L M']","['Morgan GJ', 'Hernandez A', 'Chan LC', 'Hughes T', 'Martiat P', 'Wiedemann LM']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA Splicing/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Sep;76(1):33-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07833.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07833.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time of the analysis 73 patients had died, with a median survival of 4-8 months from diagnosis of blast crisis for the whole series. When analysed as a time-dependent variable, the achievement of a favourable response to chemotherapy resulted in a longer patient's survival. On the other hand, the univariate analysis identified six pretreatment characteristics associated with a poorer prognosis: a longer chronic phase, presence of extramedullary blastic involvement, a platelet count below 200 x 10(9)/l, a less marked leucocytosis, a blood blast cell percentage higher than 10%, and presence of trisomy 8. The latter parameters were included in a multiple regression model together with the blast cell phenotype (lymphoid versus non-lymphoid), and only four of them (trisomy 8, duration of chronic phase, platelet count, and leucocyte count) retained their prognostic influence. When the therapeutical response was also included in the regression model, it proved to be the most important prognostic variable, followed by trisomy 8, length of chronic phase, extramedullary disease, and platelet count, whereas the leukocyte count lost its predictive value. Thus, in spite of the short overall survival of blast crisis patients, the identification of prognostic factors in such a haematological condition may be of interest, especially in the interpretation of new therapeutical approaches.","['Cervantes, F', 'Rozman, M', 'Rosell, J', 'Urbano-Ispizua, A', 'Montserrat, E', 'Rozman, C']","['Cervantes F', 'Rozman M', 'Rosell J', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Montserrat E', 'Rozman C']","['Postgraduate School of Haematology Farreras Valenti, University of Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Sep;76(1):27-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07832.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07832.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blast cells from 24 acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) patients were screened with a short-term proliferative assay based on 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR) uptake for their response to IL-3. To evaluate the synergism between the growth factor and Ara-C, the cells were pretreated for 3 d in liquid culture in the presence or absence of IL-3 (10 U/ml) and for the last 24 h with Ara-C (3 micrograms/ml). The cells were then washed and seeded in semisolid media to assess their clonogenic ability. The results showed that, in those cases which were good responders to IL-3 in the 3H-TdR uptake assay (19 out of 24), Ara-C exposure eliminated a greater proportion of clonogenic cells if pretreated with IL-3 than if untreated (P less than 0.001), while in cases unresponsive to IL-3 this effect was not significant. Moreover, when the same protocol was applied to bone marrow cells from normal donors, it was found that IL-3 pretreatment did not significantly enhance the toxic effect of Ara-C on day 14 granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units (CFU-GM) and erythroid burst forming units (BFU-E). Finally IL-3 pretreatment was also able to increase the cytotoxic effect of Ara-C on leukaemic cells co-cultured, to simulate clinical AML remission, with normal bone marrow cells. The results indicate that IL-3 may improve the therapeutic index of cycle-specific drugs in AML therapy.","['Lista, P', 'Brizzi, M F', 'Rossi, M', 'Resegotti, L', 'Clark, S C', 'Pegoraro, L']","['Lista P', 'Brizzi MF', 'Rossi M', 'Resegotti L', 'Clark SC', 'Pegoraro L']","[""Istituto di Medicina Interna dell'Universita di Torino, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Sep;76(1):21-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07831.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07831.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Longitudinal studies showed an inverse relationship between sEPO and haemoglobin levels in the autologous rescue and allogeneic transplant patients throughout the 130 d post-transplant study period. Early post-conditioning EPO responses were normal for the haemoglobin level in both groups, but after day 14 post-transplant, erythropoietin production in response to anaemia became impaired in one autologous rescue patient and eight of the 11 allogeneic transplant patients. There was no clear association between late impairment of sEPO production and conditioning therapy, infection, graft-versus-host disease, immunosuppressive therapy or serum creatinine. Blood transfusion requirements were similar for both groups in the first month after transplantation, but from days 31 to 90 post-transplant, BMT patients required an average of 5.5 units per patient compared with 1 unit per patient for the autologous group.

CMRGlu of the whole brain after HD-MTX was reduced by 31% on the average (p less than 0.01). CMRGlu of cerebral cortex was reduced more than that of white matter. Eight children with ALL (mean age 9.6 years) were studied using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography before and after HD-MTX (200 mg/kg or 2,000 mg/M2) therapy. Although no patients clinically showed any neurological abnormalities during HD-MTX therapy, CMRGlu of the whole brain after HD-MTX was reduced by 21% on the average (p less than 0.05). Reduction rates of rCMRGlu after HD-MTX therapy were correlated with both total doses of intrathecal MTX (r = 0.717, p less than 0.05) and total doses of systemic HD-MTX (r = 0.784, p less than 0.05). The reduction rate of CMRGlu of cerebral cortex, particularly frontal and occipital cortex, was greater than either that of basal ganglia or white matter.

At a molecular level, it is mediated by a membrane receptor on the surface of hemopoietic progenitor cells. The receptor molecule then binds selectively to a glycoconjugate on the surface of bone marrow stromal cells. The molecular nature of this receptor has been shown previously to be a lectin with specificity for an as yet unknown configuration of galactosyl and mannosyl residues of the glycoconjugate. Normal murine progenitor cell lines, FDCP-1 and B6SUT, were found to possess this homing receptor on their cell membrane, and they also bind well to hemopoietic stroma. However, when three human leukemic cell lines, U937, HL60 and K562, were probed for the presence of this receptor, they were found to be deficient in the homing protein. Further, these cells showed little ability to bind the hemopoietic stromal cell line, GB1/6. These findings suggest that leukemic cells experience a loss, or at least alteration, of homing receptor molecule during leukemic transformation. This can result in a diminished ability to bind to marrow stroma. The lack of homing function may be of pathogenetic significance in the lack of differentiation of leukemic cells and may also contribute to the dissemination of leukemic cells in the circulation.","['Hardy, C L', 'Omoto, E', 'Tavassoli, M']","['Hardy CL', 'Omoto E', 'Tavassoli M']","['Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Jackson, Miss.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/*ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 1990;58(3):179-84. doi: 10.1159/000163580.,['10.1159/000163580 [doi]'],,,,['DK-30142/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Further, for equivalent cytotoxicity, cellular DOX levels in the absence versus the presence of TFP or CGS9343B were markedly higher. Exposure to calmodulin inhibitors following DOX treatment enhanced chromosomal aberrations and cytotoxicity. Maximal effects of calmodulin inhibitors were apparent when used during and after DOX treatment, and potentiation of cytotoxicity was related to modulation of DOX-induced chromosomal aberrations.

Although certain antibiotics are recommended on the basis of their in vitro bactericidal activities, results of therapy with these antibiotics are often disappointing. To evaluate whether the currently recommended antibiotic susceptibility tests for C. burnetii give misleading results because of continued division of uninfected cells, thereby resulting in the dilution of infected cells and, hence, a false picture of antibiotic efficacy, we blocked cell division during antibiotic susceptibility testing with cycloheximide. Using this new method, we found that the currently recommended antibiotics for the treatment of Q fever, doxycycline, pefloxacin, and rifampin, did not reduce the ratio of infected to noninfected cells (either L929 or P388D1) by 9 days postinfection. To test the hypothesis that this lack of antibacterial activity is due to antibiotic inactivation by the low pH of the phagolysosomes in which C. burnetii is found, we used alkalinizing lysosomotropic agents (chloroquine or amantadine) concurrently with doxycycline. This resulted in the sterilization of C. burnetii infection in P388D1 cells. This finding seems to confirm our suspicion that the acidic conditions of the phagolysosomes in which C. burnetii is located inhibit antibiotic activity. This inhibition can be reversed in vitro when lysosomotropic alkalinizing agents are used.","['Raoult, D', 'Drancourt, M', 'Vestris, G']","['Raoult D', 'Drancourt M', 'Vestris G']","['Centre National de Reference des Rickettsies, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de la Timone, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', 'BF4C9Z1J53 (Amantadine)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['Amantadine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Coxiella/*drug effects', 'Doxycycline/*pharmacology', 'L Cells', 'Leukemia P388', 'Lysosomes/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1990 Aug;34(8):1512-4. doi: 10.1128/AAC.34.8.1512.,['10.1128/AAC.34.8.1512 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC171863,,,,,,,

The intensity of the autoradiographic signals obtained from the various genes on the filter is interpreted to be roughly proportional to the relative numbers of transcripts of the genes present in the original mRNA population. The reliability of the method was established by detecting the expression of c-N-ras and c-myc in human promyelocytic HL-60 cells, which are known to express these two oncogenes. The accuracy of the technique was further established by using a conventional method to hybridize filter-bound, cytoplasmic RNA with labeled probes synthesized from plasmid inserts of genes identified by the screening procedure. The utility of the procedure was demonstrated by our ability to simultaneously examine the relative levels of expression of 21 oncogenes in a radiation-induced canine lung carcinoma.","['Kerkof, P R', 'Kelly, G']","['Kerkof PR', 'Kelly G']","['Lovelace Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,"['0 (Membranes, Artificial)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Dogs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Membranes, Artificial', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Oncogenes', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 1990 Aug 1;188(2):349-55. doi: 10.1016/0003-2697(90)90619-k.,"['0003-2697(90)90619-K [pii]', '10.1016/0003-2697(90)90619-k [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indo-1-loaded cell samples were exposed to a radiofrequency electromagnetic field, a static magnetic field, and a time-varying magnetic field, which were generated by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) unit. We found that a 23-min exposure to all three fields, in combination, induced a significant increase in [Ca2+]i of 31 +/- 8 (SE) nM (P less than 0.01, n = 13) from a basal level of 121 +/- 8 nM. Also, cells exposed to only the time-varying magnetic field had a mean [Ca2+]i that was 34 +/- 10 nM (P less than 0.01, n = 11) higher than parallel control samples. Separate exposure to the radio-frequency (6.25 MHz) or static field (0.15 T) had no detectable effects.

These results led to several case-control studies and a similar analysis of more recent death certificates. 'Usual occupation' has been added to the death certificate tapes for the years 1979-1986. Cancer mortality in Iowa farmers for this period is very similar to that for 1971-1978. Case-control studies for acute lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma indicated that farming in general is not a risk factor for either cancer type. However, exposure to general classes of insecticides and herbicides is associated with an elevated odds ratio in farmers for incidence of multiple myeloma. The odds ratios are not statistically significant at the 5% level, probably due to relatively small numbers of cases and controls exposed to any one class of pesticides.","['Burmeister, L F']",['Burmeister LF'],"['Department of Preventive Medicine and Environmental Health, University of Iowa, Iowa City 52242.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,['0 (Air Pollutants)'],IM,"[""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*epidemiology/mortality"", 'Air Pollutants/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Iowa/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Risk Factors']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1990;18(3):295-301. doi: 10.1002/ajim.4700180309.,['10.1002/ajim.4700180309 [doi]'],,,5,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis usually is made by cytologic examination of nasal or bronchial secretions in which characteristic multinucleated giant cells with intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies are observed. The diagnosis of giant-cell pneumonia has been associated with measles virus but not exclusively. Canine distemper, herpes group viruses, and parainfluenza infections have been associated with these cells. In addition, vitamin A deficiency also has been cytologically associated with multinucleated giant cells. The authors describe the isolation of measles virus from bronchial washing and sputum in PRMK cells at 4 days from an 11-year-old child with acute interstitial pneumonia who was in remission for acute lymphocytic leukemia. Classic cytopathologic effect (CPE) consisting of syncytial and hole formation on the PRMK monolayer was apparent. In addition, a foamy appearance of the monolayer was noted in an otherwise clean lot of monkey cells. Confirmatory testing with measles antibody of the infected areas of the monolayer by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) was positive for measles antigen and negative for mumps, parainfluenza (types I, II, and III) and influenza A and B virus. Serologic studies for measles antibody revealed an IFA IgG titer of greater than 1:10,240, and an IgM titer of 1:128. Cytologic examination of the same bronchial fluid revealed the typical giant cells with characteristic inclusions associated with measles virus. Because this disease usually is severe, and often fatal, prompt recognition of this virus is essential, not only to the patient, who can be treated with immunoglobulin and/or antiviral therapy, but also to prevent the spread of the virus to other patients and medical personnel. These findings also support direct evidence for the etiologic role of measles virus in giant-cell pneumonia that has been detected either histologically or cytologically and in tissue culture at autopsy.","['Siegel, C', 'Johnston, S', 'Adair, S']","['Siegel C', 'Johnston S', 'Adair S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Bellin Memorial Hospital, Green Bay, Wisconsin 54301.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Female', 'Giant Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Kidney/cytology/microbiology', 'Macaca mulatta/microbiology', 'Measles/*complications/pathology', 'Measles virus/*isolation & purification', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/microbiology/pathology', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/etiology/microbiology/*pathology']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1990 Oct;94(4):464-9. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/94.4.464.,['10.1093/ajcp/94.4.464 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies incorporating routine coagulation analyses failed to detect any clinically useful information in most of these patients. In this study, the first comprehensive evaluation of the various aspects of the hemostatic system in a population of patients with acute myeloid leukemia was performed. Eighteen patients (23-71 years of age) were studied at either diagnosis or relapse. Hemostatic studies were performed at onset and on days 3, 7, and 30 after initiation of therapy. The bone marrow blast counts ranged from 8% to 98%; prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time showed only minor prolongations in a few of these patients. However, in all patients measurement of platelet-associated markers revealed elevated platelet factor 4 and thromboxane B2 and normal 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha levels. Fibrinolytic markers showed an increase in D-dimer and tissue plasminogen activator and a decrease in alpha 2-antiplasmin levels. Plasminogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor, and fibrinogen levels were normal. Coagulation markers demonstrated a decrease in protein C and antithrombin III levels and an elevation of the thrombin-antithrombin complex. The pretreatment values for all hemostatic markers studied were similar to the values obtained on days 3, 7, and 30 during treatment. This investigation demonstrated a subclinical activation of the components of the hemostatic system possibly leading to a hypercoagulable state. Although only six patients (33%) experienced hemorrhagic complications, the risk of bleeding and/or thrombosis was strongly evident in all patients. The significance of finding abnormal levels of specific molecular markers of hemostasis will be established in the future application of such markers in clinical evaluations of leukemic patients known to be at risk for coagulation disorders.","['Reddy, V B', 'Kowal-Vern, A', 'Hoppensteadt, D A', 'Kumar, A', 'Walenga, J M', 'Fareed, J', 'Schumacher, H R']","['Reddy VB', 'Kowal-Vern A', 'Hoppensteadt DA', 'Kumar A', 'Walenga JM', 'Fareed J', 'Schumacher HR']","['Department of Pathology, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois 60153.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antifibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (Antithrombins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifibrinolytic Agents/blood', 'Antithrombins/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Blood Coagulation Tests', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', '*Hemostasis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Function Tests', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Risk Factors']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1990 Oct;94(4):397-403. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/94.4.397.,['10.1093/ajcp/94.4.397 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this 10-year survey 324 blood culture isolates from 184 patients with hematological diseases and septicemia were studied. The distribution of microbiological diagnoses in patients with hematological diseases as well as acute leukemia 1980-1986 was significantly different (p less than 0.01) from an unselected blood culture material from the same period. The differences are mainly seen between Enterobacteriaceae other than Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococci. The microbiological spectrum for patients with hematological disease 1987-1989 was also significantly different (p less than 0.05) from the spectrum of the same group of patients 1980-1986 due to higher frequencies of coagulase-negative staphylococci and alpha-streptococci and lower frequency of E. coli in the latter period. 40% of the isolates were gram-positive cocci during the first period and increased to 50% during the second period. The susceptibility testing indicates that trimethoprim/sulfonamide is not as good a choice as ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin for oral antibiotic prophylaxis. For intravenous therapy imipenem/cilastatin or the combinations of an aminoglycoside/piperacillin or aminoglycoside/third generation cephalosporin have advantages over aminoglycoside/trimethoprim/sulfa in combination.

The programme in clinical trials at NCI had strong influence from the clinician and administrator, C. Gordon Zubrod, who introduced the randomized clinical trial at NCI and organized the co-operative clinical trials programme of the Cancer Chemotherapy National Service Center (CCNSC) beginning about 1955. The biostatistician, Marvin Schneiderman, collaborated on the first randomized trials in acute leukaemia and solid tumours and recruited the biostatisticians and statistical centres in the early phase of the co-operative clinical trials programme of the CCNSC. From the beginning, there was acceptance of the principles of the randomization of patients and the statistical analysis of data. The sequence of clinical trials for a new agent included the non-randomized phase I (dosage finding) and phase II (preliminary efficacy) trials as well as the phase III (comparison of treatments) trials. New concepts for the treatment of patients developed from 1955 to the mid-1960s included the combination of therapies with independent activity to increase response rates and the administration of therapy to patients in a disease-free (remission) state to prolong the disease-free state. Methodological developments related to clinical trials up to the mid-1960s included: a plan for phase II trials (Gehan); a generalization of the Wilcoxon test for the comparison of survival distributions with right-censored data (Gehan); a test of proportional hazards for survival distributions, which later became known as the Mantel-Haenszel test (Mantel), and an exponential regression model with an explanatory variable (Feigl and Zelen).","['Gehan, E A', 'Schneiderman, M A']","['Gehan EA', 'Schneiderman MA']","['Department of Biomathematics, University of Texas M.

Average follow up was 26.5 years (maximum = 59.9 years). Overall, 2763 deaths were observed versus 2687 expected based on U.S. mortality rates [standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 1.03]. Deaths due to cancer, however, were increased (SMR = 1.30), especially cancers of organs close to the radiation source. For organs receiving greater than 5 Gy, excess mortality of 100 to 110% was noted for cancers of the uterus and bladder 10 or more years following irradiation, while a deficit was seen for cancer of the cervix, one of the few malignancies not previously shown to be caused by ionizing radiation. Part of the excess of uterine cancer, however, may have been due to the underlying gynecologic disorders being treated. Among cancers of organs receiving average or local doses of 1 to 4 Gy, excesses of 30 to 100% were found for leukemia and cancers of the colon and genital organs other than uterus; no excess was seen for rectal or bone cancer. Among organs typically receiving 0.1 to 0.3 Gy, a deficit was recorded for cancers of the liver, gall bladder, and bile ducts combined, death due to stomach cancer occurred at close to the expected rate, a 30% excess was noted for kidney cancer (based on eight deaths), and there was a 60% excess of pancreatic cancer among 10-year survivors, but little evidence of dose-response. Estimates of the excess relative risk per Gray were 0.006 for uterus, 0.4 for other genital organs, 0.5 for colon, 0.2 for bladder, and 1.9 for leukemia. Contrary to findings for other populations treated by pelvic irradiation, a deficit of breast cancer was not observed (SMR = 1.0). Dose to the ovaries (median, 2.3 Gy) may have been insufficient to protect against breast cancer. For organs receiving greater than 1 Gy, cancer mortality remained elevated for more than 30 years, supporting the notion that radiation damage persists for many years after exposure.","['Inskip, P D', 'Monson, R R', 'Wagoner, J K', 'Stovall, M', 'Davis, F G', 'Kleinerman, R A', 'Boice, J D Jr']","['Inskip PD', 'Monson RR', 'Wagoner JK', 'Stovall M', 'Davis FG', 'Kleinerman RA', 'Boice JD Jr']","['Department of Epidemiology, Harvard University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,['W90AYD6R3Q (Radium)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Brachytherapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Radium/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Uterine Hemorrhage/*radiotherapy']",1990/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 1990 Sep;123(3):331-44.,,,,,"['5T32 ES07069/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP-31049/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['Radiat Res 1991 Dec;128(3):326'],,,,

Furthermore, these cells had following characteristics. First, they responded to various kinds of hemopoietic factors. Especially, UT-7 cells were solely dependent on GM-CSF, IL-3 or Ep. Therefore UT-7 cells are useful to the assay of these factors as megakaryocytic cells. These facts provide us with new questions: why they are dependent on plural number of factors? How are the expressions of their receptors controlled. Is there an ""autocrine"" mechanism controlling their growth? Among these questions, we have just started with the Ep receptors, and most of the problems remain to be clarified. Second, PMA treatment suppressed their growth, but enhanced their differentiation and maturation. Among the megakaryocytic phenotypes, increase in GPIIb/IIIa complex, determined by a biochemical method, PPO by ultrastructural study, and the increase in cellular ploidy were clearly observed by PMA treatment. The phorbol ester PMA is well known to induce the differentiation of various kinds of leukemic cells (Rovera et al., 1979). Detailed molecular basis to clarify why the same PMA treatment causes differentiation into different cell lineages, dependent on cellular origin of the target cells, should be further studies. Third, the cells produced hemopoietic growth factors by PMA treatment, the majority of which was GM-CSF. Humoral control of megakaryopoiesis still remains unsettled. Our study may shed a light on its ""multistep"" regulatory mechanisms. Availability of a large amount of homogeneous megakaryocytic populations, which are responsive to hemopoietic factors and phorbol ester, will provide us with a great deal of informations concerning the molecular insight of megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis.","['Miura, Y', 'Komatsu, N', 'Suda, T']","['Miura Y', 'Komatsu N', 'Suda T']","['Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi-ken, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1990;356:259-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this gene gives rise to three species of glycophorin A mRNA of sizes about 1.0, 1.7 and 2.8 kilobases in reticulocytes, foetal liver cells and erythroleukaemic K562 cells. In an investigation of how the three mRNAs originated, we showed by primer extension analysis that all three mRNAs in K562 cells had identical 5' termini and, by nucleotide sequencing of correlated cDNAs, that they had identical coding regions, except for the well-known glycophorin AM-AN polymorphism. However, we found also by sequencing the cDNAs that the mRNAs apparently differed from each other in the lengths of their 3' untranslated regions. This was confirmed by Northern blot analysis which also provided evidence that the three mRNAs originated by use of different polyadenylation signals of which seven were found in the longest cDNA we analyzed.","['Hamid, J', 'Burness, A T']","['Hamid J', 'Burness AT']","[""Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St John's, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Exons', 'Glycophorins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Liver/cytology/embryology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/10/11 00:00,1990/10/11 00:01,['1990/10/11 00:00'],"['1990/10/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/11 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1990 Oct 11;18(19):5829-36. doi: 10.1093/nar/18.19.5829.,['10.1093/nar/18.19.5829 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC332322,,['GENBANK/X51798'],,,,,

The VCS differential performed on 192 non-flagged samples was compared with the blood smear, taken as the reference method. A good correspondence was found between the two methods. Two hundred and seventy pathological samples were studied by both the VCS and the reference method: 219 samples with no anomalies other than quantitative changes and 51 with abnormal cells. 41% of the quantitative changes presented without any flag; 59% were flagged: either isolated X5 flags (30%) or other flags needing blood smear review (29%). Samples with abnormal cells (51) were detected with one or more flags: X3 + X6 in myelocytic disease X2 + X7 in lymphocytic disease. Only two (1 hairy cell leukemia, 1 lymphoma) were not flagged; however in these cases the abnormalities were revealed by the presence of either a striking neutropenia or a lymphocytosis. This corresponded to a false-negative rate of 0.4% in the group studied. Further studies were performed on patients with X5 flagging only. The VCS differential was compared to the optical differential as a reference method. There was a good relationship between the two methods; thus X5 flagging could be established without further slide review provided the numerical values were within the range valid for the laboratory. Thus, in our system of working, both VCS flags (except isolated X5) and laboratory performance limits were taken into account as regards the need for blood smear review. This resulted in a review rate of 15%.","['Picard, F', 'Terroux, N', 'Levy, J P']","['Picard F', 'Terroux N', 'Levy JP']","[""Laboratoire Central d'Hematologie, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,,IM,"['Data Display', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Flow Cytometry/*instrumentation', 'Hematologic Diseases/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Leukocyte Count/*instrumentation', 'Lymphocytosis/blood', 'Lymphoma/blood', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Software']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1990;32(3):211-6.,,,,,,['Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1991;33(1):53-4.

After relapse, most patients with t(8;21) reached a second CR, but it was short, except in the 4 patients who were then allografted, and for whom follow-up is insufficient to draw any conclusion. Our findings suggest that, although it is associated with a high CR rate, AML with t(8;21) has a high incidence of relapses, especially in the first year of CR. The term ""favorable"" cytogenetic rearrangement may be misleading in such cases, and we believe that these patients should receive intensive post-consolidation therapy, possibly including an allograft whenever feasible.","['Fenaux, P', 'Lai, J L', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Jouet, J P', 'Deminatti, M', 'Bauters, F']","['Fenaux P', 'Lai JL', 'Preudhomme C', 'Jouet JP', 'Deminatti M', 'Bauters F']","['Service des Maladies du sang, CHU, Lille, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*ultrastructure', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1990;32(3):179-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BMT, in second remission, from an unrelated donor, was rejected. Autologous reinfusion failed and he died 26 months after diagnosis. Molecular investigation of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement identified the same B cell clone at diagnosis and in relapse. The clinical and cytogenetic findings of six published cases of ALL with trisomy 8 have been reviewed with updates supplied by the authors. These reveal an heterogeneous group of patients ranging in age from 9 months to 39 years with no apparent association with a particular immunophenotype. Four patients were alive after 10-108 months follow-up. Two patients died, in relapse, 7 and 17 months after diagnosis. Thus trisomy 8 occurs in ALL with an incidence of 1-2%.

In vitro phosphorylation of an endogenous substrate in B cell leukemias showed that leukemic B cells at different stages of differentiation had specific endogenous substrates in tyrosine phosphorylation as well as distinct TPK activity. To clarify the relationship between TPK and the process of B cell differentiation, we studied protein tyrosine phosphorylation in two kinds of leukemic B cells, which showed distinct responses to TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) in B cell differentiation. TPA-treated leukemic B cells from patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) differentiated into cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (clg)+ plasmacytoid cells, while TPA-treated leukemic B cells from patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) did not differentiate into clg+ cells, but showed a peculiar morphological change, spreading. Untreated B-CLL cells and HCL cells showed similar TPK activities and tyrosine protein phosphorylation. When treated with TPA, enhanced phosphorylation was seen in B-CLL cells, while a clear reduction in phosphorylation was found in HCL cells. However, using 4-hydroxycinnamide derivatives which reduce TPK activity, we found that only the reduction of TPK activity did not lead HCL cells to spreading. These data suggest that protein tyrosine phosphorylation and/or dephosphorylation might be involved in B cell differentiation, but only the change of TPK activity in HCL cells is not sufficient to induce effects.","['Kuratsune, H', 'Owada, M K', 'Tokumine, Y', 'Tagawa, S', 'Nojima, J', 'Shibano, M', 'Nishimori, Y', 'Morita, T', 'Machii, T', 'Kitani, T']","['Kuratsune H', 'Owada MK', 'Tokumine Y', 'Tagawa S', 'Nojima J', 'Shibano M', 'Nishimori Y', 'Morita T', 'Machii T', 'Kitani T']","['Department of Clinical Research, Osaka University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Coumaric Acids)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Coumaric Acids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Oct;4(10):700-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated platelet function, platelet secretion, and platelet morphometry before and one week after splenectomy in seven patients with normal platelet production and normal spleen size (Hodgkin's disease) and five patients with splenomegaly and platelet abnormalities (4 with myeloproliferative disorders and 1 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia). Severe postoperative thrombohaemorrhagic complications occurred only in patients with myeloproliferative disorders, although platelet count and mean platelet volume increased in almost all patients after splenectomy. Four patients with myeloproliferative disorders had impaired platelet aggregation before splenectomy that improved in only one patient after surgery. Platelet buoyant density in this patient group was decreased before splenectomy and normalised thereafter. Concomitantly, intraplatelet concentrations of alpha-granular proteins increased. Before splenectomy, there was a positive correlation between platelet density and platelet volume in patients with Hodgkin's disease (r = 0.59, p less than 0.001), but not in patients with myeloproliferative disorders. There was no correlation between platelet density and platelet volume after splenectomy in either patient group. In conclusion, morphometric platelet abnormalities were found in all patients after splenectomy. In patients with myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorders, decreased platelet buoyant density normalised and intraplatelet concentrations of alpha-granule proteins were elevated after splenectomy. However, platelet function defects in this patient group were not corrected and may have been a major cause of thrombohaemorrhagic complications in the postoperative period.","['Wehmeier, A', 'Scharf, R E', 'Schneider, W']","['Wehmeier A', 'Scharf RE', 'Schneider W']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Universitat Dusseldorf.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Wochenschr,Klinische Wochenschrift,2985205R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Platelets/*cytology/physiology', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/therapy', 'Platelet Aggregation', 'Platelet Count', 'Postoperative Complications/etiology', '*Splenectomy']",1990/09/03 00:00,1990/09/03 00:01,['1990/09/03 00:00'],"['1990/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Klin Wochenschr. 1990 Sep 3;68(17):847-52. doi: 10.1007/BF01662780.,['10.1007/BF01662780 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it remains uncertain that these effects represent the only mechanism for the cytotoxic action of these ether lipids. Further experiments to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the cytotoxic action of these compounds are necessary.

In this study, the mechanism(s) by which FK973 is activated in the cytoplasm of in vitro cultured murine L1210 leukemia cells were studied using compounds that affect monoamine oxidase. When the cells were incubated with an antitumor drug and the compounds, tranylcypromine, benzylamine, phenylethylamine and tyramine of the many compounds tested reduced the cytotoxicity of FK973, but not that of mitomycin C or cisplatin. These compounds also suppressed the formation of interstrand DNA-DNA cross-links with FK973 in the cells, but did not suppress cross-links with mitomycin C or cisplatin. The incorporation of 14C-FK973 into the cells was not affected by these compounds.

While, DA was detected in 50 (27%) out of 185 adult cases with various types of leukemia. The frequencies of DA in the subtypes of leukemia were 55% in ATL, 26% in ALL, 17% in ANLL, 26% in CML-BC and 6% in CLL, respectively. When compared with other subtypes, the frequency in ATL was significantly higher (p less than 0.01), which suggested a special entity of this disease. In general, however, the frequency of DA in leukemia was rather low, which indicated the difficulty in application of DA by itself in diagnosis of leukemia. While, in cases with DA, DA was very useful as a tumor marker in monitoring the clinical course, for example, in the detection of early relapse or recruitment of leukemic cells. Furthermore, DA was found to be a good prognostic factor which indicates a poor prognosis in cases with ANLL and CML-BC.","['Takamoto, S', 'Kato, H']","['Takamoto S', 'Kato H']","['Department of Blood Transfusion, Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Aneuploidy', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Prognosis']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1990 Jun;31(6):729-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that the Moloney MuLV IN protein binds synthetic oligonucleotides containing att sequences, with specificity towards its cognate (MuLV) sequences. The terminal 13 base pairs, which are identical at both ends of viral DNA, are sufficient for binding if present at the ends of oligonucleotide duplexes in the same orientation as in linear viral DNA. However, only weak binding was observed when the same sequences were positioned within a substrate in a manner simulating att junctions in circular viral DNA with two long terminal repeats. Binding to att sites in oligonucleotides simulating linear viral DNA was dependent on the presence of the highly conserved CA residues preceding the site for 3' processing (an IN-dependent reaction that removes two nucleotides from the 3' ends of linear viral DNA); mutation of CA to TG abolished binding, and a CA to TA change reduced affinity by at least 20-fold. Removal of either the terminal two base pairs from both ends of the oligonucleotide duplex or the terminal two nucleotides from the 3' ends of each strand did not affect binding. The removal of three 3' terminal nucleotides, however, abolished binding, suggesting an essential role for the A residue immediately upstream of the 3' processing site in the binding reaction. These results help define the sequence requirements for att site recognition by IN, explain the conservation of the subterminal CA dinucleotide, and provide a simple assay for sequence-specific IN activity.","['Basu, S', 'Varmus, H E']","['Basu S', 'Varmus HE']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding, Competitive', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Integrases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Nov;64(11):5617-25. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.11.5617-5625.1990.,['10.1128/JVI.64.11.5617-5625.1990 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC248616,,,,"['Basu S, Varmus HE.

A drug resistance gene was inserted into a gp160- HIV proviral genome such that it could be packaged into HIV virions. The HIV genome was rendered replication defective by deletion of sequences encoding gp160 and insertion of a gpt gene with a simian virus 40 promoter at the deletion site. Cotransfection of the envelope-deficient genome with a gp160 expression vector resulted in packaging of the defective HIV-gpt genome into infectious virions. The drug resistance gene was transmitted and expressed upon infection of susceptible cells, enabling their selection in mycophenolic acid. This system provides a quantitative measure of HIV infection, since each successful infection event leads to the growth of a drug-resistant colony. The HIV-gpt virus produced was tropic for CD4+ human cells and was blocked by soluble CD4. In the absence of gp160, noninfectious HIV particles were efficiently produced by cells transfected with the HIV-gpt genome. These particles packaged HIV genomic RNA and migrated to the same density as gp160-containing virions in a sucrose gradient. This demonstrates that HIV virion formation is not dependent on the presence of a viral envelope glycoprotein. Expression of a murine leukemia virus amphotropic envelope gene in cells transfected with HIV-gpt resulted in the production of virus capable of infecting both human and murine cells. These results indicate that HIV can incorporate envelope glycoproteins other than gp160 onto particles and that this can lead to altered host range. Like HIV type 1 and vesicular stomatitis virus(HIV) pseudotypes, gp-160+ HIV-gpt did not infect murine NIH 3T3 cells that bear human CD4, confirming that these cells are blocked at an early stage of HIV infection.","['Page, K A', 'Landau, N R', 'Littman, D R']","['Page KA', 'Landau NR', 'Littman DR']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0414.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (CD4 Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Genes, env', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV/*genetics/growth & development', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Morphogenesis', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Nov;64(11):5270-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.11.5270-5276.1990.,['10.1128/JVI.64.11.5270-5276.1990 [doi]'],,,,"['1F32-A1 0890/PHS HHS/United States', 'AI 24286/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC248565,,,,,,,

The phenotypic characteristics of these mutant viruses differed from those of ts1. For each mutant, the degree of temperature sensitivity was correlated with the degree of inefficient processing of gPr80env, and the following rank order was observed for both parameters: ts1-E greater than ts1-G greater than ts1-L greater than ts1-A greater than ts1 greater than ts1-T. In FVB/N mice, mutant viruses of low and intermediate temperature sensitivity and inefficiency in processing of gPr80env were neurovirulent and consistently caused mutant-specific disease profiles: ts1-T caused severe whole-body tremor, ts1-A generally caused hind-limb paralysis, and ts1-L generally caused a delayed-onset paraparesis. By 150 days postinfection, FVB/N mice that were infected with ts1-G and -E, mutants of high temperature sensitivity and inefficiency in processing of gPr80env, had lymphoid leukemia instead of a neurological disease.

The underlying mechanisms behind these observations are discussed. If immunological defence mechanisms are important for the rejection of ALL cells from the body, the immunological tolerance of the testicular microenvironment might favour growth of ALL cells. Alternatively, the presence of specific growth promoting factors in the testis might enhance tumour cell proliferation. In this context, the newly discovered presence of a lymphocyte growth factor (interleukin-1-like, IL-1) at high concentrations in the testis of several mammals, including man, is of great interest.

Compared with experimental estimates, the new dosimetry system proposed in 1986 underestimates neutron doses, supporting qualitatively the conclusion by the 1965 dosimetry system that Nagasaki A-bomb emitted predominantly gamma rays whereas Hiroshima A-bomb emitted both gamma rays and fast neutrons. A theory based on two recessive mutations in hemopoietic stem cells is proposed to explain radiation leukemogenesis. The theory can explain, at least partly, the actual dose-response curve for incidences of acute leukemia in Hiroshima but cannot explain chronic leukemia in Nagasaki. Existence of a large threshold dose in the latter's dose relationship supports the hypothesis that A-bomb radiation at high doses above a threshold value was a promoter and/or progressor of leukemia. Various lines of evidence that support this hypothesis are presented. Hence, it is not warranted to assume that risk of death from cancer at a high dose, say, 1 Gy can be divided by 100 to obtain the risk at 1 cGy. Risk at low doses should be assessed by direct scrutiny of actual data at low doses in spite of their large statistical uncertainty. Actual data show that A-bomb survivors at 1-9 cGy had apparently lower incidences of tumors than unexposed persons.","['Kondo, S']",['Kondo S'],"['Atomic Energy Research Institute, Kinki University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,['0 (Radioactive Fallout)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy Outcome', 'Radiation Injuries/*epidemiology/genetics/mortality', 'Radioactive Fallout/*adverse effects', '*Risk']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 1990 Jun;31(2):174-88. doi: 10.1269/jrr.31.174.,['10.1269/jrr.31.174 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis included methotrexate, methotrexate plus cyclosporine, cyclosporine, or T-cell depletion using one of two anti-CD5 monoclonal antibodies. For patients with primary MDS, the median age was 19 years (range, 11 to 41 years) and the actuarial disease-free survival was 56% +/- 21% (median follow-up, 2 years; range, 0.8 to 5 years). There were three graft failures (two with autologous recovery) and two early deaths. Outcome appeared to be related to French-American-British (FAB) classification.

There were no graft failures, two relapses, and four early deaths. The presence of marrow fibrosis per se did not predict for graft failure (P = .21); however, the use of T-cell depleted marrow in patients with marrow fibrosis resulted in graft failure in three of five individuals. Our results suggest that in patients with primary MDS or secondary MDS/ANLL, BMT should be considered early in the course of the disease, and that attempts at inducing a remission prior to BMT appeared to be unnecessary. In MDS patients with marrow fibrosis, T-cell depletion should be avoided.","['Longmore, G', 'Guinan, E C', 'Weinstein, H J', 'Gelber, R D', 'Rappeport, J M', 'Antin, J H']","['Longmore G', 'Guinan EC', 'Weinstein HJ', 'Gelber RD', 'Rappeport JM', 'Antin JH']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/mortality/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology/mortality/surgery', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/mortality/*surgery', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/complications', 'Radiation Injuries/etiology/mortality/surgery', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1990 Oct;8(10):1707-14. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1990.8.10.1707.,['10.1200/JCO.1990.8.10.1707 [doi]'],,,,"['AG 00294/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 39542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 02635/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The concentration of the drug and its metabolites in the cells were serially determined and the following results were obtained. 1) The uptake of ara-C into HL-60 cell (1 X 10(7)/ml) was very rapid when they were incubated with 2 microM ara-C. The total intracellular ara-C content per 10(9) cells exceeded the ara-C concentration in the extracellular fluid at about 7 minutes after the start of incubation. It reached about 4 times higher than the extracellular concentration after 60 minutes. 2) Conversion of ara-C to the active form, ara-CTP, was also rapid. The intracellular concentration of ara-CTP was about 3 times higher than the ara-C concentration in the extracellular fluid after incubation for 60 minutes. 3) Total accumulation of ara-C in the cells was dependent on the extracellular ara-C concentration up to a concentration of 100 microM. The production of ara-CTP occurred in such a way that, when the extracellular ara-C concentration was lower than 10 microM, more than 90% of the uptake of ara-C was converted to ara-CTP, while at concentrations above 10 microM the efficiency at production (the ratio of total ara-C to ara-CTP production) was decreased.

Here, we demonstrate that IL-2-PE40 can successfully retard or prevent the growth of a lethal ascites tumor or a solid tumor composed of EL4J murine thymoma cells transfected with the p55 murine IL-2R. The transfected line, EL4J-3.4, expresses 1,000 to 3,000 high affinity IL-2R. Survival extension in the ascites model was achieved by initiating treatment either after 4 to 6 h or within 5 days post-tumor injection in both athymic nude and C57BL/6 mice. Similarly, the growth of an aggressive s.c. solid tumor could also be inhibited. Extension of survival was not achieved either by using the truncated toxin alone not attached to IL-2 or by using an IL-2-PE40Asp553 mutant lacking a functional toxin. Survival extension was not caused by IL-2 activated NK or other host effector mechanisms as IL-2-PE40 was unable to prevent the receptor-negative EL4J parental line from forming a lethal ascites or a solid tumor. Thus, IL-2-PE40 is a potent, specific cytolytic reagent that may prove useful in the arsenal of anti-IL-2R immunotherapeutics.","['Kozak, R W', 'Lorberboum-Galski, H', 'Jones, L', 'Puri, R K', 'Willingham, M C', 'Malek, T', 'Fitzgerald, D J', 'Waldmann, T A', 'Pastan, I']","['Kozak RW', 'Lorberboum-Galski H', 'Jones L', 'Puri RK', 'Willingham MC', 'Malek T', 'Fitzgerald DJ', 'Waldmann TA', 'Pastan I']","['Division of Cytokine Biology, CBER, FDA, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)']",IM,"['*ADP Ribose Transferases', 'Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Ascites', '*Bacterial Toxins', 'Exotoxins/*administration & dosage', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*therapy', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Survival Analysis', '*Virulence Factors']",1990/10/15 00:00,1990/10/15 00:01,['1990/10/15 00:00'],"['1990/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Oct 15;145(8):2766-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A set with a certain plant lectin and a suitable neoglycoprotein can thus determine complementary parts of a potentially relevant glycobiological interaction system. Owing to the interest in the peanut agglutinin-reactive T-antigen, we performed chemical synthesis of the respective disaccharide structure to serve as glycohistochemical ligand and established refinements of the synthetic patway. Coupling of the derivatized monomers had to be performed in the presence of sodium sulfate for optimal results. Complete removal of the protective groups from the p-nitrophenyl derivative of the N-acetylgalactosamine moiety was achieved under mild conditions with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone without affecting any other functional groups. Specific binding sites for the synthetic neoglycoprotein as well as for the plant lectin were demonstrated in cell lines of human breast carcinoma colon adenocarcinoma, and erythroleukemia. ABC reagents in conjunction with DAB as peroxidase substrate were used to visualize specific binding sites. Binding complied with the accepted criteria for specificity. Moreover, carbohydrate-specific binding sites were detected in sections of nine out of 14 cases with malignant breast lesions. The percentage of positive tumor cells with both neoglycoprotein and lectin was similar in each of the individual sections, regardless of quantitative variations between cases, lectin staining intensity often being more pronounced. The reactivity pattern in sections of primary and metastatic lesions was not significantly correlated with the lymph node status. This study emphasized that custom synthesis of saccharides and histochemical application of the resulting neoglycoprotein has a remarkable potential for complementary assessment of endogenous binding sites for carbohydrate structures, localized by external tools such as plant lectins, as a step to elucidate the importance of a putative proteincarbohydrate interaction.","['Gabius, H J', 'Schroter, C', 'Gabius, S', 'Brinck, U', 'Tietze, L F']","['Gabius HJ', 'Schroter C', 'Gabius S', 'Brinck U', 'Tietze LF']","['Max-Planck-Institut fur Experimentelle Medizin, Abteilung Chemie Gottingen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Peanut Agglutinin)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate/*metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Glycoproteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Histocytochemistry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Lectins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Peanut Agglutinin', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology/ultrastructure']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 1990 Nov;38(11):1625-31. doi: 10.1177/38.11.2212620.,['10.1177/38.11.2212620 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

At one site, more than 1500 base pairs upstream of the c-myc promoter P1, binding activity was lost as dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) induced shut-off of c-myc expression in HL-60 and U-937 leukemia cells. The disappearance of other specific binding activities was not noted. In addition, the binding activity was noted to be cell-line specific. The sequence binding the Me2SO-regulated factor was precisely located allowing confirmation of the temporal pattern of regulation by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. Because the binding activity was most abundant before the decrease of c-myc expression during differentiation, it was inferred that the far upstream element (FUSE) served a positive role, potentiating c-myc expression. A 4-base pair deletion which eliminated binding to FUSE also reduced expression of a transfected, chimeric c-myc-CAT gene in untreated, but not in Me2SO-treated U-937 cells.

Selective effect on carrier-mediated transport of physiological concentrations of reduced folates.,18272-7,"This study reports the isolation and characterization of a variant of the human CCRF-CEM leukemia cell line that overproduces the carrier protein responsible for the uptake of reduced folates and the folate analogue methotrexate. The variant was obtained by adapting CCRF-CEM cells for prolonged times to stepwise decreasing concentrations of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate as the sole folate source in the cell culture medium. From cells that were grown on less than 1 nM 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate, a variant (CEM-7A) was isolated exhibiting a 95-fold increased Vmax for [3H]methotrexate influx compared to parental CCRF-CEM cells. The values for influx Km, efflux t0.5, and Ki for inhibition by other folate (analogue) compounds were unchanged. Affinity labeling of the carrier with an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of [3H]methotrexate demonstrate an approximately 30-fold increased incorporation of [3H] methotrexate in CEM-7A cells. This suggests that the up-regulation of [3H]methotrexate influx is not only due to an increased amount of carrier protein, but also to an increased rate of carrier translocation or an improved cooperativity between carrier protein molecules. Incubation for 1 h at 37 degrees C of CEM-7A cells with a concentration of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in the physiological range (25 nM) resulted in a 7-fold decline in [3H]methotrexate influx. This down-regulation during incubations with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate could be prevented by either the addition of 10-25 nM of the lipophilic antifolate trimetrexate or by preincubating CEM-7A cells with 25 nM methotrexate. The down-regulatory effect was specifically induced by reduced folates since incubation of CEM-7A cells with 25 nM of either methotrexate, 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin, aminopterin, or folic acid, or a mixture of purines and thymidine, had no effect on [3H]methotrexate influx. Similarly, these down-regulatory effects on [3H]methotrexate transport by 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, and its reversal by trimetrexate or methotrexate, were also observed, though to a lower extent, for parental CCRF-CEM cells grown in folate-depleted medium rather than in standard medium containing high folate concentrations. These results indicate that mediation of reduced folate/methotrexate transport can occur at reduced folate concentrations in the physiological range, and suggest that the intracellular folate content may be a critical determinant in the regulation of methotrexate transport.","['Jansen, G', 'Westerhof, G R', 'Jarmuszewski, M J', 'Kathmann, I', 'Rijksen, G', 'Schornagel, J H']","['Jansen G', 'Westerhof GR', 'Jarmuszewski MJ', 'Kathmann I', 'Rijksen G', 'Schornagel JH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Formyltetrahydrofolates)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Formyltetrahydrofolates/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/10/25 00:00,1990/10/25 00:01,['1990/10/25 00:00'],"['1990/10/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/25 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Oct 25;265(30):18272-7.,['S0021-9258(17)44748-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarity of their AMP-binding domains.,18130-4,"DNA ligases play obligatory roles during replication, repair, and recombination. Multiple forms of DNA ligase have been reported in mammalian cells including DNA ligase I, the high molecular mass species which functions during replication, and DNA ligase II, the low molecular mass species which is associated with repair. In addition, alterations in DNA ligase activities have been reported in acute lymphocytic leukemia cells, Bloom's syndrome cells, and cells undergoing differentiation and development. To better distinguish the biochemical and molecular properties of the various DNA ligases from human cells, we have developed a method of purifying multiple species of DNA ligase from HeLa cells by chromatography through DEAE-Bio-Gel, CM-Bio-Gel, hydroxylapatite, Sephacryl S-300, Mono P, and DNA-cellulose. DNA-cellulose chromatography of the partially purified enzymes resolved multiple species of DNA ligase after labeling the enzyme with [alpha-32P]ATP to form the ligase-[32P]AMP adduct. The early eluting enzyme activity (0.25 M NaCl) contained a major 67-kDa-labeled protein, while the late eluting activity (0.48 M NaCl) contained two major labeled proteins of 90 and 78 kDa. Neutralization experiments with antiligase I antibodies indicated that the early and late eluting activity peaks were DNA ligase II and I, respectively. The three major ligase-[32P]AMP polypeptides (90, 78, and 67 kDa) were subsequently purified to near homogeneity by elution from preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. All three polypeptides retained DNA ligase activities after gel elution and renaturation. To further reveal the relationship between these enzymes, partial digestion by V8-protease was performed. All three purified polypeptides gave rise to a common 22-kDa-labeled fragment for their AMP-binding domains, indicating that the catalytic sites of ligase I and II are quite similar, if not identical. Similar findings were obtained from the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of their AMP-binding domains in the trypsin-digested protein fragments. The results also suggested that these isozymes have been derived from the same primordial DNA sequence or from the same precursor protein. The purification scheme and the data obtained will be instrumental for the further elucidation of the biological roles of various DNA ligases from human cells.","['Yang, S W', 'Becker, F F', 'Chan, J Y']","['Yang SW', 'Becker FF', 'Chan JY']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.

This protein (PSE1) has now been purified to homogeneity from both human placental extract and K562 cell nuclear extract. PSE1 consists of two subunits, an alpha subunit with an apparent molecular mass of 83 kDa, and a beta subunit with an apparent molecular mass of 73 kDa in K562 nuclear extracts and 63 kDa in placental extracts. Footprinting and UV cross-linking assays indicate that purified PSE1 binds to the PSE and DSE of the U1 gene. Monoclonal antibodies were prepared which specifically recognize the individual subunits of PSE1. PSE1 is immunologically similar to and shares amino acid sequence with a protein (TREF) which binds the human transferrin receptor (HTFR) promoter. An in vitro transcription system was established for a template consisting of a minimal HTFR promoter placed upstream of the human U1 snRNA-coding region and shown by immunodepletion/addback experiments to specifically require PSE1. Transcription from the adenovirus 2 major late promoter was unaffected in these experiments. This result supports a functional role of PSE1 as a transcriptional activating protein, but its role in transcription of snRNA genes remains to be established. PSE1 also has an immunological relationship to and shares amino acid sequence with the p70 and p86 subunits of the human Ku autoantigen. Ku, PSE1, and TREF may thus be identical proteins or members of a family of heterodimeric proteins consisting of related subunits. Our results support earlier proposals that Ku may be a transcriptional activator.","['Knuth, M W', 'Gunderson, S I', 'Thompson, N E', 'Strasheim, L A', 'Burgess, R R']","['Knuth MW', 'Gunderson SI', 'Thompson NE', 'Strasheim LA', 'Burgess RR']","['Department of Oncology, McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Nuclear)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (XRCC5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.- (Ku Autoantigen)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Antigens, Surface/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', '*DNA Helicases', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ku Autoantigen', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleotide Mapping', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Placenta/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proteins', 'RNA, Small Nuclear/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1990/10/15 00:00,1990/10/15 00:01,['1990/10/15 00:00'],"['1990/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Oct 15;265(29):17911-20.,['S0021-9258(18)38250-4 [pii]'],,,,"['CA07175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23076/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM28575/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Sixty-seven patients received consolidation radiotherapy and 87 patients received no further treatment. Thirty of 154 patients participated in a prospective randomized trial of the Southeastern Cancer Study Group (SEG). Ten-year actuarial survival (Hodgkin's disease deaths only) was 93% for the combined modality therapy patients compared with 59% for the chemotherapy alone patients (p less than 0.0005). Combined modality therapy patients had an 87% 10-year actuarial freedom from relapse as opposed to 56% for the chemotherapy alone patients (p less than 0.0005). Relapse occurred in 33 of the chemotherapy alone patients, 28 (85%) being in sites involved at initial diagnosis. Seven combined modality therapy patients recurred with only two true in-field failures. Multi-variate analysis demonstrated treatment (combined modality) as the only variable affecting outcome.

We found that chromosomes 5, 7, 11 and 17 are over-involved in structural rearrangements. These anomalies are similar to those observed in the same categories of patients without S-ANLL, and after in vitro treatment of normal lymphocytes by the alkylating agent melphalan. These anomalies are thus likely to be induced by treatment, independently of S-ANLL. However, the same chromosomes (5, 7, 11 and 17) are recurrently deficient in leukemic S-ANLL clones. In spite of these similarities, it remains unlikely that the deficiencies observed in leukemic clones were directly induced at the time of treatment. Probably, treatment of primary cancers induces nonrandom mutations of recessive genes located on these chromosomes as also indicated by chromosomal lesions. Various rearrangements including deletions of the homologous normal counterparts may then occur, unmasking mutated recessive genes. The latter stage would be concomitant with the leukemogenic process.","['Mamuris, Z', 'Dumont, J', 'Dutrillaux, B', 'Aurias, A']","['Mamuris Z', 'Dumont J', 'Dutrillaux B', 'Aurias A']","['C.N.R.S.

In mouse erythroleukemia cells (MELCs), this effect is detected within 1 hr of exposure of the cells to inducer before the endogenous mouse globin genes are induced. It does not require protein synthesis and is reversed if the inducer is removed. This and other evidence suggest that the mechanism involves a change in activity of a factor intimately involved with transcription, probably as a result of post-translational modification. As such, it may represent an early triggering event in terminal differentiation, and its relevance to the expression of human globin genes in stable transfectants and to induction of the mouse globin genes is discussed. Other cell lines (K562 and NSO) also show this response, which may therefore involve a ubiquitous mechanism. We also found that HMBA depresses the expression of endogenous globin genes in K562, the opposite of this differentiation inducer's effect on MELC.","['Campbell, P L', 'Kulozik, A E', 'Woodham, J P', 'Jones, R W']","['Campbell PL', 'Kulozik AE', 'Woodham JP', 'Jones RW']","['Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Globins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 1990 Jul;4(7):1252-66. doi: 10.1101/gad.4.7.1252.,['10.1101/gad.4.7.1252 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selected samples also cross-reacted with a polyclonal antibody raised against purified CP. The specific activity of CP in ALL extracts was significantly lower than in most ANLL types previously studied (all but M4).

Studies were carried out in the intact animals under basal conditions and also when requirements for this metal were either increased or decreased by manipulating stores or erythropoietic activity. No significant difference was found in the total quantity of iron absorbed from either salt or complex under any of these circumstances, suggesting that the mucosal mechanism regulating the overall process was common to both. However, the rate of transfer from the lumen into portal blood was distinctive, reaching a maximum with salt at 30 min compared to 24 h for the complex. To explore the possibility that iron from the two sources was initially handled by different subcellular pathways, the radiolabeled compounds were instilled into loops of bowel that had been isolated between ligatures in vivo. Enterocytes were harvested and fractionated, and incorporation into ferritin and transferrin was determined using RIA. From salt, iron appeared rapidly in duodenal but not ileal ferritin, whereas mucosal transferrin increased under conditions of stimulated absorption, suggesting that this protein may act as a shuttle for the metal. In contrast, iron from polymaltose showed a cumulative incorporation into duodenal ferritin over time that correlated with iron absorption, defined by the appearance of radiolabel in the serum and in the carcass; a similar pattern was demonstrable in ileal mucosal cells. Conversely, binding of iron to transferrin was minimal. No iron polymaltose was found within the mucosal cells. It is suggested that the low rate of iron transfer from this ferric complex may reflect its extracellular breakdown in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract.","['Johnson, G', 'Jacobs, P']","['Johnson G', 'Jacobs P']","['University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre, Observatory, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Iron Radioisotopes)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'UM5219H89V (teferrol)']",IM,"['Anemia, Hemolytic/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Availability', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Bloodletting', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Ferric Compounds/*pharmacokinetics', '*Intestinal Absorption', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Radioisotopes', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Transferrin/metabolism']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1990 Nov;18(10):1064-9.,,,,,,['Exp Hematol. 1991 Nov;19(10):1065.

In order to test the implication of energy metabolism in this dependence as claimed in several studies, intracellular ATP levels as well as accumulative lactate release were measured in the murine hemopoietic lines FDC-P1, 32Dcl.23, DA-1, DA-3, NFS-60, and NFS-78. ATP levels showed little or no changes within 4-6 h of IL-3 starvation. In the absence of IL-3 the accumulative lactate release ranged from 1.4 to 2.6 mM, and in its presence values between 1.5 and 3.4 mM were recorded within 7 h. Only 32Dcl.23 showed an almost complete suppression of lactate release upon IL-3 withdrawal. The cell cycle times of these cell lines determined by flow cytometry ranged between 9 (DA-3) and 24 h (NFS-78). In the presence of IL-3 there was a significant inverse relationship between cell cycle times and lactate production. It is concluded that neither ATP generation nor the metabolic pathway of lactate production, although the latter correlated with proliferative activity in the studied cell lines, is controlled by IL-3. Furthermore, no control by IL-3 of essential amino acid incorporation into proteins was detected in cell lines 32Dcl.23 and NFS-60.","['Reisbach, G', 'Ellwart, J', 'Dormer, P']","['Reisbach G', 'Ellwart J', 'Dormer P']","['GSF-Institut fur Experimentelle Hamatologie, Munich, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lactates)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Amino Acids/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Lactates/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism/physiology']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1990 Oct;190(2):175-8. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(90)90182-a.,['10.1016/0014-4827(90)90182-a [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This analysis was performed before and during the in vitro differentiation of HL60 cells into monocytes by PMA treatment and into granulocytes by DMSO treatment. The nucleoli of undifferentiated and differentiated HL60 cells were not labeled, unlike the nucleoli of other mammalian cells studied so far. This peculiarity allowed us to quantitatively analyze by flow cytometry the changes in the lectin activity associated with the extranucleolar territories enriched in ribonucleoprotein complexes. The neoglycoprotein binding was found to be significantly lower in differentiated than in undifferentiated cells. The decrease in neoglycoprotein binding was observed within the first 24 h of DMSO or PMA treatment, just before the arrest of DNA synthesis. Taking into account that the granulocytic differentiation required 72 h of chemical treatment, the extra-nucleolar lectins might be involved in modulation of the DNA synthesis rather than in phenotypic differentiation. These data are discussed in an attempt to reconcile the association of lectins with RNP complexes and their possible involvement in modulation of HL60 cell proliferation.","['Facy, P', 'Seve, A P', 'Hubert, M', 'Monsigny, M', 'Hubert, J']","['Facy P', 'Seve AP', 'Hubert M', 'Monsigny M', 'Hubert J']","['CNRS, Departement de Biochimie des Glycoconjugues et Lectines Endogenes, Orleans, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (saccharide-binding proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'TPY09G7XIR (Fluorescein)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*analysis/metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/chemistry/drug effects/*pathology', 'DNA/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Fluorescein', 'Fluoresceins', 'Humans', 'Lectins/analysis/metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis/metabolism/physiology', 'Phenotype', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1990 Oct;190(2):151-60. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(90)90179-e.,['10.1016/0014-4827(90)90179-e [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report that an additional 25% of T-ALL patients bear tal-1 gene rearrangements that are not detected by karyotype analysis. These rearrangements result from a precise 90 kb deletion (designated tald) that arises independently in different patients by site-specific DNA recombination. Since the deletion junctions resemble the coding joints of assembled immunoglobulin genes, tald rearrangements are likely to be mediated by aberrant activity of the immunoglobulin recombinase. Moreover, t(1;14)(p32;q11) translocations and tald rearrangements disrupt the coding potential of tal-1 in an equivalent manner, and thereby generate a common genetic lesion shared by a significant proportion of T-ALL patients.","['Brown, L', 'Cheng, J T', 'Chen, Q', 'Siciliano, M J', 'Crist, W', 'Buchanan, G', 'Baer, R']","['Brown L', 'Cheng JT', 'Chen Q', 'Siciliano MJ', 'Crist W', 'Buchanan G', 'Baer R']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1990 Oct;9(10):3343-51.,,,['tal-1'],,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47975/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC552072,,,,,,,

To investigate the possibility that Ets1 and Ets2 are transcriptional activators, we analyzed the ability of these proteins to trans-activate promoter/enhancer sequences in transient co-transfection experiments. A CAT construct driven by the long terminal repeat of the human T cell leukemia virus, HTLV-1 was found to be trans-activated by both Ets1 and Ets2 in NIH3T3 and HeLa cells. The increased levels of CAT activity were paralleled by increased levels of correctly initiated CAT mRNA. Mutant Ets1 proteins unable to accumulate in the nucleus were found to be inactive. An ets-responsive sequence between positions -117 and -160 of the LTR was identified by analyses of a series of 5' deletion mutants of the HTLV-1 LTR and of dimerized versions of specific motifs of the LTR enhancer region. Using a gel shift binding assay, Ets1 was found to bind specifically to an oligonucleotide corresponding to region -117 to -160. This sequence, which also contributes to Tax1 responsiveness of the HTLV-1 LTR, is characterized by the presence of four repeats of a pentanucleotide sequence of the type CC(T/A)CC. Competition experiments show that integrity of repeats 1 and 4 is important for Ets1 binding. These results show that Ets1 and Ets2 are sequence-specific transcriptional activators. In view of the high level expression of Ets1 in lymphoid cells, Ets1 could be part of the transcription complex which mediates the response to Tax1 and the control of HTLV-1 replication. More generally, Ets1 and Ets2 could regulate transcription of cellular genes.","['Bosselut, R', 'Duvall, J F', 'Gegonne, A', 'Bailly, M', 'Hemar, A', 'Brady, J', 'Ghysdael, J']","['Bosselut R', 'Duvall JF', 'Gegonne A', 'Bailly M', 'Hemar A', 'Brady J', 'Ghysdael J']","['INSERM U186/CNRS URA 1160 Institut Pasteur, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Ets1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Trans-Activators', '*Transcription Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1990 Oct;9(10):3137-44.,,,['c-ets-1'],,,,PMC552042,,,,,,,

Therefore, seven bis(amidinohydrazones), including the two most potent inhibitors of eukaryotic AdoMetDC so far reported, were screened for antiviral activity against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The screening was performed by incubating susceptible human leukemia cells in microculture plates in the presence or absence of test compounds for 7 days and by determining the number of viable cells at the end of the test. None of the compounds screened, however, displayed any detectable antiviral activity (i.e. none of them increased the viability of virus-infected cells) in these tests whose aim was to reveal potential activity against the cytopathic effects of HIV. This result suggests that inhibitors of AdoMetDC, at least when used alone, are devoid of value for the prevention of the cytopathic effects of HIV.

The activity of this drug was compared to a similar Co(III) complex, nitro-bis(2,4-pentanedionato)(pyridine)cobalt(III) [Co(Py)], which bears a pyridine moiety mustard of bis(2-chloroethyl)amine and should have no alkylating abilities. In EMT6 cells nitro-bis(2,4- pentanedionato)(bis(2-chloroethyl)amine)cobalt(III) [Co(BCA)] was significantly more cytotoxic than Co(Py) and both drugs were more toxic toward normally oxygenated than hypoxic cells. Hyperthermia (42 degrees C, 1 h) increased the slope of the concentration-dependent survival curve for Co(BCA) but not for Co(Py) in normally oxygenated EMT6 cells. Co(BCA) was an effective radiosensitizer of hypoxic EMT6 cells in vitro, producing a dose-modifying factor of 2.40. In the human squamous cell line SCC-25 and the nitrogen mustard-resistant subline SCC-25/HN2 Co(BCA) was more cytotoxic than Co(Py), and the lethality of Co(BCA) was only minimally diminished in the SCC-25/HN2 line. In mice bearing the L1210 leukemia i.p., Co(BCA) had a broad range of therapeutically effective dosage and produced a greater than 60-day increase in life span at a dose 20-fold less than was lethally toxic.

Because of the natural progression of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to ANLL, we investigated the relationship of exposure to these carcinogens in patients with primary MDS by having 52 such patients diagnosed and referred to our center answer an occupational/environmental questionnaire. We excluded all secondary MDS patients with exposure to previous chemotherapy and radiation for a previous malignancy. In addition, we prospectively gave the same questionnaire to a similar number of age- and sex-matched comparable control patients from the same socioeconomic group based on their residence, health insurance coverage, and occupation. We found a 46% exposure rate to implicated genotoxic agents in our patients with MDS. Patients with MDS who were exposed had 75% incidence of a poor prognosis French-American-British classification compared to 57% in the nonexposed group but the difference was not significant (P = 0.089). However, the karyotypic abnormalities that were associated with exposure in ANLL were found equally in both exposed (55%) and nonexposed groups (50%) of our MDS patients and our control group had a similarly high exposure rate at 40% to genotoxins. Implicating a relationship between exposure to pesticides and solvents in ANLL and MDS is difficult. All the previous studies indicating such a relationship did not use a control group of patients. Our findings indicate the pitfalls of historical data without investigating the bias of obtaining an exposure history. However, our findings that the majority of our MDS patients came from the middle socioeconomic group which has a high exposure rate as shown by our control group indicate a relationship and that prospective follow-up of the exposed cohort of control patients should be done to determine if ANLL and MDS will increase after a latent period compared to the nonexposed controls.","['Goldberg, H', 'Lusk, E', 'Moore, J', 'Nowell, P C', 'Besa, E C']","['Goldberg H', 'Lusk E', 'Moore J', 'Nowell PC', 'Besa EC']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19129.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Mutagens)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes/*physiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/epidemiology/genetics', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Nov 1;50(21):6876-81.,,,,,['CA 42232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Thus, it has been proposed that analogues of 1,25(OH)2D3 could be synthesized which might allow for separation of biological functions, i.e., promote a differentiation of leukemia cells without a significant stimulation of ICA or BCM, both biological effects which can cause hypercalcemia in humans. Here we report the results of an evaluation of four analogues of the previously studied (Zhou et al., Blood, 74:82-92, 1989) 1 alpha,25-dihydroxy-16-ene-23-yne-vitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-D3]; these analogues allowed evaluation of the consequences of (a) the presence or absence of six deuterium atoms on carbons 26 and 27 of the side chain and (b) the deletion or substitution by a fluorine atom of the 1 alpha-hydroxyl group on the A-ring. The 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-D3 analogue was found to be 7-fold more potent than the parent 1,25(OH)2D3 with respect to (a) inhibition of clonal proliferation of HL-60 cells as well as (b) induction of differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytes. Variants of this analogue which possessed the six deuterium atoms on carbons 26 and 27 were slightly less active than the 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-yne-D3. However, replacement of the 1 alpha-hydroxyl group by a 1-fluoro group, or the absence of the 1-hydroxyl group, resulted in analogues that were somewhat less effective than the parent 1,25(OH)2D3 in achieving these biological responses but more potent as inhibitors of the renal mitochondrial 25-OH-D3-1 alpha-hydroxylase, the site of endogenous production of 1,25(OH)2D3. ICA and BCM were assessed in vivo in vitamin D-deficient chickens, and each of the analogues was markedly less potent than the standard 1,25(OH)2D3. The analogue 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-D3 had 2% of the ICA and 3% of the BCM activity of the parent 1,25(OH)2D3. Absence of the 1 alpha-hydroxyl group or substitution of the 1-fluoro group for the 1-hydroxyl group significantly diminished both the ICA and BCM activity in comparison to 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-D3. Receptor binding studies indicated that 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-D3 competed about 75% as effectively as 1,25(OH)2D3 for 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors present in both chick intestinal cells and HL-60 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Norman, A W', 'Zhou, J Y', 'Henry, H L', 'Uskokovic, M R', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Norman AW', 'Zhou JY', 'Henry HL', 'Uskokovic MR', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Biomedical Sciences, University of California, Riverside 92521.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Dihydroxycholecalciferols)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '60965-80-2 (1 alpha,24-dihydroxyvitamin D3)', 'EC 1.14.- (Steroid Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.15.15 (CYP27A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.15.15 (Cholestanetriol 26-Monooxygenase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Bone and Bones/metabolism', 'Calcification, Physiologic/drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cholestanetriol 26-Monooxygenase', 'Dihydroxycholecalciferols/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Steroid Hydroxylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Nov 1;50(21):6857-64.,,,,,"['CA-30512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['NASA: 91004053'],,

The investigational approach was to evaluate the relationship between plasma dFdC and the accumulation of dFdCTP by circulating leukemia cells during infusion of different dFdC dose rates in the same individuals. Four patients with relapsed leukemia were treated weekly with two or three consecutive infusions of 800 mg/m2, the first administered over 1 h, the second over 2 h, and the third over 3 h. Two patients, one with acute myelogenous leukemia and one with acute lymphocytic leukemia, received all three infusions, but thrombocytopenia prohibited infusion of the third dose to two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The average steady-state plasma dFdC levels, achieved within 15 min after the infusion began, were 43.8 microM during infusion of 800 mg/m2/h, 9.4 microM during infusion of 400 mg/m2/h, and 5.6 microM at 267 mg/m2/h. The median area under the concentration times time curve of dFdCTP in leukemia cells during infusion was increased 2.3- and 5.1-fold for the 2- and 3-h infusions, respectively. In vitro incubations of leukemia cells from the four patients with 2.5-100 microM dFdC for 1 h showed that the maximum cellular accumulation of dFdCTP was produced by 15-20 microM dFdC. We conclude that a dose rate of greater than 400 mg/m2/h was required to achieve plasma dFdC levels that supported the maximum rate of dFdCTP accumulation in leukemia cells.","['Grunewald, R', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Keating, M J', 'Abbruzzese, J', 'Tarassoff, P', 'Plunkett, W']","['Grunewald R', 'Kantarjian H', 'Keating MJ', 'Abbruzzese J', 'Tarassoff P', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', ""110988-86-8 (2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", '65-47-4 (Cytidine Triphosphate)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacology', 'Cytidine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacology', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/metabolism']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Nov 1;50(21):6823-6.,,,,,['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In these 2-yr inhalation studies, a potent multisite carcinogenic response was observed, including neoplasms of the lung at concentrations as low as 6.25 ppm. Early occurrence and extensive development of lethal lymphocytic lymphomas in mice exposed to 625 ppm of butadiene reduced the number of animals at risk for the expression of later developing neoplasms at other sites; at lower exposure concentrations, dose responses were demonstrated for hemangiosarcomas of the heart and neoplasms of the lung, forestomach, Harderian gland, preputial gland, liver, mammary gland, and ovary.

Normal phosphodiester (PO) and nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate (PS) oligodeoxynucleotides were compared with regard to specificity, potency, and kinetics. Both PO and PS antisense BCL2 oligodeoxynucleotides were specific inhibitors of cellular proliferation, since sense versions of these synthetic DNAs were inactive at similar concentrations. Specificity was further confirmed by quantitative immunofluorescence studies, showing that PO and PS antisense BCL2 oligodeoxynucleotides (when used at appropriate concentrations) reduced levels of BCL2 protein without influencing expression of HLA-DR and other control antigens. The onset of inhibition by PO oligodeoxynucleotides was faster, with reductions in cell numbers occurring within 1 day of addition to cultures, in contrast to phosphorothioates, which were ineffective until 3-4 days. Phosphorothioates were more potent that phosphodiesters, however, with half-maximal inhibition of leukemic cell growth occurring at concentrations 5-10 times lower. As expected from previous studies demonstrating the importance of BCL2 for regulating lymphoid cell survival, BCL2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides also led to 697 leukemic cell death through sequence-specific mechanisms, with reductions in cellular viability generally lagging the inhibitory effects on cellular growth by about 2 days.

The basic structure of the encoded proteins consists of, in addition to a leader, one IgV-like and 2, 3, or 6 IgC-like domains. These domains are followed by varying COOH-terminal regions responsible for secretion, transmembrane anchoring, or insertion into the membrane by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol tail. Here we report on the characterization of CGM6, a new member of the CEA gene subgroup, by complementary DNA cloning. The deduced coding region comprises 349 amino acids and consists of a leader, one IgV-like, two IgC-like domains, and a hydrophobic region, which is replaced by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol moiety in the mature protein.

Based on activity in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the Childrens Cancer Study Group initiated studies to evaluate idarubicin in children with leukemia in second or subsequent relapses. As part of those studies, we have characterized the plasma pharmacokinetics of idarubicin and the major circulating metabolite idarubicinol in 21 patients. Idarubicin plasma elimination was described by a three-compartment open model following i.v. infusion (10-15 mg/m2) on a schedule of weekly for 3 weeks and on a schedule of daily for 3 days every 3 weeks (total dose, 30-45 mg/m2). There was substantial variability in idarubicin elimination among patients, but no indication of dose-dependent or of schedule-dependent changes in pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean terminal half-life, total body clearance, and steady state volume of distribution were 17.6 h, 679 ml/min/m2, and 562 l/m2, respectively. Idarubicinol elimination was prolonged compared to that of the parent drug with a terminal half-life of 56.8 h. This metabolite clearly accumulated in plasma during the 3 days of treatment on the schedule of daily for 3 days. Urinary recoveries (48 h) of idarubicin and idarubicinol after a single dose of idarubicin were 2.4 and 10.1%, respectively. Idarubicin was detected in 2 of 21 cerebrospinal fluid samples obtained 18-30 h after administration. In marked contrast, idarubicinol was detected in 20 of those 21 samples.

Its biological and biochemical characteristics have been compared with a cell line, derived from the ara-C-sensitive BNML model (BNML-CL/O). Resistance to ara-C was attributed to a decrease in phosphorylation of ara-C. Deoxycytidine (dCyd) kinase activity in crude cell extracts with dCyd as substrate showed similar enzyme activities in both cell lines, whereas with ara-C as substrate no dCyd kinase activity was detectable in the ara-C-resistant cell line. Two isoenzymes of dCyd kinase with different substrate specificities have been described (Cheng, Y.C., Domin, B., and Lee, L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 481: 481-492, 1977), cytoplasmic (dCyd kinase I, substrates: dCyd and ara-C) and mitochondrial (dCyd kinase II, substrates: dCyd and thymidine). In the ara-C-sensitive BNML model, thymidine induced a reduction of dCyd kinase activity when dCyd was used as substrate. However, thymidine did not affect kinase activity with ara-C was used as substrate. In the BNML-CL/ara-C, thymidine even induces a dCyd kinase inhibition of 85% with dCyd as substrate. It is likely that the ara-C-specific dCyd kinase deficiency in BNML-CL/ara-C cells was due to a selective loss of dCyd kinase I, whereas dCyd kinase II activity remained intact.","['Richel, D J', 'Colly, L P', 'Arkesteijn, G J', 'Arentsen-Honders, M W', 'Kerster, M G', 'ter Riet, P M', 'Willemze, R']","['Richel DJ', 'Colly LP', 'Arkesteijn GJ', 'Arentsen-Honders MW', 'Kerster MG', 'ter Riet PM', 'Willemze R']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/analysis/*deficiency', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/analysis', 'Drug Resistance', 'Isoenzymes/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1990/10/15 00:00,1990/10/15 00:01,['1990/10/15 00:00'],"['1990/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Oct 15;50(20):6515-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a selective decrease in accumulation of dach-Pt in the L1210/DACH line and of en-Pt in the L1210/DDP line. Intracellular dach-Pt was incorporated into DNA to a lesser extent than en-Pt in both resistant cell lines. Cytotoxicity of en-Pt adducts was less than that of dach-Pt adducts in the L1210/DDP line, while the reverse was true in the L1210/DACH line. Increased repair was seen in both resistant cell lines; a carrier ligand effect was seen only in the L1210/DDP line, which showed a greater initial rate of repair for en-Pt than dach-Pt adducts.

This study employs an animal model to explore the induction of neurotoxicity. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats at 17 and 18 days of age were administered 18 mg/kg prednisolone, 2 mg/kg methotrexate, and 1000 cGy cranial irradiation. Another 18-day-old group was administered 1000 cGy cranial irradiation but no drugs. Matching controls received saline and/or a sham exposure to radiation. All animals at 6 weeks and 4 months of age were tested for alterations in spontaneous behavior. A computer pattern recognition system automatically recorded and classified individual behavioral acts displayed during exploration of a novel environment. Measures of behavioral initiations, total time, and time structure were used to compare treated and control animals. A permanent sex-specific change in the time structure of behavior was induced by the prednisolone, methotrexate, and radiation treatment but not by radiation alone. Unlike hyperactivity, the effect consisted of abnormal clustering and dispersion of acts in a pattern indicative of disrupted development of sexually dimorphic behavior.

Almost all cases showed high reactivity to CD23, 27, w75, 39, 40, and NuB1: expression of CD1c was very low and that of 7F7, KiB3, and CD25 was variable. The reactivity of 7F7 and KiB3 was strictly correlated, and they correlated individually with CD25. Results show that the most frequent B-CLL phenotype (CD19+, 5+, 23+, 27+, 39+, NuB1+, KiB3 +/-, 7F7 +/-, and CD25 +/-) corresponds to one or more cellular subsets in the mantle zone. No correlation was found between MoAb expression, surface immunoglobulin (SIg) class or type, clinical stage, disease activity, or age at diagnosis. The only difference (statistically borderline) was the expression of 7F7 and KiB3 (in young versus old patients).

A Pediatric Oncology Group pilot study.,1671-7,"Twenty-six evaluable children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who failed to achieve initial remission after receiving two to seven drugs for at least a 4-week period were given teniposide (VM-26) and continuous infusion cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). Twenty-two received 150 mg/m2 of VM-26 on days 1 and 2 with 100 mg/2 of Ara-C as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 5; a second shortened course was given on day 14 to eight patients who had evidence of some antileukemic effect or were clinically judged able to tolerate a second course. The last four patients received three daily doses of VM-26 and a 7-day infusion of Ara-C at the same daily dosages. Twelve (48%) achieved complete remission (CR) of ALL. There was a trend toward decreasing response rates with an increasing number of drugs used in the initial induction regimen, i.e., five CR among seven patients with a prior two-drug induction attempt, six CR among 14 patients with a prior three- to four-drug induction attempt, and one CR among four patients with a prior five- to seven-drug induction attempt (P = 0.14). Ten of 17 non-T-cell patients and two of nine T-cell patients achieved remission (P = 0.10). The median time required to achieve a complete remission from the initiation of treatment was 26 days (range, 14-72 days). This period was shorter in those who required one course compared with those who required two induction courses, i.e., 25 days median vs. 44 days median. Toxicity was significant and due mainly to marrow aplasia and infection; one patient had severe prolonged VM-26-induced hypotension. Of the 12 patients entering remission, two were removed for marrow transplant and one was removed due to parental request. In the remaining nine patients, median remission duration was only 2 months (range, 1-18 months). All nine patients relapsed in the marrow. Among the entire group of 26 patients, only one patient is alive and a long-term event-free survivor (after allogeneic marrow transplant). Due to the current use of more aggressive initial induction regimens and the extremely poor prognosis in children who fail to achieve initial remission, more intensive regimens of continuation therapy or alternative therapies, such as bone marrow transplant, should be considered.","['Ochs, J', 'Rivera, G K', 'Pollock, B H', 'Buchanan, G', 'Crist, W', 'Freeman, A I']","['Ochs J', 'Rivera GK', 'Pollock BH', 'Buchanan G', 'Crist W', 'Freeman AI']","[""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'United States']",1990/10/15 00:00,1990/10/15 00:01,['1990/10/15 00:00'],"['1990/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1990 Oct 15;66(8):1671-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19901015)66:8<1671::aid-cncr2820660803>3.0.co;2-e.,['10.1002/1097-0142(19901015)66:8<1671::aid-cncr2820660803>3.0.co;2-e [doi]'],,,,"['CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Long-term follow-up of Eastern Cooperative Group and Cancer and Leukemia Group B studies.,1621-9,"In premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, differences in survival curves early during follow-up can be misleading. The authors therefore analyzed long-term survival in 378 patients, entered in three randomized trials, started between 1973 and 1978. Combined data from the three trials were used to increase the power for identifying prognostic variables. Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial 7382 randomized patients to oophorectomy plus either cyclophosphamide or combination chemotherapy or observation. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2174 randomized patients who had not progressed 3 months after oophorectomy to combination chemotherapy or combination chemotherapy or observation. Trial ECOG 2177 randomized estrogen receptor (ER) positive or ER-unknown patients to oophorectomy plus combination chemotherapy or immediate combination chemotherapy, and ER-negative patients were directly assigned to combination chemotherapy. Hence ER-negative patients need not have been healthy enough to be randomized to oophorectomy. With only 14% of the patients still alive, median survival on the three studies was 30, 24, and 28 months. The median survival of individual treatments changed noticeably in ECOG 2174 and ECOG 2177 with long-term follow-up. At this time there are no differences in survival between randomized regimens in any of the three trials. In a multivariate model, factors associated with significantly poorer survival were visceral-dominant disease, nodal metastases, breast metastases, age younger than 45 years, ER negativity, and not receiving chemotherapy immediately after oophorectomy. This treatment difference was thus not due to imbalances in the prognostic variables used in the model, but it may be due to imbalances of unknown prognostic factors or differences in patient selection.","['Falkson, G', 'Gelman, R S', 'Leone, L', 'Falkson, C I']","['Falkson G', 'Gelman RS', 'Leone L', 'Falkson CI']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Pretoria, Republic of South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*mortality/surgery', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Ovariectomy', 'Receptors, Estrogen/analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1990 Oct 1;66(7):1621-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19901001)66:7<1621::aid-cncr2820660729>3.0.co;2-g.,['10.1002/1097-0142(19901001)66:7<1621::aid-cncr2820660729>3.0.co;2-g [doi]'],,,,"['CA 21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

However, 6 months after the transplantation the k-value (rate of glucose elimination) for this group of patients had decreased (p less than 0.01). The trend towards impaired glucose tolerance was correlated with lower peak insulin values during IVGTT (p less than 0.05).

It is unclear if PMN functional heterogeneity is secondary to maturational differences or due to distinct subpopulations of cells that possess different functional capacities. The PMN 31D8 antigen is a useful probe for evaluation of PMN subpopulations. The majority of PMNs (approximately 85%) exhibit a high intensity fluorescence after 31D8 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) labeling (31D8 enriched or ""bright"" PMNs) as determined by flow cytometric analysis. These cells are more functional than cells with low intensity fluorescence (31D8 diminished or ""dull"" PMNs). Various immunologic, clonogenic and functional techniques were used to study the expression of the 31D8 antigen in HL-60 cells and myeloid cells in order to evaluate antigenic and functional heterogeneity during morphologic maturation. The results of this study indicate that the percentage of 31D8 antigen positive (31D8 antigen enriched and diminished) bone marrow cells increases from 20 +/- 11% in myeloblast cells to 68 +/- 10% in promyelocytes, 93 +/- 2% in myelocytes and 99 +/- 1% in bands and PMNs. 31D8 antigen enriched cells first appear at the myelocyte stage (32 +/- 10%) and increase in bands (52 +/- 13%), marrow PMNs (62 +/- 13%) and peripheral blood PMNs (88 +/- 4%). These data indicate that the heterogeneous expression of 31D8 antigen in PMNs is due, at least in part, to maturational differences within the PMN population and raise the possibility that other heterogeneously expressed PMN characteristics are also maturationally derived. They also suggest that 31D8 antigenic expression may be a more precise indicator of myeloid functional maturation than maturation as identified by cellular morphology.","['Krause, P J', 'Todd, M B', 'Hancock, W W', 'Pastuszak, W T', 'Maderazo, E G', 'Hild, D H', 'Kosciol, C M']","['Krause PJ', 'Todd MB', 'Hancock WW', 'Pastuszak WT', 'Maderazo EG', 'Hild DH', 'Kosciol CM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hartford Hospital, CT 06115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/10/15 00:00,1990/10/15 00:01,['1990/10/15 00:00'],"['1990/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Oct 15;76(8):1639-46.,['S0006-4971(20)75238-9 [pii]'],,,,['CA 08341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The 45 cases were divided into del(6q) only (n = 11), del(6q) and numerical abnormalities (n = 4), del(6q) and structural abnormalities (n = 23), and 6q translocations (n = 7). The breakpoints of del(6q) were subgrouped: del(6)(q15q21) in 11 cases, del(6) (q13q21) in six, del(6)(q21q23) in four, del(6)(q15) in four, del(6)(q15q23) in three, and other deletions in 10 cases. Notably, all these deletions encompassed the 6q21 band, suggesting that this might be the locus of a recessive tumor suppressor gene, the absence of which contributes to malignant transformation or proliferation. Among the seven children with 6q translocations, a previously unidentified nonrandom translocation, t(6;12)(q21;p13) was noted in two cases with an early pre-B immunophenotype. Clinical features and event-free survival were similar among children with or without 6q abnormalities. Overall, children with 6q abnormalities were less likely than those without the abnormality to have a pre-B immunophenotype (P = .03). T-cell immunophenotypes were equally represented in cases with or without 6q abnormalities. However, all four children with del(6q) and a 12p abnormality had early pre-B ALL and all three children with del(6q) and a 9p abnormality had a T-cell immunophenotype. The lack of specificity for a particular immunophenotype may imply that the gene or genes affected by 6q abnormalities are broadly active in the multistep process of lymphoid leukemogenesis. The relatively high frequency of microscopically visible del(6q) indicates the need for molecular studies to identify cases with submicroscopic deletions.","['Hayashi, Y', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Look, A T', 'Behm, F G', 'Kitchingman, G R', 'Pui, C H', 'Rivera, G K', 'Williams, D L']","['Hayashi Y', 'Raimondi SC', 'Look AT', 'Behm FG', 'Kitchingman GR', 'Pui CH', 'Rivera GK', 'Williams DL']","[""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1990/10/15 00:00,1990/10/15 00:01,['1990/10/15 00:00'],"['1990/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Oct 15;76(8):1626-30.,['S0006-4971(20)75236-5 [pii]'],,,,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Using two sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for IL-1 beta and GM-CSF, we document in the present study that the production of the two cytokines by AML blasts in culture is coordinated. First, we observe a striking correlation between the levels of GM-CSF and IL-1 beta released by the cells. Thus, a high production of IL-1 beta is always concordant with a high production of GM-CSF and, conversely, low production of IL-1 beta is concordant with low levels of GM-CSF. Second, neutralization of intrinsic IL-1 using antibodies that are specific for IL-1 alpha and -1 beta suppresses the release of GM-CSF by the cells. Third, neutralization of the endogenous source of IL-1 also results in an abrogation of GM-CSF mRNA. Fourth, the production of both IL-1 beta and GM-CSF is up-regulated by exposing AML blasts to an exogenous source of IL-1, suggesting a positive regulation of autocrine growth factor production. Taken together, our results indicate that GM-CSF production by AML blasts is mediated by endogenously produced IL-1. Both IL-1 beta and -1 alpha are produced by AML blasts, although IL-1 beta appears to be more abundant. Spontaneous colony formation by AML blasts is abrogated by the addition of neutralizing antibodies against IL-1 beta and GM-CSF, whereas each antibody alone has little effect on blast proliferation. Taken together, our results are consistent with the view that the production of IL-1 beta by AML blasts supports autocrine growth in culture, through induction of CSFs or other cytokines that stimulate blast proliferation.","['Rodriguez-Cimadevilla, J C', 'Beauchemin, V', 'Villeneuve, L', 'Letendre, F', 'Shaw, A', 'Hoang, T']","['Rodriguez-Cimadevilla JC', 'Beauchemin V', 'Villeneuve L', 'Letendre F', 'Shaw A', 'Hoang T']","['Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Hotel-Dieu Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*blood/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/blood/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/10/15 00:00,1990/10/15 00:01,['1990/10/15 00:00'],"['1990/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Oct 15;76(8):1481-9.,['S0006-4971(20)75217-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities have been correlated with leukemic cell lineage, the degree of cell differentiation, and the specific gene involved at the molecular level. Many cytogenetic findings have prognostic significance; however, the adverse influence of certain changes, including most chromosomal translocations, may in fact be offset by the greater cytoreductive effects of intensified therapy. Table 4 summarizes the relation of selected karyotypic findings to treatment outcome in patients treated on contemporary protocols. Among all of the chromosomal abnormalities identified in childhood ALL, hyperdiploidy greater than 50 has been associated with the most favorable prognosis. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the treatment outcome for patients with classical Ph+ or hypodiploid ALL is very poor even in programs of intensive chemotherapy; alternative treatment such as bone marrow transplantation should be considered for such patients. Cases with the t(4;11)(q21;q23) also have a very poor clinical outcome, but the adverse prognosis may be limited to the infant or adolescent age groups. The prognostic significance of other nonrandom translocations, such as t(1;19)(q23;p13) and several other abnormalities, needs to be further assessed in larger numbers of patients.

B-CLL LAK cells exhibited greater proliferative capacity than did normal LAK cells. When normal LAK cells were grown in B-CLL serum instead of NHS, their proliferation increased; NK cell levels also increased to those found in B-CLL LAK cells, suggesting that B-CLL serum contains a factor that promotes NK cell-like growth, LAK cells derived from normal or B-CLL patients demonstrated similar lytic activity toward K562 and Raji cells. Growth in B-CLL serum did not reduce their lytic potential. Thus, the altered phenotype and growth exhibited by B-CLL LAK cells and normal LAK cells grown in B-CLL serum does not lead to abnormalities in their cytolytic functions. We propose instead that the predominance of NK-like cells in B-CLL LAK cell populations and the presence of an NK cell-like growth factor in B-CLL serum reflect abnormalities related to NK cell-mediated B-cell regulation; ie, either inhibition of normal B-cell growth and/or growth stimulation of the leukemic clone in B-CLL.","['Santiago-Schwarz, F', 'Panagiotopoulos, C', 'Sawitsky, A', 'Rai, K R']","['Santiago-Schwarz F', 'Panagiotopoulos C', 'Sawitsky A', 'Rai KR']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Long Island Jewish Medical Center, New Hyde Park, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Blood Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology/*pathology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Stem Cells/pathology/physiology/ultrastructure']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Oct 1;76(7):1355-60.,['S0006-4971(20)75310-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

While in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) the depressed natural killer function could be restored after a 7-day incubation with recombinant interleukin (IL-2), B-CLL mononuclear cells showed a reduced LAK activity compared with normal LAK cells. Furthermore, in all but 1 of the 20 B-CLL samples tested the leukemic cells were totally resistant to autologous LAK effectors. In most cases the leukemic cells were also resistant to normal allogeneic LAK cells. Competition experiments demonstrated that the patients' LAK cells, as well as normal LAK effectors, were capable of recognizing B-CLL cells, pointing, therefore, to a postbinding cytolytic defect. In hairy cell leukemia (HCL) an overall reduced LAK activity against allogeneic targets was documented, but, at variance from B-CLL, hairy cells were often susceptible to the lytic effect of normal LAK cells, and in half of the cases tested the neoplastic population was also sensitive in an autologous system. Similarly to B-CLL, in the great majority of T chronic lymphoproliferative disorders studied, the pathologic cells were resistant to normal and autologous LAK effectors and a defective LAK generation was found. These results demonstrate that in most B and T chronic leukemias the LAK function is defective and, when inducible, does not appear directed against the leukemic population.

Direct effects of rEp on EM colony, megakaryocyte colony, and erythroid burst formation were confirmed by depletion of accessory cells such as T cells, B cells, and macrophages from crude bone marrow cells, and inhibition of the colonies by the addition of rabbit anti-rEp antibody to the culture in a dose-dependent fashion. Replating experiments were performed to confirm the differentiating ability of blast cell colonies grown in the presence of rEp. Most of the blast cell colonies yielded not only secondary erythroid colonies but also megakaryocyte colonies in the presence of 2 IU/mL rEp. Some of the blast cell colonies produced secondary EM colonies in the presence of 16 IU/ml rEp of 2 IU/mL rEp plus interleukin-3, although no granulocyte-macrophage colonies were found in the secondary culture.

We have developed a simple procedure to quantitatively purify Ep from serum and plasma for subsequent testing in the phenylhydrazine-treated mouse spleen cell assay. The method involves absorption of Ep to an immobilized high-affinity anti-Ep monoclonal antibody and acid elution of the antibody-bound material. After neutralization, the eluted EP is then tested directly in the in vitro bioassay without interference by other serum proteins. By using magnetic beads as a solid support for the antibody, washing and elution steps can be performed rapidly and efficiently. Recoveries of Ep after this procedure show very little sample-to-sample variation and are consistently between 45% and 55%, which is close to the maximum binding expected for the anti-Ep antibody. Coupled with the 7.4-fold concentration that this procedure affords, there is an overall increase in sensitivity of three- to fourfold, which makes this assay suitable for accurately measuring Ep levels in patients with below-average titers. Results with this magnetic bead assay indicate that accurate and reproducible estimates for Ep levels in the serum and plasma from healthy donors as well as from patients with hematologic disorders can be obtained. Titers of biologically active Ep in the sera from a group of patients with either leukemia or lymphoma were found to be elevated, and the values correlated well with titers of immunoreactive Ep measured in the Ep radioimmunoassay. Because of its specificity and high sensitivity, the magnetic bead assay is a valuable alternative to immunoassays for the measurement of elevated, normal, and even subnormal Ep levels in human serum and plasma.","['Wognum, A W', 'Lam, V', 'Goudsmit, R', 'Krystal, G']","['Wognum AW', 'Lam V', 'Goudsmit R', 'Krystal G']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, Cancer Control Agency of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody Affinity/immunology', 'Biological Assay/*methods', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Erythropoietin/analysis/*blood/immunology', 'Hematologic Diseases/blood', 'Humans', 'Magnetics', 'Plasma/*chemistry', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Spleen/cytology']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Oct 1;76(7):1323-9.,['S0006-4971(20)75305-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of normal bone marrow colony formation by IL-3 was much less sensitive to TGF-beta 1, and there was little or no effect of TGF-beta 1 on colony formation induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF). In different clones of myeloid leukemic cells, TGF-beta 1 suppressed differentiation induced with IL-6, IL-1 alpha, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but did not suppress differentiation induced with IL-3 or GM-CSF. The effect of TGF-beta 1 on differentiation of the leukemic cells can be dissociated from its effect on cell growth. TGF-beta 1 suppressed the production of IL-6 in normal bone marrow cells cultured with IL-1 alpha and the production of IL-6 and GM-CSF in leukemic cells cultured with IL-1 alpha or LPS. The suppression of IL-6 production can explain the suppression by TGF-beta 1 of the effects of IL-1 alpha and LPS that are mediated by IL-6. TGF-beta 1 also suppressed differentiation in clones of myeloid leukemic cells induced with differentiation factor/leukemia inhibitory factor and tumor necrosis factor.

Drug binding constants (KS) are 15,000 and 9800 M-1 for plasma membranes from drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells, respectively. Drug binding to the membranes is not affected by either (i) thermal denaturation of membrane proteins or (ii) proteolytic treatment with trypsin, thus suggesting that the protein components of the membranes do not have a major role in determining the observed drug binding. Also, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between tryptophan and daunomycin in the membranes indicates that interaction of protein components with the drug should not be responsible for the observed differences in drug binding exhibited by plasma membranes from drug-sensitive and -resistant cells. Plasma membranes from drug-sensitive cells contain more phosphatidylserine and slightly less cholesterol than membranes from drug-resistant cells. Differences in the content of the acidic phospholipid between the two plasma membranes seem to produce a different ionic environment at membrane surface domains, as indicated by titration of a membrane-incorporated, pH-sensitive fluorescence probe. The possible role of membrane lipids in modulating drug binding to the membranes was tested in equilibrium binding studies using model lipid vesicles made from phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol in different proportions. The presence of phosphatidylserine greatly increases both the affinity and the stoichiometry of daunomycin binding to model lipid vesicles. The similarity between the effects of phosphatidylserine and other negatively charged compounds such as dicetyl phosphate, cardiolipin, or phosphatidic acid suggests that electrostatic interactions are important in the observed binding of the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Escriba, P V', 'Ferrer-Montiel, A V', 'Ferragut, J A', 'Gonzalez-Ros, J M']","['Escriba PV', 'Ferrer-Montiel AV', 'Ferragut JA', 'Gonzalez-Ros JM']","['Department of Neurochemistry, School of Medicine, University of Alicante, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Phospholipids)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Liposomes', 'Membrane Lipids/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Phospholipids/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism']",1990/08/07 00:00,1990/08/07 00:01,['1990/08/07 00:00'],"['1990/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/07 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1990 Aug 7;29(31):7275-82. doi: 10.1021/bi00483a017.,['10.1021/bi00483a017 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

ER were detected in 6/7 ALL patients with values ranging between 133 and 2268 sites/cell and in 12/16 AML patients with values ranging between 274 and 4197 sites/cell. The apparent dissociation constant (KD) for ER was 0.6 +/- 0.3 nM (mean + SD of 20 cases). All blasts from ALL and AML patients expressed type II EBS at variable levels ranging between 3109 and 239450 sites/cell. The mean KD value for these sites was 18.3 +/- 5.6 nM (mean +/- SD of 23 cases). Specificity experiments demonstrated that type II EBS are oestrogen specific relative to the class of steroid hormones. In addition, the flavonol quercetin was able to compete for [3H]17 beta-oestradiol (E2) binding to type II EBS, the relative binding affinity (RBA) of quercetin being greater than that of diethylstillboestrol (DES). DES and quercetin exerted a dose-dependent inhibition of ALL and AML blast proliferation in the range of concentrations between 10(-8) and 10(-5) M. The RBA of DES and quercetin for type II EBS correlated well with their potency as cell growth inhibitors. Moreover, the flavonols rutin and hesperidin which compete slightly for [3H]E2 binding to type II EBS, were scarcely effective in inhibiting leukaemic cell proliferation.

A survey of responses in 31 cases with cytogenetic determination of neoplastic status of cultured cells in 17 studies.,476-84,"Alterations in neoplastic cell behaviour responsible for increased production of terminally-differentiated granulocytes during long-term culture of bone marrow in different categories of acute leukaemia and myelodysplasia have been investigated. An increase in neutrophils associated with transition to a morphological picture identical to normal control cultures occurred in 15 of 25 studies on acute leukaemia in contrast to one of six studies on myelodysplastic disorders. An abnormal neoplastic karyotype was employed as a marker for monitoring the course of the neoplastic cell population in 11 studies in which there was progression towards a normal pattern of differentiation. An increase in differentiation was shown by this means to represent increased maturation of cells of the neoplastic process in one study on a myelodysplastic disorder, demonstrating domination of proliferative activity in culture by all of the myelodysplastic disorders examined. Transition towards normal differentiation in nine studies on acute leukaemia, however, correlated with partial or complete replacement of the acute leukaemic cells by normal haemopoietic series in de novo acute leukaemia, and by Ph positive cells in blast crisis of CML. Conversion to morphologically and cytogenetically normal cell populations in five studies on de novo acute leukaemia occurred in four cases which failed to respond to remission-induction therapy, suggesting the selective toxic effect capable of purging acute leukaemic cells from bone marrow operated by a mechanism which lacked cross-resistance to currently-employed cytotoxic agents.","['Firkin, F C', 'Birner, R', 'Russell, S H', 'Garson, O M']","['Firkin FC', 'Birner R', 'Russell SH', 'Garson OM']","['University of Melbourne, Department of Medicine, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Aug;75(4):476-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07785.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07785.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

CR was achieved in 36/54 (67%) patients, response correlating favourably with younger age (15-30 years vs 31-57 years, P = 0.02). Three patients died in CR. Overall, there was no difference in survival or remission duration between patients who received high dose ara-C and those in the control group. However, in contrast to the early results, there was a reversal in the relevance of the prognostic factors with a trend in favour of high blast count (greater than 10 x 10(9) 1(-1)) and T-cell phenotype in terms of remission duration. Moreover, comparison of duration of remission for the previously defined prognostic groups according to therapy suggests that the prognosis of patients with 'high risk' disease (T, B, null ALL or high blast count) is improved with more intensive therapy. In contrast, those with 'low risk' disease (C-ALL and low blast count) have a better prognosis with less intensive therapy. These observations confirm those of others and allow for individualization of therapy on the basis of pre-treatment variables.","['Rohatiner, A Z', 'Bassan, R', 'Battista, R', 'Barnett, M J', 'Gregory, W', 'Lim, J', 'Amess, J', 'Oza, A', 'Barbui, T', 'Horton, M']","['Rohatiner AZ', 'Bassan R', 'Battista R', 'Barnett MJ', 'Gregory W', 'Lim J', 'Amess J', 'Oza A', 'Barbui T', 'Horton M', 'et al.']","[""ICRF Department of Medical Oncology, St Bartholowmew's Hospital, West Smithfield, London, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'HEAVD protocol', 'OPAL protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1990 Sep;62(3):454-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1990.317.,['10.1038/bjc.1990.317 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC1971462,,,,,,,

The four cell lines used were the K562 human leukaemia cell line, its adriamycin (ADM)-resistant subline (K562/ADM), which shows the mdr phenotype, PC-9 (a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line) and its cisplatin (CDDP)-resistant subline (PC-9/CDDP), which does not show the mdr phenotype. Phorbol 12-tetradecanoate-13-acetate (TPA) and the TPA-type tumour promoters, aplysiatoxin and debromoaplysiatoxin, inhibited the growth of the two parental cell lines, K562 and PC-9. The non-TPA-type tumour promoter, okadaic acid, also inhibited the growth of the two parental cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. TPA-type and okadaic acid inhibited the growth of K562/ADM more weakly than that of K562, and showed no growth inhibition in PC-9/CDDP. Anhydrodebromoaplysiatoxin, an inactive derivative of the TPA-type tumour promoter, could suppress the growth of K562 and K562/ADM only at high concentration (more than 50 pM) and it showed similar growth inhibitory effects on the two cell lines. Okadaic acid tetramethyl ether, the inactive form of the non-TPA-type tumour promoter did not inhibit the growth of any of the cell lines. The growth inhibitory effect of these compounds was well correlated with their tumour-promoting activity. A study of the accumulation of okadaic acid revealed that the amount of 3H-okadaic acid in K562/ADM and PC-9/CDDP was similar to that in their parental cells indicating that cross-resistance to this tumour promoter in the drug-resistant cell lines is not due to a difference in the amount of drug accumulated in sensitive and resistant cells. These results suggest the presence of another common mechanism for resistance to ADM and CDDP as well as to TPA- or non-TPA-type tumour promoters.","['Nishio, K', 'Sugimoto, Y', 'Nakagawa, K', 'Niimi, S', 'Fujiwara, Y', 'Bungo, M', 'Kasahara, K', 'Fujiki, H', 'Saijo, N']","['Nishio K', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Nakagawa K', 'Niimi S', 'Fujiwara Y', 'Bungo M', 'Kasahara K', 'Fujiki H', 'Saijo N']","['Pharmacology Division, National Cancer Centre Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Lyngbya Toxins)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '52423-28-6 (debromoaplysiatoxin)', '52659-57-1 (aplysiatoxin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Cisplatin/*therapeutic use', 'Cross Reactions', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance/*physiology', 'Ethers, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Lyngbya Toxins/pharmacology', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1990 Sep;62(3):415-9. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1990.309.,['10.1038/bjc.1990.309 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC1971464,,,,,,,

Since this was explained only partially by the somewhat greater antitumor activity of EDX, this result may also reflect a difference in biochemical phenotypes selected in each case. Among 20 sublines selected for resistance to MTX, a reduction in influx, an elevation of DHFR, and a reduction of DHFR inhibition by MTX were all delineated. Among 14 sublines selected for resistance to EDX, both a reduction in influx and an elevation in level of DHFR were also commonly found. In addition, however, 7 of 14 EDX-resistant sublines exhibited a reduction in the level of folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity. Clonal derivatives of these 7 EDX-resistant cell lines exhibited 2- to 28-fold reductions in FPGS activity and a commensurate reduction in [3H]-MTX polyglutamate formation in situ following exposure to [3H]-MTX during growth in mice. An analysis of the kinetics and relative substrate preferences for FPGS from variant and parental L1210 cells revealed that the various changes in FPGS activity were at the level of the Vmax rather than Km.

A 1.5 T whole body magnetic resonance scanner was used. Twenty of the patients had follow-up examinations in relation to chemotherapy. Bone marrow biopsies from the posterior iliac crest were obtained within a short time interval of all MR examinations. At the time of diagnosis, T1 relaxation times were increased significantly in all the leukemic patients, compared with 24 age-matched controls. A decrease in T1 relaxation time towards or into the normal range was observed in 10 patients who obtained remission. The T1 relaxation time remained prolonged in 6 patients who failed to obtain remission during chemotherapy. Four patients, who obtained remission with concomitant decrease of T1 values towards or into the normal range, also showed prolongation of T1 relaxation time in relation to leukemic relapse. The results indicate that changes observed in T1 relaxation times of the hemopoietic bone marrow in patients with acute leukemia reflect changes in disease activity, and, that serial measurements of T1 values may provide clinically useful information with the possibility for identification of residual disease in regions inaccessible for biopsy.","['Jensen, K E', 'Grundtvig Sorensen, P', 'Thomsen, C', 'Christoffersen, P', 'Henriksen, O', 'Karle, H']","['Jensen KE', 'Grundtvig Sorensen P', 'Thomsen C', 'Christoffersen P', 'Henriksen O', 'Karle H']","['Department of Magnetic Resonance, Hvidovre Hospital, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Acta Radiol,"Acta radiologica (Stockholm, Sweden : 1987)",8706123,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Radiol. 1990 Jul;31(4):361-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An epidemiological perspective.,647-55,"Both ionizing radiation and alkylating chemicals are used to treat cancer, and both are themselves carcinogenic. Epidemiological methods of study have provided a substantial amount of information on the long-term risks of the two types of treatment. Radiotherapy appears to increase the risk of a wide range of cancers, but the size of the increase is not substantial. Chemotherapy, in contrast, produces a very large increase in the risk of acute leukaemia, and does not generally appear to produce other types of cancer. Leukaemias following both treatment modalities appear rapidly, while the risk of solid tumours induced by radiotherapy is not manifested until a decade or more has elapsed. There does not seem to be synergy between the two types of therapy in their carcinogenic action.

However, agricultural workers have elevated risks for several specific cancer types including leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and cancers of the lip, stomach, prostate, brain, and connective tissue. Two major groups of risk factors have been proposed as causes of hematologic malignancies in agricultural workers. The first group includes various agricultural chemicals. In particular, several studies have found increased risks of malignant lymphoma and soft tissue sarcoma in persons exposed to phenoxy herbicides. However, the evidence is inconsistent and there is a wide variation in relative risk estimates. The second group of risk factors includes various animal viruses. There is currently little evidence concerning the zoonotic nature or human carcinogenicity of these viruses. However, leads have been suggested by recent evidence of increased risks of hematologic malignancies in abattoir workers, veterinarians, and meat inspectors. A third hypothesis, for which little evidence is currently available, is that agricultural work may involve prolonged antigenic stimulus leading to lymphoproliferation. The factors responsible for the increased risks for cancers other than hematologic malignancies are not well understood but may also involve exposure to chemicals or viruses.","['Pearce, N', 'Reif, J S']","['Pearce N', 'Reif JS']","['University of Otago, Department of Medicine, Wellington School of Medicine, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Abattoirs', ""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*epidemiology"", 'Animals', 'Animals, Domestic', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Pesticides/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Zoonoses']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1990;18(2):133-48. doi: 10.1002/ajim.4700180206.,['10.1002/ajim.4700180206 [doi]'],,,87,,,,,,,,,,

In a population of 21 consecutive patients 50% responded to tiazofurin treatment, confirming the usefulness of this therapy in end-stage leukemia. 2. In leukemic patients treated with tiazofurin and allopurinol reciprocal action was manifested in the increase in hypoxanthine and the decrease in uric acid concentrations in the plasma. On discontinuation of allopurinol, hypoxanthine levels steeply declined but uric acid concentration increased slowly, taking days to reach pretreatment level. 3. With a new and sensitive method the concentration of the active metabolite of tiazofurin, TAD, was measured in the mononuclear cells of tiazofurin-treated patients. Approximately 5 to 13% of the plasma tiazofurin level was observed as TAD in the mononuclear cells. This TAD concentration was sufficient to account for the inhibition of IMP DH in these cells. 4. Tiazofurin or retinoic acid caused differentiation of HL-60 leukemic cells and inhibition of cell proliferation. 5. By treating leukemic cells incubated with tiazofurin or retinoic acid also with guanosine it was elucidated that the mechanism of the two drugs differed since only the tiazofurin effects were counteracted by guanosine. 6. Tiazofurin and retinoic acid together in HL-60 cells provided synergistic impact on differentiation and cytotoxicity. 7. Tiazofurin resulted in down-regulation of the expression of ras and myc oncogenes in three systems: K562 human erythroleukemic cells, rat hepatoma 3924A cells and human HL-60 leukemia cells. 8. Because both tiazofurin and retinoic acid are licensed drugs, their potential use in combination chemotherapy may have clinical relevance in the treatment of end-stage leukemia where our earlier studies have demonstrated the usefulness of tiazofurin.","['Weber, G', 'Yamaji, Y', 'Nagai, M', 'Natsumeda, Y', 'Jayaram, H N', 'Zhen, W N', 'Paulik, E']","['Weber G', 'Yamaji Y', 'Nagai M', 'Natsumeda Y', 'Jayaram HN', 'Zhen WN', 'Paulik E']","['Laboratory for Experimental Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5200.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Synergism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Oncogenes/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*drug effects', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Ribonucleosides/*therapeutic use', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1990;30:35-45. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(90)90007-o.,['10.1016/0065-2571(90)90007-o [doi]'],,,15,"['5 SO7 RR5371/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The first problem is to get the protective antigen into a submicroscopic particle where the antigen is presented in several copies, i.e. as a multimer. For some antigens it seems also necessary to enhance the immunogenicity with an adjuvant. The immunostimulating complex (iscom) was created to fulfil these criteria by assembling antigens in a multimeric form on a matrix with built-in adjuvant to form a particle. The components are held together by hydrophobic interactions. The iscom has turned out to be highly immunogenic, inducing high antibody mediated and cell-mediated immunity including cytotoxic T cell response to influenza virus. In a mouse model iscoms containing influenza virus envelope proteins induced protective immunity by one intranasal administration. Protective immunity was also induced to a retrovirus--feline leukemia virus. In a monkey model system iscoms containing gp360 of Epstein-Barr virus induced protection to induction of tumours. Iscoms have also been used as carriers for small molecules such as oligopeptides, which combination appeared to be highly immunogenic.","['Morein, B']",['Morein B'],"['Department of Virology, National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['*Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/*immunology']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 1990 Jun;23(1-4):79-84. doi: 10.1016/0378-1135(90)90138-l.,"['0378-1135(90)90138-L [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1135(90)90138-l [doi]']",,,17,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, abnormally high expression of proteasomes may play an important role in transformation and proliferation of blood cells and in specific functions of hematopoietic tumor cells.","['Kumatori, A', 'Tanaka, K', 'Inamura, N', 'Sone, S', 'Ogura, T', 'Matsumoto, T', 'Tachikawa, T', 'Shin, S', 'Ichihara, A']","['Kumatori A', 'Tanaka K', 'Inamura N', 'Sone S', 'Ogura T', 'Matsumoto T', 'Tachikawa T', 'Shin S', 'Ichihara A']","['Institute for Enzyme Research, School of Medicine, University of Tokushima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bone Marrow/*enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cross Reactions', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoelectrophoresis', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/pathology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multienzyme Complexes/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",1990/09/01 00:00,2000/06/01 09:00,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Sep;87(18):7071-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.18.7071.,['10.1073/pnas.87.18.7071 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC54685,,,,,,,

We report here high frequency of woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA integrations in two newly identified N-myc genes: N-myc1, the homologue of known mammalian N-myc genes, and N-myc2, an intronless 'complementary DNA gene' or 'retroposon' that has retained extensive coding and transforming homology with N-myc. N-myc2 is totally silent in normal liver, but is overexpressed without genetic rearrangements in most liver tumours. Moreover, viral integrations occur within either N-myc1 or N-myc2 in about 20% of the tumours, giving rise to chimaeric messenger RNAs in which the 3' untranslated region of N-myc was replaced by woodchuck hepatitis virus sequences encompassing the viral enhancer. Insertion sites were clustered in a short sequence of the third exon that coincides with a retroviral integration hotspot within the murine N-myc gene, recently described in T-cell lymphomas induced by murine leukaemia virus. Thus, comparable mechanisms, leading to deregulated expression of N-myc genes, may operate in the development of tumours induced either by hepatitis virus or by nonacute retroviruses in rodents. Activation of myc genes by insertion of hepadnavirus DNA now emerges as a common event in the genesis of woodchuck hepatocellular carcinoma.","['Fourel, G', 'Trepo, C', 'Bougueleret, L', 'Henglein, B', 'Ponzetto, A', 'Tiollais, P', 'Buendia, M A']","['Fourel G', 'Trepo C', 'Bougueleret L', 'Henglein B', 'Ponzetto A', 'Tiollais P', 'Buendia MA']","['Unite de Recombinaison et Expression Genetique (INSERM U.163, CNRS URA 271), Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Exons', '*Gene Expression', 'Hepadnaviridae/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/*microbiology', '*Marmota/genetics/microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'RNA Splicing', 'Rats', '*Sciuridae/genetics/microbiology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1990/09/20 00:00,1990/09/20 00:01,['1990/09/20 00:00'],"['1990/09/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/20 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1990 Sep 20;347(6290):294-8. doi: 10.1038/347294a0.,['10.1038/347294a0 [doi]'],,,,,['Nature. 1990 Sep 20;347(6290):230-2.

However, while much progress has been made in areas of metabolism and pharmacokinetics, further studies would be worthwhile to improve mechanistic understanding such as the examination of alternate metabolic pathways, the generation of interspecies scaling factors, and an assessment of the relevance of various tumor sites. In this respect, data pertaining to repeated and pulse exposures of rodents and primates would be helpful. Another important aspect is the need to understand any human health implications of the observed 1,3-butadiene-induction of the murine leukemia virus. In this respect, studies have been pursued that include the comparison of leukemogenesis in congenetic strains, the leukemogenicity of viral isolates in rodent carcinogenicity and human cell culture studies, and the mechanisms of activation of ecotropic proviral sequences. Molecular epidemiological and toxicological research is ongoing in rodents and primates to evaluate hemoglobin adduct formation as an index of 1,3-butadiene exposure. Challenges of specificity, sensitivity, and simplification of current procedures need to be overcome. Recent mutagenicity and metabolism data suggest that structurally-related isoprene may have carcinogenic potential.

To assess the possible human carcinogenicity of 1,3-butadiene, a critical review was undertaken of the epidemiologic literature. An early retrospective study of 8017 males employed in tire manufacturing found excess mortality for lymphatic and hematopoietic neoplasms in production workers (standardized mortality ratio, SMR = 560); these workers were exposed to 1,3-butadiene as well as to styrene and possibly to benzene. A recently updated epidemiologic study of 2568 workers at a butadiene manufacturing plant in Texas reported low mortality overall (SMR = 84) but found excess deaths for lymphosarcoma and reticulum cell sarcoma (SMR = 229). A retrospective study of workers employed at two synthetic rubber plants in Texas found excess mortality for lymphatic and hematopoietic malignancies in the older of these facilities; the excesses for lymphosarcoma (SMR = 224) and leukemia (SMR = 278) were most significant in wartime workers. A large, recently updated retrospective study of 12,113 workers employed in eight synthetic rubber manufacturing plants in the United States and Canada found excess mortality for lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer in production workers; the SMR for other lymphatic cancers in white production workers was 230, and the SMR for all lymphatic malignancies in black production workers was 507. These updated epidemiologic results strongly suggest an etiologic association between occupational exposure to 1,3-butadiene and human cancer. It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that there now exists at least limited evidence for the human carcinogenicity of 1,3-butadiene.","['Landrigan, P J']",['Landrigan PJ'],"['Division of Environmental and Occupational Medicine, Mt.

Review of the literature demonstrates that much of the data are incomplete. Most reports contain small numbers of patients, making analysis of any particular regimen difficult to assess. The morbidity and mortality of the procedure appear to be substantially less than that seen in the allogeneic setting. The major complications relate to problems with engraftment. Recovery of platelet production to normal levels is frequently cited as delayed, and in some patients, does not occur. This phenomenon may be heightened by marrow manipulation during purging or posttransplant drug therapy. It is not known if this is a problem related to stem cells or related to the changes in the hematopoietic microenvironment. The results of autologous bone marrow transplantation for patients with acute myeloid leukemia suggest that, as with standard chemotherapy, there is little survival benefit when patients are in relapse at the time of transplantation. There are few long-term survivors, and relapse within 5 months is the rule. It should be noted that the vast majority of the studies reported here have used marrow that has not been treated in an attempt to remove occult leukemia cells. The use of purged bone marrow has not yet been adequately studied. In patients in second or subsequent remission, ABMT appears to offer a chance for long-term survival not seen with present second-line standard chemotherapy regimens and should be considered a viable option for patients under the age of 55. The results to date do not define whether marrow purging is beneficial, and most studies being carried out at the present time are not evaluating this question. The majority of studies are examining different methods of purging. The result of our study in patients in second and third remission using in vitro purging of bone marrow with monoclonal antibodies PM-81 and AML2-23 are encouraging, as are the studies of purging with 4-HC. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B has just begun a study for patients with AML in second remission using the protocol we piloted at Dartmouth. We are also evaluating the feasibility of using this therapy in patients at the time of first relapse, as studies in the allogeneic setting have suggested the results are similar to those achieved in second remission (60).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Mills, L E', 'Cornwell, G G 3rd', 'Ball, E D']","['Mills LE', 'Cornwell GG 3rd', 'Ball ED']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Invest. 1990;8(2):181-90. doi: 10.3109/07357909009017564.,['10.3109/07357909009017564 [doi]'],,,61,,,,,,,,,,

None of the six Ph1-/BCR- CML patients had mutations in the RAS oncogenes, while 17 of 30 (57%) of the CMML patients had RAS oncogene mutations. Eighty percent of the mutations involved substitution of aspartic acid for glycine (G----A) in the 12th or 13th codons of N-ras or K-ras. Furthermore, although not statistically significant, survival studies raise the possibility of shortened survival in patients with RAS oncogene point mutations, with the average survival being 33 months for Ph1-/BCR- CML, 35 months for CMML without point mutations, and 11 months for CMML with RAS mutations. Thus, RAS mutations appear to be associated with CMML and not Ph1-/BCR- chronic phase CML, there is a high propensity for the K-ras or N-ras mutations to involve an G----A substitution in the 12th or 13th codons, and RAS mutations in CMML may relate to prognosis and require further studies.","['Hirsch-Ginsberg, C', 'LeMaistre, A C', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Talpaz, M', 'Cork, A', 'Freireich, E J', 'Trujillo, J M', 'Lee, M S', 'Stass, S A']","['Hirsch-Ginsberg C', 'LeMaistre AC', 'Kantarjian H', 'Talpaz M', 'Cork A', 'Freireich EJ', 'Trujillo JM', 'Lee MS', 'Stass SA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Texas M.

The virus which was used in this experiment, FV, is highly immunogenic and does not normally cause disease in an adult rat. At first, we induced a FV viremia in tumor bearing rats in order to deliver the virus to the site of the tumor cells. FV viremia was induced by injecting 60 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (CY) i.v. after the administration of FV, and by transferring syngeneic bone marrow cells so that FV would be able to infect them and then replicate. In order that the tumor cells which were infected with virus should regress, it was necessary to break down their tolerance to FV antigens. As adoptive immunotherapy we therefore, transferred syngeneic spleen cells from rats which had been immunized with FV to tumor bearing rats. The result of this experiment was that these tumor bearing rats infected with FV which had received either normal syngeneic spleen cells or no spleen cells as controls died from liver metastasis (8 out of 9 rats (89%) and 15 out of 17 (88%) respectively). On the other hand, only 4 out of the 15 (27%) tumor bearing rats which were infected with FV and which received FV-immune spleen cells died from liver metastasis. These sets of data indicate that the in vivo xenogenization of tumor cells are indeed able to induce the regression of metastatic tumor cells.","['Suzuki, Y', 'Okayasu, T', 'Morikawa, K', 'Hamada, J', 'Sugawara, M', 'Oikawa, T', 'Hosokawa, M', 'Kobayashi, H']","['Suzuki Y', 'Okayasu T', 'Morikawa K', 'Hamada J', 'Sugawara M', 'Oikawa T', 'Hosokawa M', 'Kobayashi H']","['Laboratory of Pathology, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biotherapy,"Biotherapy (Dordrecht, Netherlands)",8903031,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/secondary/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biotherapy. 1990;2(1):41-9. doi: 10.1007/BF02172075.,['10.1007/BF02172075 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The formation of BABQ-glutathione adducts was demonstrated in vitro for the BABQ parent compound (TW13), triaziquone (2,3,5-tris(1-aziridinyl)-1,4-benzoquinone) and for BABQ derivatives containing halogen substituents. The clinically-used BABQ derivative diaziquone (AZQ; 2,5-bis(1-aziridinyl)-3,6-bis(ethoxycarbonylamino)-1,4-benzoquinon e) did not react with glutathione. TW13 and triaziquone markedly inactivated bacteriophage M13-DNA in the presence of glutathione. This inactivation is probably produced by reductive activation of the BABQ derivative to a DNA-alkylating semiquinone radical. However, formation of bulky glutathione adducts decreases reactivity to DNA. Halogen-substituted BABQ derivatives react rapidly with glutathione to form adducts. This appeared to prevent DNA alkylation by these compounds. Comparison of these results with in vivo and in vitro activity against tumour models (L1210) suggests that in vivo halogen-substituted BABQ derivatives are efficiently inactivated by glutathione conjugation. The differences between the halogen-substituted BABQ derivatives on the one hand and TW13 and triaziquone on the other hand are probably caused by a difference in reaction mechanism with glutathione. From the viewpoint of drug design, halogen-substituted BABQ derivatives are expected to be inactive anti-tumour agents, in spite of high reactivity and activity in tumour models in vitro.","['Lusthof, K J', 'de Mol, N J', 'Janssen, L H', 'Prins, B', 'Verboom, W', 'Reinhoudt, D N']","['Lusthof KJ', 'de Mol NJ', 'Janssen LH', 'Prins B', 'Verboom W', 'Reinhoudt DN']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Utrecht University, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aziridines)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (Quinones)', 'F3D5D9P25I (Triaziquone)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Aziridines/*pharmacology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Bacterial/*drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Escherichia coli', 'Glutathione/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Triaziquone/pharmacology']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1990 Aug;5(3):283-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies reported since 1985 were identified by a computer search using MEDLINE as well as from bibliographies of published work. STUDY SELECTION: Sixty-two reports on the clinical applications of the sIL-2R, largely from peer-reviewed journals, were identified. These reports address the utility and significance of sIL-2R measurements in various conditions. Basic scientific investigations delineating the biochemical and molecular features of the human interleukin-2 receptor complex and the sIL-2R protein were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: The validity of sIL-2R quantitation as an index of in-vivo immune system activation and its usefulness as a measure of disease activity and outcome were examined. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: The quantitation of sIL-2R, a novel laboratory measure of in-vivo immune system activation, correlates reliably with disease activity in autoimmune inflammatory disorders, transplantation rejection, and specific infectious disorders. Markedly elevated serum sIL-2R levels are a particularly prominent feature of certain hematologic malignancies, such as human T lymphotropic retrovirus type I-associated adult T-cell leukemia and hairy cell leukemia, reflecting tumor burden and response to therapy. The sIL-2R level at disease onset may also reliably predict long-term prognosis in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and it appears to provide an additional serologic measure in the assessment of clinical progression in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Studies have suggested that sIL-2R levels offer a rapid, reliable, and noninvasive measure of disease activity, response to therapy, and, in some cases, prognosis in a broad spectrum of conditions associated with T- or B-cell immune activation.","['Rubin, L A', 'Nelson, D L']","['Rubin LA', 'Nelson DL']","['University of Toronto, Ontario.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/immunology', 'Biomarkers/*blood', 'Humans', 'Infections/immunology', 'Inflammation/immunology', 'Neoplasms/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/blood/*physiology', 'Transplantation Immunology']",1990/10/15 00:00,1990/10/15 00:01,['1990/10/15 00:00'],"['1990/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1990 Oct 15;113(8):619-27. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-113-8-619.,['10.7326/0003-4819-113-8-619 [doi]'],,,107,,,,,,,,,,

Nuclear extracts were prepared from wild-type and resistant cells and compared for their ability to bind DNA consensus sequences for the transcription factors Sp1 and NF kappa B contained in the 5' long terminal repeat region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Southwestern (DNA-protein) blots showed a family of DNA-binding proteins of 105 kilodaltons (kDa) that were present only in HL-60/AR cells. Competitive gel shift assays indicated that these factors were related to transcription factor Sp1, and immunoblotting with an Sp1 antibody identified this factor as Sp1. DNase footprinting of the promoter region in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 5' long terminal repeat showed that protection occurred at two Sp1 sites as well as two NF kappa B sites and the trans-acting region with nuclear extracts only from resistant cells. Preliminary evidence also suggests that phosphorylation may play a negative regulatory role in the activity of Sp1, since calf intestine alkaline phosphatase stimulated the DNA-binding activity of Sp1 in vitro.

A series of six linker insertion mutations and two single-base substitutions were generated within the region encoding the IN protein. Mutations were initially generated within an Escherichia coli plasmid expressing the IN protein, and the resulting variants were assayed for DNA-binding activity. Mutations which altered conserved cysteine residues within a potential DNA finger-binding motif resulted in lower or variable DNA binding, which appeared to be the result of variable protein folding. Upon renaturation, these proteins were able to nonspecifically bind DNA in a manner similar to that of the other mutant IN proteins and the parent. When reconstructed back into full-length virus, seven of the eight mutations were lethal. All mutants produced a stable IN protein in virions and mediated normal conversion of the retroviral RNA to its three DNA forms. Fine-structure analysis of the linear double-stranded viral DNA indicated that all seven lethal alterations within the IN protein blocked the formation of the 3' recessed termini that normally precedes integration.","['Roth, M J', 'Schwartzberg, P', 'Tanese, N', 'Goff, S P']","['Roth MJ', 'Schwartzberg P', 'Tanese N', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey/Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway 08854.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/genetics', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', '*Genes, pol', 'Integrases', '*Lysogeny', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', '*Mutation', 'Restriction Mapping']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Oct;64(10):4709-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.10.4709-4717.1990.,['10.1128/JVI.64.10.4709-4717.1990 [doi]'],,,,['CA30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC247957,,,,,,,

The activation of this response by either agonist was substantially but incompletely inhibited in cells treated with pertussis toxin. Thus, in cells containing only 1-10% of the control level of non-ADP-ribosylated Gi-2/3, UTP induced rapid 2-fold increases in inositol polyphosphate accumulation whereas smaller 50% increases were observed in FMLP-stimulated cells. Washed membranes prepared from control and toxin-treated HL-60 cells were used to characterize this toxin-insensitive activation of phospholipase C further. The agonist-independent stimulation of phospholipase C by either millimolar Ca2+ or the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) was only modestly attenuated by toxin treatment. There was a 70-80% decrease in the rate and extent of phospholipase C activity stimulated by GTP per se in the absence of receptor agonists. The rate and extent of FMLP-induced potentiation of GTP-dependent phospholipase C activity were also inhibited by greater than 80% in toxin-treated membranes. Conversely, the potency and efficacy characterizing UTP-induced potentiation of GTP-dependent phospholipase C activity were only modestly attenuated (less than 20% inhibition).

Similarly, the secretion of tissue plasminogen activator by leukaemic blasts in vitro uniformly predicted for primary drug resistance, whereas a CR rate of 68% was associated with production of the urokinase type or a mixture of both enzymes. Remission duration and survival did not differ between these two forms of chemotherapy, nor were they influenced by immunotherapy with C. parvum or the duration of maintenance therapy, whereas age below 50 and the species of plasminogen activator secreted were significant prognostic factors.

When administered orally for 4-9 days, the effective therapeutic dose ranged between 60 and 125 mg/kg. The antineoplastic effect of ambazone appeared to be mediated, at least in part, by the immune system. In order to characterize the drug, biophysical and biophysicochemical studies were carried out using thin-layer chromatography, absorption spectroscopy and polarographic measurements. The distribution of ambazone in an n-octanol/water system indicated low hydrophobicity, thereby excluding the possibility of a preferential contribution from hydrophobic forces to the mode of action of ambazone. Ambazone undergoes three protonation reactions with pK values at 10.69 (equilibrium between the negatively charged and neutral forms), 7.39 (equilibrium between the neutral and singly positively charged form) and 6.22 (equilibrium between the singly and doubly positively charge form). Interaction of the drug with model membrane system was monitored by spectrophotometric and fluorescence measurements. Using the fluorescence label 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) as a probe pointed to the interaction of ambazone with the inner area of the phospholipid bilayer matrix of liposomes as being nonspecific. Ambazone induces an overall increase in the cellular cAMP content of leukemia cells and macrophages. So far, membrane interaction has provided a molecular basis for both immunological and antineoplastic activities of the drug. By performing DNA melting experiments, it was shown that neutral or singly positively charged ambazone species stabilize the secondary structure of DNA, while the doubly positively charged form binds more strongly and destabilizes the DNA. After oral administration to rats and mice, ambazone was found to be incompletely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, to an extent of about 35-50%. Absorbed ambazone binds only weakly to plasma proteins, whereas its binding to red blood cells is relatively strong. The mutagenic potential of ambazone shown in bacterial systems and human lymphocytes corresponds to its relatively weak interaction with DNA. The toxic action of ambazone on the intestine is believed to be due to inhibition by the drug of bacterial DNA, RNA and protein syntheses. It is assumed that the reported affinity of ambazone for different cellular targets, i.e., membranes, nucleic acids and proteins, contributes to the overall antibacterial effect. The weak antiviral activity of ambazone in the Sendai virus/chicken embryo fibroblast system is probably the result of the interaction with Sendai virus NH glycoprotein.","['Lober, G', 'Hoffmann, H']","['Lober G', 'Hoffmann H']","['Central Institute of Microbiology and Experimental Therapy, Academy of Sciences of the G.D.R., Jena.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Biophys Chem,Biophysical chemistry,0403171,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'BYK4592A3Q (1,4-benzoquinone guanylhydrazone thiosemicarbazone)', 'OD5Q0L447W (Mitoguazone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mitoguazone/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biophys Chem. 1990 Apr;35(2-3):287-300. doi: 10.1016/0301-4622(90)80016-z.,"['0301-4622(90)80016-Z [pii]', '10.1016/0301-4622(90)80016-z [doi]']",,,56,,,,,,,,,,

In its DNA-bound form, amsacrine efficiently quenches the fluorescence of ethidium. Fluorescence lifetime studies demonstrate two populations of DNA-bound ethidium. The first, whose fluorescence lifetime is constant at approx. 3 ns and whose proportion increases with increasing amsacrine binding ratio, may comprise molecules bound in close proximity to amsacrine. The second, whose fluorescence lifetime is longer and variable (10-24 ns) and whose proportion decreases with increasing amsacrine binding ratio, may comprise molecules three or more base-pairs away from ethidium. Studies with a number of derivatives of 9-anilinoacridine containing different anilino substituents suggest that the observed wide variation in quenching capacity is correlated with the magnitude of the substituent dipole moment in a particular direction. Consideration of the geometry of the DNA-binding complex indicates that the negative pole of a dipole established in the anilino ring is directed towards a positively charged site on the ethidium molecule. Quenching of ethidium fluorescence may therefore occur where an electron-transfer complex has formed between ethidium and amsacrine molecules. To ascertain whether electron-transfer complex formation is biologically important in the amsacrine series, ethidium quenching has been quantitated and compared with activity against a transplantable neoplasm in mice, the Lewis lung carcinoma. Compounds which strongly quench ethidium fluorescence are in general highly active antitumour agents. The results are discussed in terms of a model where amsacrine has both a DNA-binding and a protein-binding domain, the latter possibly interacting by formation of an electron-transfer complex. The most likely protein-binding domain is on the enzyme topoisomerase II, the target for its cytotoxic activity.","['Baguley, B C']",['Baguley BC'],"['Cancer Research Laboratory, University of Auckland Medical School, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Biophys Chem,Biophysical chemistry,0403171,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Electron Transport/drug effects', 'Humans']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biophys Chem. 1990 Apr;35(2-3):203-12. doi: 10.1016/0301-4622(90)80009-v.,"['0301-4622(90)80009-V [pii]', '10.1016/0301-4622(90)80009-v [doi]']",,,50,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the mechanisms by which these oncogenes affect various cell types has been hampered by a paucity of experimental systems that reproduce the range of biological effects associated with them. We have developed an experimental system in which murine hematopoietic stem cell populations are infected with either v-abl or BCR/ABL retroviruses and are used to reconstitute lethally irradiated mice. Irrespective of the form of activated abl, greater than 90% of the animals reconstituted with such cells develop tumors. About 50% of them develop a myeloproliferative syndrome that shares several features with the chronic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia; the remaining animals succumb to pre-B-cell lymphomas. The myeloproliferative syndrome is characterized by large numbers of clonally derived, infected myeloid cells. This model will allow study of the mechanism by which activated abl genes affect hematopoietic precursors in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that introduction of an activated abl gene into the appropriate target cell, not the structure of the gene, is the major determinant in myeloid cell specificity.","['Kelliher, M A', 'McLaughlin, J', 'Witte, O N', 'Rosenberg, N']","['Kelliher MA', 'McLaughlin J', 'Witte ON', 'Rosenberg N']","['Department of Pathology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Animals', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/microbiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/microbiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Sep;87(17):6649-53. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.17.6649.,['10.1073/pnas.87.17.6649 [doi]'],,,,"['CA 24220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 27507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC54594,,,['Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1990 Nov;87(22):9072'],,,,

Therefore, the ALL-BFM 83 study is first used to demonstrate the incidence, antigen expression and dynamics of relapse occurrence of immunological subtypes in childhood ALL. This is then followed by a discussion of the different immunological features hitherto applied for identification of residual leukemia cells in ALL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase--TdT; common acute lymphoblastic leukemia-associated antigen--CALLA, CD10; various T-cell differentiation antigens; kappa/lambda labelling); these are, however, not leukemia-specific and are expressed to varying degrees by normal lymphoid progenitor cells. The sensitivity of these analyses is therefore largely determined by the markers applied and the type of investigational material. Finally, suitable markers are presented for detecting residual leukemia cells in the different immunological subtypes of ALL. Their clinical relevance still remains to be evaluated in prospective therapy studies.","['Ludwig, W D', 'van Dongen, J J', 'Thiel, E', 'Teichmann, J V', 'Hofmann, J', 'Riehm, H']","['Ludwig WD', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Thiel E', 'Teichmann JV', 'Hofmann J', 'Riehm H']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Klinikum Steglitz, FU Berlin, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 1990 Jun;13(3):166-74. doi: 10.1159/000216752.,['10.1159/000216752 [doi]'],,,42,,,,,,,,,,

Fifteen cases were divided into two groups, Group A comprising 11 cases of ICrH accompanying primary BTD, and Group B comprising four cases of ICrH accompanying secondary BTD caused by various underlying diseases. Group A included four cases of hemophilia A (Hp-A), two cases of factor XIII deficiency (FXIII-d), three cases of thrombocytopenia (Th-p) and two cases of vitamin K deficiency (VK-d). The four cases of Hp-A responded favorably, with good prognoses, to a supplementary therapy alone. This result was endorsed by the development of therapy as documented in the references. The combined five cases of FXIII-d and Th-p tended without exception, to show good prognoses in the wake of a combination therapy of supplementary treatment and surgical procedure. As regards FXIII-d, there was an inter-reference difference in supplementary doses. Many references shared the view that splenectomy was essential to the treatment of Th-p in general, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in particular. The current study also suggested that gammaglobulin in large doses would serve as an effective therapy. The two cases of VK-d suffered from a serious degree of lingering neurologic manifestations, although their lives were saved. Even though there is an established therapy for it, VK-d was found to be a problem with poor functional prognosis showing the importance of the preventive approach. Group B was classified into the acute type and the subacute type depending on the rate of pathologic development. As underlying diseases DIC and myelofibrosis due to acute myeloblastic leukemia, and Th-p due to aplastic anemia were noted in two cases in each group. Of these, two cases of the subacute type were able to be saved, while two cases of the acute type followed poor prognostic courses resulting, eventually, in death. The following were found to be responsible fatal factors: 1) causes of BTD which involved both mechanisms of coagulation and hemostasis, 2) non-removal of the underlying disease, in which case supplementary therapy tended to be futile, and 3) the underlying disease per se as a danger to the life of the patient. In conclusion, therapeutic rationale and prognosis in ICrH accompanying primary type of BTD will benefit from the implementation of an adequate augmentative therapy as in the ordinary type of ICrH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Fukuda, T', 'Akimoto, J', 'Chin, M', 'Itoh, H', 'Miwa, T', 'Hasue, M']","['Fukuda T', 'Akimoto J', 'Chin M', 'Itoh H', 'Miwa T', 'Hasue M']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Tokyo Medical College.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,No Shinkei Geka,No shinkei geka.

Both studies yielded similar results with respect to the incidence of immunological subtypes: CD10-negative pre-pre-B ALL (ALL-BFM 83: 3.6%; ALL-BFM 86: 5.3%), common ALL (80.1%; 77.9%), B-ALL (1.9%; 2.8%), pre-T/T-ALL (13.9%; 13.5%). Leukemic cells of 3 patients in the ALL-BFM 83 study lacked lymphoid and myeloid antigens (acute unclassifiable leukemia, 0.5%), and 3 patients in the ALL-BFM 86 study exhibited different blast populations with expression of either myeloid or lymphoid features (acute mixed-lineage leukemia, 0.5%).

The molecular biological analysis revealed the deletion of C mu gene in one allele in three sIg-negative cases. The incidence of CLL, CLL-L and CLL/PL in Japan was deduced to be 1/10 of that in Western countries.","['Kobayashi, T', 'Kita, K', 'Ohno, T', 'Shirakawa, S']","['Kobayashi T', 'Kita K', 'Ohno T', 'Shirakawa S']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Mie University.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/epidemiology/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Survival Rate']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1990 May;31(5):554-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of four leukemia-prone strains expressed low levels of such thymic transcripts, but none of 11 control strains did. 8.4 kb Mpmv RNA expression was not induced in thymuses of control mice by the lpr/lpr or gld/gld genotypes (which cause polyclonal immune activation) nor by treatment with mitogens. In contrast to Mpmv, thymic 8.4 kb Pmv expression was poorly associated with autoimmunity: it was easily detected in nearly all strains, and was increased by polyclonal activation in control mice. These studies indicate that the organ-specific thymic 8.4 kb Mpmv expression (a) is characteristic of several genetic backgrounds which predispose to murine lupus, (b) precedes and does not correlate with disease development, (c) is not due to polyclonal activation, and (d) is regulated independently of 8.4 kb Pmv expression.","['Krieg, A M', 'Steinberg, A D']","['Krieg AM', 'Steinberg AD']","['Cellular Immunology Section, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', '*Genes, env', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Species Specificity', 'Spleen/microbiology', 'Thymus Gland/microbiology']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1990 Sep;86(3):809-16. doi: 10.1172/JCI114778.,['10.1172/JCI114778 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC296796,,,,,,,

Haploidentical recipients differed from their donors for no more than one HLA locus on the nonshared haplotype. All were given postgrafting immunosuppression with a combination of methotrexate and cyclosporine. In a randomized study we explored whether prednisone administered from day 0 through 35 along with methotrexate/cyclosporine could improve prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The GVHD incidence in patients not given prednisone was comparable with that previously reported with methotrexate/cyclosporine. Unexpectedly, significant increases in acute and also chronic GVHD were seen in HLA-identical recipients administered prednisone, but not in the small number of patients administered HLA-nonidentical grafts. However, the resultant increase in transplant-related mortality in patients administered prednisone was offset by an increase in leukemic relapse in patients not administered prednisone, presumably related to the absence of a graft-versus-leukemia effect. Therefore, overall disease-free survival of the two groups of patients was comparable, with slightly more than 50% of the patients being alive at more than 2 years after transplantation. We speculated that prednisone adversely affected GVHD prophylaxis, interfering with methotrexate's cell cycle-dependent suppression of donor lymphocyte proliferation in response to host antigens. In a pilot study we explored whether beginning prednisone on day 15, after completion of methotrexate administration, would avoid this adverse effect. The GVHD incidence in patients administered methotrexate/cyclosporine along with ""late"" prednisone was comparable with that in patients not administered prednisone. We conclude that methotrexate/cyclosporine is effective in decreasing the incidence of grade II through IV GVHD, and that the addition of prednisone to this regimen is not beneficial in recipients of HLA-identical marrow grafts.","['Storb, R', 'Pepe, M', 'Anasetti, C', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Beatty, P', 'Doney, K', 'Martin, P', 'Stewart, P', 'Sullivan, K M', 'Witherspoon, R']","['Storb R', 'Pepe M', 'Anasetti C', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Beatty P', 'Doney K', 'Martin P', 'Stewart P', 'Sullivan KM', 'Witherspoon R', 'et al.']","['Division of Clinical Research Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*surgery', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporins/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*surgery', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', 'Random Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Sep 1;76(5):1037-45.,['S0006-4971(20)74508-8 [pii]'],,,,"['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

DATA IDENTIFICATION: English-language literature search using MEDLINE (1980 to 1990) and CANCERLIT (1980 to 1990), review of meeting abstracts and reports, and an extensive manual search of bibliographies of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: Approximately 800 articles, abstracts, and book chapters were selected for analysis. DATA EXTRACTION: The literature was reviewed and 227 articles were selected as representative of the important advances in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a disease of lymphocytes that appear to be mature but are biologically immature. These B lymphocytes arise from a subset of CD5-B cells that appear to have a role in autoimmunity. The pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is likely a multistep process, initially involving a polyclonal expansion of CD5-B cells followed by transformation of a single cell. Chromosome studies indicate that trisomy 12 is the most common abnormality, followed by 14q+, 13q, and 11q. These abnormalities portend a poor prognosis. Recent progress in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia involves three new drugs: fludarabine, pentostatin, and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. Recent preliminary results of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation present insights into the potential curability of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin can prevent or delay moderate bacterial infections in persons with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

The molecular weight of the so-called 68 kDa U1 RNP antigen, which is associated with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), was 64.5 kDa in RTE, 62.5 kDa in HeLa cells and HL-60 cells, and 59 kDa in WBCs. Surprisingly, in both WBCs and U-937 cells, the main protein band bearing the 68 kDa U1 RNP antigenic determinants was 30.5 kDa in molecular weight, which was confirmed using antibodies purified by affinity chromatography. After stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), there was in the human lymphocytes a diminished amount of the 30.5 kDa protein and simultaneously an increased synthesis of several proteins of higher molecular weight, especially the 57 kDa protein bearing the 68 kDa antigenic determinants. The concentrations of the A, B/B', C, D, and E proteins also increased with PHA stimulation.

Seventy percent of the patients were females with mean age of 43.1 +/-9 years. All of them presented the typical skin lesions consisting of papules and painful erythematous--edematous plaques in face, neck and upper chest. Fever was observed in seven patients and painful joints in four cases. One case presented polyarthritis of the big joints and there was one other case of conjuntivitis. The analytical data revealed a constant increase in sedimentation rate observed in 90% of patients. Leukocytosis was observed in 30% of patients and neutrophilia in 40%. Histologically, the lesions showed a neutrophilic infiltration of the skin without signs of vasculitis. Eight patients received treatment with Prednisone per os, one of whom, because of his relapses, was later given Potassium Iodine. Another patient was treated with Indomethacin, and one patient did not received any treatment. The evolution was favorable in all cases with sustained remissions. Sweet's Syndrome has been described associated mainly with acute myeloid leukemia in 10-20% of patients and in isolated instances with other systemic and neoplasic diseases. The concomitant conditions in 50% of our cases were: Ulcerative colitis, nodular sclerotic Hodgkin disease, infiltrative ductal carcinoma of the breast, carcinoma of the uterus neck and Crohn's disease; these last two associations had not been previously described in the literature.","['Zamora Martinez, E', 'Martin Moreno, L', 'de Castro Torres, A', 'Barat Cascante, A']","['Zamora Martinez E', 'Martin Moreno L', 'de Castro Torres A', 'Barat Cascante A']","['Servicio de Dermatologia, Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, AV.

Calpain I requires low (or microM)-Ca2+ for activation and calpain II requires high (or mM)-Ca2+. Both isozymes consist of one heavy (approx.80 kDa) and one light (approx. 30 kDa) subunit each. The heavy subunits of isozymes I and II are different genetic products, while the light subunits are identical. Antibodies respectively specific for the heavy subunits of pig calpains I and II were raised in rabbits, and the affinity-purified IgG proteins were used for Western blot analysis. When 23 human hematopoietic system cells were examined for the degree of their expression of the genes for calpains I and II, all of them were found to contain calpain I of detectable amounts in their cytosolic fluid. By contrast, only nine cell-line cells were positive in calpain II, and they were, without exception, the lineage which had been infected with HTLV-I, the retrovirus responsible for human adult T-cell leukemia. The enhanced production of calpain II in HTLV-I infected T-cells was also confirmed by running chromatographic analyses on the homogenates of these cells, and comparing them with those of uninfected T-cells. When YT-C3 cell, which is an uninfected, natural killer-like cell, was transfected with HTLV-I gene, the resulting transformed stable cells, YT-4 and YT-5.1, were found to produce increased amounts of calpain II concomitant with that of interleukin (IL)-2 receptor protein. These results suggest that the gene expression for calpain isozymes may vary during the course of differentiation of T-lymphocytes. The mechanism of regulation of calpain isozyme genes and the biological significance of the variation in expression during differentiation still remain unanswered.","['Murachi, T', 'Adachi, Y', 'Hatanaka, M', 'Ishihara, G', 'Takano, E', 'Yamagata, Y', 'Kannagi, R']","['Murachi T', 'Adachi Y', 'Hatanaka M', 'Ishihara G', 'Takano E', 'Yamagata Y', 'Kannagi R']","['Department of Clinical Science, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calpain/*genetics', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'Models, Genetic']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1990;344:477-94.,,,,24,,,,,,,,,,

These activated ras genes have been identified in various human tumors as well as their preneoplastic lesions such as colorectal tumors (20-40%), pancreatic carcinomas (95%), lung carcinomas (20-30%), myelodysplasia (40%) and acute myeloid leukemia (30%). The activation of ras p21 is due to amino acid substitutions at positions 12, 13 or 61 of the p21 protein. This report describes two monoclonal antibodies designated D129 and D146 raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 5-16 of ras p21 activated by the substitution of aspartic acid for glycine at position 13. D129 and D146 react specifically with the peptide with the aspartic acid substitution at position 13, but not with the peptide with valine at position 13 or the peptide containing the normal glycine at position 13. Western blot analysis demonstrates that D129 and D146 react specifically with p21 extracted from transformed NIH3T3 fibroblast lines containing aspartic acid at position 13. These studies also demonstrate that D146 is able to detect the activated p21 with aspartic acid at position 13 that is shed into the culture media. Studies demonstrate that MAb D146 specifically immunoprecipitates the cellular p21 with aspartic acid at position 13 from transformed NIH3T3 cells, whereas D129 cannot immunoprecipitate the activated p21. Using a sandwich ELISA format, D146 is able to detect the p21 with position 13 aspartic acid from cell extracts and culture fluids. The ability of D146 to function in the ELISA format raises the possibility that this assay maybe a quick and effective way of determining the presence of activated p21 with aspartic acid at position 13 in human fluids and tissues.","['La Vecchio, J A', 'Hamer, P J', 'Ng, S C', 'Trimpe, K L', 'Carney, W P']","['La Vecchio JA', 'Hamer PJ', 'Ng SC', 'Trimpe KL', 'Carney WP']","['E.I.

These sequences, when compared with those previously reported for the human c-myb gene, reveal an alternative splicing process that generates at least four forms of the c-myb message. Three of these forms co-migrate on Northern blots and are co-expressed in several human hematopoietic cell types. Data on sequence comparisons with mouse and chicken homologues of c-myb coupled with oligonucleotide hybridization to genomic clones of the human c-myb gene indicate that this alternative splicing process utilizes three closely spaced splice donor sites and two unique exons present between viral defined exons 5 and 6. In one clone, the alternative splicing would generate a predicted myb protein with a three amino acid deletion in the region involved in transcription activation. In the other clone, incorporation of a new exon leads to introduction of a translation stop codon leading to loss of the entire carboxy terminus of the protein. This includes loss of a portion of the region involved in transcription activation as well as a separate highly conserved domain.

Enzymatic denaturation of cellular DNA was shown to prevent loss of cell surface antigen-bound biotin moieties, and thus to preserve cell surface immunofluorescence distribution. After a mild protein extraction and the introduction of breaks into the chromatin using restriction endonucleases, E. coli exonuclease III was used to generate stretches of single stranded DNA. This approach permits detection of the incorporated BrdUrd using anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibodies. The enzymatic denaturation protocol was optimized using in vitro BrdUrd-labeled L1210 murine leukemia cells, and applied to both in vivo and ex vivo BrdUrd-labeled murine bone marrow cells.

Each form of treatment has drawbacks--the limited eligibility and continued high rate of early death associated with the allogeneic transplant procedure and the significantly greater likelihood of relapse, as well as the risk for drug-induced, life-threatening toxicities observed following the administration of chemotherapy. Future efforts should be directed at improving each of these treatment techniques, perhaps through kinetic synchronization of leukemic cells by hematopoietic growth factors to make chemotherapy more potent and by better understanding and then harnessing the ""graft-versus-leukemia"" effect which appears so instrumental in reducing the relapse rate following allografting.","['Mayer, R J']",['Mayer RJ'],"['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1990 Jul;6 Suppl 1:48-51.,,,,38,,,,,,,,,,

Toxicity associated with the above preparative regimen included conjunctivitis in the majority of patients, severe gastrointestinal symptoms in seven patients (10%), skin desquamation in four patients (6%), and interstitial pneumonitis of unknown etiology in two patients (3%). One patient died from a 'capillary leak' syndrome that may have been attributable to Ara-C toxicity. With a follow-up of 1.1-4.3 years, the estimated survival is 21% (95% confidence interval, 10-32%), with a disease-free survival of 18% (8-28%) and an estimated relapse rate of 75% (62-88%) at 3 years. These results are not significantly different from overall outcome in 105 patients treated previously at this same institution with cyclophosphamide-containing preparative regimens (31% (22-40%) estimated survival, 29% (20-38%) disease-free survival, and an estimated relapse rate of 63% (52-74%) at 3 years), especially when results are stratified based on allogeneic versus autologous BMTs. Although efficacious for a minority of patients with poor risk ALL, a pre-BMT preparative regimen consisting of total body irradiation followed by high doses of Ara-C did not improve long-term survival over more conventional preparative regimens consisting of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. Future strategies may need to investigate novel approaches for reducing leukemic relapse rates in patients with ALL undergoing bone marrow transplantation.","['Woods, W G', 'Ramsay, N K', 'Weisdorf, D J', 'Haake, R', 'Vallera, D A', 'Kim, T H', 'Lasky, L', 'Nesbit, M E', 'Bostrom, B', 'Uckun, F']","['Woods WG', 'Ramsay NK', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Haake R', 'Vallera DA', 'Kim TH', 'Lasky L', 'Nesbit ME', 'Bostrom B', 'Uckun F', 'et al.']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1990 Jul;6(1):9-16.,,,,,"['CA 21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25097/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Repeated cycles of DNA synthesis by heat-stable Taq DNA polymerase enables to obtain more than 10(5) copies of the target sequence. Recently its enormous attitude of amplification has been applied for the detection of tumor-specific gene alterations. Examples include the detection of point mutation of RAS oncogenes at codons 12, 13, and 61 and the detection of minimal residual neoplastic cells in patients in complete clinical remission. Among many kinds of tumor specific gene translocations, BCR-ABL gene in t(9;22)(q34;q11) and BCL-2-IgH gene in t(14:18)(q32;q21) have been successfully PCR-amplified around their fused regions. In lymphoid malignancies gene rearrangements of T cell receptor chain or immunoglobulin heavy chain can be used as clonal markers for leukemic cells. PCR technique permits the detection of leukemia DNA at dilution of 10(-4) to 10(-6).

More than 80% of cancer patients with advanced metastatic disease suffer moderate to severe pain. Most cancer pain is caused by direct tumor infiltration; approximately 20% of cancer pain may be attributed to the effects of surgery, radio-therapy, or chemotherapy. The incidence of cancer pain is related to tumor type; 70% or more of patients with tumors of the bone, cervix, and ovaries suffer cancer-related pain, while only 5% of patients with leukemia have pain. Pain is defined by the organs involved. Somatic pain is usually dull and well localized; visceral pain is generalized and difficult to describe. Other types of pain, including deafferentation pain and referred pain, are particularly difficult to manage. Cancer pain may be acute or chronic. The latter may cause psychological reactions that make effective treatment more challenging. Opiate analgesic agents, administered by the epidural or intrathecal routes, block pain more selectively and produce fewer adverse reactions than systemic analgesic agents. The duration and onset of analgesia depend on the lipophilicity of the agent used. Because pain is the most common complaint of the patient with cancer, clinicians should be aware of the range of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic analgesic modalities available to them. Familiarity with newer modalities and delivery routes, such as spinal administration of opiate analgesics, is recommended.","['Koeller, J M']",['Koeller JM'],"['College of Pharmacy, University of Texas, Austin.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Hosp Pharm,American journal of hospital pharmacy,0370474,,IM,"['Humans', 'Neoplasms/*physiopathology', 'Pain, Intractable/drug therapy/*physiopathology']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hosp Pharm. 1990 Aug;47(8 Suppl):S3-6.,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,

These abnormalities can be categorized as 1) increased platelet aggregation and activation, 2) abnormal activation of coagulation cascade, 3) release of plasminogen activator, and 4) decreased hepatic synthesis of anticoagulant proteins like Protein C and antithrombin III. The abnormal activation of coagulation cascade is mediated through release of Tissue Factor, Factor X activators, and other miscellaneous procoagulants from the plasma membrane vesicles of tumor cells. Macrophages of a tumor-bearing host also produce increased amounts of Tissue Factor. Production of Factor X activators and macrophage Tissue Factor is decreased by warfarin. The ability of the tumor cells to produce platelet-aggregating activity and plasminogen activator parallels their metastatic potential in animal and experimental systems. These studies also show that antiplatelet agents and antibodies against plasminogen activator can suppress the metastatic process. One or more laboratory abnormalities of hemostasis can be shown in up to 95% of patients with metastatic cancer. These abnormalities, however, are unable to predict subsequent development of thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications. Clinical complications occur in 9-15% of the patients in the form of thrombotic or hemorrhagic disorders. The therapy of tumor-related coagulopathy should be guided by its clinical expression. Subclinical DIC should not be treated. Coumadin is generally ineffective for therapy of thrombosis in cancer patients. There is no consensus regarding the use of heparin in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The defibrination in APL may be from disseminated intravascular coagulation as well as systemic fibrinolysis, as shown by decreased alpha 2 antiplasmin levels. In such cases, epsilon aminocaproic acid plus heparin therapy may be of benefit.","['Nand, S', 'Messmore, H']","['Nand S', 'Messmore H']","['Department of Medicine, Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL 60153.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Protein C)', '9000-94-6 (Antithrombin III)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)']",IM,"['Antithrombin III/biosynthesis', 'Blood Coagulation/physiology', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/complications/etiology/therapy', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', '*Hemostasis', 'Humans', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*blood/complications/metabolism', 'Plasminogen Activators/physiology', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Aggregation', 'Protein C/biosynthesis', 'Thromboembolism/complications']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1990 Sep;35(1):45-55. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830350111.,['10.1002/ajh.2830350111 [doi]'],,,152,,['Am J Hematol. 1991 Dec;38(4):337-8.

We assessed this possibility as follows: blood mononuclear cells from 433 patients with B-cell CLL in five European centers were cultured with B-cell mitogens, and banded metaphases were studied. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-one patients could be evaluated cytogenetically, and 218 had clonal chromosomal changes. The most common abnormalities were trisomy 12 (n = 67) and structural abnormalities of chromosome 13 (n = 51; most involving the site of the retinoblastoma gene) and of chromosome 14 (n = 41). Patients with a normal karyotype had a median overall survival of more than 15 years, in contrast to 7.7 years for patients with clonal changes. Patients with single abnormalities (n = 113) did better than those with complex karyotypes (P less than 0.001). Patients with abnormalities involving chromosome 14q had poorer survival than those with aberrations of chromosome 13q (P less than 0.05). Among patients with single abnormalities, those with trisomy 12 alone had poorer survival than patients with single aberrations of chromosome 13q (P = 0.01); the latter had the same survival as those with a normal karyotype. A high percentage of cells in metaphase with chromosomal abnormalities, indicating highly proliferative leukemic cells, was associated with poor survival (P less than 0.001).

In this study the synergistic activity of IL-1 was investigated on IL-3 and GM-CSF induced growth of acute myeloid leukemia colony forming cells (AML-CFU) in vitro. Among 12 cases of human AML, IL-1 significantly elevated IL-3 stimulated colony numbers in eight instances and enhanced GM-CSF induced colony growth in five cases. As IL-1 is an inducer of cytokine production and since tumor necrosis factor (TNF) elevates IL-3 or GM-CSF induced proliferation of AML-CFU, we examined whether IL-1 enhanced AML-CFU growth via the induction of TNF production. Neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha antibodies significantly decreased IL-1/IL-3 or IL-1/GM-CSF stimulated colony numbers in six of seven cases studied, whereas anti-TNF-beta had no effect, indicating that endogenously produced TNF-alpha costimulated the growth of AML-CFU. Furthermore, AML blast cells stimulated by IL-1 released increased amounts of TNF-alpha (between 25 and 533 pg/ml; median 255 pg/ml) into the culture medium (TNF-alpha specific radioimmunoassay) as compared with noninduced AML cells (less than 1 to 149 pg TNF-alpha/ml; median 31 pg/ml). Thus, the effect of IL-1 on AML-CFU proliferation is not the result of direct activation of AML progenitors, but IL-1 stimulates the release of TNF-alpha by AML cells and endogenous TNF subsequently synergizes with IL-3 or GM-CSF.","['Delwel, R', 'van Buitenen, C', 'Salem, M', 'Oosterom, R', 'Touw, I', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Delwel R', 'van Buitenen C', 'Salem M', 'Oosterom R', 'Touw I', 'Lowenberg B']","['Dr. Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antibodies', 'Cell Division', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis/immunology/physiology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Aug;4(8):557-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of 18-hr culture in purified recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) (1 ng/ml) on in vitro AML marrow cell [3H]dThd incorporation into DNA, intracellular ara-C activation to the triphosphate form (ara-CTP), and subsequent ara-CTP retention were determined in leukemic cells of 11 patients and compared with cells similarly cultured in HSA-containing sera.

Pre-BMT samples available for eight of 11 patients contained detectable bcr-abl fusion products serving as a baseline for comparison to post-BMT studies. Six patients showed no PCR-detectable bcr-abl transcripts in each of several serial analyses post-BMT (1-36 months post-BMT). The remaining five patients demonstrated various patterns of bcr-abl transcript expression after transplantation. In three patients, bcr-abl transcripts persisted for up to 3 months post-BMT but subsequently were undetectable. Molecular relapse was observed 3 and 6 months post-BMT in the remaining two patients whose earlier post-BMT samples showed no bcr-abl fusion transcripts. No bcr-abl transcripts were detected in subsequent samples from both of these patients 6 months and 1 year post-BMT, respectively.

In this paper we describe the expression of this homing receptor glycoprotein during lymphoid development. CD44 expression was examined on a large panel of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (n = 234) and lymphoid leukemias (n = 44). These tumors, which are the malignant counterparts of normal lymphoid cells ""frozen"" at a certain stage of maturation/activation, are thought to represent a complete spectrum of lymphoid development from stem cell to mature, activated T and B lymphocyte. It was found that CD44 exhibits a trimodal distribution on developing lymphocytes of both the T and B lineage: the CD44 antigen is expressed at relatively high levels during early stages of lymphoid differentiation, i.e., on prothymocytes and immature precursor B cells (null acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and common ALL). Subsequently, at the stage of the immature/common thymocyte, the pre-B cell and early B cell (pre-B-ALL and B-ALL), the CD44 antigen is temporarily lost from the cell surface to be reacquired during further T and B cell maturation. At the activated (germinal center) B cell stage. CD44 is heterogeneously expressed. This distribution pattern of the CD44 molecule closely matches the recirculatory versus sessile nature of lymphoid cells at consecutive phases of their development, and thus apparently reflects its homing receptor function. In addition, the relatively high expression of the CD44 antigen in the earliest phases of T and B cell development suggests that the molecule may also be involved in the migration of bone marrow derived lymphoid precursors to their site of maturation.","['Horst, E', 'Meijer, C J', 'Radaskiewicz, T', 'van Dongen, J J', 'Pieters, R', 'Figdor, C G', 'Hooftman, A', 'Pals, S T']","['Horst E', 'Meijer CJ', 'Radaskiewicz T', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Pieters R', 'Figdor CG', 'Hooftman A', 'Pals ST']","['Department of Pathology and Pediatrics, Free University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 May;4(5):383-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specificity studies revealed that interleukin-3 (IL-3) could partially inhibit the binding of GM-CSF to AML blasts and to the cells of the leukemic lines M07-E, KG-1, and HL-60. The inhibition of GM-CSF binding by IL-3 was directly dependent on the presence of IL-3 receptors. Analysis of competition curves indicated that the Kd and the number of binding sites per cell of unlabeled and iodinated GM-CSF were identical. In contrast, the inhibition of GM-CSF binding by IL-3 was mediated by IL-3 occupancy of a high affinity receptor only, with the same number of sites as the high affinity GM-CSF receptor but a slightly higher Kd. Despite this competitive binding, IL-3 augmented AML blast proliferation in the presence of GM-CSF, indicating that the two growth factors have converging pathways in supporting blast proliferation. In striking contrast to AML blasts, GM-CSF binding to neutrophils was compatible with the presence of only one class of binding site of intermediate affinity (Kd approximately 100-160 pM). Furthermore, IL-3 does not compete for the binding of GM-CSF to neutrophils.","['Onetto-Pothier, N', 'Aumont, N', 'Haman, A', 'Park, L', 'Clark, S C', 'De Lean, A', 'Hoang, T']","['Onetto-Pothier N', 'Aumont N', 'Haman A', 'Park L', 'Clark SC', 'De Lean A', 'Hoang T']","['Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Division', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 May;4(5):329-36.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using 1-O-hexadecyl-2-[3H]arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine as a substrate and a series of conventional and high-pressure liquid chromatographic techniques, we have purified a PLA2 from the soluble fraction of differentiated human monocytic U937 cells. The enzyme has been purified nearly 2000-fold to homogeneity. The purified enzyme has a molecular mass of 56 kDa, under reducing conditions, by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The enzyme activity has a pH optimum of 8.0 and is calcium concentration-dependent. The EC50 for the activation of the enzyme activity by calcium is 300 nM. When the cells were homogenized in the presence of the calcium chelator EGTA (0.2 mM), the enzyme was found to be soluble (more than 90% of the activity in the 100,000 x g supernatant). However, when Ca2+ concentration was controlled from 10 nM to 100 microM in Ca2(+)-EGTA buffers, increasing amounts of the activity were found in the particulate fraction (100,000 x g pellet). This suggests that membrane translocation and activation of the soluble PLA2 may be regulated by physiological intracellular levels of Ca2+. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed different phosphatidylcholine substrates presented in either vesicular or Triton X-100 mix micellar forms. In both situations, the enzyme showed a high degree of specificity for arachidonic acid on the sn-2 position of the substrate. Substitution of palmitic or oleic on the sn-2 position substantially reduced the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme. When vesicles of arachidonic acid-containing phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol were presented to the purified enzyme, all of them were hydrolyzed with comparable efficiency.

We therefore determined if phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced changes in megakaryocyte gene expression could be detected and semi-quantified in single cells using the techniques of in situ hybridization and photodensitometry. Megakaryocytes were isolated from normal human bone marrow by counterflow centrifugal elutriation. After 2, 15, and 24 h of culture in 8 nM PMA, megakaryocytes were probed by in situ hybridization with biotin-11-dUTP-labeled cDNA probes for human c-myc, beta-actin, and coagulation cofactor V (FV) mRNA. Hybridization was detected by an enzyme-catalyzed colorimetric reaction that was photometrically quantified as an inverse function of light transmission through labeled cells. In control megakaryocytes, steady state levels of c-myc and FV mRNA did not change over the 24-h observation period, whereas that of beta-actin appeared to increase slightly. In contrast, after 2 h of exposure to 8 nM PMA, a statistically significant increase (p less than 0.001) in c-myc and beta-actin mRNA expression was observed, whereas FV mRNA expression appeared to be unchanged (p = 0.207). These inductions were transient, however, because by 15 or 24 h, beta-actin and c-myc expression levels, respectively, no longer exceeded those measured in untreated controls. However, in the presence of higher PMA doses (160 nM), beta-actin mRNA levels remained elevated at 24 h. The relationship between megakaryocyte maturation and apparent level of beta-actin mRNA expression was also examined.

In leukemia, however, immature white blood cells are able to traverse the barrier and to appear in the blood stream. Very little is known about the regulatory processes which govern the egress of white blood cells in healthy individuals and their malignant counterparts in patients with leukemia. The results of the few studies performed to address this question in animal and human leukemias all agree that the extent to which adventitial cells (fibroblasts) cover the endothelium in bone marrow is drastically reduced. This implies altered interactions between the leukemic and adventitial cells and their extracellular matrix. We propose here a model to explain the egress of normal cells and their leukemic counterparts. It is based upon our own experimental data and the general at present limited knowledge of the subject. It is hoped that this model will stimulate further research into this important aspect of leukemogenesis.","['Petrides, P E', 'Dittmann, K H']","['Petrides PE', 'Dittmann KH']","['Department of Medicine III, University of Munich Medical School Grosshadern, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Factors/physiology', 'Bone Marrow/anatomy & histology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cytokines', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/*physiology', 'Models, Biological']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blut. 1990 Jul;61(1):3-13. doi: 10.1007/BF01739426.,['10.1007/BF01739426 [doi]'],,,95,,,,,,,,,,

The 26 evaluable patients were equally distributed between the two study groups. Nine of 13 (69%) MMG patients became refractory with a median onset at transfusion 7 (15 d), compared with only one of 13 (8%) OG patients (P = 0.001). Refractoriness was associated with the formation of high titre isoagglutinins, anti-HLA and platelet specific antibodies. In one patient refractoriness appeared to be due to high titre isoagglutinins alone. Six other patients developed an increase in isoagglutinin titre sufficient to adversely affect platelet increments. Patients receiving ABO-mismatched platelets had a higher incidence of anti-HLA antibodies (5 v. 1) and platelet specific antibodies (4 v. 1). ABO-mismatched platelets transfused prior to the onset of refractoriness resulted in increments similar to those achieved by ABO-matched platelets. The study demonstrates that ABO-mismatched platelets are as effective as matched platelets in patients with low titre isoagglutinins requiring only few transfusions. However, the greater incidence of early refractoriness induced in MMG patients indicates that ABO-mismatched platelets should not be given to patients with marrow failure requiring long-term support.","['Carr, R', 'Hutton, J L', 'Jenkins, J A', 'Lucas, G F', 'Amphlett, N W']","['Carr R', 'Hutton JL', 'Jenkins JA', 'Lucas GF', 'Amphlett NW']","['University Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)'],IM,"['*ABO Blood-Group System', 'Acute Disease', '*Blood Grouping and Crossmatching', 'Blood Platelets/pathology', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/therapy', 'Male', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Jul;75(3):408-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb04356.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb04356.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the molecular mechanisms leading to translocations are unknown, structural analysis of translocations in tumors derived from lymphocytes and their precursors has suggested the involvement of the lymphocyte recombinase, a normal cellular enzyme (or enzyme complex) that is essential for antigen receptor gene rearrangement. Recent observations of frequent recombinase-mediated interchromosomal exchanges between separate antigen receptor genes in normal lymphocyte precursors have provided clear examples of the ability of the recombinase to catalyze chromosomal translocation events, some of which may actually contribute to increased diversity of antigen receptor proteins. These findings have established that, even in the normal setting, the recombinase is not constrained to act only on gene segments linked in cis, but can also function in trans.

Cytostatic drugs and irradiation are known to be potentially neurotoxic, particularly when combined. The examination involved four neuropsychological tests of sensory-motor and cognitive functioning, as well as an age-appropriate intelligence test. For control the bone marrow donors (n = 32), siblings of the patients, were also investigated. A pronounced delay in motor development was found in four children, who had been treated with BMT including total body irradiation before 3 years of age.

The enzyme from human myelogenous leukemic cells contained a 80 kDa subunit as a major component. Amino acid sequencing revealed that N-terminal regions of the 80 kDa from CML cells and the 18 kDa from placenta were identical, and the sequence of the 64 kDa from placenta was identical to the downstream sequence of Gly138 in the 80 kDa enzyme. Therefore, it is probable that the 80 kDa is a precursor form and the 64 kDa is a mature form that is derived by removal of N-terminal 18 kDa peptide (137 amino acids) from the precursor form. These observation simply that proteolytic processing of this enzyme is impaired in myelogenous leukemic cells. The possibility of impaired protease activity against the 80 kDa subunit in CML cells was excluded, since the 80 kDa was not susceptible to several protease sources from normal tissues (placenta and liver) and granulocytes under a variety of reaction conditions. In addition no mutation of the primary structure in myelogenous leukemic cells was detected through analysis of DNA encoding for a peptide, including Gly138 of the enzyme.

Rev-RRE binding studies suggested that the lack of nonreciprocal complementation stems from the inability of HIV-2 Rev to interact with HIV-1 RRE RNA. Maintenance of RNA secondary structure, rather than the primary nucleotide sequence, appeared to be the major determinant for interaction of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 Rev with the HIV-2 RRE. Moreover, the binding domain of the HIV-2 RRE recognized by HIV-1 Rev was dissimilar to the binding domain of the HIV-1 RRE, in terms of both secondary structure and primary nucleotide sequence.

Virus replication in these cells can be increased up to 25-fold by phorbol esters (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate), recombinant cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and cytokine-enriched mononuclear cell supernatants. We have tested specific activators of protein kinases (PK) and PK inhibitors (isoquinolinesulfonamide derivatives), as well as calcium-mobilizing agents, for their effect on constitutive and induced virus expression in U1 cells. Virus expression was measured by reverse transcriptase, Western blot, and nuclear run-on analysis. Activation of PKC by 1-oleyl,2-acetylglycerol, a synthetic analog of the natural ligand 1,2-diacylglycerol, and bryostatin 1 (a recently described specific PKC activator) resulted in a two- to eightfold increase in virus production. In contrast, activators of cyclic-nucleotide-dependent PKs were not effective in inducing virus expression. PK inhibitors were tested for their effect on HIV upregulation by cytokines and other inducing agents. The isoquinolinesulfonamide derivative H7, a potent inhibitor of PKC activation, effectively blocked (70 to 90%) HIV induction by cytokines and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. The derivative HA1004, which is more selective for cyclic-nucleotide-dependent kinases, did not suppress viral induction. In addition, increases in intracellular calcium levels dramatically enhanced HIV production induced by both specific PKC activators and cytokines. These results indicate that activation of PKC is a common pathway involved in the upregulation of HIV expression in chronically infected cells stimulated by cytokines and other inducing agents.","['Kinter, A L', 'Poli, G', 'Maury, W', 'Folks, T M', 'Fauci, A S']","['Kinter AL', 'Poli G', 'Maury W', 'Folks TM', 'Fauci AS']","['Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '86390-77-4 (1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Biological Factors/*pharmacology', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytokines', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'HIV/drug effects/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macrolides', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Virus Replication']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Sep;64(9):4306-12. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.9.4306-4312.1990.,['10.1128/JVI.64.9.4306-4312.1990 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC247897,,,,,,,

Tiazofurin produced lymphopenia which was not dose-dependent in the range of 23-36% decrease from baseline, and the effect on lymphocyte count was generally greater than the decline in neutrophil count. Non-hematologic toxicity of a moderate or worse severity (greater than or equal to grade 2) included nausea and vomiting (18% of all courses), serum transaminase elevations (SGOT, 16%; SGPT, 9%), rash (9%), stomatitis (3%), conjunctivitis (3%), headache (10%), other signs of central nervous system toxicity (8%), and cardiac toxicity, primarily pleuropericarditis (4%). Dose-related cutaneous toxicity, headache, and nausea and vomiting were evident in the five day bolus schedule, and myalgia was more frequently reported at higher doses on the single dose schedule. The five day continuous infusion (CI) schedule had a higher incidence of neurotoxicity, cardiac toxicity, SGPT elevations and ocular toxicity than the daily for five days bolus schedule, but none of these differences attained statistical significance. Although the peak plasma concentrations of tiazofurin achieved with the five day bolus schedule were 3-fold higher than the steady-state plasma levels seen with an equal dose given by CI, the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was approximately 1.6-fold higher with CI. These observations suggest that both high peak plasma concentrations (above 400 microM) and prolonged exposure to plasma levels exceeding 50 microM may result in a higher incidence of serious non-hematologic toxicity.","['Grem, J L', 'Rubinstein, L', 'King, S A', 'Cheson, B D', 'Hawkins, M J', 'Shoemaker, D D']","['Grem JL', 'Rubinstein L', 'King SA', 'Cheson BD', 'Hawkins MJ', 'Shoemaker DD']","['Investigational Drug Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Ribavirin/*adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Ribonucleosides/*adverse effects', 'Ulcer/chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Vomiting/chemically induced']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1990 May;8(2):227-38. doi: 10.1007/BF00177266.,['10.1007/BF00177266 [doi]'],,,46,,,,,,,,,,

CAP57 was detected in the granules of mature peripheral blood neutrophils. However, it was absent from other cells of the peripheral blood: eosinophils, red blood cells (RBCs), and mononuclear cells. In human bone marrow, CAP57 was confined to the neutrophilic series. The earliest stage of development of the myeloid cells at which CAP57 was demonstrated was the promyelocyte. Double immunofluorescent labeling showed that CAP57 was detected in cells positive for myeloperoxidase. The absence of lactoferrin in certain cells (promyelocytes) containing CAP57 indicated that CAP57 was synthesized and packaged in a population of granules prior to the development of granules that contain lactoferrin. CAP57 could not be demonstrated in HL60 cells either by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or by immunocytochemistry. However, the presence of another granule-associated cationic antimicrobial protein of molecular weight 37 Kd (CAP37) was readily detected in undifferentiated HL60 cells. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that CAP57 and BPI were identical. Further indication of the identity between CAP57 and BPI was that monoclonal anti-CAP57 antibodies cross reacted with BPI. Sucrose density-gradient centrifugations showed CAP57 was confined to a granule population that exhibited a buoyant density intermediate of the previously described light and heavy azurophil granules. Further resolution of the individual azurophil granule populations by Percoll density-gradient centrifugation revealed that CAP57 was most concentrated in the density range of 1.093 to 1.100 g/cc. These results strongly suggest the unique finding that CAP57 may be associated with a heretofore unreported granule type.","['Pereira, H A', 'Spitznagel, J K', 'Winton, E F', 'Shafer, W M', 'Martin, L E', 'Guzman, G S', 'Pohl, J', 'Scott, R W', 'Marra, M N', 'Kinkade, J M Jr']","['Pereira HA', 'Spitznagel JK', 'Winton EF', 'Shafer WM', 'Martin LE', 'Guzman GS', 'Pohl J', 'Scott RW', 'Marra MN', 'Kinkade JM Jr']","['Department of Microbiology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (bactericidal permeability increasing protein)', '0 (cationic antimicrobial protein 57, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids/analysis', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides', 'Blood Proteins/analysis/immunology/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Cross Reactions/immunology', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/blood/pathology', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*metabolism']",1990/08/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/08/15 00:00'],"['1990/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Aug 15;76(4):825-34.,['S0006-4971(20)82461-6 [pii]'],,,,"['AI 17662/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 21150/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 22294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

For in vivo experiments a batch of 70 mg Ha6D3 was purified and 6 mg Ha6D3 was injected intravenously into a chimpanzee with time intervals of 10 months and 1 month. The side effects observed were shivering, some muscular spasms and variations in the heart frequency. A decrease of lymphocytes of more than 50% was documented by haematogram analysis. The flow cytometry data showed that the Ha6D3 antigen does not modulate. Even after three repeated injections applied in a time interval of several months no immune response to Ha6D3 could be detected in vivo or in vitro.

However, marrow transplantation is hazardous, costly and applicable to relatively few patients. Therefore, we evaluated the results and limitations of marrow transplantation for CML and discussed new treatment strategies. We decided to select a limited number of papers that focused on the relevant issues rather than to undertake an exhaustive comparison of treatment results from different centres. Patients with CML in the chronic phase who receive marrow from a sibling with the same human leukocyte antigen type can expect to have a long-term disease-free survival rate of 50%. However, the procedure is associated with a mortality rate of 30%, mainly because of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and interstitial pneumonitis. Moreover, because of the requirements for age and histocompatibility only 10% of patients with chronic-phase CML are currently eligible. Transplantation earlier in the chronic phase (within 1 year after diagnosis), the use of marrow from matched, unrelated donors and the development of improved methods for reducing the incidence of GVHD all hold promise. In addition, the preliminary results of intensive therapy followed by transplantation with cultured autologous marrow have been encouraging.

In humans, cases of Q fever are reported in immunocompromised hosts suffering from leukemia, cancer, and human immunodeficiency virus infection (AIDS). Similar data are reported with strict or facultative intracellular parasites living within the phagolysosome. Sporadic publications reported the appearance of auto-antibodies during Q fever which may change the clinical picture of the disease. The pathological findings of hepatitis diagnosed during acute Q fever and those with C. burnetii chronic endocarditis are quite different and may reflect a different immunological response to C. burnetii.

Spontaneous m-RNA expression for GM-CSF was found in only one of 20 patients, and for IL-6 in eight of 11 patients. In vitro incubation of AML cells of eight patients with recombinant tumor necrosis factor for 24 hr revealed induction of GM-CSF m-RNA expression in three cases and GM-CSF protein expression in two of them. These data suggest that spontaneous GM-CSF production occurs rarely in AML and that monokines, such as tumor necrosis factor, may induce GM-CSF in AML cells. Therefore, interactions of AML cells with normal or malignant accessory cells may be important for autocrine stimulation in AML. Our data suggest that ectopic growth factor secretion is not the primary cause of generating AML but may contribute to progression of the disease.

Induction of all these proteins, which have also been found in platelet granules (u-PA on platelet surface receptors) occurs at the level of mRNA accumulation.

The remarkable specificity of this enzyme for myristoyl CoA observed in vivo appears to arise in large part from a cooperativity between NMT's acylCoA and peptide binding sites: the length of the acylCoA bound to NMT influences the interactions of peptide substrates with NMT. We have previously synthesized analogs of myristic acid with single oxygen or sulfur for methylene substitutions. These heteroatom substitutions produce significant reductions in acyl chain hydrophobicity without accompanying alterations in chain length or stereochemical restrictions. In vitro studies have shown that the CoA thioesters of these analogs are substrates for S. cerevisiae NMT and that the efficiency of their transfer to octapeptide substrates is peptide sequence-dependent. In vivo studies with cultured mammalian cells have confirmed that these fatty acid analogs are selectively incorporated into a subset of cellular N-myristoylproteins, that only a subset of analog-substituted proteins undergo redistribution from membrane to cytosolic fractions, and that these analogs can inhibit the replication of human immunodeficiency virus I and Moloney murine leukemia viruses--two retroviruses that depend upon N-myristoylation of their gag polyprotein precursors for assembly. We have now extended our analysis of NMT-acylCoA interactions by synthesizing additional analogs of myristic acid and testing them in a coupled in vitro assay system. Myristic acid analogs with two oxygen or two sulfur substitutions have hydrophobicities comparable to that of hexanoic acid and decanoic acid, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Heuckeroth, R O', 'Jackson-Machelski, E', 'Adams, S P', 'Kishore, N S', 'Huhn, M', 'Katoh, A', 'Lu, T', 'Gokel, G W', 'Gordon, J I']","['Heuckeroth RO', 'Jackson-Machelski E', 'Adams SP', 'Kishore NS', 'Huhn M', 'Katoh A', 'Lu T', 'Gokel GW', 'Gordon JI']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,"['0 (Acyl Coenzyme A)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.97 (glycylpeptide N-tetradecanoyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acyl Coenzyme A/chemical synthesis/*metabolism', 'Acyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/enzymology', 'Substrate Specificity']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Lipid Res. 1990 Jun;31(6):1121-9.,['S0022-2275(20)42752-X [pii]'],,,,"['AI-27179/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07200/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

For patients on continuous daily maintenance therapy for ALL, enhancement of myeloid colony growth in response to IL-1 was proportional to the decrease in colony growth in response to GM-CSF.

From molecular studies, it seemed that Ph- CML with features of true CML always have the bcr rearrangement, while Ph- patients, lacking such rearrangement, have atypical forms of CML.

The amino acid sequences were deduced from the cDNAs of various animals and human. Four uveitopathogenic sites in bovine S-Ag were characterized. One of the sites (peptide M) has sequence homology with non-self proteins from baker's yeast, potato, E. coli, hepatitis B virus, moloney murine leukemia virus, Moloney murine sarcoma virus, AKR murine leukemia virus and baboon endogenous virus. Mononuclear cells from animals immunized with peptide M showed significant proliferation when incubated with synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequences of the above-mentioned foreign proteins. In addition, all the peptides induced EAU in Lewis rats with a dose of 10-2000 micrograms. Moreover, native histone H3 from baker's yeast histone H3 induced EAU in Lewis rats. Thus, we found several examples of antigenic mimicry between self and non-self proteins.

A double-blind cross-over trial on improvements in monocyte polarization and clinical effects.,304-13,"Twenty patients with chronic purulent rhinosinusitis were treated with TP-1 (Serono; 1 mg/kg body weight), in a double-blind cross-over trial. TP-1 was administered by daily i.m. injections for the first 14 days followed by two injections/week for 6 further weeks. The patients were immunologically special in that they had defects in their cell-mediated immune system. Fourteen showed a decreased chemotactic responsiveness of their peripheral blood monocytes as measured in the polarization assay. This defective function can probably be ascribed to the presence in serum of low molecular weight factors (LMWFs; less than 25 kD). As reported earlier, this factor shows a structural homology to the envelope protein of murine and feline leukaemia virus (P15E). Thirteen patients showed a defective delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test reactivity towards candidin and/or streptokinase-streptodornase (Sk/Sd) antigen, 14 had a defective MIF production from their peripheral blood lymphocytes towards candidin, Sk/Sd and/or Haemophilus influenzae antigen. Eighteen patients completed the TP-1 trial and showed clinical improvements: 12 out of 15 were feeling better during TP-1 therapy and the nasal mucosa showed on inspection absent mucopurulent secretion in 13 patients. Positive bacterial culture rates for the nose decreased from 14 out of 16 to five out of 15. Placebo treatment had no significant effects. The clinical improvements were accompanied by a better performance of the cell-mediated immune system; the most significant effects were recorded in the monocyte polarization assay. The suppressive P15E-like LMWFs in serum clearly decreased during TP-1 treatment. In vitro TP-1 neutralized the immunosuppressive effect of the LMWFs. The restoring effects of TP-1 on monocyte polarization and its neutralizing activity of P15E-like LMWFs could explain the beneficial effects of thymic hormone treatment reported in adults with clinical signs of immunodeficiency in the presence of a full T cell repertoire.","['Tas, M', 'Leezenberg, J A', 'Drexhage, H A']","['Tas M', 'Leezenberg JA', 'Drexhage HA']","['Laboratory for Clinical Immunology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Thymus Extracts)', '0 (thymostimulin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chronic Disease', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/*immunology', 'Immunity, Cellular/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Rhinitis/complications/immunology/*therapy', 'Sinusitis/complications/immunology/*therapy', 'Thymus Extracts/*therapeutic use']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1990 Jun;80(3):304-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.1990.tb03286.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2249.1990.tb03286.x [doi]'],,,,,,PMC1535186,,,,,,,

The duration of fever and severe granulocytopenia (less than 0.5 x 10(9)/l) was significantly longer in patients with AOC than in patients without AOC, the median differences between the patients with and without AOC being 4 and 3 days, respectively. Development of AOC could not be correlated to a change in the qualitative composition of the oral microflora. The thrombocyte count was lower in patients with AOC on day 4, whereas no differences were found in leukocyte counts. The prevalences of Candida albicans agglutinin titres greater than or equal to 5 were similar in patients with (24%) and without AOC (33%), and in controls (29%). Seroconversion or a significant increase in the agglutinin titre occurred in 4 patients with AOC and long-lasting fever, who became afebrile after systemic antifungal therapy. It is concluded that AOC is associated with long-lasting fever and decreased bone marrow function as judged by low thrombocyte counts, but not related to specific bacteria in the oral cavity or to an increased occurrence of C. albicans antibodies in the serum.","['Bergmann, O J', 'Andersen, P L']","['Bergmann OJ', 'Andersen PL']","['University Department of Medicine and Haematology, Aarhus Amtssygehus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Infect Dis,Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,0215333,"['0 (Antibodies, Fungal)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Agranulocytosis/complications', 'Antibodies, Fungal/biosynthesis', 'Candida albicans/immunology', 'Candidiasis, Oral/blood/*etiology/immunology', 'Fever', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sepsis/complications']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Infect Dis. 1990;22(3):353-8. doi: 10.3109/00365549009027059.,['10.3109/00365549009027059 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

While leukemia and bone marrow toxicity were related to cumulative exposures of benzene received by workers, no evidence was presented that the rate of exposure at a given cumulative exposure contributed to the effects. Likewise, animal experiments suggested that exposures of several hours duration at a given level of benzene induced more bone-marrow toxicity when administered 3 rather than 5 days/week but did not indicate that the rate of exposure over shorter time scales played any role. The toxicokinetics of benzene in humans were also studied to determine whether nonlinear dose-rate effects would be likely to result from peak exposures associated with an exposure dose of 8 ppm-hr, which is allowed under the permissible exposure limit. This led to three conclusions. First, the concentration of benzene in the bone marrow should be sufficiently damped that the impact of a peak exposure should be minimal. Second, the peak concentration of benzene in the liver should be within the capacity of the cytochrome P450 system to maintain first-order metabolism. And finally, the maximum blood concentration of metabolites should be well below levels which have been shown to induce toxic effects in vitro. Taken together, the toxicokinetic relationships and the absence of clear experimental dose-rate effects suggest that the current STEL for benzene is unwarranted, assuming that 8-hr average exposures are kept below 1 ppm. While the argument can be made, on the basis of health considerations, that the existing 8-hr limit for benzene is too high, the rate of exposure during short periods appears to be irrelevant. Thus, we recommend that health professionals focus upon long-term exposures to benzene received by large numbers of workers rather than devote scarce resources to evaluate transient air levels.","['Paxman, D', 'Rappaport, S M']","['Paxman D', 'Rappaport SM']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley 94720.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,8214983,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/pharmacokinetics/*poisoning/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Species Specificity', 'United States', 'United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol. 1990 Jun;11(3):275-87. doi: 10.1016/0273-2300(90)90027-9.,"['0273-2300(90)90027-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0273-2300(90)90027-9 [doi]']",,,41,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, cotransfection of BCL2 with oncogenes that encode nuclear proteins (E1A and C-MYC) did not produce malignant transformation, whereas HA-RAS did complement with these genes.

The absence of H-2Kk molecules correlates with the ability of these cell lines to form tumors in vivo as well as to escape lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro. In this report it is shown that the 5' regulatory area of the H-2Kk gene failed to activate transcription in H-2Kk-negative cells. Examination of the proteins interacting with the H-2Kk enhancer in expressing and nonexpressing cells revealed clear differences. In particular, the level of a nuclear protein interacting at position -166 was greatly reduced in the negative cell lines. A transcription factor, known as H2TF1 or KBF1, has been shown previously to interact with this binding site and to be essential for the expression of certain class I genes as well as the expression of beta 2-microglobulin.

However, as the mRNA and protein levels recovered, c-myc protein synthesis levels dissociated from the levels of c-myc mRNA and protein accumulation. This dissociation appears to result from unusual translational and posttranslational regulation during differentiation. Translational enhancement was suggested by the observation that relatively high levels of c-myc proteins were synthesized from relatively moderate levels of c-myc RNA. This translational enhancement was not observed with c-myb. Under certain culture conditions, we also observed a change in the relative synthesis ratio of the two independently initiated c-myc proteins. Posttranslational regulation was evidenced by a dramatic postcommitment decrease in the accumulated c-myc protein levels despite relatively high levels of c-myc protein synthesis. This decrease corresponded with a twofold increase in the turnover of c-myc proteins. The consequence of this regulation was that the most substantial decrease in c-myc protein accumulation occurred during the postcommitment phase of differentiation.

This observation suggests that the pleiomorphism of retrovirus-induced lymphomas, which had been suggested previously from the analysis of mouse tumors, is an intrinsic property of the process of oncogenesis and is not due to the transformation of different types of cells by spontaneously arising leukemogenic variants of the inoculated virus. The wide spectrum of phenotypes expressed by these tumors suggests that Moloney murine leukemia virus may infect and transform T cells at various stages of development. Alternatively, the target cells may be immature T-cell precursors which, following transformation, continue to differentiate. A host of early findings, suggesting that the repertoire of target cells is restricted to poorly differentiated hematopoietic progenitors, and the ability of the LE3Sp cell line to differentiate in culture indicate that the latter possibility may be more likely. The data in this report address the extent and mechanism of the phenotypic variability of retrovirus-induced rodent T-cell lymphomas. In addition, they demonstrate the potential usefulness of the T-cell lymphoma lines we have established in studies of oncogenesis and T-cell differentiation.","['Lazo, P A', 'Klein-Szanto, A J', 'Tsichlis, P N']","['Lazo PA', 'Klein-Szanto AJ', 'Tsichlis PN']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/microbiology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Phenotype', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymoma/*immunology/microbiology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*immunology/microbiology']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Aug;64(8):3948-59. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.8.3948-3959.1990.,['10.1128/JVI.64.8.3948-3959.1990 [doi]'],,,,"['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-35553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC249690,,,,,,,

The final enzyme levels show 12-fold (subclone B8/3) and 40-fold (subclone F4N) increases compared to initial values.

Sepiapterin reductase is present in unstimulated F4N cells and absent in B8/3 cells. The enzyme activity is not affected by DMSO treatment in either cell line. This explains why DMSO treatment causes accumulation of tetrahydrobiopterin in the MEL subclone F4N, but not in subclone B8/3. MEL cells are devoid of phenylalanine hydroxylase for which tetrahydrobiopterin serves as cofactor. In F4N, but not in B8/3, tetrahydrobiopterin modulates the rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation, thus being functionally linked with cell proliferation rather than with differentiation. In contrast to T lymphocytes, periods of tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis and of modulator function are uncoupled in MEL cells.","['Kerler, F', 'Ziegler, I', 'Schmid, C', 'Bacher, A']","['Kerler F', 'Ziegler I', 'Schmid C', 'Bacher A']","['GSF-Institut fur Experimentelle Hamatologie, Munchen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Pteridines)', '0 (Pterins)', '22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', 'CJQ26KO7HP (sepiapterin)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.153 (sepiapterin reductase)', 'EC 1.14.16.1 (Phenylalanine Hydroxylase)', 'EC 3.5.4.16 (GTP Cyclohydrolase)', 'EC 4.6.- (Phosphorus-Oxygen Lyases)', 'EC 4.6.10 (6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase)', 'EGX657432I (sapropterin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Biopterin/*analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction', 'GTP Cyclohydrolase/biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Phenylalanine Hydroxylase/analysis', '*Phosphorus-Oxygen Lyases', 'Pteridines/pharmacology', '*Pterins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1990 Aug;189(2):151-6. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(90)90229-4.,['10.1016/0014-4827(90)90229-4 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We isolated three cDNA clones encoding cellular proteins that bind to the p40tax-dependent enhancer of HTLV-1 by screening a lambda gt11 cDNA library of an HTLV-1 infected cell line. All three proteins, TREB5, TREB7 and TREB36, contained a leucine zipper structure and basic amino acid domain, which are conserved in FOS, JUN and CREB, and also had multiple potential phosphorylation sites. The proteins expressed in Escherichia coli bound to the p40tax-dependent enhancer of the 21 bp sequence, but not to an inactive mutant carrying a mutation in the CRE region. In DNase I footprint analysis, all three proteins protected the 21 bp sequences in the LTR; however, the patterns were not identical to each other. TREB7 and TREB36 protected all three repeats of the 21 bp, but TREB5 protected only the second repeat. TREB7 and TREB36 protected the 5' and middle portions of the 21 bp which are essential for p40tax-mediated trans-activation, whereas TREB5 and CREB1 protected a narrower part of the middle region of the second 21 bp repeat containing the CRE consensus sequence. These structural features and DNA binding properties suggest that TREB proteins are members of a CREB protein family and that some of them (i.e., TREB7 and TREB36) may be involved in p40tax-mediated trans-activation.","['Yoshimura, T', 'Fujisawa, J', 'Yoshida, M']","['Yoshimura T', 'Fujisawa J', 'Yoshida M']","['Department of Viral Oncology, Cancer Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (X-Box Binding Protein 1)', '0 (XBP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Gene Library', 'Gene Products, tat/*genetics', '*Genes, Viral', '*Genes, tat', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleotide Mapping', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', '*Transcription Factors', 'X-Box Binding Protein 1']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1990 Aug;9(8):2537-42.,,,,,,,PMC552284,,,,,,,

This pattern consisted of a selective and complete replacement of the B-areas with disappearance of follicles and widening of the medullary cords, an expanded T-zone showing features consistent with dermatopathic lymphadenitis and well-preserved sinuses. Clinically, multiple involved sites at presentation (lymph nodes, spleen, skin, bone marrow, and peripheral blood) and during the 9-year follow-up (testis) were detected, and the disease was associated with a relative indolent course like other low-grade lymphomas.

Ethanol treatment was also associated with a concentration-dependent and transient downregulation of c-myc transcripts. Similar effects were observed for c-myb mRNA levels. The results further show that ethanol exposure is associated with induction of tumor necrosis factor gene expression.

After a clinical and pathological review 14 patients were classified as postpolycythaemic myelofibrosis and 7 patients as a transitional myeloproliferative disorder. In 13 patients a diagnosis of hairy cell leukaemia was made, 3 patients had malignant lymphoma, 2 had malignant histiocytosis, and 1 patient had systemic lupus erythematosus with myelofibrosis. Two patients were excluded for further analysis owing to insufficient data. In the remaining 80 patients a diagnosis of idiopathic myelofibrosis was made. The clinical and laboratory findings in this series of patients are presented and compared to those in previous series. Infectious, cardiovascular, thromboembolic, and haemorrhagic complications were frequent, being recorded in 63%, 50%, 40%, and 33% of the patients, respectively. Various autoimmune phenomena were found in a proportion of the patients, but none had clinical evidence of connective tissue disease. Fifteen patients (19%) had a syndrome of acute myelofibrosis. The diagnostic criteria for this disease entity and its place within the spectrum of myeloproliferative disorders are discussed. In the present series acute myelofibrosis was found to encompass various transitional stages toward the evolution of acute leukaemia. It is proposed that acute or malignant myelofibrosis is considered as an acute variant of idiopathic myelofibrosis. Within this syndrome the acute variant seems to be far more common than previously recognized, which may also explain the marked clinical heterogeneity of the myelofibrosis/osteomyelosclerosis syndrome in this and most previous series.","['Hasselbalch, H']",['Hasselbalch H'],"['Department of Medicine and Haematology C, Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Serum Albumin)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/blood', 'Autoimmunity', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/complications', 'Humans', 'Infections/complications', 'Liver/physiopathology', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications', '*Primary Myelofibrosis/blood/complications/physiopathology', 'Serum Albumin/analysis', 'Splenomegaly/complications', 'Thromboembolism/complications']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1990 Aug;34(4):291-300. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830340411.,['10.1002/ajh.2830340411 [doi]'],,,62,,,,,,,,,,

This also holds for the BNML; thus, conclusions should only be drawn with great caution. Nevertheless, the studies in the BNML model have added considerably to the understanding of various processes that occur during the development of leukemia, e.g., the interaction of leukemic cells and normal hemopoietic stem cells in relation to the microenvironment. The methodology developed in the BNML model allows the quantification of the relative effectiveness of any given treatment with regard to the antileukemic activity compared with the toxicity for normal host tissues. Furthermore, the cell kinetic studies performed in the BNML as a consequence of timed sequential chemotherapy has been helpful in designing an approach to take advantage of this phenomenon in the treatment of acute leukemia. The comparison of the various treatment modalities, employed for the conditioning prior to bone marrow transplantation, made it possible to determine the relative effectiveness of the various approaches. The fractionation of total body irradiation for conditioning purposes was supposed to have a negligible effect with regard to a reduced antileukemic effect. Detailed studies that were conducted in the BNML model did not confirm this hypothesis indicating that (hyper-)fraction of TBI results in a reduced antileukemic effect. The in vitro purging studies in the BNML aimed at the elimination of residual leukemic cells in autologous bone marrow transplantation contributed to the introduction of this method in clinical practice. However, extended studies in the BNML model also indicated that the contribution of the residual leukemia cell in the patient contributed to a much greater extend to the recurrence of leukemia then did the residual cells in the autologous marrow graft. A major contribution of the BNML was achieved in the study of the area of so-called ""minimal residual disease"" (MRD). A number of so-far unknown aspects of relapsing leukemia could be identified and studied. A new concept of discriminating locally relapsing leukemia and a delayed occurrence of generalized spreading of leukemia formed the basis for the explanation of the observed heterogeneity in the distribution of leukemic cells during the remission and the subsequent relapse phase. In conclusion, it is obvious that proper comparison of the human disease as well as the counterpart in the animal model requires a detailed knowledge of both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Martens, A C', 'Van Bekkum, D W', 'Hagenbeek, A']","['Martens AC', 'Van Bekkum DW', 'Hagenbeek A']","['Radiobiological Institute TNO, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/therapy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN/*physiology', 'Rats, Inbred Strains/*physiology']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Apr;4(4):241-57.,,,,164,,,,,,,,,,

The 72-hr assay was found to be sensitive, reproducible and linearly related to the number of viable cells within a broad range of cell concentrations. At clinically achievable drug concentrations, the calcium channel blocker Verapamil (ver) and the immunosuppressant Cyclosporin A (csA) were found to partly reverse acquired Vincristine (vcr) resistance in multi-drug resistant (MDR) T-ALL L100 cells with little or no effect on the drug-sensitive parental L0 cell line. By combining the fluorometric indices, we found that low concentrations of csA were growth-inhibitory, whereas higher concentrations (greater than 10 micrograms/ml) were progressively cytotoxic for drug-sensitive L0 cells. In MDR L100 cells, on the other hand, csA produced significant cell kill even at low drug concentrations. Ver had no effects on sensitive L0 cells but showed considerable cytotoxic action towards MDR L100 cells. There was no apparent relationship between drug reversal of vcr resistance and the cytotoxic actions of the drug per se since the calcium channel blocker diltiazem (dil) significantly potentiated the actions of vcr on MDR L100 cells without being more toxic to these cells (compared to vcr-sensitive L0 cells).","['Larsson, R', 'Nygren, P']","['Larsson R', 'Nygren P']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, Uppsala University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)', 'YL39R93PRE (diacetylfluorescein)']",IM,"['Benzimidazoles', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cytological Techniques/instrumentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fluoresceins', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Fluorometry/instrumentation/methods', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Vincristine/antagonists & inhibitors']",1990/07/15 00:00,1990/07/15 00:01,['1990/07/15 00:00'],"['1990/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1990 Jul 15;46(1):67-72. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910460114.,['10.1002/ijc.2910460114 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report on a patient with AL, which showed a very rapid switch from the lymphoblastic phenotype exhibited at presentation to a myelomonoblastic one, appeared at first relapse, and lastly progressed to an undifferentiated leukemia in the terminal phase. Together with this morphologic and cytochemical evolution, leukemic cells expressed, besides the primary early-B antigens, new immunological markers related to T-lymphocytic and myeloid lineages.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive intermediate dose methotrexate as a 24-h continuous infusion, administered either simultaneously with continuous infusion teniposide or sequentially with the teniposide infusion beginning 12 h after the end of the methotrexate infusion. Plasma samples were obtained during and after infusions at appropriate times for a comprehensive pharmacokinetic study of each drug. Two measured drug concentrations obtained during the infusion were used to adjust each patient's dose rate to achieve target values of 10 microM for methotrexate and 15 microM for teniposide. Pharmacokinetic parameters for teniposide were not different for patients given simultaneous methotrexate from parameters estimated for patients receiving teniposide 12 h after the end of the methotrexate infusion.

Late complications included a skin rash consistent with graft versus host disease; infections with Herpes zoster, hepatitis, and Pneumocystis carinii; and the development of Epstein-Barr virus associated lymphoproliferative syndrome.

To further investigate the heterogeneity observed in the clinical behavior of B-CLL, we determined the phenotype and growth requirements of clonogenic cells from 28 patients with B-CLL from low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups as defined by the Rai staging system. Using methyl-cellulose as a semi-solid media with feeder cells and/or growth factors, colonies were observed with one or more of the culture conditions tested in 25 of 28 CLLs. Phenotypic analysis of colonies demonstrated that the clonogenic cells uniformly expressed la, CD19, CD20, CD5, and the identical light chain as the original CLL cell cultured. However, heterogeneity was observed in clonogenic B-CLL cell growth among the three different CLL risk groups. Clonogenic cells from patients with low-risk CLL required either irradiated unstimulated T cells, with or without conditioned media (CM) or irradiated activated T cells alone for colony formation. Both the number of colonies (227 +/- 15) as well as the number of cells per colony (220 +/- 82) were large, with a mean cloning efficiency of 0.39%. In contrast, clonogenic cells from patients with intermediate- and high-risk CLL required the combination of both irradiated activated T cells and CM. As compared with the low-risk CLLs, both the number and size of the colonies formed by the intermediate- (74 +/- 17, 70 +/- 39) and high- (83 +/- 28, 40 +/- 14) risk groups were significantly lower (P less than .0001). Similarly, the mean cloning efficiency was significantly reduced to 0.15% and 0.14%, respectively. None of the recombinant cytokines (interleukin 1 [IL-1] to IL-7, tumor necrosis factor, alpha and gamma-interferon, B-cell growth factor, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) alone or in combination with each other could entirely replace the stimulatory effect of the activated T cells. These data suggest that clinical progression of B-CLL is associated with a loss of clonogenic potential in the circulating pool of neoplastic cells, which require as yet undefined factors provided by activated T cells and CM.","['Dadmarz, R', 'Rabinowe, S N', 'Cannistra, S A', 'Andersen, J W', 'Freedman, A S', 'Nadler, L M']","['Dadmarz R', 'Rabinowe SN', 'Cannistra SA', 'Andersen JW', 'Freedman AS', 'Nadler LM']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Biological Factors/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Cytokines', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Risk Factors']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Jul 1;76(1):142-9.,['S0006-4971(20)84271-2 [pii]'],,,,"['CA 34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 40216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Whereas P210bcr-abl also occurs in chronic myeloid leukemia, P190bcr-abl is uniquely expressed in Ph'-positive ALL. As a consequence, P190bcr-abl is preeminently a tumor-specific marker in leukemic cells of ALL patients. Because P190bcr-abl is composed of the normal bcr and abl proteins, the major part of the P190bcr-abl molecule comprises nontumor-specific determinants. The joining region between bcr and abl, newly generated during the Ph' translocation, is exclusively a tumor-specific epitope on the P190bcr-abl molecule. Therefore, only antibodies against the bcr-abl joining region will detect the tumor-specificity of P190bcr-abl. In this study a polyclonal antiserum, termed BP-ALL, was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the bcr-abl junction in P190bcr-abl. The reactivity of BP-ALL with native P190bcr-abl derived from a Ph'-positive ALL cell line (TOM-1) was tested using immunoprecipitation analysis. BP-ALL reacted highly specifically with P190bcr-abl but not with P210bcr-abl isolated from chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines. Peptide inhibition studies further confirmed the fine specificity of BP-ALL. Our data indicate that the tumor-specific bcr-abl junction domain is exposed in an antigenic fashion on the P190bcr-abl molecule.","['van Denderen, J', 'van der Plas, D', 'Meeuwsen, T', 'Zegers, N', 'Boersma, W', 'Grosveld, G', 'van Ewijk, W']","['van Denderen J', 'van der Plas D', 'Meeuwsen T', 'Zegers N', 'Boersma W', 'Grosveld G', 'van Ewijk W']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Chimera/immunology', 'DNA/analysis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/analysis', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Jul 1;76(1):136-41.,['S0006-4971(20)84270-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The simple histogram method was most discriminatory and distinguished patients with Sezary syndrome from patients with other types of lymphoid leukemias and reactive lymphocytosis, including infectious mononucleosis. The histogram method could not, however, distinguish patients with Sezary syndrome from patients with T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Japanese T-cell leukemia.

The cells were also tested for the FMC7, defined previously on PLL cells and the RAB1, a newly described hairy cell leukemia antigen. Thirteen out of the 24 samples expressed with variable intensity all the above antigens. While Ia, CD19, CD20, FMC7, and RAB1 were strongly or moderately expressed in all, the complement receptors (CD21 and C3b) were only weakly expressed in 12 cases; and the activation antigens B5, TAC, T9, T10, and PCA1 were found with variable intensity in two-thirds of the cases. In 50% of the cases tested, the CD5 antigen (usually strongly expressed on B CLL cells) was weakly to moderately expressed. These findings (absence or weak expression of complement receptors with variable expression of activation antigens) suggest that the PLL cells are activated B cells. When stimulated in vitro by anti-mu and TPA, (phorbol ester) tumor cells showed a decrease in CD21 and Slg and a stronger expression of CD25, T9, T10, and PCA1, with evidence of Ig secretion in four out of the seven cases studied.

Fifteen patients had stage I, two stage II and three stage III disease at the time of presentation. The faucial tonsils were the primary site in seven cases, other head and neck sites in five, inguinal lymph nodes in four and possibly another, and the abdomen in two. Six cases (30%) were classified as follicular small cleaved cell type (FSCC), five (25%) as follicular mixed small cleaved and large cell (FMC), and nine (45%) as follicular large cell (FLC). The architectural pattern was purely follicular (F) in five cases (20%), predominantly follicular (F greater than D) in six (30%), follicular and diffuse (F = D) in six (30%) and predominantly diffuse (F less than D) in three (15%). In one case a progression from F greater than D LC to F less than D LC was documented. All patients attained complete remission (CR). One died of acute lymphoblastic leukemia 7 yr after the original diagnosis of FSCC non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), but the others are all alive and free of disease with a follow-up ranging from 6 mo to 16 yr (median 4 yr).

Extensive deletion/mutagenesis analysis to identify cis-acting signals involved in virus transmission has led to the design of a family of novel, highly efficient retroviral vectors and a partner helper-free packaging cell line. The pBabe retroviral vector constructs transmit inserted genes at high titres and express them from the Mo MuLV Long Terminal Repeat (LTR). Each of these vectors has been constructed with one of four different dominantly acting selectable markers, allowing the growth of infected mammalian cells in the presence of G418, hygromycin B, bleomycin/phleomycin or puromycin, respectively. The high titre ecotropic helper free packaging cell line, omega E, was designed in conjunction with the pBabe vectors to reduce the risk of generation of wild type Mo MuLV via homologous recombination events. The omega E cell line was generated with separate gagpol and ecotropic env expression constructs with minimal sequence overlap and decreased sequence homology achieved by 'codon wobbling'. Homologous env coding sequences were deleted from the pBabe vectors without diminishing recombinant vector titre. Together, the pBabe vectors and omega E cell line should prove useful in experiments where highest frequencies of gene transfer, or concomitant expression of several different genes within a single cell are required with minimal risk of helper virus contamination.","['Morgenstern, J P', 'Land, H']","['Morgenstern JP', 'Land H']","[""Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial/genetics', 'Exons', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genes, gag', 'Genetic Markers', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transfection']",1990/06/25 00:00,1990/06/25 00:01,['1990/06/25 00:00'],"['1990/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1990 Jun 25;18(12):3587-96. doi: 10.1093/nar/18.12.3587.,['10.1093/nar/18.12.3587 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC331014,,,,,,,

Serial CSF B2-m levels were also measured in 18 patients who received prophylactic intrathecal cytotoxic treatment. CSF B2-m levels were significantly higher in patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement than in those without (p less than 0.001). A CSF B2-m level greater than 1.80 mg/L was closely associated with CNS disease (specificity 96%, sensitivity 76%) and CNS infiltration was also likely when the CSF B2-m level exceeded a simultaneously drawn serum level (specificity 98%, sensitivity 46%). Intrathecal methotrexate prophylaxis resulted in a consistent and significant rise in CSF B2-m levels with an average increase of 96% during a course of intrathecal injections. These results suggest that CSF B2-m levels may not be helpful for predicting early CNS relapse in these patients. However the CSF B2-m level and the corresponding serum B2-m level is a useful adjunct to the cytological diagnosis of CNS involvement by malignancy at presentation. Its value in predicting early CNS relapse and documenting response to CNS treatment requires further clarification.","['Jeffery, G M', 'Frampton, C M', 'Legge, H M', 'Hart, D N']","['Jeffery GM', 'Frampton CM', 'Legge HM', 'Hart DN']","['Department of Clinical Oncology, Christchurch Hospital.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,"['0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Lymphoma/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*cerebrospinal fluid']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathology. 1990 Jan;22(1):20-3. doi: 10.3109/00313029009061421.,['10.3109/00313029009061421 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many interesting characteristics including development of pregnancy-dependent mammary tumors, presence of Fv-2s, a Friend leukemia virus-susceptible gene, high incidence of hydronephrosis and low level of natural killer (NK) cell activity have been reported in this strain of mice. Two congenic strains, DDD-Fv-2r and DDD-Mtv-2+, have been produced. Inbreeding of dd mice maintained at Denken was commenced in 1957 and the resulting inbred strain was named DDD after dd at Denken. The ancestors of dd mice had come from Germany. The process of introduction to Japan and the history of these mice were surveyed in the literatures, since the description concerning them had been confused. As a result, the following history was confirmed: the original colony of mice of an unknown size was introduced from the Hoechst Company, Frankfurt a.m. Main, Germany into the Kitasato Institute, Tokyo, Japan by Dr. Tsuneo Komatsu under the direction of Dr. Sahachiro Hata in autumn, 1928. Dr. Hata and his colleagues bred these mice to use for medical researches and called them ""deutsche Maus"". Their descendants (one male and one female) were shipped to the Health Institute of Manchuria Railway, Talien (currently called Dalian), China on demand of Dr. Koji Ando in 1934. Two males and eight females from the Talien colony were shipped back to Dr. Saburo Kojima, the Institute for Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan in 1943. They had been maintained without crossing with another colony at the Institute, from which mice were distributed to many institutes throughout Japan between 1944 and 1960, and served as the starting nuclei of many inbred or outbred strains. The ""deutsche Maus"" was named dd mice after ""deutsche Maus at Denken"" in 1952.

Four hundred forty-one patients achieved complete remission (CR). By January 1988, 237 patients had been followed-up in first CR for at least 10 years. Ten patients developed SANLL between the 34th and 123rd month of CR. The 15-year SANLL risk is 3.5% +/- 2.7%. Cox's stepwise regression analysis performed with all initial and treatment covariates (sex, age, histology, splenectomy, MOPP chemotherapy, and irradiation extent) showed that the only significant explanatory variable of SANLL risk was the irradiation extent (P less than .002). Using the log-rank test, SANLL risk ranged from 2.2% for supradiaphragmatic irradiation alone to 9.1% for subtotal (STNI) or total nodal irradiation (TNI) (P less than .001).

On behalf of evaluating the changes of disease profile for ten years, we divided the accumulated data into three phases; former phase the first three years, middle phase the second three years and late phase the last four years. There was no significant difference in the frequency of various hematopoietic disorders among the three phases. Each leukemia patients occupied 77% of all cases. Sepsis suspected is the most frequent infectious disease accounting for 68.8%. The other infectious diseases were 8.4% of the sepsis, 14.8% of the respiratory infections and 3.1% of the urinary tract infections. Comparing the frequency of infections among the three phases, the respiratory and urinary tract infections inclined to decrease.

In comparing the percentage of gram-negative bacilli among the three phases, it showed a decreasing tendency in order former phase 63.6%, middle phase 76.4% and late phase 43.8%. Pseudomonas, however, had been isolated at almost constant ratio through ten years. On the other hand, the ratio of gram-positive bacteria isolated were 34.5% in former phase, 23.6% in middle phase and 56.3% in late phase, showing increasing a tendency through the period. Twenty-three kinds of antibiotics were administered by intravenous drip infusion. The efficacy rate was 43.9% to 67.2%. In particular, effectiveness of antibiotic therapy often depends on the change of peripheral neutrophil counts from the onset and during the therapy.

However, other factors including chemotherapy, GVHD, viral infections, host environment, and genetic factors also contribute to the problem. It has been pointed out by critics of bone marrow transplantation that success is often reported as disease-free survival, meaning survival in remission. However, there are, obviously, secondary problems that can significantly impair patients' quality of life, even though their leukemia (or lymphoma) is in unmaintained remission. Very few data on quality of life in long-term surviving patients have been reported. Several studies are currently ongoing (Forman S, Blume K, personal communication), and the results are urgently needed. It will also be of interest to compare patients given, allogeneic transplants with those given autologous marrow infusions in an attempt to determine to what extent conditioning regimens and alloreactivity contribute to long-term side effects.

Transplant within 1 year of diagnosis may provide a greater chance of survival than transplant at a longer interval from diagnosis. T-cell depletion of donor BM significantly reduces the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, but is associated with an increased risk of graft failure and a marked increase in rate of relapse. Early results suggest that HLA-matched or partially HLA-mismatched unrelated donors may be used successfully in cases in which a suitably matched related donor is not available. Autologous transplantation of BM or PB stem cells can result in successful engraftment and possibly prolonged survival in some patients with CML. Following allogeneic BMT, some patients relapse cytogenetically without progressing to hematologic relapse. The use of PCR methodology to amplify bcr-abl transcripts has revealed persistence of the malignant clone in a substantial number of patients who are in hematologic and cytogenetic remission.

An overview of preclinical and clinical studies.,159-69,"Idarubicin is a new derivative of Daunorubicin which was found to be more potent and more active than Daunorubicin and Doxorubicin in several experimental leukemias. Its antileukemic activity in preclinical models prompted the introduction of Idarubicin into clinical studies. As a single agent, Idarubicin produced complete remission in 20% and 30% of patients with heavily pretreated pediatric and adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) respectively. Idarubicin combined with Cytarabine and/or other antileukemic agents produced complete remissions in 46% of patients with refractory or relapsed AML and in 58% of patients with refractory or relapsed ALL (adult and pediatric). Subsequently, Idarubicin has been employed in untreated AML patients in combination with Cytarabine and/or Etoposide, producing complete remissions in more than 80% of patients. In ALL patients the drug has been used in combination with Vincristine, Cytarabine and Prednisone, producing complete remissions in 82% of patients. Recently, Idarubicin has been utilized in combination with intermediate doses of Cytarabine in refractory or relapsed ALL and AML, and 70% of patients achieved complete remission. Preliminary results of ongoing prospective randomized studies in untreated adult AML seem indicate that Idarubicin is at least equivalent, if not superior to Daunorubicin. The antileukemic activity of Idarubicin given orally as single agent, or in combination with other drugs, has been shown in AML and myelodysplastic syndromes. The toxicity of Idarubicin includes mild nausea and vomiting, alopecia and liver dysfunction. Ongoing randomized trials comparing Idarubicin to Daunorubicin should provide more information about the potential cardiotoxicity of this drug.","['Carella, A M', 'Berman, E', 'Maraone, M P', 'Ganzina, F']","['Carella AM', 'Berman E', 'Maraone MP', 'Ganzina F']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Ospedale S.

RNA-primed nascent DNA was radiolabeled by incubating whole-cell lysates with [alpha-32P]ATP and [3H]dTTP in the presence of approximately physiological concentrations of the remaining ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. The primer RNA was purified by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Nuclear subfractionation studies revealed that at least 94% of the primer RNA and RNA-primed nascent DNA were located within the insoluble matrix fraction of the nucleus. The predominant primer RNA isolated from the nuclear matrix was 8-10 nucleotides in length, and several lines of evidence indicated that this oligoribonucleotide was the functional primer RNA. Essentially all of the matrix primer RNA was covalently linked to the newly replicated DNA as demonstrated by its buoyant density in cesium chloride gradients, phosphate-transfer analysis, and sensitivity to DNase I. Analysis of 32P transfer from [alpha-32P]dTTP revealed a random distribution of ribonucleotides at the 3'-end of the primer RNA. Data obtained from mixing experiments indicated that the association of RNA-primed nascent DNA with the nuclear matrix was not the result of aggregation of these fragments with the nuclear matrix.

Four patients had two separate FNABs, and one had three aspiration procedures. The patient population was limited to children and young adults (age range, 2 months to 29 years; mean, 16 years) who were known to have diverse forms of cancer, and who subsequently developed a mass in the peripheral soft tissues (including breast). The interval between the time of diagnosis of the primary malignant neoplasm and FNAB ranged from 1 day to 17 years (mean, 39 months). All FNAB diagnoses were confirmed by subsequent surgical open biopsy or clinical follow-up greater than 1 year. No complications occurred from the procedure. The cytomorphology is presented in selected cases and correlated with the patient's original tissue histopathology. Twenty aspirates were diagnosed as cytologically malignant, one as suspicious for malignancy. Seven were considered benign. None were unsatisfactory. One false-positive and no false-negative cytologic diagnoses were obtained. The overall accuracy of FNAB diagnoses was 96%, while sensitivity was 100% and specificity 88%. Sites of aspiration included soft tissues of the head and neck (seven cases), trunk (eight cases), breast (four cases), and extremities (nine cases). Malignant cytologic diagnoses included sarcoma (thirteen), seminoma (two), lymphoma/leukemia (two), melanoma (one), undifferentiated neoplasm (one), and neuroblastoma (one). Electron microscopy of aspirated cells was used to confirm the diagnosis in two cases. Fine needle aspiration biopsy of soft tissue masses from children and young adults with cancer demonstrates a high diagnostic accuracy, and its use is justified in this population.","['Wakely, P E Jr', 'Powers, C N', 'Frable, W J']","['Wakely PE Jr', 'Powers CN', 'Frable WJ']","['Department of Pathology, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dysgerminoma/diagnosis/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Histological Techniques', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Melanoma/diagnosis/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neuroblastoma/diagnosis/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Sarcoma/diagnosis/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Thoracic Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/ultrastructure']",1990/06/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1990 Jun;21(6):669-77. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(96)90015-5.,"['S0046-8177(96)90015-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(96)90015-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recurrence of underlying malignancy for which transplant had been performed occurred in five patients. Leukoencephalopathy of varying severity was found in eight patients, half of whom had received intrathecal chemotherapy and/or cranial radiation. Patients with systemic graft-versus-host disease had a variety of nonspecific neuropathologic findings in the nervous system; however, nearly half (44%) showed no detectable changes.

Recently, it has been reported that conditioning with high doses of busulfan can successfully replace total body irradiation (TBI), in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia as well as adult chronic myelogenous leukemia. We report here the case of a 29-month-old boy with juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML) transplanted with HLA-identical bone marrow after conditioning with busulfan, etoposide and cyclophosphamide. Successful engraftment was followed by early relapse on day 67. A second HLA-identical transplant was performed following myeloablative treatment with TBI. Engraftment was once again successful and the patient remains free of disease more than 24 months after transplantation.
