A prospective comparison.,581-8,"We compared the outcome of marrow transplantation with that of continued chemotherapy for adults with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia who achieve a first remission. From May 1977 to July 1982, 111 consecutive adults (ages 17 to 50) with newly diagnosed acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia were treated with induction chemotherapy. Ninety patients (81%) had a complete remission. Forty-four remission patients had available donors: 33 received a transplant and 11 did not. Forty-six patients in remission without matched donors were treated with continued chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 5-year, disease-free survival from complete remission are 49% +/- 18% for the transplant group and 20% +/- 13% for the chemotherapy group. When compared to the chemotherapy group, patients undergoing transplantation had a higher risk of dying during the first 6 months after remission induction but a lower risk of dying thereafter. Within the transplant group, only age influenced survival. Within the chemotherapy group, a leukocyte count of greater than 10 000 mm3 at diagnosis, a French-American-British (FAB) Cooperative Group morphologic status of M-4, M-5, or M-6, and the presence of infection at diagnosis were all associated with shorter survival.","['Appelbaum, F R', 'Dahlberg, S', 'Thomas, E D', 'Buckner, C D', 'Cheever, M A', 'Clift, R A', 'Crowley, J', 'Deeg, H J', 'Fefer, A', 'Greenberg, P D']","['Appelbaum FR', 'Dahlberg S', 'Thomas ED', 'Buckner CD', 'Cheever MA', 'Clift RA', 'Crowley J', 'Deeg HJ', 'Fefer A', 'Greenberg PD', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Random Allocation', 'Regression Analysis']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-101-5-581 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1984 Nov;101(5):581-8. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-101-5-581.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with acute or chronic leukemia were stratified by leukemic type and clinical status and included one group of patients considered to be in relapse after complete remission from previous chemotherapy and another group of patients considered refractory to standard induction and/or salvage chemotherapy. During the initial treatment schedule, complete remissions were obtained in two of seven patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia, in one of three patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but in none of the patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia in blast crisis. The durations of remission for these three patients were 22, 57, and 78 days, respectively. An increase in mitoxantrone dose to 12 mg/m2/d produced complete remissions in 8 of 19 evaluable patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia, in one of ten patients with refractory acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia, and in one of four patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia in blast crisis. Each of these patients required only a single course of mitoxantrone to achieve remission; the median time to remission was 37 days (range 18 to 64 days). Remission duration ranged from 35 days (chronic granulocytic leukemia) to 186 days, with the median duration for those patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia achieving remission being 135 days. Of the six patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, none achieved remission at the higher dose level. Drug-related gastrointestinal toxicity included mucositis (25%), diarrhea (21%), and nausea and vomiting (61%). Systemic infection (nonfatal) was experienced by 21% of patients and alopecia by 17%. Other side effects that occurred occasionally were hepatic dysfunction, decreased renal function, confusion, lethargy, anxiety, and fever. Possible drug-related phlebitis developed in one patient, and a single episode of minor epistaxis was reported in another. Cardiovascular toxicity was low. At a mitoxantrone dose of 10 mg/m2/d for five days, one patient developed hypotension, and one episode of congestive heart failure was reported in another. At the higher dose of 12 mg/m2/d, no drug-related hypotension, congestive heart failure, tachycardia, or chest pain were reported. These data indicate that mitoxantrone is a promising single drug for the treatment of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia and possibly for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Moore, J O', 'Olsen, G A']","['Moore JO', 'Olsen GA']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anthraquinones/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(84)90010-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1984 Sep;11(3 Suppl 1):41-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eligible patients included those with adequate renal and hepatic function, normal left ventricular ejection fraction, and those who had received previous treatment. When mitoxantrone was given alone in a once daily times five schedule, 5 of 12 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients achieved complete remission; 4 of these patients had been refractory to reinduction and 1 to induction chemotherapy with anthracycline-containing treatments. Four of these patients had progressive disease, and three died during induction. Of 12 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, 1 had a complete remission, 1 had a partial remission, 8 had progressive disease, and 2 died during induction. Mitoxantrone was also found to be active in two patients in the blastic transformation of chronic myeloid leukemia with a response in one patient lasting 17 weeks. Combinations of mitoxantrone with vincristine sulfate and prednisone resulted in complete remission in four of nine acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients and one of four patients with Tdt-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis. Three of these patients had not experienced a prior remission following anthracycline-containing treatments. Partial remission occurred in two of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients and one of the Tdt-positive chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Two of this latter group of patients died in induction. Treatment with mitoxantrone and cytarabine resulted in two acute myeloid leukemia patients achieving complete remission and one a partial remission; two patients had progressive disease, and one died in induction. No response was seen in a patient with Tdt-negative chronic myeloid leukemia after two courses of treatment. One patient with acute leukemia in the course of myelofibrosis died in induction. All the patients achieving complete remission are alive and have been in complete remission from 2 to 12 months. Side effects included mild nausea and vomiting in 9 of 13 patients treated with the mitoxantrone-vincristine sulfate-prednisone combination, and in 3 of 8 patients treated with the mitoxantrone-cytarabine combination.

NK was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF), by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), and by the plasma antiproteinase alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (alpha-1-X), all of which are specific for serine-dependent proteinases. Substrate specificity was then determined on the basis of the specificity of the plasma and fungal anti-proteinases and synthetic alternate substrates that affected NK. alpha-1-X, which inhibits only serine proteinases with aromatic amino acid specificity, blocked NK. Chymostatin, but not other fungal inhibitors, also blocked NK activity. Furthermore, the only synthetic substrates that effectively reduced NK were those derived from aromatic amino acids. The ester derivatives of these substrates inhibited NK better than the amides.

In this study, the effect of several known protease inhibitors on TPA-induced differentiation of human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (line HL-60) was tested. Among the test compounds, only pentamidine-isethionate (PI), an inhibitor of trypsin-like enzymes, prevented one early marker of differentiation, e.g. cell adherence to plastic and glass surfaces. However, PI failed to affect other markers of differentiation and did not inhibit readherence of scraped and resuspended TPA-treated cells. Exposure to TPA resulted in a decrease in the cellular alkaline proteolytic activity and an increase in the acid proteolytic activity. PI further inhibited the residual activity of the alkaline protease in the 36,000 g pellet fraction of the TPA-treated cells, but did not reduce this activity in control cells. The present results indicate, on the basis of the differential effects of PI, that the emergence of differentiation markers in HL-60 cells following exposure to TPA is independent of the induction of adherence.","['Klemes, Y', 'Kidron, M', 'Mayer, M', 'Fibach, E']","['Klemes Y', 'Kidron M', 'Mayer M', 'Fibach E']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (Amidines)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '673LC5J4LQ (Pentamidine)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amidines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*pathology', 'Pentamidine/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(11)60622-1 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1432-0436.1984.tb01419.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 1984;27(2):141-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-0436.1984.tb01419.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used such an approach to determine whether it is possible to transfer the malignant phenotype of anchorage independence from human AML cells to anchorage-dependent rodent cells, using chromosomes as the source of genetic information. We found that chromosomes isolated from leukemic cell lines were capable of transferring the malignant phenotype of anchorage independence, whereas chromosomes derived from the lymphocytes of normal individuals were not active in this assay. Using Southern blot analysis of the DNA from transferants, we were able to show that the transfer of anchorage independence correlated with the presence of human DNA in the transferants.

Value of monoclonal antibodies].,165-83,"Immunoperoxidase study can be performed either on fixed and paraffin embedded biopsy specimens or on frozen sections. Advantages and limits of these two methods, as well as the results obtained on normal and pathologic lymphoid tissue are presented. Immunoperoxidase on paraffin sections (PAP technic) is a simple method which allows a good morphologic analysis. However, most of the fixatives destroy proteic antigens particularly those linked to the cell membrane. Thus surface immunoglobulins (S.Ig) cannot be detected. In contrast cytoplasmic immunoglobulins remain antigenic enough to be demonstrated in routine paraffin embedded sections. In lymphomas synthesizing monotypic immunoglobulins, the percentage of labelled cells varies from 5 to 80%. Beside the background staining, which can be attenuated by trypsinisation, absorption of extracellular substances is often responsible for a false positive staining. Pathologists are mainly confronted with the passive uptake of extracellular immunoglobulins (IgG K and IgG L), as well as other serum proteins (lysozyme etc...). Immunoperoxidase on frozen sections allows the use of monoclonal antibodies. A large number of surface and cytoplasmic antigens can be detected. First, the localization of B and T lymphocytes, NK cells, interdigitating cells and dendritic reticulum cells within the normal lymph node is described. In the second part, the interest of monoclonal antibodies in differential diagnosis between lymphoma and pseudo-lymphoma, and in phenotyping of lymphomas is discussed. Now, it is possible to perform an in situ immunologic characterization of most lymphomas. B cell lymphomas have sIg associated with other antigens (Pan B+, HLA-DR+). Cells of chronic lymphoid leukaemia and centrocytic (cleaved-cell) lymphomas frequently express T65 (T 101+ or Leu 1+) antigen which is usually found on normal or neoplastic T lymphocytes. Monoclonal antibodies provide new evidence of the germinal centre origin of follicular lymphomas. Thus, monoclonal antibody directed against dentritic reticulum cells (CRD) revealed the same network of DRC in follicular lymphomas as in reactive germinal centres. This finding could account for the nodular pattern of these lymphomas, neoplastic cells being in some way, enclosed within the DRC network. On the other hand, neoplastic follicles are surrounded by a large amount of t lymphocytes. Some T lymphocytes are also found within the follicles where they are associated with NK cells. Lastly, as reactive benign follicles, neoplastic follicles are labelled by the anti-Calla antibody.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Delsol, G', 'Al Saati, T', 'Caveriviere, P', 'Voigt, J J', 'Ancelin, E', 'Rigal-Huguet, F']","['Delsol G', 'Al Saati T', 'Caveriviere P', 'Voigt JJ', 'Ancelin E', 'Rigal-Huguet F']",['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Ann Pathol,Annales de pathologie,8106337,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '8002-74-2 (Paraffin)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Specificity', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Frozen Sections', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Histiocytes/metabolism', 'Hodgkin Disease/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunoenzyme Techniques/standards', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Microtomy/methods', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Paraffin', 'Protein Denaturation', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",1984/06/01 00:00,1984/06/01 00:01,['1984/06/01 00:00'],"['1984/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Pathol. 1984 Jun-Aug;4(3):165-83.,,Etude en immunoperoxydase du tissu lymphoide normal et pathologique.

In vitro kinetics studies suggested the importance of a rapid mode of action for in vivo efficacy, which is not the property of all I-a-T. Ways of accelerating and potentiating such conjugates are proposed, such as the use of lysosomotropic amines like ammonium chloride.

At the same time, newly discovered human cellular oncogenes have been mapped to individual chromosomes, with precise band assignment. Some of the assignments are coincident with the breakpoints of translocations observed in particular tumors. In fact, a relocation of the corresponding oncogenes has been observed in the cells of some of these tumors. Two notable examples are that of the t(9;22) translocation of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), causing the transfer of the oncogene c-abl from chromosome 9 to chromosome 22, and that of the t(8;14) translocation of Burkitt lymphoma, causing the transfer of the oncogene c-myc from chromosome 8 to chromosome 14. These findings can be taken as indicative of a critical role of chromosome alterations in the origin of cancer, through the activation of one or more cellular oncogenes, although there is no firm evidence that such an activation actually occurs. In addition, some concern exists over the validity of accepting in vitro transformation of a cell line by oncogenes as a model of carcinogenesis in man. For these reasons the question on the significance of chromosome alterations in leukemias and lymphomas should not be considered entirely settled yet. Useful models, whose study may lead to the clarification of this important point, are represented by premalignant conditions, such as the myeloproliferative disorders, where chromosome abnormalities are present before the development of a bona fide neoplasm, and by the aneuploidy syndromes, in which there exists an association between a constitutional chromosome anomaly and an increased risk of cancer.","['Neri, G']",['Neri G'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Med Genet,American journal of medical genetics,7708900,,IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics', 'Risk']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajmg.1320180317 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Med Genet. 1984 Jul;18(3):471-81. doi: 10.1002/ajmg.1320180317.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A review.,225-32,"This paper is a review on immune complexes in malignant tumours. High levels of immune complexes have been detected in the serum of patients with malignant solid tumours, leukemias and lymphomas. These studies were performed using non-specific methods. Results obtained by different laboratories are in general coincident; elevated levels of immune complexes in pre-treatment samples and in recurrent disease and, normal values in post-treatment studies indicating a disease free state. Nevertheless, there are certain variations among the results obtained by different techniques suggesting the necessity to check various methods for each tumour type. Although there is no clear evidence that immune complexes in cancer patients contain tumor related products, the current status of clinical research suggests the potential of circulating immune complexes assays for monitoring malignant diseases.","['Segal-Eiras, A', 'Croce, M V']","['Segal-Eiras A', 'Croce MV']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Singapore,Allergol Immunopathol (Madr),Allergologia et immunopathologia,0370073,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/analysis/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'Osteosarcoma/immunology', 'Prognosis']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Allergol Immunopathol (Madr). 1984 May-Jun;12(3):225-32.,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The derived, generalized equations are based on kinetic principles. The method is relatively simple and is not limited by whether the dose-effect relationships are hyperbolic or sigmoidal, whether the effects of the drugs are mutually exclusive or nonexclusive, whether the ligand interactions are competitive, noncompetitive or uncompetitive, whether the drugs are agonists or antagonists, or the number of drugs involved. The equations for the two most widely used methods for analyzing synergism, antagonism and summation of effects of multiple drugs, the isobologram and fractional product concepts, have been derived and been shown to have limitations in their applications. These two methods cannot be used indiscriminately. The equations underlying these two methods can be derived from a more generalized equation previously developed by us (59). It can be shown that the isobologram is valid only for drugs whose effects are mutually exclusive, whereas the fractional product method is valid only for mutually nonexclusive drugs which have hyperbolic dose-effect curves. Furthermore, in the isobol method, it is laborious to find proper combinations of drugs that would produce an iso-effective curve, and the fractional product method tends to give indication of synergism, since it underestimates the summation of the effect of mutually nonexclusive drugs that have sigmoidal dose-effect curves. The method described herein is devoid of these deficiencies and limitations. The simplified experimental design proposed for multiple drug-effect analysis has the following advantages: It provides a simple diagnostic plot (i.e., the median-effect plot) for evaluating the applicability of the data, and provides parameters that can be directly used to obtain a general equation for the dose-effect relation; the analysis which involves logarithmic conversion and linear regression can be readily carried out with a simple programmable electronic calculator and does not require special graph paper or tables; and the simplicity of the equation allows flexibility of application and the use of a minimum number of data points. This method has been used to analyze experimental data obtained from enzymatic, cellular and animal systems.","['Chou, T C', 'Talalay, P']","['Chou TC', 'Talalay P']",['eng'],"['AM 07422/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 27569/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0 (Pyrethrins)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.1 (Alcohol Dehydrogenase)', 'W4X6ZO7939 (1,10-phenanthroline)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/pharmacology', 'Alcohol Dehydrogenase', 'Alcohol Oxidoreductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites/pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Deoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Chemical', 'Phenanthrolines/pharmacology', 'Pyrethrins', 'Rotenone']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(84)90007-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1984;22:27-55. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(84)90007-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Any patient in complete remission is suitable for an autologous bone marrow transplantation. Bone marrow is aspirated from the patient during complete remission, frozen, and stored at -196 degrees C, and it can be used for hematopoietic reconstitution after high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy of the patient. In patients with solid malignant tumors or leukemia the elimination of clonogenic tumor cells from the graft by means of physical separation techniques has not been successful. However, studies in mice and more recently in patients indicate that antibodies destroy residual leukemic cells of the bone marrow transplant without jeopardizing the capacity for regeneration. During our first study in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, bone marrow was taken from 50 patients in remission and cryopreserved. Preservation time ranged from 1 to 60 months and the mean number of aspirated nucleated bone marrow cells was 4 X 10(8)/kg body weight (1.9 - 7.4 X 10(8)/kg). After cryopreservation the stem cell viability of the standard samples was 80% - 100%. Autologous bone marrow was transplanted in five patients with common ALL (cALL). The transplant was prepared by incubation with specific antisera of high cytotoxic, selective activity against cALL cells. Our preliminary results show that bone marrow cells aspirated in remission and prepared with antileukemic antisera stimulate repopulation of the recipient's bone marrow and effect hematopoietic regeneration.","['Netzel, B', 'Haas, R I', 'Thierfelder, S']","['Netzel B', 'Haas RI', 'Thierfelder S']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Recent Results Cancer Res,Recent results in cancer research.

After late effects had become known, the radiation exposure was reduced to doses following which no such effects were found. Thus, it was assumed that one could obtain an optimal medical benefit without inducing any hazard. Later, due to experimental findings, hypotheses arose (linear dose-effect response, no time factor) which led to the opinion that even low and lowest radiation doses were relevant for the induction of late effects. A radiation fear grew, which was unintentionally strengthened by radiation protection decrees: even for low doses a radiation risk could be calculated. Therefore, it was believed that there could still exist a radiation hazard, and the radiation benefit remained in question. If, however, all presently known facts are considered, one must conclude that large radiation doses are hazardous and low doses are inefficient, whereas lowest doses have a biopositive effect. Ionizing radiation, therefore, may cause both, hazard as well as benefit. Which of the two effects prevails is determined by the level of dose.","['Flemming, K']",['Flemming K'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Nuklearmedizin,Nuklearmedizin.

The graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) is a serious complication that affects long-term survivors following bone marrow transplantation. It is the result of an immunologic reaction mounted by the grafted reticuloendothelial cells against the tissues of the recipient, and it affects multiple organ systems. Involvement of the skin and mucosal surfaces of the head and neck region, in particular the oral cavity, occurs in a large number of patients with GVHD. In this report we present four patients with GVHD in whom mucosal lesions and infections of the head and neck region were prominent features. Our observations indicate that the clinical and histological characteristics of these lesions vary according to the time elapsed from the onset of the disease. Therefore, clinical examination of the head and neck region and biopsy of the oral mucosa are important not only in the diagnosis of the GVHD, but also in the evaluation of its progress and response to treatment.","['Medina, J E', 'Frame, R', 'Toth, B', 'Nguyen, L', 'Luna, M H']","['Medina JE', 'Frame R', 'Toth B', 'Nguyen L', 'Luna MH']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Laryngoscope,The Laryngoscope,8607378,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Erythema/pathology', 'Facial Dermatoses/etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*pathology', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lip Diseases/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mouth Diseases/etiology/pathology', 'Mouth Mucosa/*pathology', 'Skin Diseases/etiology/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Tongue Diseases/etiology/pathology', 'Ulcer/etiology/pathology']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1288/00005537-198409000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Laryngoscope. 1984 Sep;94(9):1145-51. doi: 10.1288/00005537-198409000-00003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the 33 patients studied 27 presented with clinically diagnosed acute and/or chronic GvHD, one patient died of bone marrow rejection. Immunohistological analysis of the respective skin biopsies with selected monoclonal antibodies against human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and differentiation antigens of the lympho-hematopoietic cells revealed low dermal mononuclear cell counts with phenotypically normal constituents in five cases with uncomplicated reconstitution post-grafting. In contrast, increased dermal cellular infiltrates predominantly consisting of Lyt 3+, OKT 8+ T-lymphocytes, as well as of a large number of Ia-like (immune response associated = HLA-D) determinant + monocytes/macrophages were observed in all patients with active acute/chronic GvH reactivity. As sign of activation simultaneous expression of HLA-D region products was also found on a subset of the invading OKT8+ T-lymphocytes. Progression of GvHD was associated with additional surface staining of keratinocytes for Ia-like determinants. Loss of Ia-like determinant+, OKT6+ dentritic epithelial cells in all leukemic patients, as well as in patients with aplastic anemia with or without GvHD suggested damage of Langerhans cells due to the previous radiotherapy and/or specific immunological destruction. In patients with fatal outcome of GvHD prolonged reduction of these dentritic epithelial cells seemed to be indicative of impaired immune reconstitution or bone marrow dysfunction. Thus immunopathological features of skin GvHR may enable early recognition and prognostic evaluation of this disease possibly allowing more effective therapy.","['Muller, C', 'Ostendorf, P', 'Wernet, P', 'Schuch, K', 'Wahl, H', 'Waller, H D']","['Muller C', 'Ostendorf P', 'Wernet P', 'Schuch K', 'Wahl H', 'Waller HD']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Wochenschr,Klinische Wochenschrift,2985205R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Biopsy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Skin/*immunology/pathology', 'Time Factors']",1984/07/16 00:00,1984/07/16 00:01,['1984/07/16 00:00'],"['1984/07/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/16 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01716464 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Wochenschr. 1984 Jul 16;62(14):675-88. doi: 10.1007/BF01716464.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these cell surface components, T8 is of particular interest because it is required during the recognition of target cells by a subset of CTL. An understanding of its role during CTL:target adhesion requires detailed biochemical structural analysis of the T8 molecule. This has been hindered by the small amounts of protein currently available. Here we describe the development of a purification scheme that will permit the accumulation of larger quantities of T8. We studied the binding of T8 to several lectins and determined that one of these, wheat germ agglutinin, bound T8 quantitatively. Experiments designed to test the properties of T8 in a phase separation system with the use of Triton X-114 were performed. These indicated that T8 partitions into the aqueous phase rather than the detergent phase during this procedure. With this in mind, we developed a protocol that resulted in a significant purification of T8 after affinity chromatography. Upon preparative SDS-PAGE followed by electroelution, the T8 antigen was purified to homogeneity and used for N-terminal acid acid sequencing. This analysis yielded the amino terminal 22 amino acids of T8. On purification, it was observed that the protein existed as two bands of Mr 33 and 34 kilodaltons after SDS-PAGE analysis. The relationship between these chains was investigated by limited radio-sequencing and tryptic peptide map analysis; our results indicated that the two polypeptides were identical. The two chains were treated with trifluoromethane sulfonic acid to determine whether carbohydrates accounted for the difference in m.w. This reagent, which cleaves both N-linked and O-linked sugars, cleaved approximately 2000 daltons of oligosaccharides from the T8 molecule. These oligosaccharides are most likely of the O-linked rather than the N-linked variety.","['Snow, P M', 'Keizer, G', 'Coligan, J E', 'Terhorst, C']","['Snow PM', 'Keizer G', 'Coligan JE', 'Terhorst C']",['eng'],"['AI-17651/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Detergents)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Cell Line', 'Detergents/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/analysis', 'Receptors, Mitogen/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1984 Oct;133(4):2058-66.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

None of the fractions of the enzyme from RBL cells formed LTC4 from LTA4. The microsomal glutathione S-transferase from rat liver also produced LTC4 from LTA4. It differs from the microsomal LTC synthetase of RBL cells in at least two respects: (1) The enzyme from RBL cells did not react with chromophoric substrates like dinitrochlorobenzene while the enzyme from liver did react. (2) Triton X-100 potentiated the activity of the enzyme from basophil leukemia cells and solubilized it, while it inhibited the activity of the leukotriene-synthesizing enzyme in the rat liver preparation.

Methods have been developed to compare pre- and post-TBI CT of lung. The average local features of a cross-sectional lung slice are extracted from three peripheral regions of interest in the anterior, posterior, and lateral portions of the CT image. Also, density profiles across a specific region may be obtained. These may be compared first for verification of patient position and breathing status and then for changes between pre- and post-TBI. These may also be compared with radiation dose profiles through the lung. A preliminary study on 21 leukemia patients undergoing total body irradiation indicates the following: (a) Density gradients of patients' lungs in the antero-posterior direction show a marked heterogeneity before and after transplantation compared with normal lungs. The patients with departures from normal density gradients pre-TBI correlate with later pulmonary complications. (b) Measurements of average peripheral lung densities have demonstrated that the average lung density in the younger age group is substantially higher: pre-TBI, the average CT number (1,000 scale) is -638 +/- 39 Hounsfield unit (HU) for 0-10 years old and -739 +/- 53 HU for 21-40 years old. (c) Density profiles showed no post-TBI regional changes in lung density corresponding to the dose profile across the lung, so no differentiation of a radiation-specific effect has yet been possible.

Ammonia-dependent bactericidal, cytotoxic, and cytolytic activities of the chloramines.",10404-13,"Isolated human neutrophilic leukocytes were stimulated to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and to secrete cytoplasmic granule components including myeloperoxidase into the medium. Myeloperoxidase catalyzed the oxidation of chloride (Cl-) by H2O2 to yield hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which reacted with endogenous nitrogen compounds to yield derivatives containing nitrogen-chlorine (N-Cl) bonds. Compounds available for reaction with HOCl were ammonia (NH+4), taurine, alpha-amino acids, and granule proteins and peptides that were released into the medium. A portion of the N-Cl derivatives formed under these conditions accumulated in the extracellular medium. These long lived oxidizing agents were characterized as hydrophilic, low molecular weight, mono-N-chloramine (RNHCl) derivatives based on their absorption spectrum, ability to oxidize 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid and to chlorinate ammonia (NH+4), and behavior upon ultrafiltration, gel chromatography, and extraction with organic solvents. The RNHCl derivatives were of low toxicity, but reacted with NH+4 to yield the lipophilic oxidizing agent monochloramine (NH2Cl). Therefore, the addition of NH+4 conferred bactericidal, cytotoxic, and cytolytic activities on the RNHCl derivatives. The results indicate that taurine and other neutrophil amines protect neutrophils and other cells against oxidative attack by acting as a trap for HOCl and by competing with endogenous NH+4 for reaction with HOCl. However, the RNHCl derivatives act as a reserve of oxidizing equivalents that is converted to a toxic form when an increase in NH+4 concentration favors formation of NH2Cl.","['Grisham, M B', 'Jefferson, M M', 'Melton, D F', 'Thomas, E L']","['Grisham MB', 'Jefferson MM', 'Melton DF', 'Thomas EL']",['eng'],"['AI 16795/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DE 04235/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Amines)', '0 (Chloramines)', '0 (Chlorides)', '7664-41-7 (Ammonia)', '9010-72-4 (Zymosan)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amines/*blood', 'Ammonia/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Chloramines/blood/*toxicity', 'Chlorides/*blood', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/physiology', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', 'Escherichia coli/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/blood', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/toxicity', 'Zymosan/pharmacology']",1984/08/25 00:00,1984/08/25 00:01,['1984/08/25 00:00'],"['1984/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)90979-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1984 Aug 25;259(16):10404-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although normal stem cells are present in such patients, their differentiation is somehow suppressed. However, their presence may be demonstrated either by cell culture studies, employing G6PD as the marker in appropriately selected cases, or by their emergence in patients subjected to marrow ablative chemotherapy. Suppression of normal stem cell growth and development does not require a hyperproliferative marrow, and the current data do not support the notion that normal stem cells are simply reduced in frequency by a vast increase in the numbers of neoplastic progenitors. It is likely, therefore, that such suppression involves cellular signals, operating over short distances (perhaps through cell-to-cell contact), which interfere with normal progenitors. Thus, stem cell culture techniques, in combination with cell markers, have provided a direct and informative way to approach the issues of disease pathogenesis, the kinetics of stem cell differentiation, and the interaction of normal and neoplastic cells in patients with clonal haemopathies.","['Adamson, J W']",['Adamson JW'],['eng'],"['AM-19410/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Clin Haematol,Clinics in haematology,0331547,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Genetic Markers', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/analysis', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency/genetics', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Pancytopenia/genetics/pathology', 'Polycythemia Vera/genetics/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/genetics/pathology', 'Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Thrombocytosis/genetics/pathology']",1984/06/01 00:00,1984/06/01 00:01,['1984/06/01 00:00'],"['1984/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Haematol. 1984 Jun;13(2):489-502.,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stable mutants were obtained by continuous selection at ara-A concentrations of 1 or 2.5 microM in the presence of the adenosine deaminase inhibitor 2'-deoxycoformycin. Four clones selected for further investigation were 4- to 11-fold less sensitive to the cytotoxicity of ara-A than the parental CCRF-CEM line. These clones also showed cross-resistance to deoxyadenosine and thymidine, but normal sensitivity to arabinosylcytosine and adenosine, and increased sensitivity to the etoposide VP16-213. No change was found in the activity of kinases that phosphorylate ara-A and the various nucleosides that could account for the resistant phenotype in these mutant lines. Resistance was associated with a 2- to 8-fold increase in the level of all four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. The triphosphate pools in the mutants were resistant to the inhibition produced in wild-type cells by addition of deoxy-adenosine or thymidine, although significant activation in the deoxyguanosine triphosphate pool was obtained by higher concentrations of thymidine. An examination of ribonucleotide reductase in extracts of two of the mutants revealed a specific alteration in the normal sensitivity of the enzyme for deoxyadenosine triphosphate and adenosine triphosphate but not 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine 5'-triphosphate. When the level of ribonucleotide reductase activity was measured, it was found that the ara-A-resistant cells contained approximately twice the wild-type level of cytidine diphosphate reductase activity at physiological adenosine triphosphate level. This combination of increased enzyme activity and alteration in sensitivity to the nucleoside triphosphates could account for both the changes in deoxyribonucleotide pool sizes and the resistant phenotype of the presumed mutants.","['Fridland, A']",['Fridland A'],['eng'],"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology', 'Mutation', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*toxicity']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Oct;44(10):4328-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The demonstration of peroxidase activities at the ultrastructural level and immunofluorescence labeling with a panel of monoclonal antibodies, including an antiplatelet glycoprotein Ib and an antiglycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex, on blood or marrow cells, permitted identification of otherwise unidentifiable promegakaryoblastic proliferation. In two patients, the use of an immunoperoxidase technique with an antifactor VIII-R-Ag antibody has allowed direct confirmation of this diagnosis on bone marrow sections. This megakaryoblastic proliferation was not pure and was variably associated with blasts of other cell lines (erythroblasts or myeloblasts). Changes in the population of blasts were observed during evolution in two patients. The sixth patient had a mild thrombocytopenia associated with severe neutropenia and anemia. Bone marrow biopsy displayed a myelofibrosis and immature cells, without megakaryocytic proliferation. Ultrastructural study revealed a pure basophil-mast cell proliferation.

The L2C leukaemic cells of guinea pigs, which closely resemble those of human lymphoma in expression and metabolism of immunoglobulin have been used as a model. Exposure of neoplastic B cells to antibody results in rapid binding of approximately 420,000 molecules of antibody per cell at saturation, and the amount consumed does not increase markedly over the next 4 h of exposure at 37 degrees C. This is in spite of the fact that secretion of idiotypic IgM continues unaffected by the presence of antibody, and reflects the fact that the amount of IgM secreted during this period is low compared to the amount displayed on the cell surface. If cells undergo lysis, however, the antibody consumed is approximately doubled: thus a recipient with an estimated tumour load of 10(12) cells would require 200 mg of monoclonal anti-idiotype for binding to surface and intracellular antigen. The effect of the soluble idiotypic IgM found in serum on the ability of antibody to bind target cells has been examined by means of the fluorescence activated cell sorter. Access of antibody to the cells is efficiently blocked by competing idiotypic IgM in the fluid phase, with no indication of preferential binding to cell surface idiotype.

Our goal was to determine if these transformed cells expressed antigens associated with malignancy. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with DNA fragments from a human acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL 1-69), and transformed colonies were selected for growth in soft agar. Transfected cells containing human DNA sequences demonstrated by Southern blot analysis were used to immunize Balb/C mice. Monoclonal antibodies were produced and screened for binding to the parental leukemia (ALL 1-69), transfectant (17(2], and 3T3 cells in an enzyme-linked assay. A monoclonal antibody (IgM kappa) designated 17-9H3 bound to ALL 1-69 and secondary transfectant 17(2) but not to NIH 3T3 plasma membranes. Immunoperoxidase staining confirmed this binding pattern and demonstrated that the antigen was expressed on the cell surface. Expression of the antigen by transfectants directly correlated with the presence of a single 6.1 kilobase human DNA sequence. The antibody binding site of the antigen was inactivated by trypsin, glucosidase, and hyaluronidase. Binding of the 17-9H3 antibody was selective for acute lymphocytic leukemias (5/8) and osteogenic sarcomas (33/36), although other tumor types did demonstrate significant binding by immunoperoxidase staining. The majority of normal tissues did not bind 17-9H3 with the exception of some metabolically active cells (renal tubular epithelium, secretory epithelial cells, and cardiac smooth muscle), germ cells, Leydig cells of the testes, and some lymphoid cells. Monoclonal antibodies to oncogene-associated antigens may be potentially useful for cancer diagnosis and therapy and as probes for oncogene isolation.","['Roth, J A', 'Scuderi, P', 'Westin, E', 'Gallo, R C']","['Roth JA', 'Scuderi P', 'Westin E', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Surgery,Surgery,0417347,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*biosynthesis', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fibroblasts/analysis/immunology', 'Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Membrane Proteins/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'Oncogenes', 'Transfection']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Surgery. 1984 Aug;96(2):264-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The capacity for thymus repopulation of bone marrow cells from 4 X 1.8 Gy irradiated mice is decreased to a similar low level as that of regenerating bone marrow derived from lethally irradiated mice reconstituted with isogeneic marrow. It was calculated that the prothymocyte content of both types of regenerating marrow was less than 0.1% of that of normal marrow. Long-term cultures of C57BL bone marrow were found to contain the same numbers of prothymocytes per CFU-S as normal bone marrow, in contrast to cultured marrow from (C3H X AKR)F1 mice, that shows a striking decrease of prothymocytes. Normal bone marrow cells and long-term cultured bone marrow cells of C57BL mice were about equally effective on the basis of numbers of CFU-S injected in protecting 4 X 1.8 Gy irradiated syngeneic recipients from developing thymic lymphomas, while regenerating bone marrow was virtually nonprotective.

Of these, 235 were evaluable for analysis of the relation of GR levels to clinical outcome. For the 42 patients in the earlier Total Therapy Study IX, lower GR levels (less than 16,000 sites/cell) were associated with both induction failure and more frequent relapse (p less than 0.01) [Cancer Research, Vol. 42, p. 4801 (1982)]. When patients with 'high-risk' features (leukocyte count greater than 100 X 10(3)/mm3, positive erythrocyte rosette test, central nervous system involvement, and mediastinal mass) were excluded, lower receptor levels were still associated with early and more frequent relapse (p less than 0.02). The other 193 evaluable patients were consecutively admitted to Total Therapy Study X, in which patients with 'standard-risk' or 'high-risk' features were assigned to separate protocols--XS and XH, respectively. Induction chemotherapy in both protocols consisted of prednisone, vincristine and L-asparaginase; patients in the XH protocol received additional epipodophyllotoxin (VM-26) and cytosine arabinoside twice a week for 2 weeks preceding the conventional induction therapy. To compare the prognostic value of GR level in Study X with that of Study IX (which included both 'high-risk' and 'standard-risk' patients but did not separate them into different protocol groups), children in the XH and XS protocols were analysed together. The proportion of patients with 'standard-risk' features was the same in the two studies: 69% in Study IX and 73% in Study X. In Study X, which had a significantly better treatment result (p less than 0.001), lower receptor levels were not associated with induction failure, but were correlated with more frequent relapse (p less than 0.05). When patients in XH and XS protocols were analysed separately, however, receptor levels were no longer related to treatment outcome. Thus, GR level in childhood ALL has prognostic value, but it is not an independent factor and its importance is related to the efficacy of treatment.","['Pui, C H', 'Ochs, J', 'Kalwinsky, D K', 'Costlow, M E']","['Pui CH', 'Ochs J', 'Kalwinsky DK', 'Costlow ME']",['eng'],"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*analysis', 'Receptors, Steroid/*analysis']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(84)90073-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1984;8(3):345-50. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(84)90073-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infusion rates of 0.7 to 1 mg/min were associated with unacceptable toxicity in the presence of circulating target cells, but slower rates were well-tolerated. Immunofluorescence techniques confirmed that circulating cells did bind the antibody in vivo and were subsequently removed from the circulation. Modulation of the antigen on target cells in the bone marrow and skin has important implications for the schedule of administration of such antibodies, and points out the possible limitation of effector cell-mediated cytotoxicity at the tissue level. Production of anti-mouse antibodies resulted in neutralization of therapy in two patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and suggests that whether such an anti-mouse response is produced may be secondary to the underlying immune status of the patient or the amount of mouse protein to which immunocompetent cells are exposed. The relative specificity and efficacy of monoclonal antibody therapy is encouraging, but the limited clinical benefit and problems of modulation and anti-mouse antibody production underscore the need for continued research into passive therapy and suggest that cytotoxic conjugates may be of more clinical value.","['Dillman, R O', 'Shawler, D L', 'Dillman, J B', 'Royston, I']","['Dillman RO', 'Shawler DL', 'Dillman JB', 'Royston I']",['eng'],['N01-CM-07444/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Bronchial Spasm/etiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Sezary Syndrome/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Skin Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Urticaria/etiology']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1984.2.8.881 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1984 Aug;2(8):881-91. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1984.2.8.881.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty patients were deemed evaluable, 20 on each arm. The overall complete remission (CR) rate for all patients in both arms was 28% (11/40). There was no significant difference in CR rates between the two arms. There were 12 early deaths (less than 60 days) in the F DAT arm compared with only five early deaths on the At DAT arm (P = .05). Due primarily to this early death rate, the median survival for the F DAT group was 29 days v 159 days for the At DAT groups (P = .02). The range of survival of the patients in CR for the At DAT group given either one or two cycles of induction therapy was 121 to 414 days, while the survival range for the F DAT CR patients was 121-186 + days. The median survival for those not achieving CR was 14 days for the F DAT group v 80 days for the At DAT (P less than .02). Fifty-nine percent of the At DAT patients spent greater than 100 days out of the hospital v 12% for the F DAT group. Attenuated chemotherapy with lower doses of DAT is the preferred induction regimen for elderly patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia since it causes fewer early deaths, allows a better quality of life, and yields survival times as durable as intensive therapy.","['Kahn, S B', 'Begg, C B', 'Mazza, J J', 'Bennett, J M', 'Bonner, H', 'Glick, J H']","['Kahn SB', 'Begg CB', 'Mazza JJ', 'Bennett JM', 'Bonner H', 'Glick JH']",['eng'],"['CA 14958/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18281/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 20182/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Quality of Life', 'Random Allocation', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/chemically induced', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1984.2.8.865 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1984 Aug;2(8):865-70. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1984.2.8.865.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The addition of untreated sera to SAC-treated cultures partly abrogated the effect, suggesting a blocking substance in untreated serum. Cytotoxicity was not complement-dependent nor did it appear to be cell mediated. It was, however, eliminated by trypsin treatment of SAC-treated sera. These studies suggest that SAC-treated AML serum contains a protein that is cytotoxic to AML blasts, and that this protein is partly inactivated by untreated AML serum, possibly through interaction with immunoglobulins.

A total of 12 patients received 1, 10, or 40 mg doses administered over 2 hr, or 50 or 100 mg doses administered over 50 hr. Decreases in T65 antigen expression (up to 90%) coincided with decreases in the circulating leukemic cell count in those patients who received T101 over a 2-hr period, indicating that clearance of circulating T65 antigen-positive cells could account for most of the observed decreases in T65 antigen expression. In contrast, analysis of bone marrow specimens from these patients indicated that decreases in T65 antigen density in this relatively stationary population resulted not from a cell decrement but rather from antigenic modulation. Pulmonary toxicity prevented administration of doses greater than 40 mg over a 2-hr period; therefore, higher doses (50 and 100 mg) were administered over a 50-hr period. This treatment schedule resulted in greater than 90% reduction in T65 antigen density of both circulating and bone marrow leukemic cells without dramatic drops in circulating leukemic cell counts, indicating that antigenic modulation accounted for most of the observed decreases in T65 antigen density under these conditions. Reexpression of T65 antigen by modulated cells was observed both in vitro and in vivo within 2 to 4 days. Immunoperoxidase staining of in vivo-modulated specimens and in vitro modulation studies with 125I-T101 suggested that T65 antigen-T101 antibody complexes were internalized during modulation. Although antigenic modulation inhibits the potential therapeutic effectiveness of unconjugated T101 antibody in CLL patients, treatment of CLL with T101 drug or toxin immunoconjugates under conditions that bring about rapid and extensive internalization of the T65 antigen may provide an effective means of therapy.","['Schroff, R W', 'Farrell, M M', 'Klein, R A', 'Oldham, R K', 'Foon, K A']","['Schroff RW', 'Farrell MM', 'Klein RA', 'Oldham RK', 'Foon KA']",['eng'],['N01-CO-23910/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/therapy', '*Membrane Glycoproteins']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1984 Sep;133(3):1641-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A case report.,196-200,"A previously healthy 8-year old girl was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, and, while she was in first remission, she received a bone marrow transplant from her atopic brother. Studies 1 to 2 years after transplantation revealed that the marrow recipient had a specific-IgE production of donor-type pattern, indicated by the similar skin prick test results and RAST scores in the donor and recipient demonstrating allergy to animal dander and house dust. The recipient's own immunity had been destroyed by the preparative regimen for marrow transplantation, and no lymphoid cells of host origin could be found after transplantation in the chromosome analysis. A sensitization of the recipient to animal dander after transplantation was very unlikely because no animal contacts were present, and the chronic liver graft-versus-host disease of the patient additionally suggested a delayed immunologic recovery. The case history suggests that atopy can be transferred by bone marrow transplantation from donor to recipient. A possible mechanism appears to be a passive transfer not only of lymphoid precursors but also of mature memory cells within the bone marrow inoculum.

A model for discrete stages of neoplastic and normal pre-B cell differentiation.,332-40,"The expression of B cell associated and restricted antigens on tumor cells isolated from 138 patients with non-T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (non-T cell ALL) was investigated by flow cytometric analysis by means of a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Tumor cells from these patients could be assigned to one of four subgroups: human leukocyte antigen-DR-related Ia-like antigens (Ia) alone (4%, stage I); IaB4 (14%, stage II); IaB4CALLA (33%, stage III); and IaB4CALLAB1 (49%, stage IV). The expression of B cell-restricted antigens (B4 and B1) and rearrangements of Ig heavy chain genes provided strong evidence for the B cell lineage of stages II, III, and IV tumors. The lineage of the Ia alone group is still unknown. The B4 antigen was expressed on approximately 95% of all non-T cell ALLs tested, and given its absence on T cell and myeloid tumors, it appears to be an exceptional marker to define cells of B lineage. The demonstration that Ia alone, IaB4, IaB4CALLA, and IaB4CALLAB1 positive cells can be readily identified by dual fluorescence analysis in normal fetal and adult bone marrow provided critical support for the view that these leukemic pre-B cell phenotypes were representative of the stages of normal pre-B cell differentiation. It was interesting that the IaB4+ cell was more frequently identified in fetal bone marrow than in adult marrow, whereas the predominant cell found in adult marrow expressed the IaB4CALLAB1 phenotype. These data suggest that the leukemogenic event may be random, since the predominant pre-B cell leukemic phenotype appears to correspond to the normal pre-B cell phenotype present in these hematopoietic organs. Our observations provide an additional distinction between adult and childhood ALL, since these studies show that most non-T cell ALLs seen in children less than 2 yr old are of stage II phenotype, whereas the majority of non-T ALLs in adults are of stage IV phenotype. Finally, it should be noted that the present study suggests that the analysis of leukemic B cell phenotypes and their normal counterparts can provide a mechanism for the investigation and orderly definition of stages of pre-B cell differentiation in man.","['Nadler, L M', 'Korsmeyer, S J', 'Anderson, K C', 'Boyd, A W', 'Slaughenhoupt, B', 'Park, E', 'Jensen, J', 'Coral, F', 'Mayer, R J', 'Sallan, S E']","['Nadler LM', 'Korsmeyer SJ', 'Anderson KC', 'Boyd AW', 'Slaughenhoupt B', 'Park E', 'Jensen J', 'Coral F', 'Mayer RJ', 'Sallan SE', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['CA 25369/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI111428 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1984 Aug;74(2):332-40. doi: 10.1172/JCI111428.,,,PMC370483,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peptide mapping experiments indicate that these two substrates are closely related but are distinct from the major 58,000-dalton tyrosine protein kinase substrate found in T lymphocytes. To determine if the same kinase is active in both B and T lymphocytes, their substrate specificities were compared using two exogenously added substrates: angiotensin I and the cytoplasmic domain of the erythrocyte band 3 protein. LSTRA, a lymphoma cell line that expresses elevated levels of the T lymphocyte kinase (Casnellie, J. E., Harrison, M. L., Hellstrom, K. E., and Krebs, E. G. (1983) J. Biol.

TBI was delivered from two opposing 60Co sources at an exposure rate of 4 to 8 cGy/min, either as a single dose of 10 Gy (105 patients) or in fractions (76 patients), usually at increments of 2 to 2.25 Gy/day for 6 to 7 days for cumulative doses of 12 to 15.75 Gy. To date, 86 patients have developed cataracts. Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates of the incidence of cataracts for patients given chemotherapy only and no TBI, single-dose TBI, and fractionated TBI are 19, 80, and 18%, respectively. On the basis of proportional hazards regression analyses, patients given single-dose TBI had a relative risk of developing cataracts that was 4.7-fold higher than in patients given fractionated TBI or chemotherapy only (p less than 0.00005), suggesting a significant sparing effect with use of TBI dose fractionation.

The effects were evaluated in a normal and a leukemic mouse model using the endogenous colony-former technique. Splitting the TBI to give part of the total dose before the first dose of drug was found to enhance stem cell kill in some instances, but not in others. The optimum proportion of TBI given as the first dose did not appear to exceed 100 rads. When a higher proportion of the total TBI was given as the initial dose there was an indication of a protective effect on the stem cells with the PIP-TBI protocols, but similar protection was not observed with the CY-TBI protocols. When CY and PIP were combined together in the same protocol it was found that a simple inversion of the order of these two drugs could result in a six-fold difference in the extent of stem cell ablation achieved, indicating that with multiple drug protocols the drug sequencing itself could be equally important as the manner in which the radiation is given.","['OKunewick, J P', 'Buffo, M J', 'Kociban, D L']","['OKunewick JP', 'Buffo MJ', 'Kociban DL']",['eng'],['CA26838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Piperazines)', '64474-15-3 (3,6-bis(5-chloro-2-piperidyl)-2,5-piperazinedione)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/therapy', 'Mice', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Preoperative Care', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(84)90182-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(84)90182-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1984 Jul;10(7):1087-93. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(84)90182-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibody reagents (HP1-1D antibody and anti-factor VIII antibody, respectively) and an immunocytochemical staining technique to identify the megakaryocytic nature of the leukemic cells of 12 patients who presented with acute leukemia. The leukemic cells of our patients demonstrated the presence of one or both of these platelet- and megakaryocyte-related antigens, but were negative for all of the commonly employed cytochemical and immunocytochemical staining reactions, except for diffuse acid phosphatase activity and granular PAS positivity. Morphologically, the leukemic cells varied in size from 10 to 40 microns in diameter, frequently had cytoplasmic budding, and contained occasional vacuoles and/or peroxidase-negative azurophilic granules. Five patients presented with syndromes of acute myelofibrosis, and seven patients had otherwise unclassifiable acute leukemias, including three patients who had secondary leukemias. Diffuse reticulin myelofibrosis was present in all cases in which it was sought. Chromosomal abnormalities of leukemic cells were found in five cases. Two patients had deficiencies of plasma coagulation factor V. Study of one patient revealed significant platelet dysfunction. When cytoreductive chemotherapy of leukemia was attempted, the observed response was generally poor, with the exceptions of one patient who has remained in complete remission following treatment with etoposide (VP-16) and a second patient who attained remission following bone marrow transplantation. These cases of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia represented from 3.6% to 9.3% of all acute leukemia cases diagnosed concomitantly in our institution. Acute leukemia with megakaryocytic differentiation may occur more frequently than previously recognized, may present with differing syndromic features, and can be identified by the use of specific antibody reagents and relatively simple immunocytochemical techniques.","['Huang, M J', 'Li, C Y', 'Nichols, W L', 'Young, J H', 'Katzmann, J A']","['Huang MJ', 'Li CY', 'Nichols WL', 'Young JH', 'Katzmann JA']",['eng'],['CA 15083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blood Coagulation Factors/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/blood/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83805-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 Aug;64(2):427-39.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age was 13 years (range, two to 20 years). Thirteen patients had localized disease (stage I, II), and 16 had disseminated disease (stage III, IV). The median follow-up is four years (range, seven months to nine years), and Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall and relapse-free survival are 83% and 76%, respectively.

These children were all in complete continuous remission for more than 3 1/2 years and were no longer receiving therapy. The results indicated no substantial differences between groups as a function of radiation therapy. However, decreased neuropsychologic performance was found when the entire sample was compared with population norms. These data do not support the hypothesis that cranial radiation therapy is responsible for the neuropsychologic sequelae seen in these survivors of ALL. Post hoc multiple regression analysis indicated that parental education levels accounted for more of the neuropsychologic variability seen in these children than other factors such as age at diagnosis, type of therapy, or sex of child.","['Whitt, J K', 'Wells, R J', 'Lauria, M M', 'Wilhelm, C L', 'McMillan, C W']","['Whitt JK', 'Wells RJ', 'Lauria MM', 'Wilhelm CL', 'McMillan CW']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Dis Child,American journal of diseases of children (1960),0370471,,IM,"['Brain/*radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Cognition', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Intelligence', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/psychology/*radiotherapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Random Allocation', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archpedi.1984.02140460022009 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Dis Child. 1984 Aug;138(8):730-6. doi: 10.1001/archpedi.1984.02140460022009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sera of patients were obtained prior to each infusion, immediately following each infusion, and at defined intervals (2, 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours postinfusion) and assayed for 1-Asp enzymatic activity.1-Asp antigen, and anti-1-Asp antibodies. Results indicate that the in-vivo elimination half-life of 1-Asp activity in patients with no demonstrable specific antibody is approximately 5.5 hours. Half-life of enzymatic activity in patients with a moderately high level of specific antibodies (pre-infusion) was prolonged (approximately 7.0 hours) in comparison to the group with no specific antibodies. In patients with very high levels of specific antibodies several infusions could not be completed because of apparent anaphylactic reactions. In-vitro studies showed that experimental immune complexes made of 1-Asp and the IgG-fraction of a rabbit-anti-1-Asp antibody under conditions of antigen excess still exhibit enzymatic activity. On the basis of this observation we conclude that specific antibodies to 1-Asp in vitro and, most likely, in vivo do not inactivate the drug but may lead to either delayed elimination of enzyme activity or, in the presence of high levels of specific antibodies, anaphylactic reaction.","['Wahn, V', 'Fabry, U', 'Korholz, D', 'Reinhardt, D', 'Jurgens, H', 'Gobel, U']","['Wahn V', 'Fabry U', 'Korholz D', 'Reinhardt D', 'Jurgens H', 'Gobel U']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Pharmacol (New York),"Pediatric pharmacology (New York, N.Y.)",8400778,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antibody Specificity', 'Asparaginase/immunology/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/immunology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pediatr Pharmacol (New York). 1983;3(3-4):303-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both monoclonal antibodies were initially identified by indirect immunofluorescence screening techniques on paraformaldehyde-acetone-fixed cell preparations. Specificity screens with 36 well-characterized human lymphoma and leukemia cell lines showed that both LN-1 and LN-2 stained cell lines of B cell lineage but were unreactive with those of T cell or, with one exception, myeloid derivation. Null cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines were found to be LN-2+ but LN-1-. The B cell specificity of these reagents was confirmed on 15 lymphoma and 17 leukemia biopsy specimens by using indirect immunofluorescence techniques. Immunoperoxidase staining of sections from B5-fixed, paraffin-embedded human lymphoid tissues showed that LN-1 bound to the cell membrane and cytoplasm of germinal center cells whereas LN-2 stained the nuclear membrane and cytoplasm of germinal center and mantle zone B lymphocytes as well as interfollicular histiocytes and thymic medullary dendritic cells. Both monoclonal antibodies failed to stain cortical thymocytes, lymph node T cells, and peripheral blood T and myeloid cells. Immunoperoxidase staining of 20 nonlymphoid human organs and tissues revealed that LN-1 reacted positively with red blood cell precursors of the bone marrow, ciliated epithelial cells of the bronchus, distal tubular cells of the kidney, and ductal cells from several organs including the breast and prostate. In contrast, LN-2 was unreactive with all human nonlymphoid organs and tissues including the bone marrow. Indirect immunofluorescence staining of a panel of 26 solid tumor cells lines showed that LN-1 was reactive with the majority of epithelium-derived cell lines, glioblastomas, and astrocytomas but was unreactive with neuroblastomas, small cell carcinoma of the lung, and sarcomas. LN-2 was unreactive with 25 of 26 of the solid tumor cell lines by these techniques. Immunobiochemical studies have shown that LN-1 recognizes a cell surface sialoantigen whereas LN-2 is directed against a 35,000 dalton nuclear membrane protein. Because of their high specificity for B cell tumors and their ability to stain B5-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, LN-1 and LN-2 are useful reagents for the diagnosis and classification of the human lymphomas and leukemias.","['Epstein, A L', 'Marder, R J', 'Winter, J N', 'Fox, R I']","['Epstein AL', 'Marder RJ', 'Winter JN', 'Fox RI']",['eng'],['R01 CA30621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Spleen/cytology/pathology']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1984 Aug;133(2):1028-36.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The amount of newly synthesized cytoskeletal vimentin is decreased dramatically by 24 h of induction, and is paralleled by a rapid loss of vimentin mRNA (approximately 25-fold reduction at 96 h). Hence, disappearance of vimentin filaments in these cells appears to be regulated at the level of vimentin mRNA abundance. On the other hand, the levels of actin synthesis and actin mRNA remain essentially unchanged. The kinetics of vimentin mRNA reduction during dimethyl sulfoxide-mediated differentiation, and the levels of vimentin mRNA observed in the presence of hexamethylene-bisacetamide or hemin as inducers suggest that the cessation of vimentin expression precedes, but may be associated with commitment to terminal differentiation.

In histocompatible recipients, ASL-1 cells are highly malignant, but LM(TK-) cells are rejected. Several distinguishing characteristics in the properties of the surface antigens of the three cell types are described. ASL-1 cells and hybrid cells but not LM(TK-) cells form an antigenically cross-reactive leukaemia-associated antigen; however, it is not detected on the surface membranes of ASL-1 cells taken directly from leukaemic mice. The antigen becomes apparent after short-term culture of the cells. Serum from leukaemic animals, unlike specific antibodies, has no effect upon the expression of the leukaemia-associated antigen of either hybrid or ASL-1 cells. Hybrid cells form a 'second' antigen, foreign to F1 mice, which can be distinguished from the leukaemia-associated antigen of ASL-1 cells. It is not detected on either parental cell. The leukaemia-associated antigen of ASL-1 cells is more readily digested by each of three proteases used than the analogous antigen of hybrid cells. The heightened immunogenic properties of hybrid cells is reflected by the observation that spleen cells from mice injected with hybrid cells undergo extensive proliferation in short-term in vitro culture, with or without an added specific stimulus.","['Slomski, R', 'Wang, D R', 'Cohen, E P']","['Slomski R', 'Wang DR', 'Cohen EP']",['eng'],['CA27579-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immune Sera)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts/immunology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Hybrid Cells/*immunology', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Peptide Hydrolases/pharmacology', 'Spleen/immunology']",1984/06/01 00:00,1984/06/01 00:01,['1984/06/01 00:00'],"['1984/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1984 Jun;52(2):281-90.,,,PMC1454631,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunological techniques are not discussed and the review deals mainly with light and electron microscopic cytochemistry, transmission (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The importance of light microscopic cytochemistry is clearly demonstrated. In particular, paranuclear acid phosphatase, non-specific esterase (NSE) and diaminopeptidase staining are recommended as reliable T-cell markers. Ultrastructural identification of unclassified leukemic cells using techniques to detect myeloperoxidase, acid phosphatase, platelet peroxide (PPO) and NSE, is shown to be of great importance in cases of early myelo-monoblastic differentiation with negative light microscopic cytochemistry. SEM is also shown to be a reliable means of distinguishing lymphoid and non-lymphoid leukemia when some degree of differentiation is present. However SEM does not appear to contribute in the diagnosis of unclassified leukemia.

In order to determine whether erythroid cells which do not enucleate contain homologous membrane domains, immature avian erythroid precursor cells and avian erythroleukemic cells were examined using merocyanine 540 (MC540), a fluorescent dye whose binding is sensitive to the packing of membrane lipids. Results were found to contrast with previous studies of the murine equivalents of these cells. In birds, normal erythroid precursors, including basophilic erythroblasts from the bone marrow and spleen of anemic animals, contained no detectable (less than 0.1%) cells which were stained by the dye. But cells from chicks infected with avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) did stain.

An affinity-purified rabbit antibody has been produced against p68 and used to study its cellular distribution. The antibody stained fixed and permeabilised human B lymphoblastoid cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes and sections of human tonsil. Whole cells, however, were not stained, indicating that the protein was not represented at the cell surface. This assignment was consistent with the detection of p68 in immunoprecipitates from biosynthetically- but not surface-labelled cells. It is concluded that p68 is located on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Subcellular fractionation experiments confirmed that p68 was largely membrane-bound in lymphocytes, although a small soluble fraction (approximately 10% of the total) was detected. Sub-fractionation of lymphocyte membranes revealed that p68 was associated not only with the plasma membrane but also with other endomembrane systems. As judged by immunoprecipitation, p68 was present in a variety of cultured cell lines of both lymphoid and non-lymphoid origin. p68 demonstrated a diffuse distribution in fixed and permeabilised fibroblasts which did not correspond to the distribution of either microfilaments or intermediate filaments. However, in detergent-extracted cells the protein was localised in a lamina-like network. A similar immunofluorescent staining pattern has recently been observed for spectrin-related proteins in the detergent-resistant cytoskeleton of fibroblasts. It is suggested that p68 is part of a sub-membranous cytoskeletal complex not only in lymphocytes but also in other cell types.","['Owens, R J', 'Gallagher, C J', 'Crumpton, M J']","['Owens RJ', 'Gallagher CJ', 'Crumpton MJ']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*isolation & purification', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity/methods', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Palatine Tonsil', 'Subcellular Fractions/analysis']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1984 May;3(5):945-52.,,,PMC557456,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under basal conditions alveolar macrophages, in common with other mononuclear phagocytes, are derived from the bone marrow. A population of macrophage precursors within the pulmonary interstitium provides a reserve pool capable of proliferation and delivery of phagocytes in response to unusually heavy loads of inhaled particles. This reserve system also produces macrophages when monocytic precursors in the bone marrow are depleted by diseases such as leukemia. The alveolar macrophage is destined to ingest particulate matter and to be eliminated along the mucociliary pathway; clearance by lymphatics is of minor importance and macrophages probably do not recross the alveolar epithelium to reach the pulmonary interstitial compartment. Although the protective role of the macrophage is dominant, this cell may participate, directly or indirectly, in the genesis of two major groups of chronic pulmonary disease, interstitial fibrosis and emphysema. Such inappropriate responses involve interactions with fibroblastic cells and tissue injury initiated by proteases secreted by the macrophage.","['Bowden, D H']",['Bowden DH'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,,IM,"['Animals', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lung/cytology', 'Lung Diseases/physiopathology', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*physiology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/*cytology/physiology']",1984/04/01 00:00,1984/04/01 00:01,['1984/04/01 00:00'],"['1984/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.8455327 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1984 Apr;55:327-41. doi: 10.1289/ehp.8455327.,52,,PMC1568378,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alkylating agents such as melphalan, chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide seem to lead to the highest rate of second malignancies. Second malignancies after antitumour drugs are mostly acute leukaemias. Conditions which could influence the carcinogenicity of an antitumour drug are (a) its carcinogenic potency; (b) long-term administration; (c) the total dose used and (d) long-term survival of the patient. Irradiation and chemotherapy seem to have the greatest carcinogenic potential, e.g. in malignant lymphomas. The role of immunosuppression as a co-carcinogenic factor is difficult to estimate. Although transplant patients on anticancer drugs for immunosuppression have a higher risk of reticulosarcomas, but not of solid tumours, there is no evidence to suppose that in general immunosuppression and carcinogenicity are directly related.

The composite antigenic phenotype of the various cases, as determined by immunofluorescence assay, did not correlate with the French-American-British morphological classification. Furthermore, some cells in each case failed to express any antigen normally expressed on myelomonocytic precursors from the level of the early CFU-GM to the mature granulocyte or monocyte. In double-fluorescence experiments, the individual cells expressed none, one, or both antigens. These results demonstrate that there is considerable subpopulation heterogeneity in AML.

In the prospectively randomized phase of the investigation, 46 patients received daunorubicin in induction, whereas 53 did not. The two groups were otherwise comparable for pretreatment variables. A complete response was observed in 38/46 patients (83%) treated with daunorubicin, compared to 25/53 (47%) induced with vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase alone (P = .003). The high response rate attributable to the use of the anthracycline was confirmed by the nonrandomized treatment of 78 subsequent patients, in whom a complete response rate of 76% was attained. A common program for central nervous system therapy and for maintenance therapy was employed in 103 patients achieving complete response. Maintenance consisted of cycles of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and methotrexate with periodic reinforcement with vincristine and prednisone. Maintenance therapy proved to be minimally toxic. The average duration of complete response was 15 months and was not affected by the induction program employed. Approximately 25% of responders are projected to remain in continuing complete response for 36 months. The failure of the daunorubicin-containing programs to produce a higher percentage of long-term survivors, despite the higher complete response rates achieved, was thought to be due to the use of a maintenance program that was weak in intensity and dependent on reinforcement with vincristine and prednisone. These data clearly establish the increased effectiveness of vincristine, prednisone, L-asparaginase, and daunorubicin, as compared to this combination without daunorubicin, in the induction of complete response in adults with ALL. The results support the concept of an intensive, rather than a conservative, chemotherapeutic approach as the most appropriate strategy for the treatment of adult ALL.","['Gottlieb, A J', 'Weinberg, V', 'Ellison, R R', 'Henderson, E S', 'Terebelo, H', 'Rafla, S', 'Cuttner, J', 'Silver, R T', 'Carey, R W', 'Levy, R N']","['Gottlieb AJ', 'Weinberg V', 'Ellison RR', 'Henderson ES', 'Terebelo H', 'Rafla S', 'Cuttner J', 'Silver RT', 'Carey RW', 'Levy RN', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['CA12011/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16118/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Brain Neoplasms/secondary', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Daunorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Naphthacenes/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Random Allocation', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83868-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 Jul;64(1):267-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four significant differences were observed between the group given TMP/STX (30 patients) and the control group (33 patients): 1) the mean duration of severe granulocytopenia (less than or equal to 500 PMN/mm3) before the first febrile episode was longer in prophylaxis group, 14.26 days versus four in the control group (p less than 0.001); 2) the number of febrile episodes was 37 in TMP/STX group and 69 in control group (p less than 0.01); 3) 23 patients on prophylaxis presented at least one febrile episode versus 33 in the control group (p less than 0.01); 4) deaths due to infection were two in the TMP/STX group versus 11 in control group (p less than 0.05).

This was associated with a reduced ability of their serum to inhibit the growth of a test strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Serum iron, transferrin, and related parameters were measured serially in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation for leukemia or aplastic anemia. It was found that a high proportion of these patients also have a high saturation of their transferrin with iron. This was related to three distinct physiologic deficits: a low level of serum transferrin; a high level of iron; and an inability to reduce the level of serum iron during infection. Three of six patients who were unable to reduce their serum during fever and infection subsequently died of sepsis. These data support the hypothesis that derangements in nonspecific serologic defense mechanisms involving iron contribute to susceptibility to infection in patients with leukemia undergoing bone marrow transplantation.","['Hunter, R L', 'Bennett, B', 'Towns, M', 'Vogler, W R']","['Hunter RL', 'Bennett B', 'Towns M', 'Vogler WR']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/blood/therapy', 'Blood Bactericidal Activity', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Fever/blood', 'Humans', 'Infections/blood/*immunology', 'Iron/*blood', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk', 'Transferrin/*analysis']",1984/06/01 00:00,1984/06/01 00:01,['1984/06/01 00:00'],"['1984/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/81.6.748 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1984 Jun;81(6):748-53. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/81.6.748.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age was 27 years for both maintenance chemotherapy patients (range 17-42 years) and for patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (range 16-42 years). The 1-year survival for maintenance chemotherapy was 80% vs. 54% with bone marrow transplantation (p = NS). Complete remission durability was 70% at 1 year for maintenance chemotherapy (34% projected for 5 years) compared with no relapses in the first year with bone marrow transplantation (p = 0.01). Patients on maintenance chemotherapy were hospitalized for an average of 22 days (range 0-171 days) during the first 12 months of treatment. Patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation were hospitalized for an average of 82 days (range 41-113 days) in the same time period. Severe hematologic toxicity was seen in 13/13 bone marrow transplantation patients and 6/20 maintenance chemotherapy patients. Chronic graft-vs.-host disease occurred in 3/7 surviving bone marrow transplantation patients. Maintenance chemotherapy had an average first year cost of +3,076.00 for patients who did not relapse and +48,827.00 for patients that relapsed. The first year costs for bone marrow transplantation averaged +84,102.00. Thus, maintenance chemotherapy was associated with a better early survival, less toxicity, and lower cost than bone marrow transplantation in the first year after initiating therapy. However, fewer relapses with bone marrow transplantation suggest that it will yield a higher long-term survival rate.","['Armitage, J O', 'Klassen, L W', 'Burns, C P', 'Kugler, J W', 'Ray, T L', 'Gingrich, R D', 'Ahmann, G B', 'Tewfik, H H']","['Armitage JO', 'Klassen LW', 'Burns CP', 'Kugler JW', 'Ray TL', 'Gingrich RD', 'Ahmann GB', 'Tewfik HH']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/economics', 'Male', 'Recurrence/economics', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage']",1984/06/01 00:00,1984/06/01 00:01,['1984/06/01 00:00'],"['1984/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000421-198406000-00015 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 1984 Jun;7(3):273-8. doi: 10.1097/00000421-198406000-00015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its origin from mature neutrophil granulocytes was ascertained by fluorescence-microscopic investigations. In the present paper the existence of thermostabile antigen of granulocytes in neutrophil granulocytes could be confirmed. The fluorescence pattern of neutrophil granulocytes of healthy persons did not show any differences in comparison to patients with inflammatory or myeloproliferative diseases as well as granulocytes from punctates of the joint or sternal marrow. With the help of punctates of the lymph-nodes the presence of thermostabile antigens of granulocytes in cells of the lymphatic system could be excluded. In smears of the sternal marrow positive fluorescence could be proved in the myelopoesis in neutrophil metamyelocytes. Quantitative investigations in inflammatory and myeloproliferative diseases as well as in granulocytopenias showed that the TSGA -serum values of the numbers of granulocytes go parallel. In punctates of the joint of patients with rheumatoid arthritis we found concentrations of thermostabile antigens of granulocytes which up to 50-fold were above the normal values of the serum. There was a close correlation to the number of granulocytes in the synovial fluid and to the cytological local activity.

Infection was the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. Severe infection following the initiation of induction therapy was found in 16.7% of patients on Arm 3 vs 1.8-6% on other regimens. Immediate triple IT chemoprophylaxis during induction therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia as used in this study appears to be associated with increased susceptibility to infection and this form of CNS prophylaxis has increased hazards of morbidity and mortality in infants and other high risk patients.","['Hvizdala, E', 'Berry, D H', 'Chen, T', 'Dyment, P G', 'Kim, T H', 'Steuber, C P', 'Sullivan, M P']","['Hvizdala E', 'Berry DH', 'Chen T', 'Dyment PG', 'Kim TH', 'Steuber CP', 'Sullivan MP']",['eng'],"['CA-03713/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-15995/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26756/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infections/etiology', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950120306 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1984;12(3):173-7. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950120306.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the immunoperoxidase staining provides an easy and dependable method to survey TdT by bright-field microscopy. The peroxidase+ small granules were detected in the nucleus of the blasts from TdT+ ALL cases.

Natural cytotoxicity against both uninfected and virus-infected cells was demonstrated in normal uninfected mice, but LCMV-infected cells were cleared from the lungs and whole bodies more rapidly than uninfected cells. Treatment of L-929 cells with defective interfering LCMV inhibited standard virus synthesis and protected the target cells from enhanced in vivo rejection. The in vivo rejection was apparently mediated by a cellular constituent of the host immune response and not simply a result of virus-induced cytopathic effects on the target cell, as hydrocortisone acetate and cyclophosphamide each reduced rejection of both target cell types and eliminated the enhanced rejection of LCMV-infected cells. The enhanced rejection of LCMV-infected cells was not restricted by histocompatibility antigens, indicating that classic T-cell recognition was not involved in the lysis, and since the enhanced rejection of LCMV-infected cells was mediated by mice treated with cobra venom factor, complement was also not involved in the lysis. Although moderate levels of interferon (102 U/ml) were present in the sera and although there was a modest activation of natural killer (NK) cells in the lungs of LCMV-infected cell recipients but not uninfected cell recipients, the enhanced rejection of virus-infected cells did not appear to be NK cell mediated. Normal mice and mice depleted of NK cell activity by in vivo treatment with antibody to asialo ganglio-n-tetraosylceramide ( AGM1 ) rejected uninfected and LCMV-infected L-929 cells similarly. This antibody markedly inhibited the rejection of NK-sensitive YAC-1 cells. In addition to the natural cytotoxicity directed against virus-infected cells, a second nonspecific rejection mechanism appeared in response to treatment protocols which induced interferon. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid and infection with LCMV augmented in vivo rejection of both uninfected and LCMV-infected L-929 cells but eliminated the differential rejection of the virus-infected cells. Infection with LCMV also augmented the in vivo rejection of the NK-sensitive target cell, YAC-1. In vivo treatments with anti- AGM1 sera only moderately inhibited the elevated rejection of uninfected and LCMV-infected L-929 cells, indicating that the enhanced rejection of these target cells was predominantly mediated by a mechanism other than that mediated by NK cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Biron, C A', 'Habu, S', 'Okumura, K', 'Welsh, R M']","['Biron CA', 'Habu S', 'Okumura K', 'Welsh RM']",['eng'],"['AI00432/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI17672/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['3X7931PO74 (hydrocortisone acetate)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Complement System Proteins/analysis', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hydrocortisone/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'L Cells/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",1984/06/01 00:00,1984/06/01 00:01,['1984/06/01 00:00'],"['1984/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.50.3.698-707.1984 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1984 Jun;50(3):698-707. doi: 10.1128/JVI.50.3.698-707.1984.,,,PMC255727,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lysolecithin treatment was accompanied by only minimal increases in non-specific background fluorescence, and no increase in autofluorescence. Our studies have demonstrated that lysolecithin treatment of human mononuclear cell populations permits flow cytometric analysis of cytoskeletal structures, including intermediate filaments, as well as cytoplasmic immunoglobulin. Studies currently in progress in our laboratory have demonstrated broad intracellular reactivity with some monoclonal antibodies identifying leukocyte differentiation and tumor-associated antigens. These findings contrast with the more restricted expression of these antigens on the cell surface and demonstrate not only the value of the lysolecithin technique but also the importance of the study of intracellular antigens in our overall understanding of the specificity, distribution, synthesis, and function of cellular antigens.","['Schroff, R W', 'Bucana, C D', 'Klein, R A', 'Farrell, M M', 'Morgan, A C Jr']","['Schroff RW', 'Bucana CD', 'Klein RA', 'Farrell MM', 'Morgan AC Jr']",['eng'],"['N01-CO-23909/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-23910/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Lysophosphatidylcholines)']",IM,"['Antigens/*analysis', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cytoplasm/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Lysophosphatidylcholines/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/immunology']",1984/05/25 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1984/05/25 00:00'],"['1984/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1984/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(84)90182-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(84)90182-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1984 May 25;70(2):167-77. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(84)90182-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of such gradients showed a band of light-scattering material near the bottom of the tube; assay of gradient fractions for lytic activity against SRBC showed a potent lytic activity giving a sharp peak in this region. Complete lysis of SRBC was achieved with less than 1 microgram/ml protein of the most active fractions. Examination in the electron microscope showed that a pool of fractions containing lytic activity consisted of pure cytoplasmic granules showing similar morphology to those found in the LGL tumors. The lytic band was associated with a peak in the activity of four different lysosomal enzymes. Analysis of Percoll gradient fractions showed that marker enzymes for mitochondria, plasma membrane, and cytosol were well separated from this activity peak. Analysis of the Percoll gradient fractions by SDS gel electrophoresis showed that this granule fraction was free of contamination of proteins from other parts of the gradient. The granules contained major protein bands of 62, 58, 30, 29, and 28 kilodaltons. In addition to protein, the purified granule fractions contain hexose and uronic acid, but no nucleic acids or phospholipids were detected in chemical assays. Major amounts of chymotryptic, tryptic, and elastase activities were not present, nor were peroxidase or lysozyme activities detectable in substantial amounts. These data show that NK tumor cell cytoplasmic granules contain a potent lytic activity and have biochemical properties that distinguish them from granules present in granulocytes and mast cells.","['Millard, P J', 'Henkart, M P', 'Reynolds, C W', 'Henkart, P A']","['Millard PJ', 'Henkart MP', 'Reynolds CW', 'Henkart PA']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,['EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Fractionation', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*analysis/enzymology/ultrastructure', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*analysis/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/enzymology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344']",1984/06/01 00:00,1984/06/01 00:01,['1984/06/01 00:00'],"['1984/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1984 Jun;132(6):3197-204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This accessory function (AF) of monocytes requires the release of interleukin 1 (IL 1). Cells from three human leukemic cell lines, K562, HL60, and U937, could very efficiently replace monocytes in a 72-hr mitogen-induced T cell proliferation assay. The AF was clearly related to precise maturational stages of these cells; the hematopoietic precursor K562 cells spontaneously exerted high AF, but lost this property when treated with differentiation inducers. On the contrary, the promyelocytic HL60 cells and the ""histiocytic"" U937 cells exhibited no spontaneous AF, but acquired this property when induced to differentiate along the granulocytic and/or monocytic pathway. Three leukemic cells could not only stimulate T cells to proliferate and produce IL 2 in the presence of mitogens, but also under appropriate culture conditions these cells could produce IL 1, which could not be distinguished from normal human monocyte derived IL 1 by gel filtration and isoelectric focusing. Moreover, analysis of phenotypic markers revealed that AF and production of IL 1 could be demonstrated in different cell types and therefore are not restricted to the monocytic lineage. No HLA-DR antigen could be detected on K562 and HL60 cells. Thus, the expression of the DR antigens is not required for AF and IL 1 production in response to mitogens.

Major problems to be overcome in transplantation in patients with aplastic anemia are marrow graft rejection and graft vs. host disease. Results are better in younger patients and in patients who have not been previously transfused. Newer approaches to the control of graft vs. host disease, for example total lymphoid irradiation and the immunosuppressive agent, cyclosporin A, hold promise for future progress. In patients with acute leukemia, the major clinical problems are early infections, recurrent leukemia, graft vs. host disease, and interstitial pneumonia. Both ultra-isolation and prophylactic granulocyte transfusions are able to decrease the incidence of early infections. Attempts to intensify the conditioning regimen have failed to decrease the incidence of recurrent leukemia, but transplantation earlier in the course of disease, particularly in patients with acute, nonlymphoblastic leukemia in first remission, have decreased the incidence of recurrent leukemia. Both acute and chronic forms of graft vs. host disease have been recognized. Acute graft vs. host disease continues to be a significant clinical problem, in spite of the use of Cyclosporin A. Chronic graft vs. host disease is being recognized earlier and treated successfully with immunosuppressive agents. Interstitial pneumonia, primarily secondary to cytomegalovirus, remains the major cause of death post-transplantation. In spite of these problems, however, patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission have a 60% likelihood of remaining alive, free of disease following allogeneic marrow transplantation from an HLA identical sibling. Patients with acute leukemia who have relapsed who undergo allogeneic marrow transplantation have a longer survival than patients treated with conventional chemotherapy and even patients in relapse have a significant likelihood of cure following high-dose chemoradiotherapy and allogeneic marrow transplantation.","['Weiden, P L']",['Weiden PL'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci,Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,8914816,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/therapy', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Metabolism, Inborn Errors/therapy', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10408368309165762 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci. 1983;19(3):173-86. doi: 10.3109/10408368309165762.,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All these changes in REH cells observed on TPA treatment represent the differentiation of a human leukemic non-T/non-B-cell line to macrophage-like cells for the first time which indicates that some non-T/non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells may have latent monocyte-like phenotype.","['Srivastava, B I', 'Koga, M', 'Srivastava, P']","['Srivastava BI', 'Koga M', 'Srivastava P']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Phorbols)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*physiology', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phorbols/*toxicity', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*toxicity']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Jul;44(7):3017-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Toxicity of the resulting immunotoxins (IT) was measured against leukemic cell lines treated alone and in the presence of excess bone marrow using a highly sensitive colony inhibition assay. Cells were pretreated with IT in the presence of lactose to block the native binding of ricin. The IT proved to be potent cytotoxins for the p65-positive cell lines, CEM and MOLT-4. Treatment with T101-ricin (1000 ng/ml) inhibited clonogenic activity of these lines by more than 5.1 logs. Less than 1 log of the inhibition at this dose was due to nonspecific killing by IT. Notably, the presence of excess bone marrow did not reduce IT toxicity against the leukemic populations. Comparison of IT concentrations which inhibited 50% of clonogenic activity showed that T101-ricin was 140- to 540-fold and VIII-1-ricin was 12- to 192-fold more toxic to p65-positive than to p65-negative cell lines. Neither unconjugated anti-p65 nor IT prepared with an irrelevant antibody inhibited clonogenic activity. Blocking of IT toxicity by unconjugated antibody further demonstrated that the antibody moiety of the IT directed the selective toxicity. We found that T101-ricin was more toxic for CEM cells than was VIII-1-ricin, even though blocking studies indicated that the two antibodies bind to proximal or identical epitopes. This report is unique in that an IT was shown to specifically eliminate greater than 99.99% of leukemic cells from human bone marrow. These findings indicate the utility of T101-ricin as an in vitro reagent for autologous bone marrow transplantation in treatment of T-cell leukemia.","['Stong, R C', 'Youle, R J', 'Vallera, D A']","['Stong RC', 'Youle RJ', 'Vallera DA']",['eng'],"['CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25097/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antitoxins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antitoxins/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Ricin', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Jul;44(7):3000-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, MCS-2, a ""pan"" granulocyte/monocyte marker, was inducible in vitro in AUL and in acute myelogenous leukemia, while it was not inducible in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. BA-2 (recognizing the Mr 24,000 protein) and TA-1 (recognizing the Mr 170,000 and Mr 95,000 proteins) were also inducible in cases of AUL, acute myelocytic leukemia, and acute monoblastic leukemia, although these antigens are not limited only to leukemias of the myelomonocytic lineage. Our studies also indicate that undifferentiated cells could be induced to nonspecific esterase and sometimes to chloroacetate esterase reactivity while losing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Morphological studies in these cases revealed cytological maturation following TPA treatment. In most cases, these changes were also partially inducible by culturing cells in medium alone or with the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide but not to the extent that was demonstrated by TPA.

The addition of PGF2 alpha did not result in increased numbers of colonies, but it did cause a shift in the size of the colonies so that there was a significant increase in larger colonies (P less than 0.001) and significantly fewer small colonies (P less than 0.05) as compared to untreated samples. Of the prostenoids tested in a Tris-buffered system, PGI2 affected the greatest increase in CFU-C (P less than 0.01) followed by PGF2 alpha (P less than 0.05) whereas 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (the stable hydrate of PGI2) did not affect colony growth. Time-response curves revealed a linear growth pattern for PGF2 alpha with a peak at 10 days, whereas there was a 6-day growth lag with PGI2 followed by linear growth with a peak at 13 days. TxB2 added to cultures significantly reduced the number of bone marrow CFU-C at all doses tested.

All four patients with pretreatment transferrin levels within the normal range were discharged, three of them with minimal complications.

Here the risk of alloimmunisation which makes a continuation of transfusion therapy or a subsequent bone marrow transplantation problematic, is just one of the examples. Modern cell separation techniques allow the production of highly concentrated cell preparations aiming at the reduction of the frequency of transfusions and minimizing the risk of sensitisation. If rich concentrated preparations have to be given to immunodeficient patients an irradiation should proceed their transfusion, otherwise the immunocompetent lymphocytes contained in the preparations could induce graft versus host reactions.

A report of four cases and review of the literature.,182-7,"Four new cases of acute myelofibrosis are reported, and 63 cases reported in the literature are reviewed. The typical features of this disease include a rapidly progressive clinical course; nonspecific symptoms such as weight loss, anorexia, fatigue and weakness; the absence of organomegaly; pancytopenia; circulating blast cells; and mild abnormalities in the red blood cell morphology. The bone marrow aspirates are usually ""dry."" The bone marrow biopsies are essential for the diagnosis and show four consistent features: hypercellularity, reticulin fibrosis, proliferation of blast cells and bizarre, atypical megakaryocytes. In 16 cases, the blast cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow, which are unclassifiable by conventional morphology, could be identified as megakaryoblasts by ultrastructural and immunocytochemical techniques. It is concluded that acute myelofibrosis is a definite clinicopathologic entity, which may be related to acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.","['Truong, L D', 'Saleem, A', 'Schwartz, M R']","['Truong LD', 'Saleem A', 'Schwartz MR']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 1984 May;63(3):182-7.,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to the squamous cell carcinomas of the adult, malignancies of the young are of embryogenic or haematogenic origin, or are sarcomas, and in 80% of the cases regional or distant metastases are probable. On the other hand they are usually highly sensitive to cytotoxic drugs and radiation treatment. Basing on our own patient material of the last 10 years (a total of 502 tumours, including 50 head and neck malignancies), the formation of metastases, some diagnostic criterias and especially current therapeutic schedules are discussed and illustrated. The present combined modalities of treatment including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy as well as ""prophylaxis of the central nervous system"", have contributed to a fundamental increase in survival. For the most important malignancies in childhood, 3-year survival rates of more than 60% may be expected. These healing rates have become possible only by a interdisciplinary treatment in which the otorhinologist , the radiotherapist and the paediatric oncologist participate. In head and neck tumours of the young the otorhinologist must establish the diagnosis clinically and by biopsy and, if possible, surgically remove the tumour.

Clinical observations show that the prognoses of patients with various malignancies differ among males and females, and some cancers can be alleviated and partially controlled by altering the accustomed hormonal environment. Although beneficial effects usually are only temporary, there is no doubt that some cancers are hormone-dependent to a degree. A significant number of prostatic carcinoma in males and breast carcinoma in both sexes have been treated with various additive or ablative endocrine manipulations. The detection and quantitation of specific steroid binding proteins in hormone-sensitive tumors have enhanced our understanding of the mechanism of endocrinal therapy. Excluding carcinoma of the breast and of the sex organs (ovary and uterus in females, testis and prostate in males), many other solid tumors have been tested for the presence of estrogen and other steroid receptors. A fair number of solid cancers contains estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER, PR), even those from male patients. Thus, the better prognosis of females with sarcoma, melanoma, liver, colorectal and other cancers cannot simply be explained by the presence or absence of estrogen or progesterone receptors. This review attempts to summarize clinical reports of this interesting phenomenon, including therapeutic results with estrogenic, antiestrogenic, and other hormonal approaches.","['Lee, Y T']",['Lee YT'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Surg Oncol,Journal of surgical oncology,0222643,"['0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Breast Neoplasms/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', '*Neoplasms/analysis/mortality/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent/analysis/therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Estrogen/analysis', 'Receptors, Progesterone/analysis', 'Receptors, Steroid/*analysis', 'Sarcoma/analysis/mortality', '*Sex Factors']",1984/04/01 00:00,1984/04/01 00:01,['1984/04/01 00:00'],"['1984/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jso.2930250408 [doi]'],ppublish,J Surg Oncol. 1984 Apr;25(4):255-62. doi: 10.1002/jso.2930250408.,81,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the presence of HCGF, ATP levels are maintained in these factor-dependent cells (FDC-P cells); in the absence of HCGF, intracellular ATP levels undergo a steady depletion. The cell death that follows this ATP depletion can be prevented by supplying exogenous ATP suggesting that HCGF maintains these cells via its effects on energy metabolism. We have investigated the effect of HCGF on FDC-P cells further and found that: (i) HCGF markedly and rapidly increases lactate production; (ii) high extracellular glucose or glycolytic intermediate concentrations can maintain FDC-P cell viability to some extent whilst stimulating lactate production; (iii) the uptake of 2-deoxyglucose by FDC-P2 cells is stimulated by HCGF in a dose-dependent fashion. This uptake is inhibited by cytochalasin B; (iv) HCGF does not stimulate L-glucose uptake by FDC-P cells. These results suggest that HCGF acts to maintain FDC-P cells via its action on glucose transport.

Although the T cell phenotypes were antigenically heterogeneous, all cases represented mature T cell phenotypes. The majority of the remaining 28 cases expressed the B cell-associated antigen, B1. At 5 yr, actuarial survival for the Ig- patients was 63%, compared with 15% for the Ig+ patients. A significantly greater proportion of patients with Ig+ lymphomas were over the age of 65 at diagnosis. All of the 9 patients with marrow involvement were Ig+. Multiple factors were analyzed by the Cox regression procedure for their impact on survival, including antigenic profile, histologic grade, morphological classification, and numerous clinical parameters previously recognized to be of prognostic significance. In this analysis, stage, age greater than 65 yr, systemic symptoms, and marrow involvement had the greatest influence on survival. The survival difference between Ig- and Ig+ patients is explained by a higher proportion of Ig+ patients with these unfavorable prognostic factors. With our current immunologic methods, retrospective cell phenotyping analysis has not provided independent prognostic significance in diffuse large cell lymphoma. A prospective evaluation of similarly treated patients is needed to characterize the influence of phenotype fully and to determine its potential usefulness for therapy.","['Horning, S J', 'Doggett, R S', 'Warnke, R A', 'Dorfman, R F', 'Cox, R S', 'Levy, R']","['Horning SJ', 'Doggett RS', 'Warnke RA', 'Dorfman RF', 'Cox RS', 'Levy R']",['eng'],"['CA05838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21223/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83439-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 May;63(5):1209-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two receptor-positive tumor cell lines, WEHI-3 and M5076, were exposed to methotrexate-human serum albumin conjugate (MTX-HSA) in the presence and absence of anti-HSA antiserum. Both cell types were killed by 30 nM MTX when the drug conjugate was given in the presence of antiserum but were totally unaffected in the absence of antiserum. Drug-free HSA given with antiserum had no effect. Both cell lines responded similarly despite their marked difference in phagocytotic activity. One of the two lines, M5076, is defective in MTX transport and hence resistant to free MTX. Since this line would not be affected by MTX released extracellularly from MTX-HSA, its susceptibility implies that MTX is released inside cells, after endocytosis of the complex, and that endocytosis circumvents the transport defect. Two cell lines lacking Fc receptors (CHO and L929) were not influenced by the drug complex. The pharmacologic effect is mediated by a specific ligand-receptor interaction, since Fc receptor-positive cells are protected by an excess of unconjugated HSA and by the addition of a small amount of staphylococcal protein A, which binds to the Fc portion of IgG. These data demonstrate that Fc receptors can be exploited for cellular drug delivery using a common antigen-antibody complex as a drug carrier.","['Shen, W C', 'Ryser, H J']","['Shen WC', 'Ryser HJ']",['eng'],"['CA 14551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 34798/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (methotrexate-serum albumin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Endocytosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Receptors, Fc/*immunology', 'Serum Albumin/therapeutic use']",1984/03/01 00:00,1984/03/01 00:01,['1984/03/01 00:00'],"['1984/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.81.5.1445 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1984 Mar;81(5):1445-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.81.5.1445.,,,PMC344852,,,,,,,,,,,,

Functionally mature macrophage properties, such as adherence, morphologic character, and phagocytosis, were induced by the presence of TPA in each of the cell lines except for adherence in the HL-60 cells. After 3 days in culture, the expression of the OKM-1-defined antigen was markedly augmented in all 4 cell lines. The expression of the 63D3-defined antigen was also markedly augmented in the ML-1, KG-1, and THP-1-0 cells, but it was not significantly altered in the HL-60 cells. The MCS-2-defined antigen was amplified in expression in the ML-1 and HL-60 cells, but it showed minimum decrease in the KG-1 and THP-1-0 cells. The MCS-1-defined antigen expression was suppressed in ML-1, HL-60, and THP-1-0 but was enhanced in KG-1. The suppressed expression of My-1 antigen (detected by the MoAb 1/12/13) was noted in all 4 cell lines. Thus in the ML-1 cells, expression of the myeloid-monocyte antigens was augmented, whereas myeloid antigen expression was inhibited in the presence of TPA, a result that parallels antigenic expression in terminal macrophage differentiation. The trend was true, except for the 4 cell line-antigen combinations (MCS-2-defined antigen and MCS-1-defined antigen in KG-1, 63D3-defined antigen in HL-60, and MCS-2-defined antigen in THP-1-0). The heterogeneous attitude of some antigens to TPA found in these cell lines may result from the fact that they represent different points in the myeloid-monocyte differentiation scheme.","['Sugimoto, T', 'Tatsumi, E', 'Takeda, K', 'Minato, K', 'Sagawa, K', 'Minowada, J']","['Sugimoto T', 'Tatsumi E', 'Takeda K', 'Minato K', 'Sagawa K', 'Minowada J']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Phorbols)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*immunology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1984/04/01 00:00,1984/04/01 00:01,['1984/04/01 00:00'],"['1984/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1984 Apr;72(4):923-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients who had granulocyte counts of less than 200/mm3 and no response to antibiotic therapy were assigned to receive antibiotic therapy alone or granulocyte transfusions plus antibiotic therapy. Granulocytes were collected by filtration leukapheresis (FL), intermittent flow centrifuge leukapheresis (IFCL) or continuous flow centrifuge leukapheresis (CFCL). Therapeutic effects of granulocyte transfusions were evaluated on the basis of 20-day survival after entry into the study. The patients were divided into three groups: 1) 22 patients received antibiotic therapy alone for 29 infectious episodes (control group); 2) 27 patients received 131 transfusions of granulocytes collected by FL for 31 infectious episodes (FL group); 3) 26 patients received 139 transfusions of granulocytes collected by IFCL and CFCL for 27 infectious episodes (IFCL & CFCL group). The overall survival of the transfused patients was not significantly different from that of the untransfused patients. Similarly, there was no significant difference in survival between the transfused and untransfused patients when the data concerning septicemia were analyzed. When patients showed bone-marrow recovery, which was indicated by recovery of granulocytes to 500/mm3 or more during the study, 20-day survival was observed in 13 of 14 untransfused patients and in all of 26 transfused patients. In contrast, the survival rate for the patients without bone-marrow recovery was 13% (2/15) in the control group, 39% (7/18) in the FL group and 57% (8/14) in the IFCL & CFCL group respectively. Thus, the survival rate was significantly higher for the transfused than for the untransfused patients. These observations suggest that therapeutic granulocyte transfusions may be of limited value in improving the outcome of severe infections in persistently granulocytopenic patients. Since bone-marrow recovery is a critical factor for the prognosis of severe infections, therapeutic granulocyte transfusions do not provide any beneficial effects in granulocytopenic patients whose bone-marrow function will recover.","['Matsue, K', 'Harada, M', 'Nakao, S', 'Ueda, M', 'Kondo, K', 'Odaka, K', 'Mori, T', 'Hattori, K']","['Matsue K', 'Harada M', 'Nakao S', 'Ueda M', 'Kondo K', 'Odaka K', 'Mori T', 'Hattori K']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Agranulocytosis/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology/*therapy', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/*transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis/methods', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sepsis/etiology/mortality/therapy']",1984/03/01 00:00,1984/03/01 00:01,['1984/03/01 00:00'],"['1984/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1984 Mar;14(1):21-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results from immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that RaLV produced by Novikoff and WRC cells could be distinguished by their unique patterns of reactivity with xenoantisera raised against virus particles or viral glycoproteins. This differential labelling was unexpected since all the antisera tested had been shown by immunoprecipitation and immunodepletion analysis to be reactive with viral glycoproteins expressed on the cell surface. Since no significant differences in cell surface-associated viral glycoproteins and those shed from the cell surface were detected by pulse iodination analysis, it was concluded that the apparent discrepancy between immunoferritin labelling and immunoprecipitation analysis resulted from differences in antigen accessibility on intact virions caused by structural differences in the viral glycoproteins expressed on Novikoff and WRC cells. This conclusion was supported by results from ferritin-lectin labelling, affinity chromatography and neuraminidase digestion studies which demonstrated differences in the saccharide moieties on both virion and cell surface-associated viral glycoproteins. Further evidence of structural differences was provided by limited digestion with trypsin and V8 protease of the Mr 64 000 (Nov gp64) and Mr 68 000 (WRC gp68) viral glycoproteins immunoprecipitated from Novikoff and WRC cells, respectively, with either monospecific anti-Rauscher murine leukaemia virus anti-gp70 serum or monospecific antiserum against Nov gp64 (anti-gp64).

Despite the finding that E11 did not inhibit rosettes with C3b-coated sheep erythrocytes (EC3b), several lines of evidence indicated that E11 was specific for complement receptor type one (CR1). All monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erythrocytes that reacted with E11 formed EC3b rosettes. The E11 antigen on these cells was shown to be a molecule of 222 +/- 10 kDa. Treatment of lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils with E11 followed by fluorescein-coupled F(ab')2 anti-mouse-IgG at 37 degrees C in buffer lacking sodium azide, led to capping or apparent endocytosis of the E11 antigen and a diminution in CR1 activity of 88%, 59% and 25%, respectively. This same treatment had no detectable effect on monocyte or neutrophil CR3 activity (EC3bi rosettes). Furthermore, with E11-capped lymphocytes, the residual EC3b rosetting was capped directly over the E11-fluorescence cap, whereas EC3d,g rosetting (CR2 specific) was undiminished and distributed evenly around the circumference of cells containing E11-fluorescence caps. Finally, the binding of E11 to cells was inhibited by the prior treatment of these cells with a well characterized rabbit polyclonal anti-CR1. These data indicated that E11 was specific for a site in CR1 that was distal from the C3b-binding site, so that E11 was unable to block CR1 activity. E11 proved to be useful for identifying CR1 on various cells in tissue sections, and for quantitating CR1 on erythrocytes and neutrophils. Erythrocytes and neutrophils from normal individuals were found to bind an average of 610 and 4.6 X 10(4) 125I-labeled E11 molecules per cell. When E11 was visualized in tissues by immunoperoxidase staining, the cells that apparently contained the greatest amounts of CR1 were dendritic reticulum cells and kidney podocytes. The E11 reactive dentritic reticulum cells were characteristic of both follicular and diffuse follicular center cell tumors. Lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) characteristically expressed little E11, confirming earlier studies that CLL cells lacked CR1 activity detected by EAC1-3b rosette formation. Because normal B cells have been shown to express CR1 at a very early stage of maturation, the absence of CR1 on CLL cells is discordant with the immature nature of CLL cells defined by immunoglobulin expression.","['Hogg, N', 'Ross, G D', 'Jones, D B', 'Slusarenko, M', 'Walport, M J', 'Lachmann, P J']","['Hogg N', 'Ross GD', 'Jones DB', 'Slusarenko M', 'Walport MJ', 'Lachmann PJ']",['eng'],"['CA-25613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F06 TW00694/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Endocytosis', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Complement/*immunology', 'Rosette Formation']",1984/03/01 00:00,1984/03/01 00:01,['1984/03/01 00:00'],"['1984/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830140307 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1984 Mar;14(3):236-43. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830140307.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conditioned medium of HL-60 cells at high density stimulated [3H]glucose incorporation into lipids in rat adipocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The dose-response curve for this factor was not parallel to that for insulin, and the maximal effect achieved was much greater than reached by insulin or multiplication-stimulating activity. Moreover, the maximal effect reached by either insulin or the conditioned medium was additive. The insulin-like activity was not suppressed in the presence of antiinsulin antibody. Insulin-like activity was not detectable by radioreceptor assay for insulin, suggesting that the factor does not act through the insulin receptor. The factor in the conditioned medium of HL-60 cells was heat stable and sensitive to trypsin. When the conditioned medium was subjected to gel filtration on a Sephadex G-100 column, the major part of insulin-like activity eluted in the position corresponding to an apparent molecular weight between RNAase and insulin markers. The remaining activity, approximately 10% of the total, appeared with a larger molecular weight species.

RNase treatment of the nonleukemic ascites tumor cells (Ehrlich ascites tumor and Sarcoma 180) produced a significant reduction in their electrophoretic mobilities. When the cells were labeled with [3H]uridine then incubated with RNase, there was a marked increased in the radioactive nucleotides present in the incubation medium as compared to the results of the experiment with RNase-untreated controls. Indirect membrane immunofluorescence studies of nonleukemic ascites tumor cells suggest that the sites that react with anti-RNA antibody are distributed diffusely on their surfaces. RNase treatment of these cells markedly reduced their ability to react with the antibody. It thus appears that RNAs are present on the surface membrane of nonleukemic ascites tumor cells and that RNase digests these RNAs, removing negatively charged nucleotides from their electrophoretic surfaces. This results in a reduction in mobility. In contrast, leukemic ascites cells (L1210 and C1498) incubated with RNase showed no significant change in mobility or in the amount of nucleotides released into the incubation medium. Moreover, no fluorescence was found on the surface of cells examined by indirect membrane immunofluorescence.

The finding of low numbers of LC in patients with untreated aplastic anemia is suggestive of a medullary origin of LC in man.

In an attempt to shorten the time required for immunologic reconstitution, 14 patients were treated with thymosin fraction 5 after transplantation. Two died before administration of thymosin could be completed. In the remaining 12 patients, immunologic studies were compared to those of patients who were transplanted but did not receive thymosin. While five patients had transient elevation of in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis during thymosin treatment, results of other immunologic studies from patients treated with thymosin were similar to those from patients not treated. The subsequent development of graft-versus-host disease, major or minor infection, and leukaemic relapse was not different between the groups. Six patients are alive and five are well without problems; one has chronic graft-versus-host disease. We conclude that thymosin fraction 5 administered as described was not toxic. Although modifying some immunological parameters, thymosin did not appear to alter the incidence of graft-versus-host disease, infection or leukaemic relapse or to accelerate immunologic reconstitution.","['Witherspoon, R P', 'Hersman, J', 'Storb, R', 'Ochs, H', 'Goldstein, A L', 'McClure, J', 'Noel, D', 'Weiden, P L', 'Thomas, E D']","['Witherspoon RP', 'Hersman J', 'Storb R', 'Ochs H', 'Goldstein AL', 'McClure J', 'Noel D', 'Weiden PL', 'Thomas ED']",['eng'],"['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30924/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (thymosin fraction 5)', '61512-21-8 (Thymosin)', 'W0B22ISQ1C (Thymalfasin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/immunology', 'Antibody Formation/*drug effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/*drug effects', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Rosette Formation', 'Thymalfasin', 'Thymosin/*analogs & derivatives/blood/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1983.tb02841.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1983 Dec;55(4):595-608. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1983.tb02841.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the development of several new techniques has led to a more detailed cell characterization.

The enzyme assay is based on the incorporation of radiolabeled hypoxanthine into unfractionated heterologous tRNA and the reaction rate is proportional to the amount of added enzyme extract. Hydrolysis of the radiolabeled tRNA and analysis of the nucleoside composition yields inosine (the nucleoside of hypoxanthine) as the only radiolabeled product.

The formation of mouse lung tumours, for which there is no indication of a viral or hormonal etiology, has also proved to be significantly influenced by the H-2 haplotype.

Regularly they seem to be involved in normal cell differentiation and proliferation: a number of oncogene-encoded proteins specifically phosphorylates tyrosine, a key reaction in growth control. Certain human tumors exhibit activated forms of these genes and DNA fragments isolated from these neoplasms transform nonneoplastic cells (transfection assay). Oncogenes were first discovered and defined in a number of retroviruses; these viral oncogenes (v-onc) are thought to have been derived from the cellular oncogenes (c-onc). By integration of the v-onc genes into the host genome acute neoplastic transformation of the cell may occur. Several modes of oncogene activation are discussed that lead either to an increased dosage of gene product or to the formation of an altered gene product. The localization of oncogenes in the human genome near the breakpoints of specific chromosome aberrations involved in various neoplasms like Burkitt lymphoma and several leukemias emphasizes the importance of these genes in carcinogenesis.","['Bartram, C R']",['Bartram CR'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)']",IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA, Recombinant', '*Genes', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Retroviridae']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00443210 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 1984 Jan;141(3):134-42. doi: 10.1007/BF00443210.,124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is clear, however, that not all blast cells are leukemic cells, especially during rapid marrow regeneration. Similarly, some leukemia cell lines have been shown to differentiate in vitro, and the same process also occurs in vivo. Therefore, the leukemic burden may be due to more differentiated cells as well as to blast cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the human malignancy-associated nucleolar antigen (HMNA) could be used as a marker for leukemic cells and to examine its potential as a diagnostic tool. The proportion of HMNA-positive cells in the bone marrow of patients with acute leukemia was determined by indirect immunofluorescence with antibodies to HMNA and was compared with the differential counts routinely made in the clinic laboratory. The percentages of HMNA-positive cells among the nucleated cells in the marrow of 72 patients with clinical evidence of leukemia were significantly higher (range 9%-98%, median 83%) than those observed for nonleukemic individuals (range less than 0.05%-2.5%, median 1%) or for fractions of marrow cells from normal volunteers enriched for normal early progenitor cells (less than or equal to 2%). Patients with leukemia in remission had a lower percentage of HMNA-positive cells (range 0%-83%, median 3%). The percentage of HMNA-positive cells increased as patients approached relapse. Although the percentage of HMNA-positive cells was related to the percentage of blast cells in the bone marrow of the patients with leukemia, some partially differentiated cells were also HMNA-positive in some specimens, and some blastic cells were HMNA-negative in other specimens. These studies indicate the potential usefulness of HMNA as a marker for leukemic cells.","['Davis, F M', 'Hittelman, W N', 'McCredie, K B', 'Keating, M J', 'Vellekoop, L', 'Rao, P N']","['Davis FM', 'Hittelman WN', 'McCredie KB', 'Keating MJ', 'Vellekoop L', 'Rao PN']",['eng'],['CA-28153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (malignancy-associated nucleolar antigen, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Nucleolus/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*immunology/pathology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*immunology/pathology', 'Recurrence']",1984/03/01 00:00,1984/03/01 00:01,['1984/03/01 00:00'],"['1984/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83481-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 Mar;63(3):676-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The R3 clone is a non-differentiating DMSO-resistant clone (R3) and has altered membrane fluidity and dramatically altered insulin-binding properties. The receptor of R3 bound insulin as if it possessed a single class of low affinity receptors that lacks the property of negative cooperativity. The Scatchard plot is linear and there is no ligand-induced acceleration of dissociation. The Hill coefficient for R3 is 1, implying 'no cooperativity', whereas the Hill coefficient for the two DMSO-inducible clones, (FLC and F+) is 0.3, implying 'negative cooperativity'. In addition, the insulin receptor of R3 has a decreased affinity for insulin, manifested as a 40-fold increase in the amount of insulin required to compete for half of the tracer binding (41 nM for R3 vs. 1 nM for FLC and F+). Computer-fitted Scatchard plots analyzed by the negative cooperativity model reveal that R3 has 95 000 receptor sites/cell, with a high affinity constant Ke of 0.016 nM-1, and a low affinity constant, Kf of 0.012 nM-1. Both DMSO-inducible clones have about 40 000 receptor sites/cell with Ke of 0.11 nM-1 and Kf of 0.02 nM-1. Electron spin resonance measurements with the 5-nitroxy stearate spin probe demonstrate that R3 had a more fluid plasma membrane than the FLC and F+ clones. The lipid composition of R3 is different from that of the DMSO-inducible clones. The weight ratio for unsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids for R3 is 2.5, and the FLC clone has a lower ratio of 1.9. These results are consistent with our earlier findings in FLC that very high membrane fluidity is associated with alterations in the binding properties of the insulin receptor.","['Simon, I', 'Brown, T J', 'Ginsberg, B H']","['Simon I', 'Brown TJ', 'Ginsberg BH']",['eng'],"['AM 21084/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 21128/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 28516/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*physiology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fatty Acids/analysis', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Insulin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Fluidity', 'Membrane Lipids/analysis', 'Mice', 'Receptor, Insulin/metabolism']",1984/02/17 00:00,1984/02/17 00:01,['1984/02/17 00:00'],"['1984/02/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/02/17 00:01 [medline]', '1984/02/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(84)90052-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(84)90052-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1984 Feb 17;803(1-2):39-47. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(84)90052-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive screening against a variety of tissues indicates that L3B12 is sensitive and specific for leukocytes, related cells of bone marrow lineage, and their corresponding neoplasms. Unlike many lymphoid antigens that are not detectable following routine fixation and embedding, those recognized by L3B12 and related antibodies are variably preserved. L3B12 has proven useful in studying the antigen expression of normal leukocytic elements, lymphomas, and related disorders, and in enriching or depleting leukocytes from heterogeneous cell populations. From a diagnostic standpoint, L3B12 staining of tissue sections or cell suspensions is useful for distinguishing large cell lymphomas from undifferentiated carcinomas and in distinguishing lymphomas and leukemias from other small round cell tumors of childhood.","['Wood, G S', 'Link, M', 'Warnke, R A', 'Dilley, J', 'Levy, R']","['Wood GS', 'Link M', 'Warnke RA', 'Dilley J', 'Levy R']",['eng'],['USPHS-CA 21223/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Mice/immunology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Middle Aged', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/immunology']",1984/02/01 00:00,1984/02/01 00:01,['1984/02/01 00:00'],"['1984/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/81.2.176 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1984 Feb;81(2):176-83. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/81.2.176.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The circulating formed elements in the peripheral blood show highly reproducible circadian rhythms. The timing and the extent of these rhythms were established in a clinically healthy human population and are shown as chronograms, cosinor summaries and, for some high-amplitude rhythms, as time-qualified reference ranges (chronodesms). Not only the number but also the reactivity of circulating blood cells varies predictably as a function of time as shown for the circadian rhythm in responsiveness of human and murine lymphocytes in vitro to lectin mitogens (phytohemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen). Some circadian rhythms of hematologic functions appear to be innate and are presumably genetically determined but are modulated and adjusted in their timing by environmental factors, so-called synchronizers. Phase alterations in the circadian rhythms of hematologic parameters of human subjects and of mice by manipulation of the activity-rest or light-dark schedule and/or of the time of food uptake are presented. Characteristically these functions do not change their timing immediately after a shift in synchronizer phase but adapt over several and in some instances over many transient cycles. The circadian rhythm of cell proliferation in the mammalian bone marrow and lymphoid system as shown in mice in vivo and in vitro may lend itself to timed treatment with cell-cycle-specific and nonspecific agents in an attempt to maximize the desired and to minimize the undesired treatment effects upon the marrow. Differences in response, and susceptibility of cells and tissues at different stages of their circadian and circaseptan (about 7-day) rhythms and presumably of cyclic variations in other frequencies are expected to lead to the development of a chronopharmacology of the hematopoietic and immune system. Infradian rhythms of several frequencies have been described for numerous hematologic and immune functions. Some of these, i.e., in the circaseptan frequency range, seem to be of importance for humoral and for cell mediated immune functions including allograft rejection. Infradian rhythms with periods of 19 to 22 days seem to occur in some hematologic functions and are very prominent in cyclic neutropenia and (with shorter periods) in its animal model, the grey collie syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Haus, E', 'Lakatua, D J', 'Swoyer, J', 'Sackett-Lundeen, L']","['Haus E', 'Lakatua DJ', 'Swoyer J', 'Sackett-Lundeen L']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am J Anat,The American journal of anatomy,0376312,"['0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Allergy and Immunology', 'Animals', '*Biological Clocks', 'Blood Cells/physiology', 'Blood Physiological Phenomena', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Capillaries', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Dog Diseases/pathology', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Forecasting', '*Hematology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunity', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/classification/immunology/physiology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/cytology/immunology', 'Male', 'Menstruation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogens/immunology', 'Neutropenia/pathology', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations/administration & dosage', 'Rats', 'Seasons']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/aja.1001680406 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Anat. 1983 Dec;168(4):467-517. doi: 10.1002/aja.1001680406.,113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus the regulation of the cell division is excluded. The DNA-molecules which are in their structure analogous or much equal to the desoxyribonucleic acids of the proviruses and the tumour viruses are normal constituents of the nucleus-DNA of the man and the animals and are called cellular oncogens in contrast to the viral oncogens. Under physiologic conditions the cellular oncogens are not or only at a very small extent used for the formation of proteins. Some tumour viruses cause a formation of tumours only by means of an activation of cellular oncogens, i.e. by efficacy as promotor sections. In man most tumours develop under the influence of carcinogens which lead to the development of repair processes on the DNA and to the new organisation of the arrangement of DNA-molecules. Here the cellular oncogens are activated, which evoke an increased synthesis of transforming proteins. Thus, on principle the development of tumours takes place in the same way in man and animal. In the most tumour forms of man oncogenic DNA-molecules are proved, which in their structure correspond to the viral oncogens of animals.","['Kolb, E']",['Kolb E'],['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Z Gesamte Inn Med,Zeitschrift fur die gesamte innere Medizin und ihre Grenzgebiete,21730470R,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Viruses/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology', 'Oncogenic Viruses/*metabolism', 'Poultry', 'Primates', 'Retroviridae/metabolism', 'Sarcoma/etiology']",1983/11/15 00:00,1983/11/15 00:01,['1983/11/15 00:00'],"['1983/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Z Gesamte Inn Med. 1983 Nov 15;38(22):601-8.,60,Neuere Erkenntnisse zur Biochemie und zu den Eigenschaften von Tumorviren sowie zur Biochemie der Tumorentwicklung bei Mensch und Tier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protection against endogenous and exogenous infection was attempted by a rigorous sterile protective isolation regimen, comprising laminar-air-flow cabinets, daily decontamination of skin, mucous membranes and intestines. All supplies of food, fluids, medicine and equipment were sterilized. In all patients a heavy suppression of the normal bacterial flora was obtained after approximately 1 week and 85% of a total of 1026 days of decontamination revealed only scanty growth in one or a few regions of the patients. The surviving microorganisms were Candida albicans and non-pathogenic commensals (mainly Staphylococcus albus). In 1 patient only an exogenic microorganism was introduced possibly by transfusion or staff. 16 febrile episodes were recorded in the patients during decontamination covering 21% of the period. Four episodes were caused by bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and mixed). In most of the remaining episodes the etiology was not established. The results thus show that endogenous pathogenic bacteria can be eradicated by the regimen, and that systemic antimicrobial chemotherapy can be restricted and guided by the results of the previous and contemporary cultures. However, viral infections remain a major problem in these patients.

The presence of antibodies was examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) and the indirect antiglobulin rosetting reaction (IARR). Galactose oxidase treatment destroyed the ability of leukaemic cells to react with antibodies prepared in the hybrid mice, an effect that was reversed by treating the enzyme-modified cells with borohydride. Analysis by immunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of leukaemic cells, labelled by the galactose oxidase/[3H]-NaBH4 technique, indicated that a group of glycoproteins of apparent molecular weight greater than 70 000 was involved. Antibodies could be raised in AKR mice to the same group of glycoproteins by immunization with irradiated leukaemic cells or irradiated neuraminidase-treated leukaemic cells. The level of antibody raised in AKR mice had no effect on the growth of leukaemic lymphoblasts introduced subcutaneously into the host. Antibodies prepared in hybrid mice against leukaemic cells also were absorbed by lymphoid cells of pre-leukaemic 6-month-old AKR mice, indicating that contrary to previous claims in the literature antigens detected by such antisera are not related to malignancy. Hybrid mouse serum cross-reacted with antigens from purified RNA virus isolated from Abelson lymphoma, as demonstrated by the immunoelectrophoretic blotting technique. The pattern of reactivity was not appreciably altered following the absorption of antibodies directed against leukaemic cells. It is concluded that the glycoproteins detected by us may not be viral antigens but normal high molecular weight lymphoid glycoproteins with altered glycosylation patterns that are induced when the viral genomes are expressed.","['McClure, M O', 'Cook, G M']","['McClure MO', 'Cook GM']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', 'EC 1.1.3.9 (Galactose Oxidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Galactose Oxidase/pharmacology', 'Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Rosette Formation']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1983 Nov;64:213-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Test of thyroid graft rejection between B6.C-H-2bm1 and C57BL/6 mice following reciprocal immunization with normal versus malignant cells.,485-99,"The immunogenic properties of one (or few) selected antigen(s) encoded by the mouse major histocompatibility complex was studied using the C57BL/6(B6) mouse strain and its descendant B6.C-H-2bm1(bm1) mutant. These strains differ in a point mutation in the H-2K region. We compared the immunogenic and antigenic expression of the mutated antigen on different bm1 tissues by testing the vulnerability of these tissues to graft rejection response in B6 recipients. Previous results demonstrated that B6 and bm1 mice do not reject reciprocal thyroid transplants, despite the acute rejection of reciprocal skin grafts. Thyroid grafts were rejected, however, after presensitizing the recipients with skin graft syngeneic with the thyroid, but not after sensitization with spleen cells. In the present work we induced tumors in bm1 mice by treating them with a chemical carcinogen (3-methylcholanthrene). We found that two out of four tumors demonstrated strict strain specificity and were rejected by all mouse strains (including the B6 recipients) except by their strain of origin. All tumors were found to be sensitive to in vitro lysis by B6 anti-bm1 effector cells. HZ1-A and HZ1-B tumor cells were rejected by B6 recipient mice but could not immunize B6 mice against a subsequent bm1 thyroid graft. When testing the immunogenicity of B6 originated EL4 leukemia cells (which are fatal to B6 mice), we found that the tumor cells were rejected by bm1 recipients, but, unlike B6 skin grafts, were incapable of inducing the rejection of a subsequent B6 thyroid transplant. The results demonstrated that an H-2K molecule may exhibit different immunological properties when expressed on cells of different tissues. The different expression of the mutated antigen on different cell types, its ability to trigger T cells but not B cells responses and the potential involvement of the tissue specific differentiation molecules in the graft rejection response are discussed.","['Isakov, N', 'Segal, S']","['Isakov N', 'Segal S']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,['0 (H-2 Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Graft Rejection', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'Immunization', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'Skin Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Thyroid Gland/*transplantation', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-2985(83)80071-0 [pii]', '10.1016/S0171-2985(83)80071-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 1983 Dec;165(5):485-99. doi: 10.1016/S0171-2985(83)80071-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All of them received bone-marrow grafts from HLA matched, MLC nonreactive, sibling donors, were nursed in laminar down-flow isolators with selective gut decontamination, and received GvHD prophylaxis with methotrexate. The number of nucleated cells in the marrow graft/kg body weight of the recipient had no relation with the rapidity of engraftment or with the occurrence and severity of GvHD. The number of hematopoietic progenitor cells (CFUc)/kg had a weak, but significant, correlation with both the number of neutrophils at day 30 post BMT and with the day at which the reticulocytes passed the 10% level. The number of T cells/kg did not show any correlation with either the occurrence or the severity of GvHD. Our data show that the concentration of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the graft correlates with the rapidity of engraftment. However, within the range of numbers of T cells infused in this study, no correlation is present between T cells in the graft and GvHD. Therefore, nearly complete depletion of marrow grafts of T cells is probably necessary to effectively decrease the incidence of GvHD.","['Jansen, J', 'Goselink, H M', 'Veenhof, W F', 'Zwaan, F E', 'Blotkamp, C']","['Jansen J', 'Goselink HM', 'Veenhof WF', 'Zwaan FE', 'Blotkamp C']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Female', '*Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1983 Nov;11(10):967-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The independence of chromosomal findings from other prognostic features in predicting long-term response to treatment is now established [2-5, 7-9]. In children, a good or bad prognosis can be predicted only when a chromosomally abnormal cell line is identified. Differential prognosis, then, depends on the nature of the abnormality. In adults, as in children, the kind of abnormal clone, when present, is of some value prognostically.

PL-21 cells were positive for peroxidase, naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase, and Sudan Black B staining. Under the usual culture conditions, a small proportion of these cells differentiated into mature granulocytes, and this differentiation was enhanced by the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide in the culture medium. PL-21 cells had receptors for the Fc portion of IgG and complement, intracytoplasmic lysozyme and phagocytic activity, but lacked Epstein-Barr virus-associated nuclear antigen. Chromosome analysis of this cell line revealed a human male polyploid karyotype with 13q+ and double minute chromosomes.

Lessons from the last two EORTC trials and prospects for the future.,7-14,"It is well known that patients with granulocytopenia due either to bone marrow failure, acute leukemia or its treatment, or as a result of other intensive chemotherapy are at enhanced risk of serious infection. Several approaches have been designed to minimize the risk of infection in these patients by means of suppression of gastrointestinal flora. A retrospective review of infection in febrile neutropenic patients revealed a significant decrease in bacteremia in patients who had received some oral antimicrobial regimen compared with those who did not. In one large series, infection due to the four most common infecting organisms in neutropenic patients (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species) occurred in 28% of 380 patients receiving some oral antibiotic regimen compared with 44% of 426 receiving no oral prophylaxis. Aminoglycosides alone or in combination with vancomycin or polymyxin and bacitracin and other agents have been utilized in gut decontaminating regimens. More recently, selective decontamination with a variety of oral agents including nalidixic acid, cotrimoxazole, colistin, etc. have been shown to be effective in some trials. Although cotrimoxazole initially was thought to be beneficial in reducing infection and bacteremia in neutropenic patients, the recently completed EORTC trial did not show a significant difference in incidence of infection or bacteremia in acute leukemia patients attendant upon the use of oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

The present study addressed the question whether the prophylactic administration of a similar amount of J5 antiserum could protect neutropenic patients from acquiring gram-negative infections. One hundred patients, the majority of which had acute non-lymphoblastic (63%) and lymphoblastic (29%) leukemia, presented 109 episodes of neutropenia. Sixty of the 100 patients underwent bone marrow transplantation. All patients were given one unit of either pre-immune (control) or J5 antiserum serum from volunteers at the onset of neutropenia. When compared to control serum, J5 antiserum given prophylactically did not reduce the number of febrile days, the number of gram-negative bacteremic episodes, or death from these infections. This inability to demonstrate a beneficial effect of prophylaxis with a single unit of J5 antiserum in prolonged neutropenia may have several explanations that are discussed.","['McCutchan, J A', 'Wolf, J L', 'Ziegler, E J', 'Braude, A I']","['McCutchan JA', 'Wolf JL', 'Ziegler EJ', 'Braude AI']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr Suppl,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift.

This paper reviews our subsequent studies in prophylaxis of herpes group infections in a high risk group of patients suffering from acute leukaemia. In study 1 we randomised HSV seropositive (greater than or equal to 1:8) patients to receive intravenous acyclovir or placebo. In this stratified study bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients were completely protected from HSV infections by acyclovir compared with a 50% failure rate for those on placebo. There was significant protection also in the non-BMT group [8]. In study 2 oral acyclovir prophylaxis failed to provide complete protection in BMT recipients despite the achievement of apparently adequate blood levels. In study 1 the secretion of EBV in saliva before and during the trial gave inconclusive results. In each of the first two studies one patient on ""active"" acyclovir developed a cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Thus, at the dosage of drug used, prophylaxis of CMV was unsuccessful suggesting that claims of therapeutic efficacy are unlikely to be supported in controlled trials. Study 3 is current and concerns the pharmacokinetics of an acyclovir prodrug (BW 134U) taken by mouth. This drug is near 100% absorbed and achieves approximately twice the level of active acyclovir in vivo, following conversion by adenosine deaminase (ADA), in normal volunteers.","['Prentice, H G', 'Hann, I M']","['Prentice HG', 'Hann IM']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr Suppl,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift.

Electrophoresis of thymic lymphoma, myeloid leukemia and reticulum sarcoma cells.",691-700,"Electrophoretic mobility of cells from 21 primary mouse leukemias was investigated and compared with that of various normal mouse reference cells. Six thymic lymphomas, nine reticulum cell sarcomas, five myeloid leukemias and one stem-cell leukemia were examined. The mean AEM of cells from the group of primary thymic lymphomas (1.13 microns s-1 V-1 cm) was similar to that of reticulum cell sarcomas (1.15 microns s-1 V-1 cm) and significantly lower than that of the myeloid leukemias (1.20 microns s-1 V-1 cm). Since the examined cell suspensions were prepared from leukemic lymph nodes, the analysis was performed to investigate the possible admixture of normal LNC in the cell populations. Electrophoretograms of normal and leukemic lymph nodes were compared and the AEM of cells from leukemic lymph nodes was considered separately for two cell populations, one corresponding in size to normal LNC (6-9 microns in diameter) and the other to leukemic blast cells (10-16 microns in diameter). In the 6-9 microns cell subpopulations from leukemic lymph nodes, electrophoretically slow cells corresponding to B LNC were almost totally depleted (1%); also electrophoretically fast cells with the mean AEM of T LNC were fewer (45-57%) than in normal LNC populations. The leukemic cells 10-16 microns in diameter displayed mean AEM of 1.09 (thymic lymphomas), 1.12 (reticulum cell sarcomas) and 1.21 (myeloid leukemia) micron s-1 V-1 cm. The mean AEM of blast cells from thymic lymphomas and reticulum cell sarcomas was not significantly different; it was similar to that of blast cells prepared from normal mouse thymus (1.09 microns s-1 V-1 cm) on a density gradient. In contrast, the 10-16 microns cell populations from lymph nodes of mice with myeloid leukemias were significantly faster than blast cells from thymic lymphomas and reticulum cell sarcomas.","['Bubenikova, D', 'Bubenik, J']","['Bubenikova D', 'Bubenik J']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,,IM,"['Animals', 'Electrophoresis', 'Female', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/analysis', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*pathology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1983;30(6):691-700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these studies we demonstrated that, although these tumor cells are sensitive in vitro both to lysis by NK or NK-like cells and to the growth-inhibitory effect of murine L-cell interferon (IFN), the growth of the tumor in vivo could be either inhibited or enhanced by IFN. The outcome of in vivo IFN treatment was dependent on the timing and route of IFN administration relative to tumor challenge. IFN given systematically at the same time as tumor challenge resulted in enhancement of primary tumor formation, rate of tumor growth and subsequent progressive tumor growth. In contrast, IFN administered at the site of tumor inoculation on days 1-3 after tumor challenge inhibited tumor formation and growth. Histopathology of tissue sections obtained from the site of tumor challenge confirmed these results. Similar studies performed in mice given 450 rads of X-irradiation showed that IFN could still inhibit tumor growth when administered at the site of tumor inoculation on days 1-3 after tumor challenge. IFN administered simultaneously with tumor challenge, however, did not enhance tumor growth in irradiated mice. These results are consistent with the interpretation that 1) inhibition of MSC-induced tumor growth by IFN has a radioresistant component and 2) the enhancement of MSC-induced tumor formation by IFN is dependent on interaction with a radiosensitive population of cells, possibly lymphoid cells.","['Murasko, D M', 'Fresa, K', 'Mark, R']","['Murasko DM', 'Fresa K', 'Mark R']",['eng'],"['AI-16840/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05418/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'L Cells/immunology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1983/12/15 00:00,1983/12/15 00:01,['1983/12/15 00:00'],"['1983/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910320616 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1983 Dec 15;32(6):751-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910320616.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The binding was inhibited appreciably with F(ab')2 fragments specific for the L2C surface IgM idiotypic determinants.

Most preparations consist of the isolated mycobacterial cell wall or cell wall skeleton attached to oil. Cord factor (trehalose dimycolate) has also been included in some preparations. In animal models, such preparations given intralesionally, systemically, or as a vaccine can cause regression of disease and establish tumor-specific immunity. Trials in humans have utilized oil-attached mycobacterial components given intralesionally, intradermally, intrapleurally, intraperitoneally, intravenously, and as an ointment. The major toxicity has been fever, chills, and local inflammation and/or abscess formation. An increase in the white blood count and lymphocyte count has been observed. An increase in liver function test was reported in a minority of patients. Given intralesionally, these preparations cause regression of the injected lesion, regression of noninjected cutaneous and visceral disease, and the apparent establishment of a tumor-specific immune response. Administered intrapleurally and intraperitoneally, there is a response and a clearing of malignant cells in approximately 50% of cases. Given intravenously, oil-attached cell wall skeleton and trehalose dimycolate can eradicate pulmonary disease. Used as an ointment, the preparations have been effective in mycosis fungoides and Kaposi's sarcoma. These reagents demonstrate definite single-agent activity.

Absolute bone marrow cell concentrations were monitored by measuring cell concentrations in an aspirate sample and correcting for dilution with blood by a cell cycle kinetic method using cytofluorometry.

There was no trend observed according to age. Granulocytes had a much higher effective D0, approximately 1000 rad in vivo. Absolute nucleated cell concentration in marrow dropped slowly initially, due to an increased lymphocyte concentration in marrow during a concurrent drop in lymphocyte concentration in peripheral blood, but eventually fell on the last day of TBI ranging from 7-44% of the initial marrow nucleated cell concentration.

Results in seventy leukemia patients with allogeneic transplants.,1607-11,"From May, 1979 to March, 1981, 76 leukemia patients were prepared for bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with a new hyperfractionated total body irradiation (TBI) regimen (1320 cGy in 11 fractions, 3x/day), followed by cyclophosphamide, 60 mg/kg, for two days. Partial lung shielding was done on each treatment, with supplemental electron beam treatments of the chest wall to compensate, and of the testes, a sanctuary site. This regimen was initiated to potentially reduce fatal interstitial pneumonitis as well as decrease leukemic relapse. These patients were analyzed in May, 1982, for a minimum follow-up of 14 months. Overall actuarial survival at 1 year for acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) patients is 63%, while relapse-free survival at 1 year is 53%. For those ANLL patients who underwent BMT while in remission (first, second, and third combined), relapse-free survival is 61% at 1 year compared with 40% for those patients who had their BMT at the time of relapse (greater than or equal to 10% blasts in marrow). On the other hand, for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) patients, there is no significant difference between relapse or remission patients with regard to overall survival or relapse-free survival, when relapse is defined as greater than 5% blasts in the marrow at the time of cytoreduction. Overall actuarial survival at 1 year for ALL is 61% and relapse-free survival is 45% at 1 year. Patients with ALL who had their BMT cytoreduction at the time of relapse have a survival equal to that of our remission patients, and greater than that of patients in relapse cytoreduced with a single dose as reported by others. However, patients with greater than or equal to 10% blasts have not fared as well, having only a 22% 1 year relapse-free survival compared with a 68% 1 year relapse-free survival for patients with less than 10% blasts. Fatal interstitial pneumonitis has dropped to 18% compared with 50% in our previous single-dose TBI regimen (1000 cGy), in which the same doses of cyclophosphamide were given prior to TBI. In conclusion, not only has fatal interstitial pneumonitis been reduced by hyperfractionation and partial lung blocking, but there may be a survival advantage in ALL patients in relapse, who have a survival equal to that of remission patients. This may indicate a greater cell kill with the higher dose (1320 cGy) attained with this regimen, in these patients with a higher leukemic cell burden.","['Shank, B', 'Chu, F C', 'Dinsmore, R', 'Kapoor, N', 'Kirkpatrick, D', 'Teitelbaum, H', 'Reid, A', 'Bonfiglio, P', 'Simpson, L', ""O'Reilly, R J""]","['Shank B', 'Chu FC', 'Dinsmore R', 'Kapoor N', 'Kirkpatrick D', 'Teitelbaum H', 'Reid A', 'Bonfiglio P', 'Simpson L', ""O'Reilly RJ""]",['eng'],"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/prevention & control', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*methods']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(83)90412-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(83)90412-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1983 Nov;9(11):1607-11. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(83)90412-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutagenicity is only weakly correlated with in vitro inhibition of L1210 cell growth; however, mutagenicity, yeast toxicity and in vitro and in vivo antitumour activity are all correlated with selective binding to polydeoxy(adenylic-thymidylic) acid rather than polydeoxy(guanylic-cytidylic) acid, as measured by an ethidium competition assay. It is concluded that A-T-rich DNA may be a target for all the biological effects measured in this study.

When the extract was not dehaeminized, SMWP in agarose electrophoresis was shown to have peroxidase activity probably due to the presence of haem. When this non-dehaeminized extract was chromatographed on Con-A Sepharose neither SMWP nor an antigen (EbAg) present in Eb livers were retained. The association of EbAg with SMWP is still unexplained. Immunoelectrophoresis shows a reaction of identity between chicken SMWP and serum albumin. Chicken SMWP is thus not a beta 2-microglobulin. The finding of an immunological relationship between SMWP and albumin confirms the biochemical homology of SMWP with serum albumin in terms of amino acid residues.

It is generally successful when used early in the treatment of aplastic anaemia. It is the only treatment that offers long-term disease-free survival for patients with acute leukaemia who have relapsed at least once, with 10-30 per cent apparent cures. Although still somewhat controversial, it appears also to be the treatment of choice for patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia in first chemotherapy induced remission and for those with chronic myelogenous leukaemia in the chronic phase since approximately 50-60 per cent of these patients are surviving after marrow transplantation in complete remission, apparently cured. Marrow grafting is the only effective treatment for many patients with inherited immunological-deficiency diseases and certain genetic storage diseases. It is being explored for the therapy of patients with lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, small-cell lung cancer, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer and genetic disorders of haematopoiesis. Cures of congenital Fanconi anaemia, Blackfan-Diamond anaemia, osteopetrosis, and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria have been achieved by marrow grafting. Genetic disorders associated with haemolytic anaemia and cyclic neutropenia have been cured by marrow grafting in animals. Target disorders for marrow transplantation in humans are thalassaemia major and sickle cell disease, and, indeed, a first successful transplant for treatment of thalassaemia major has recently been described (Thomas et al, 1982). Marrow transplantation has been limited by the fact that many patients do not have HLA-identical siblings and very few have monozygotic twins. The Seattle team has now explored the use of less well-matched family member donors in more than 80 patients with leukaemia. These donors share one HLA haplotype genetically with the patient and are phenotypically identical at two of the three major HLA loci on the other HLA haplotype (Clift et al, 1979). Overall, the post-transplant survival appears more a reflection of the type and stage of the leukaemia than of the marrow donor. Patients with leukaemia grafted in relapse have a projected survival of 20-30 per cent and those transplanted in remission of 50 per cent. The incidence and severity of GVHD may not be significantly different from that of patients given HLA-identical sibling marrow grafts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Storb, R', 'Santos, G W']","['Storb R', 'Santos GW']",['eng'],"['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30924/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Clin Haematol,Clinics in haematology,0331547,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications/*therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Disease', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy', 'HLA Antigens/analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Infections/etiology/therapy', 'Leukemia/complications/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Postoperative Complications/etiology/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1983/10/01 00:00,1983/10/01 00:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0308-2261(83)80007-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Haematol. 1983 Oct;12(3):721-37. doi: 10.1016/s0308-2261(83)80007-1.,103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and other tumor promoters, these cells adhere to the surface of the culture dish or become agglutinated to each other. Structurally related compounds which are devoid of tumor promoting activity failed to induce agglutination of MEL cells. Pentamidine isethionate (PI) and tosylamide-phenylethyl-chloromethyl ketone, two known inhibitors of trypsin-like enzymes, prevent the phorbol esters-induced adherence and agglutination. A short exposure to TPA results in an increase in protease activity at the alkaline pH range. This TPA-induced proteolytic activity is inhibited by PI. Induction of erythroid differentiation by hexamethylene-bisacetamide is associated with a decrease in TPA-induced cell adhesion and TPA-induced proteolytic activity.

It has offered a treatment which often cures patients of more than 20 otherwise lethal diseases. The treatment so horrendously difficult and dangerous at first has already been greatly improved, simplified, and made much safer. The availability of a suitable donor has been much extended and real progress has been made in prevention and perhaps even in treatment of graft-versus-host disease. This has made possible the option of marrow transplantation for every patient in whom we think the treatment may be beneficial. The problem underlying many cases of interstitial pneumonia has been identified and patients are already benefitting clinically from this progress. Progress has also been made which promises antiviral therapy which could reduce, prevent, and ultimately eliminate the intercurrent virus infections which limit the applicability of marrow transplantation, especially for children with severe immunodeficiencies. I do not know how far this line of investigation can be taken. However, just as we have learned stepwise to use marrow transplants from matched siblings to treat many diseases, to use fetal liver in place of bone marrow, to employ matched relative donors when a matched sibling is not available, and, finally, even to use parental donors to achieve correction of SCID, we now have good reason to believe that, ultimately, we can use marrow transplantation without fear of GVHD to address many additional genetically determined and acquired diseases; certainly, for those diseases that involve any of the cells that are derived from bone marrow cells, and perhaps for those attributable even to cells of other organs and tissues, the functions of which are, in whole or in part, a consequence of interactions of marrow-derived cells and cells of ectodermal or endodermal origin, marrow transplantation may be useful. To us, the future of marrow transplantation as a major modality of treatment or prevention of many diseases, including hemoglobinopathesis, immunodeficiencies, hematologic abnormalities, abnormalities of function of marrow-derived cells, and even inborn errors of function of cells of organs and tissues not of marrow origin, seems bright, indeed.

The findings were analyzed in relationship to the histologic pattern of involvement, as well as to the immunologic data of cell suspensions from peripheral blood. In all cases, the dominant lymphoid population within the bone marrow infiltrates showed identical phenotypic characteristics of B-CLL cells from the blood (HLA-DR+, mu +, most frequently delta +, kappa +, or lambda +, and weakly RFA-1+). The infiltration by these malignant B cells was diffuse in 5 cases and nodular plus interstitial in 12. The number of T cells (UCHT1+, RFA-1+, mu) was variable (5%-25%) in the different samples, but the values were high when compared to the proportion of T cells in normal bone marrow and in the blood of most patients studied. Furthermore, a clear predominance of T cells exhibiting the inducer phenotype (Leu-3+) was observed in all bone marrow samples, which is in contrast with the findings from peripheral blood, where T cells with the suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype (Leu-2+) were dominant. These data suggest a different blood and tissue distribution of inducer and suppressor/cytotoxic cells in B-CLL, which may have important pathophysiologic significance.","['Pizzolo, G', 'Chilosi, M', 'Ambrosetti, A', 'Semenzato, G', 'Fiore-Donati, L', 'Perona, G']","['Pizzolo G', 'Chilosi M', 'Ambrosetti A', 'Semenzato G', 'Fiore-Donati L', 'Perona G']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/immunology']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63318-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1983 Dec;62(6):1289-96.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TBI was delivered in a single dose (sTBI) of 10 Gy, at a dose rate of 0.06-0.08 Gy/min, or in fractionated doses (fTBI) of 3.3 Gy/d, on each of 3 consecutive days, at the same dose rate. Lung shielding was adopted for all patients, in order to obtain a homogeneous dose delivered to the lung and at midline. The first 12 patients were prepared with sTBI and the following 18 with fTBI. Several variables (remission status, mode of irradiation, prevention of graft versus host disease (GvHD) with methotrexate (MTX) or cyclosporin A(CyA) were then analysed for their influence on (a) incidence and mortality of GvHD, (b) incidence and mortality of interstitial pneumonia (IP), (c) 100-d survival, and (d) relapses. Our data suggest that fTBI is the single most important factor associated with a lower incidence of IP (P = 0.002), a lower mortality from GvHD and IP (P = 0.03 and 0.001) and a better 100-d survival (P = 0.03). Remission status had no significant influence on GvHD, IP and acute mortality. When compared to MTX, the use of CyA was associated with less GvHD and IP, but when only patients in remission given fTBI were analysed, this was no longer true. Relapses were mostly influenced by the remission status of the patient at transplant (P = 0.001).

Since cells are smeared and fixed before staining it is possible to combine optimal preservation of cellular detail with visualization of positive labelling. Additional advantages over conventional immunofluorescent procedures for detecting cellular antigens include the fact that samples may be stored for long periods both before and after staining, and that double labelling may readily be performed (either by combining immunoenzymatic staining with T cell rosetting or by performing immunoperoxidase and immuno-alkaline phosphatase techniques sequentially). Furthermore, these methods may be applied to samples containing too few cells for conventional examination (e.g. samples of cerebrospinal fluid). A total of 16 different antigens (including HLA-DR, common ALL antigen and antigens associated with T cells, B cells, erythroid cells and megakaryocytes) were demonstrated by immuno-enzymatic staining on a range of normal and neoplastic haematological samples. It is concluded that this approach to cellular antigen labelling is of potential value not only in routine haematological diagnosis, but also for research in many immunological and haematological fields.","['Moir, D J', 'Ghosh, A K', 'Abdulaziz, Z', 'Knight, P M', 'Mason, D Y']","['Moir DJ', 'Ghosh AK', 'Abdulaziz Z', 'Knight PM', 'Mason DY']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Blood Cells/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peroxidases', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1983.tb02154.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1983 Nov;55(3):395-410. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1983.tb02154.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this group low levels of PKK, Factor XII and HMWK and increased KK-I are common. In chronic renal disease patients, only F XII and KK-I are elevated, whereas PKK and HMWK are normal. Kidney transplantation leads to a rise in KK-I and reduction of PKK and HMWK. The values almost normalize few days after the operation. Factor XII, slightly increased immediately after transplantation, remains high in long term transplant recipients, whereas HMWK falls below normal. In liver disease patients, acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis of the liver and coma, PKK is reduced. In cases with acute hepatitis PKK raises with recovery.

The higher the resistance of leukemic blasts to chemotherapy, the more aggressive the induction therapy necessary to achieve favourable results. Intensive therapy produces a transient phase of bone marrow aplasia in which the patients must be protected by supportive care. Sensitivity to chemotherapy is relatively low in acute myelocytic leukemia. Therefore, the maximum tolerable dose of multi-drug chemotherapy is necessary to induce complete remissions (CR), which can be achieved in about 75% of patients under 65 years. Up to 40% remain in continuous remission longer than 3 years. The recurrence rate is high. Relapses are highly resistant to therapy, and therefore bone marrow transplantation is considered during the first CR. Most cases with acute lymphocytic leukemia are associated with higher sensitivity to chemotherapy. Less aggressive induction therapy in combination with maintenance therapy achieves CR in up to 85% of patients, about half of whom remain in continuous remission more than 3 years.

Distinct differences in the movement and regeneration of cell surface Ig were observed when these cells were compared. Both L2C and KSL cells were slower to cap than normal B cells which formed a well-organized single patch.

Up to 30.11.81, 162 patients had completed treatment and were evaluable. Of these, 77.8% achieved complete remission, 80.7% in the age group 15-35 years and 68.3% in the age group greater than 35-65 years. The median survival time for all patients was 24 months and for the 126 patients with complete remission the median has not yet been reached (last observation 31 months). The median remission duration is 20 months. Prognostic factors for remission duration are (1) the number of chemotherapy courses required to reach complete remission, (2) the immunological subtype, (3) age and (4) initial leukocyte count.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Hoelzer, D', 'Thiel, E', 'Loffler, H', 'Bodenstein, H', 'Plaumann, L', 'Buchner, T', 'Urbanitz, D', 'Koch, P', 'Heimpel, H', 'Engelhardt, R']","['Hoelzer D', 'Thiel E', 'Loffler H', 'Bodenstein H', 'Plaumann L', 'Buchner T', 'Urbanitz D', 'Koch P', 'Heimpel H', 'Engelhardt R', 'et al.']",['ger'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies']",1983/08/01 00:00,1983/08/01 00:01,['1983/08/01 00:00'],"['1983/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000215227 [doi]'],ppublish,Onkologie. 1983 Aug;6(4):170-4. doi: 10.1159/000215227.,,Patientenrekrutierung und Ergebnisse einer Vorphasestudie zur Therapie der akuten lymphatischen Leukamie und der akuten undifferenzierten Leukamie des Erwachsenen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Actuarial two-year survival rates were 0 per cent, 29 per cent, and 44 per cent, respectively. Twelve patients are still alive and in remission after 327 to 1488 days, with 10 surviving beyond two years. Acute graft-versus-host disease and viral pneumonia were the major causes of death. Leukemic cells failed to clear in one patient with end-stage disease, and a relapse with meningeal leukemia occurred in another. Only one other relapse was seen--in a patient given a transplant during a third remission. Survival was favorably affected by younger age and transplantation during first remission. We conclude that high-dose chemotherapy with busulfan and cyclophosphamide, followed by allogeneic-marrow transplantation, can produce long-term remission of acute leukemia.

A report of a randomised, controlled study.",343-6,"Based on the concept of ""stem-cell competition,"" hypertransfusion has been shown to attenuate the leucopenia associated with chemotherapy in children with leukemia. We conducted a randomized, controlled study of hypertransfusion in 25 patients with inoperable lung cancer who received combination chemotherapy consisting of methotrexate, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and CCNU (Lomustine) (MACC scheme). Twelve patients in the hypertransfusion group were given red cell transfusion to a hemoglobin value greater than or equal to 17 gm/dl prior to each chemotherapy cycle. The two groups of patients were comparable in age, cell type, extent of disease, performance status, and initial hemoglobin level and blood counts. The mean fall in granulocyte count was greater for control group (3.76 X 10(9)/liter) than for hypertransfusion group (3.27 X 10(9)/liter), and the mean fall in platelet count was greater for control group (53.84 X 10(9)/liter) than for hypertransfusion group (35.83 X 10(9)/liter), although the differences did not reach statistical significance (p greater than 0.05) partly because our MACC scheme was probably not sufficiently myelosuppressive to bring about a difference in the two groups. Granulocytopenia-associated infections were infrequent in both groups: two episodes in 37 cycles of chemotherapy in the hypertransfusion group and three episodes in 43 cycles in the control group. Hypertransfusion was simple and safe, and the encouraging trend towards less marked myelosuppression in our hypertransfused group would warrant further studies using more intensive and myelosuppressive combination chemotherapy regimens.","['Lam, W K', 'So, S Y', 'Ng, R P', 'Yu, D Y']","['Lam WK', 'So SY', 'Ng RP', 'Yu DY']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['7BRF0Z81KG (Lomustine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'MACC combination']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Carcinoma, Bronchogenic/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity', 'Lomustine/administration & dosage', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950110510 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1983;11(5):343-6. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950110510.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Factors affecting the inhibition of tumor growth by CA cellular preparations were: i) the schedule of agent administration; ii) the method of cell inactivation; iii) the FLC load. In particular, mice given 10(7) yeast cells, inactivated by cold alkali, on days -14 and +1 with respect to 10(4) FLC challenge on day 0 did not develop tumors. A crude cell wall fraction derived from cells extracted with hot alkali was still effective in reducing (but not suppressing) tumour growth whereas a purified, particulate glucan fraction (glucan ""ghosts"", essentially consisting of beta 1,3-1,6 glucan) was ineffective. No cellular preparation or cell wall fraction exerted anti-FLV effects (as shown by splenomegaly measurements) nor did any CA material induce interferon-like activity in the serum of animals injected with either FLC or FLV. Therefore, the observed antitumor activity by CA was not mediated by antiviral effects but possibly due to an ""adjuvant-type"", nonspecific, immunopotentiation of host antitumor response, as documented in other animal tumor models.","['Cassone, A', 'Scaringi, L', 'Pesce, C D', 'Titti, F', 'Bistoni, F', 'Marconi, P', 'Rossi, G B']","['Cassone A', 'Scaringi L', 'Pesce CD', 'Titti F', 'Bistoni F', 'Marconi P', 'Rossi GB']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Microbiologica,Microbiologica,7902903,,IM,"['Animals', 'Candida albicans/*immunology', 'Cell Wall/immunology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Immunization', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Time Factors']",1983/07/01 00:00,1983/07/01 00:01,['1983/07/01 00:00'],"['1983/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Microbiologica. 1983 Jul;6(3):207-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometric analysis showed that none of these cell lines stained for the HLA-DC/DS antigen. In the presence of 1.6 X 10(-9) M of 12-O-tetradecanoylporbol-13-acetate (TPA), expression of this antigen was detected. The expression was completed after 168 h of incubation. Iodination of cell surface, immunoprecipitation by Leu 10 antibody, and two-dimensional gel analysis revealed that TPA-treated Josh 7 cells synthesized and expressed a 29,34 kD bimolecular complex with both alpha and beta chains different from those of HLA-DR antigen. Quantitative absorption experiments with cell lysates indicated a greater than 25-fold increase in HLA-DC/DS antigen in TPA-treated cells. With the induction of HLA-DC/DS antigen expression, there are concomitant decreases in the expression of the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) and the enzymatic activity of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. No appreciable changes in HLA-DR and Ig expression were observed. There was also no change in HLA-SB expression as detected by antibody ILR-1. However, DNA synthesis was markedly inhibited by TPA treatment. These results indicate that precursor and pre-B cell lines can be induced to mature in vitro.

Characterization of the B cell precursor indicates that this assay is detecting a very early precursor and not a B lymphocyte or a late pre-B cell. This conclusion is based on the observations that a) pre-B cells transformable by Abelson murine leukemia virus are not present in LTBMC by 3 days postrecharge and CFU-B are absent by 6 days postrecharge; b) late B cell progenitors capable of rapid repopulation of irradiated CBA/N mice are not present in LTBMC, since a lag in the kinetics of B cell reconstitution in animals grafted with LTBMC cells is observed compared with fresh bone marrow cells; c) the B cell precursors in LTBMC have high proliferative potential, since they can stably repopulate recipient mice for at least 8 wk postreconstitution and through two serial passages in irradiated CBA/N recipients; and d) the B cell precursors are large, rapidly sedimenting cells as determined by velocity sedimentation. The serial transplantation experiment further shows that a split is often observed between lymphoid and myeloid reconstituting ability of LTBMC cells.

Some of the obstacles to success have been partially overcome. Many advances in supportive care have been made. Pneumocystis carinii and herpes simplex infections are preventable. Effective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract for bacteria and fungi is now readily achievable and may have reduced the risk of serious systemic infections. New antibiotics which, in combination, are effective in life-threatening infections are under study. Recent developments in the prevention or amelioration of graft versus host disease (GvHD) have included T lymphocyte depletion in the donor marrow and the use of the fungal polypeptide cyclosporin A. Less than 10% of patients would now be expected to succumb to this complication. Outstanding problems remaining to be resolved are the improvement in the antileukaemic conditioning prior to transplantation and the prevention or treatment of cytomegalovirus infection in the seropositive recipient. This infection can cause pneumonitis and is currently the single most frequent transplant related cause of mortality.","['Prentice, H G']",['Prentice HG'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Postoperative Care', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.36.11.1207 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1983 Nov;36(11):1207-14. doi: 10.1136/jcp.36.11.1207.,57,,PMC498532,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients selected for inclusion in phase I-II trials usually have tumors that have failed to respond to treatment with established clinically useful drugs, either from the start of treatment or during continuing treatment after initial useful response. These treatment failures are no doubt due, in many cases, to drug-resistant tumors if initially unresponsive or to the overgrowth of drug-resistant mutant tumor stem cells in initially responding patients who ultimately failed under continuing treatment. Therefore, the cross-resistance profiles of drug-resistant murine tumors to treatment with new drugs going into phase I-II trials should provide useful guides for patient selection for those trials. Also, these cross-resistance profiles will provide useful information indicating likely biochemical mechanism of action of new drugs with promising anticancer activity, thus guiding drug selection for combination chemotherapy trials in animals or man.

Perhexiline maleate and triparanol both markedly enhance the sensitivity of drug-resistant cells to doxorubicin and vinblastine but do not have an effect on anthracycline-sensitive cells. This enhanced sensitivity is associated with increased drug accumulation. Although perhexiline maleate has been reported to be a calcium antagonist in other systems, our data do not implicate this mechanism in the enhancement of cell sensitivity to doxorubicin.

Recovery from severe pancytopenia in less than 4 weeks after transplantation occurred in 92.8% of evaluable patients, suggesting the efficacy of the autologous marrow in limiting the prolonged myelosuppression anticipated with intensive BCNU. Serious extramedullary toxicity was encountered at BCNU 1200 mg/m2, where a 9.5% incidence of fatal interstitial pneumonitis and a 3.0% incidence of fatal hepatic necrosis was observed. Higher BCNU doses, 1500 to 2850 mg/m2, were associated with a 35.3% incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity. Fatal encephalomyelopathy was encountered in two patients given BCNU 2250 and 2850 mg/m2. One patient who received the highest cumulative dose of BCNU (3450 mg/m2 in 2 courses) died of cardiac necrosis. Other serious extramedullary toxicities were not encountered, even in the 14 patients who survived from 1 to nearly 5 years after BCNU therapy. Antitumor responses occurred in 40.0% of evaluable patients; a dose effect could not be evaluated due to patient heterogeneity. The BCNU doses associated with acceptable toxicity, 600 to 1200 mg/m2, produced a 37.5% total and an 11.3% complete response (CR) rate, including five patients with prolonged CRs of 1 to nearly 5 years. Notable among the CRs was the 25.0% CR rate in previously untreated metastatic melanoma, and the production of CRs in malignant disease in the central nervous system (CNS) including melanoma, lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, acute leukemia and glioblastoma multiforme. It is concluded that augmented doses of BCNU can be given when autologous marrow transplantation is used to limit myelosuppression.

Results of long-term bioassays performed at the Bologna Institute of Oncology.,589-630,"Until recently, the incidence of benzene carcinogenicity was based only on the association between benzene occupational exposure and human leukemia, with many limited case reports and scanty epidemiological data. Available experimental studies up to 1976 on animals were rare, fragmentary, and inadequate, and had failed to prove the carcinogenic effects of benzenes. However, an integrated project of long-term carcinogenicity bioassays, begun in our laboratory in 1976 and still continuing, has shown that benzene produces a variety of tumors in rats including Zymbal gland carcinomas, carcinomas of the oral cavity, hepatocarcinomas, and possibly mammary carcinomas, lymphoreticular neoplasias, and other malignancies. Some of the tumors caused by benzene are uncommon or unusual in the breed of rats studied. Therefore benzene must be considered, under the studied experimental conditions, a strong multipotential carcinogen. The need for more experimental research is emphasized, particularly to assess the carcinogenic effects of low doses. Also recommended are more comprehensive epidemiological investigations, extended to all types of malignancies, and the application of adequate measures for primary prevention.","['Maltoni, C', 'Conti, B', 'Cotti, G']","['Maltoni C', 'Conti B', 'Cotti G']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/history/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/history', 'Female', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Rats']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.4700040503 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1983;4(5):589-630. doi: 10.1002/ajim.4700040503.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because normal cell sources produce only a few micrograms of IL 2 per liter, it was necessary to utilize high producer clones and subclones of a human T leukemia cell line to obtain immunogenic amounts of IL 2 protein. Moreover, assays that required antibody-mediated intervention of the high affinity IL 2-receptor binding were ineffectual in the identification of anti-IL 2-producing hybridomas, thus necessitating the development of immunoassays. Two of three initially derived antibodies detected by enzyme-linked immunoassay were found to react specifically with IL 2 as demonstrated by antibody concentration-dependent neutralization of IL 2 activity. The neutralization of cellular proliferation was specific for IL 2-reactive cells, coincided with an inhibition of IL 2 receptor binding, could be completely overcome by affinity-purified IL 2 and was species-specific; human and murine IL 2 were neutralized, whereas rat IL 2 activity remained unaffected. A third antibody, although much less effective in neutralizing IL 2 activity, bound to IL 2 more avidly and functioned as an efficient immunoabsorbent. IL 2 could be concentrated and purified by immunoabsorption from crude conditioned medium in a single step. The purified product, which retained biologic activity, was made up of a single protein (Mr = 15,500) as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, reversed-phase liquid chromatography, and amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. These results indicate that the distinctive biochemical and functional properties of individual lymphokines may well determine the efficiency with which antibodies may be elicited and detected. However, once produced, anti-lymphokines are uniquely suited for the exploration of the molecular and biologic properties of these immunoregulatory molecules.","['Smith, K A', 'Favata, M F', 'Oroszlan, S']","['Smith KA', 'Favata MF', 'Oroszlan S']",['eng'],"['CA-17323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-17643/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neutralization Tests', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1983/10/01 00:00,1983/10/01 00:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1983 Oct;131(4):1808-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether or not protein loss occurs across the intestinal mucosa in this severe diarrheal illness, we measured fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin once per week in 24-h stool specimens from 25 consecutive patients during hospitalization for bone marrow transplantation. The mean alpha 1-antitrypsin concentration and serum clearance for these patients before transplantation were below 2.6 mg/g stool and 13.0 ml/day (upper limits for normals). Values for all patients increased moderately after pretransplant conditioning. Values for patients who did not develop graft-versus-host disease of the intestine returned to baseline levels; however, those for patients with graft-versus-host disease of the intestine became markedly and persistently elevated (concentration ranged from 16.6 to 51.1 mg/g, clearance from 66.6 to 384.5 ml/day).

Present status and the future. A review.,1043-52,"High-dose cytoreductive treatment followed by ABMT represents a new approach to the treatment of acute leukemia as an alternative when leukemic patients do not have HLA-identical donors. ABMT protocol seems to be a valuable treatment for AML if it is immediately employed after the remission obtained to consolidate the remission. For ALL adult patients, and so for poor prognosis ALL in children, intensive therapy with ABMT represents a new approach when conventional therapy has failed or failed to consolidate the remission. The results of ABMT in CML in the literature have been disappointing; the bone marrow could be collected during the course of the first chronic phase after hydroxyurea therapy or other treatment programs. In leukemia the ABMT approach will be more credible if the protocol includes in vitro immunologic or pharmacologic means to eliminate residual leukemic cells.","['Herve, P', 'Philip, T', 'Flesch, M', 'Rozenbaum, A', 'Plouvier, E', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Noir, A', 'Peters, A', 'Leconte des Floris, R']","['Herve P', 'Philip T', 'Flesch M', 'Rozenbaum A', 'Plouvier E', 'Cahn JY', 'Noir A', 'Peters A', 'Leconte des Floris R']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Rats', 'Tissue Preservation', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1983/08/01 00:00,1983/08/01 00:01,['1983/08/01 00:00'],"['1983/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0277-5379(83)90027-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1983 Aug;19(8):1043-52. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(83)90027-5.,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All received asparaginase consolidation and central nervous system prophylaxis with cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate. All patients then received prolonged intensification with vincristine, prednisone, and doxorubicin, and half of them were randomized to receive weekly high-dose asparaginase. Continuation therapy was with vincristine, prednisone, methotrexate, and 6-mercaptopurine. After a median follow-up of 57 months, there were four remission deaths and 25 relapses. Central nervous system relapse was the first event in 4% of patients. There were fewer treatment failures in the asparaginase-treated group [2-sided, p = 0.04 (0.07 controlling for standard and high-risk groups)]. Asparaginase toxicity occurred in six patients (8%) and was self-limited, but it precluded further use of the drug in those patients. The major toxicity of this treatment program was drug-induced cardiomyopathy which occurred in 10 patients (14%) and was fatal in three of them. In summary, we conclude that the intensive use of high-dose asparaginase has an important role in the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated at the time of diagnosis and before initiation of therapy were mixed with 51Cr-labeled K562 or MOLT-4 target cells at a ratio of 100:1. In 13 consecutive cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia, the mean percentage of lysis of K562 cells (15.0%) was significantly below that of adult (49.8%) and age-related controls (35.9%). A similar pattern was observed against MOLT-4 targets (acute lymphocytic leukemia, 11.3%; adults, 39.8%; and pediatric controls, 28.4%). The mean activity in 8 cases of acute myelogenous leukemia was also markedly reduced (6.8% versus K562 and 6.0% versus MOLT-4). Linear regression analyses of white blood cell, lymphocyte, and leukemia blast counts failed to demonstrate any correlation between peripheral cell counts and natural killer cell activity. Thus, it would not appear that the observed decrease in lysis was due merely to dilution of effectors with blasts. The lytic activity of cells isolated from patient blood was significantly lower than that from cells isolated from an equal volume of blood from a normal adult.

Such studies suggest that phenotypic heterogeneity may be expressed in individual leukemia cell populations. This was verified in the murine AKR leukemia that was found to be composed of four antigenically different subtypes of leukemia cells, and it was shown that this feature has a severe negative impact on the use of leukemia cell specific monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) as therapeutical reagents. Twenty-four human T-lymphoblastic leukemias were analyzed with Mabs against HLA class I, HLA class II, and T-lymphocyte differentiation antigens, and 21 were found to be intratumoral heterogeneous with respect to these antigens. Mabs with high specificity were generated against AML cells and subsequently used to analyze more than 50 AML samples from different patients. The reactivity pattern of the Mabs differed significantly among the various AML samples. Further, a pronounced intratumoral antigenic heterogeneity (IAH) was found in most AML samples with regard to reactivity of the Mabs against AML and expression of major histocompatibility antigens. The negative impact of IAH on the use of Mabs in clinical oncology is described. It is argued that IAH exemplifies the phenotypic diversity of malignant neoplasms which is also suggested to be a basic and necessary feature of malignant cell populations. Mabs against subsets of malignant cell populations may have a profound effect on cancerous cell populations, and it is therefore of crucial importance that such subsets are identified and characterized. It is conceivable that this may result in generation of Mabs with potentially high value in cancer diagnosis and therapy, particularly in combination with drugs that induce differentiation in the malignant cell mass.","['Olsson, L']",['Olsson L'],['eng'],['CA-29876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00048967 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1983;2(2):153-63. doi: 10.1007/BF00048967.,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among those 70 cases, 4 APL, 4 AMMoL and 5 AML were associated with overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and 5 T cell ALL, 7 ATL and 2 null cell ALL were associated with hypofibrinogenemia not adapted for DIC. The sample used was the lysate of 10(7) cells. PCA was measured by recalcification time of normal plasma with the cell lysate, XAA and PlgAA was measured by chromogenic substrate. APL and AML, especially those associated with overt DIC, had high PCA, and lymphocytic leukemia generally had low PCA in comparison with normal controls. Total PCA (PCA multiplied by cell count/microliter) was remarkably increased in DIC and mildly increased in ALL with hypofibrinogenemia. The change in XAA and total XAA (XAA multiplied by cell count/microliter) was not remarkable in any leukemia except for T cell ALL and null cell ALL with hypofibrinogenemia. PlgAA was high in lymphocytic leukemias with hypofibrinogenemia, APL and AMMoL with DIC. Total PlgAA (PlgAA multiplied by cell count/microliter) was high especially in T cell ALL and null cell ALL with hypofibrinogenemia. Thus it is probable that PCA is the most important factor causing DIC in myelogenous leukemia and that PlgAA is the most important factor causing hypofibrinogenemia in lymphocytic leukemia. The measurement of these activities in the leukemic cells is valuable in prediction and prevention of the hemostatic disorder in leukemia.","['Wada, H', 'Nagano, T', 'Tomeoku, M', 'Kuto, M', 'Karitani, Y', 'Deguchi, K', 'Shirakawa, S']","['Wada H', 'Nagano T', 'Tomeoku M', 'Kuto M', 'Karitani Y', 'Deguchi K', 'Shirakawa S']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '9001-29-0 (Factor X)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)', 'EC 3.4.21.6 (Factor Xa)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.26 (cancer procoagulant)']",IM,"['*Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/complications', 'Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Factor X/*metabolism', 'Factor Xa', 'Fibrinogen/analysis', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/complications/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Plasminogen Activators/*metabolism']",1983/05/15 00:00,1983/05/15 00:01,['1983/05/15 00:00'],"['1983/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0049-3848(83)90223-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Thromb Res. 1983 May 15;30(4):315-22. doi: 10.1016/0049-3848(83)90223-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemic relapse is rare, as is transplant-related mortality from interstitial pneumonia and severe graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). In aplastic anaemia the most important development is that treatment with ALG offers a real alternative to BMT which is of crucial importance for all patients without a histo-compatible family donor. The main problems of BMT are the lack of histocompatible donors and GvHD. In leukaemia, relapse is still an additional problem. The new immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin-A (CyA) has made an important contribution to the prophylaxis of severe GvHD. In future the results with CyA are potentially improvable by combination with other immunosuppressive agents. It is important that the use of HLA-semicompatible family donors, unrelated donors or alternative stem cell sources should become feasible. The value of autologous BMT is difficult to judge because in most instances it has been performed in patients with endstage disease. In several congenital diseases there are alternatives to BMT, such as genetic engineering. Although many problems of BMT still have to be solved, this procedure has an important place in modern medicine.","['Speck, B', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Nissen, C', 'Osterwalder, B', 'Signer, E', 'Corneo, M']","['Speck B', 'Gratwohl A', 'Nissen C', 'Osterwalder B', 'Signer E', 'Corneo M']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,0404401,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Hematologic Diseases/therapy', 'Humans', 'Transplantation, Autologous/adverse effects/trends']",1983/07/23 00:00,1983/07/23 00:01,['1983/07/23 00:00'],"['1983/07/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/07/23 00:01 [medline]', '1983/07/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Schweiz Med Wochenschr. 1983 Jul 23;113(29):1030-4.,,Knochenmarktransplantation quo vadis?,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The accessory function (AF) of monocytes is mediated through the release of interleukin-1 (IL-1). We here report that cells from three human leukemic lines--K562, HL-60, and U-937--could exert AF and efficiently replace monocytes in a 72-hr mitogen-stimulated proliferation assay. This AF was clearly related to precise maturational stages of these cells, since the hematopoietic precursor K562 cells spontaneously exerted high AF but lost this property when treated with differentiation inducers such as sodium butyrate or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). On the other hand, untreated HL-60 and U-937 cells exhibited no spontaneous AF, but they acquired this function when induced to differentiate either along the granulocytic pathway (dimethyl sulfoxide-treated HL-60 cells) or along the monocytic pathway (PMA-treated HL-60 and U-937 cells). Supernatants from PMA-triggered K562 or HL-60 cells allowed the proliferative response of murine thymocytes to phytohemagglutinin A and were therefore shown to contain IL-1. Analysis of phenotypical markers showed that AF and IL-1 production were not restricted to cells of the monocytic lineage. No HLA-DR antigen could be detected on K562 and HL-60 cells. Thus, the expression of HLA-DR antigens is not required for AF and IL-1 production in response to mitogens. Human leukemia cell lines could provide useful sources of human IL-1.","['Wakasugi, H', 'Harel, A', 'Dokhelar, M C', 'Fradelizi, D', 'Tursz, T']","['Wakasugi H', 'Harel A', 'Dokhelar MC', 'Fradelizi D', 'Tursz T']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Mitogens)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*immunology', 'Mitogens', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology']",1983/10/01 00:00,1983/10/01 00:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.80.19.6028 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1983 Oct;80(19):6028-31. doi: 10.1073/pnas.80.19.6028.,,,PMC534353,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study p53 content and synthesis, during inducer-mediated MELC differentiation, has been examined with monoclonal antibodies to p53. A decrease in p53 synthesis and content was demonstrated during induced differentiation. As determined by cell cycle fractionation, the decrease in p53 is manifest at all stages of the cell cycle. Hemin, which induces globin mRNA accumulation but not terminal cell division, fails to decrease p53 content. A MELC variant resistant to inducer-mediated commitment to terminal cell division also fails to decrease p53 levels in response to inducers.

Subsequently, we used cells from 48 human hematopoietic cell lines of different cell lineages and maturation stages to compare the IF and biochemical assays for expression of TdT. In addition, we have attempted to correlate the expression of TdT, adenosine deaminase (ADA), thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and immunological markers with maturation stages in these different cell lines. The results indicate that TdT positive cells remain TdT positive when assayed by either the biochemical or IF tests during growth or early plateau phase, but that cells under poor growth conditions, such as in old cultures, may give a negative TdT IF reaction. Otherwise, biochemical and IF assays for TdT gave comparable results in the 48 cell lines tested, testifying to the reliability of the IF test. Based on the comparisons of the various cell lines studied, it appears that both ADA and TdT decrease progressively as maturation of T cells from Blast I to Blast IV to mature T cells increases. TP was deficient in all T-cell lines compared to normal peripheral blood T cells, which in turn had lower activity compared to normal peripheral blood B cells. Pre-B cells, although indistinguishable from each other by immunological markers and all having low TP and ADA activity, showed heterogeneity, with TdT activity high in some and low in others. All non-T, non-B lines had high TdT activity, but low ADA and TP activity. B- and myelocytic cell lines had low ADA and TdT activity, and showed an increase in TP activity as the maturation of cells increased. These results indicate that the TdT IF test is a reliable procedure for detecting TdT positive cells, and that TdT, ADA and TP could be useful markers for studying the differentiation of human hematopoietic cells.","['Srivastava, B I', 'Minowada, J']","['Srivastava BI', 'Minowada J']",['eng'],"['CA-14413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-17140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase I)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*metabolism', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'DNA Polymerase I/metabolism', 'DNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma/*enzymology/physiopathology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(83)90097-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1983;7(3):331-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(83)90097-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the Charcot-Leyden crystal protein, another eosinophil protein, was recently identified in basophils, we tested whether MBP might also be a constituent of blood basophils. Highly purified, eosinophil-free basophil suspensions were prepared using the fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) to sort basophil-containing mononuclear cell preparations stained with fluorescein-conjugated sheep IgG anti-human IgE antibody. Using these FACS-purified basophils, we found that: (a) enrichment for surface IgE-positive cells (greater than 95% basophils) by FACS also enriched for cells staining for MBP by immunofluorescence; (b) MBP appeared to be localized in the histamine-, heparin-containing granules; (c) significant quantities of MBP were measurable by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in freeze-thaw detergent extracts of purified basophils; and (d) RIA dose-response curves for extracts of purified eosinophils and basophils had identical slopes. The MBP content of basophils from normal individuals averaged 140 ng/10(6) cells, whereas purified eosinophils from normal donors and patients with the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome averaged 4,979 and 824 ng/10(6) cells, respectively. MBP was also detected by immunofluorescence and RIA in cells obtained from a patient with basophil leukemia, although the MBP content for basophil leukemia cells was lower than that for normal basophils.

We now report the purification to homogeneity and characterization of actin from blood lymphocytes of normal subjects and patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The recovery of the purified protein was about 20%. The properties of the lymphocyte actins were compared to each other and to those of rabbit skeletal muscle actin. Lymphocyte actin consisted of beta and gamma forms in a 2:1 ratio. The Mr 42,000 was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Normal and leukemic lymphocyte actin had similar polymerization properties as assessed by viscosity measurements at 25 degrees and 4 degrees, and the ultrastructural appearance of the filaments was the same. Similar patterns were observed between normal and chronic lymphocytic leukemia actin tryptic digests analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The Vmax of the actin-activated myosin Mg2+ ATPase activity was compared using rabbit skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin and subfragment 1 preparations. The values obtained with rabbit skeletal muscle and normal lymphocyte actin were identical. The Vmax observed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia lymphocyte actin was 70% of that obtained with normal lymphocyte actin. The amount of actin needed to produce half-maximal activation (Kapparent) of heavy meromyosin and subfragment 1 were, respectively, 26 and 25 microM for normal lymphocytes and 18 and 24 microM for chronic lymphocytic leukemia lymphocytes.

Myeloid membrane markers were present in all K-562 cell lines. Only the early granulopoietic cell surface markers were expressed in 75 to 95% of the cells, while none of the late membrane markers was detected. In contrast, neither the early (myeloperoxidase) nor late (lactoferrin) cytoplasmic markers were present. Thus, K-562 cells showed a membrane phenotype similar to that of a normal or leukemic promyelocyte but lacking myeloperoxidase.

The patterns of the ability of PMA to influence induction and cell multiplication by various inducing agents differed in the two lines. The pattern of DEX inhibition of differentiation was similar in the two lines. Notably, DEX markedly inhibited induction due to all of the inducers tested except protease V8, actinomycin D, PGE1, and butyrate and its fatty acid analogues that were tested.

Proteases, which have been shown to stimulate both MEL cell differentiation and growth, are inhibited with respect to their effects on differentiation, but not with respect to those on growth by DEX and/or PMA. DEX did not have the same effect on induction stimulated by the two proteases studied. Many of these findings indicate that at least some effects by inducers on cell multiplication in this system are not inextricably linked to differentiation. It is hoped that the further study of induction by proteases, which have known enzymatic activities, as well as of inhibitors of induction, will shed light on the molecular mechanism(s) of action of DMSO and other low molecular weight inducers.","['Scher, W', 'Waxman, S']","['Scher W', 'Waxman S']",['eng'],"['AM 16690-06/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 24402-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Phorbols)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1983.tb47300.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1983;411:180-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1983.tb47300.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infections episodes occurred 269 times in 148 patients. In 193 infections, potential pathogens were cultured. Infection was a contributing cause of death in 89 patients. E. Coli, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa accounted for 58% of the isolates. No unusual patterns of antimicrobial resistance were observed. The outcome of the infections was related to the absence or resolution of neutropenia. Among 48 patients febrile on first admission, four cases of gram-negative pneumonia, two cases of fungal pneumonia, and two cases of pseudomonas cellulitis were diagnosed. We conclude that the etiology of infections was similar to that of cancer centers; multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms were not prevalent; absence or resolution of neutropenia indicates a good prognosis for outcome of infection; and untreated acute leukemics may acquire opportunistic infections.","['Balducci, L', 'Halbrook, J C', 'Chapman, S W', 'Vance, R B', 'Thigpen, J T', 'Morrison, F S']","['Balducci L', 'Halbrook JC', 'Chapman SW', 'Vance RB', 'Thigpen JT', 'Morrison FS']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blood/microbiology', 'Candida/isolation & purification', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/microbiology', 'Cryptococcus/isolation & purification', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Escherichia coli/isolation & purification', 'Fever/etiology', 'Hospitals, General', 'Humans', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Pneumonia/*etiology', 'Sepsis/*etiology', 'Serratia marcescens/isolation & purification']",1983/08/01 00:00,1983/08/01 00:01,['1983/08/01 00:00'],"['1983/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830150107 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1983 Aug;15(1):57-63. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830150107.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first case was a 28-year-old woman with PSIIIsA HD, treated with total lymphoid irradiation followed by combination chemotherapy that was almost entirely ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), who developed acute monoblastic leukemia three years after the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease. We believe this to be the first reported case of secondary leukemia associated with the combination of radiotherapy and ABVD chemotherapy. The second case was a 37-year-old man with Stage IVB Hodgkin's disease, treated with radiotherapy and MOPP (nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone) who developed acute myeloblastic leukemia five years after the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease. Both cases showed typical changes of panmyelosis demonstrated by cytochemical and ultrastructural studies. In both cases, bone marrow cells had a dominant clone with a markedly abnormal karyotype.

A group of 18 patients was tested 6 months after BMT and another group of 10 patients was tested after one year. At 6 months after BMT, 94% of the patients had normal serum IgG and IgM levels, whereas at one year 29% of them had low IgA levels. The proportion of patients with normal lymphocyte responses in vitro at 6 months after BMT was 69% and 76% for the responses to concanavalin A and to soluble antigens; 75% and 53% for the responses to allogeneic cells and pokeweed mitogen, respectively; and 89% for the response to phytohemagglutinin. All but one were able to generate suppressor cells upon con A stimulation. At one year after the graft, only one patient had demonstrable multiple abnormalities in in vitro tests. Skin test reactivity at one year was comparable to pre-graft reactivity. After BMT a lymphopenia persisted for 6 months. The rate of infectious complications was high during the first 3 months after BMT, and it diminished progressively as immune functions returned to normal. Infection was the cause of death in two cases (one disseminated cytomegalovirus infection and one septicemia). GHVD occurred in 12 patients; in nine of them the disease was transient and mild, only 1 patient developed severe chronic GVHD. Acute GVHD did not influence the tempo of immunologic reconstitution.

It is our view that, in adults, examination of material obtained by aspiration combined with a trephine biopsy allows for the most thorough morphological assessment of the marrow. Morbidity is limited to transient discomfort to the patient, and even bilateral procedures are conveniently performed on outpatients. There is no absolute contraindication to combining aspiration and trephine biopsy, but in severe bleeding disorders due to acquired or congenital coagulation factor deficiencies replacement therapy is indicated and the patient should be observed in hospital for 24 hours following the procedure. Thrombocytopenia is not associated with significant bleeding from the biopsy site in our experience. The advantages of the trephine biopsy are that it allows better overall assessment of cellularity and morphology and is indispensable in cases where aspiration has failed or where infiltration due to the myeloproliferative syndrome or to haematological and non-haematological malignancies has occurred. With marrow hypoplasia and granulomatous disorders involving the marrow, the trephine biopsy is indispensable for diagnosis.","['Bird, A R', 'Jacobs, P']","['Bird AR', 'Jacobs P']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",South Africa,S Afr Med J,South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,0404520,,IM,"['*Biopsy, Needle/instrumentation', 'Bone Marrow Examination/*methods', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Granuloma/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/classification', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/pathology', 'Needles/standards', 'Specimen Handling']",1983/08/20 00:00,1983/08/20 00:01,['1983/08/20 00:00'],"['1983/08/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/20 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,S Afr Med J. 1983 Aug 20;64(8):271-6.,50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increases in blood neutrophils, eosinophils and perhaps monocytes are observed routinely when persons with an apparently normal hematopoietic system are exposed to ""therapeutic"" doses of the drug. Blood platelets tend to be increased, but lymphocytes and erythrocytes are unaffected. Neutrophilia reflects a true increase in the total number of mature neutrophils in all body compartments and is due to increased production. Neutrophil function generally is unaffected by Li. In man or in other mammals, certain classes of hematopoietic stem cells are increased by Li administration. Extensive studies of the effect of Li have been carried out in cultures of cells producing colonies of neutrophils and macrophages (CFUNM) in semisolid media. The colony-forming cell itself is little affected by Li. Cells which produce the factor essential for production of normal CFUNM (CSF) are stimulated to produce more CSF by the presence of Li. Studies of changes in vivo in CSF levels yield somewhat conflicting results; serum CSF being increased in some but not in others. Thus, it is not clear if the effect of Li on cell production in vivo reflects a direct effect on granulocytic precursors, including stem cells, or is mediated by stimulation of a feed-back loop (or both). A number of trials of Li therapy designed to modify induced neutropenia or to correct existing neutropenia are reviewed. Although many of these are very difficult to interpret, there is some reason to be optimistic concerning an eventual role for Li therapy of certain diseases associated with hematologic abnormalities.","['Boggs, D R', 'Joyce, R A']","['Boggs DR', 'Joyce RA']",['eng'],"['AM07040/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM14352/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28179/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,['9FN79X2M3F (Lithium)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects', 'Dogs', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects', 'Felty Syndrome/drug therapy', 'Granulocytes/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic System/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy', 'Lithium/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/drug therapy', 'Neutrophils/drug effects']",1983/04/01 00:00,1983/04/01 00:01,['1983/04/01 00:00'],"['1983/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0037-1963(83)90012-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1983 Apr;20(2):129-38.,79,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite these advances, unsolved questions remain which will require research into better component preparation and randomized clinical trials. The prevention of post-transfusion graft-vs-host disease in the immunocompromised patient will require research into optimum radiation dosages for blood products and the appropriate choice of patients to receive these products. Alloimmunization to platelet concentrates will continue to be a problem as children receive more ablative cancer therapy. The use of leukocyte-poor platelets and allogeneic cryopreserved platelets may aid some of these patients, but the value of these products needs to be proven by more clinical trials. Finally, crossmatching of platelet products may become more readily available and may prove useful for more adequate selection of donors. If bone marrow transplantation becomes a therapeutic modality following remission induction for a large number of leukemic patients, the use of blood products pretransplantation will require intense investigation. Graft rejection in these children may be linked to the kind, number, and cytomegalovirus status of blood products given during their acute leukemic phase.

However, the majority of mice subjected to low initial tumor load were cured when they were treated with chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus booster injection of CA at a relatively ""late"" stage of the disease, i.e., when high tumor load was present in tumor-bearing hosts.

Moreover, marked host protection can be attained when immunostimulated mice, inoculated iv with lymphoma cells, are subjected to simultaneous challenge with high inocula of the same tumor ip, followed by BCNU administration. These data stress the importance of the peritoneal cavity for successful CA plus drug treatment and suggest that optimal tumor ""antigen load"" should be present at the time of CA and/or BCNU administration.","['Marconi, P', 'Cassone, A', 'Baccarini, M', 'Tissi, L', 'Garaci, E', 'Bonmassar, E', 'Frati, L', 'Bistoni, F']","['Marconi P', 'Cassone A', 'Baccarini M', 'Tissi L', 'Garaci E', 'Bonmassar E', 'Frati L', 'Bistoni F']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Candida albicans/immunology', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Species Specificity']",1983/08/01 00:00,1983/08/01 00:01,['1983/08/01 00:00'],"['1983/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1983 Aug;71(2):299-307.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have treated five ATL patients (four males and one female, 42 to 72 yr of age) with total body irradiation (TBI). One patient who received 150 rad of TBI achieved complete remission and has been well without treatment for over a year. One hundred and thirty rad of TBI was administered to another patient, resulting in control of the leukocyte count at around 10,000/microliter and survival for 6 mo. Three patients received 100 rad of TBI. Only one of these patients has lived with leukemic cells for over a year without treatment. The other two patients relapsed rapidly and despite various kinds of treatment, such as a second course of TBI, extracorporeal irradiation of the blood, cytapheresis and combination chemotherapy consisting of pepleomycin, vincristine and a high dose of prednisolone, expired from pneumonia in 3 and 4 mo respectively. In all except the last two patients, thrombocytopenia and anemia developed and lasted for 2.5 wk to 3 mo and granulocytopenia occurred only in the patient who received 150 rad of TBI.

For 13 donors tested 18.1 +/- 4.4% of the PBL formed conjugates with K 562 and 2.7 +/- 1.6% displayed NK reactivity. In contrast to the A-SCCA, the PLL-modified assay permits direct identification of both conjugate forming (TBC) and cytolytic PBL (NK) by means of surface markers. Indirect immunofluorescence studies with monoclonal anti-PBL antibodies revealed that neither the plating procedures nor the incubation conditions employed affected the expression of the antigens recognized by these reagents. This method of directly identifying NK cells showed that OKM1+ cells were enriched among the NK cells as compared to PBL and TBC (55% vs. 23% and 43%, respectively). In contrast, the OKT3+ or Leu1+ fraction of the NK cells was reduced as compared to PBL and TBC. However, using this method of identification at the effector cell level, a substantial proportion of the NK cells were OKT3+ or Leu1+ (57% or 58% respectively, 7 donors). Approximately 25% of the NK cells were Leu2a+ and 30% were Leu3a+, respectively. However, the size of the Leu3a+ fraction varied considerably with individual donors and the size of this fraction appeared to be inversely related to that of the donors NK pool.","['Vargas-Cortes, M', 'Hellstrom, U', 'Perlmann, P']","['Vargas-Cortes M', 'Hellstrom U', 'Perlmann P']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '25104-18-1 (Polylysine)', '9012-36-6 (Sepharose)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Polylysine', 'Sepharose']",1983/08/12 00:00,1983/08/12 00:01,['1983/08/12 00:00'],"['1983/08/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/12 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(83)90114-X [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(83)90114-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1983 Aug 12;62(1):87-99. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(83)90114-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As early as Days 2 to 3, the levels of STF and of AZ sensitivity of splenocytes were profoundly decreased in DBA/2 mice, and, to a lesser extent, in BALB/c mice given FLV-P; however, SSRFCs/spleen were increased in both mouse strains. Conclusive evidence of infectious FLV-P was obtained in the thymuses of DBA/2 mice soon after infection. In mice of the same strains infected with FLV-A, STF levels were similarly decreased, but AZ sensitivity of splenocytes was unaffected, and SSRFCs were decreased. Evidence of early FLV-A infection in the thymus of DBA/2 mice was likewise obtained. In C57BL/6 mice given FLV-A, STF levels, AZ sensitivity of splenocytes, and SSRFC showed changes similar to, but of lower magnitude than, those in BALB/c mice. On the other hand, in C57BL/6 mice given FLV-P, the decrease in STF and AZ sensitivity was almost as pronounced as in susceptible DBA/2 mice in the face of complete absence of infectious virus or viral markers in the thymuses. The observed changes are ascribed to virus infection in view of the following: (a) good temporal correlation between these changes and virus infection; (b) absence of any change in mice given heat-inactivated viruses or spleen homogenate of normal DBA/2 mouse spleen; (c) overall good correlation between mouse genotype and genetic (Fv-1 and Fv-2) restrictions of virus infection on one hand and the magnitude of the observed changes on the other. In particular, the decrease in STF and SSRFC levels is ascribed to the replication-competent (Friend-murine leukemia virus) component of Friend leukemia virus complex, whereas the decrease in AZ sensitivity of splenocytes and the increase of SSRFCs are ascribed to the defective spleen focus-forming virus component of the complex. All changes described so far were transient, since they were not detectable beyond 42 days after virus inoculation in overtly leukemic animals. The observed derangements of thymus-derived immune functions may play an important cofactor role during the onset of leukemia in mice genetically permissive to Friend leukemia virus replication and transformation, but they do not seem relevant to the maintenance of leukemia.","['Tonietti, G', 'Rossi, G B', 'Del Gobbo, V', 'Accinni, L', 'Ranucci, A', 'Titti, F', 'Premrov, M G', 'Garaci, E']","['Tonietti G', 'Rossi GB', 'Del Gobbo V', 'Accinni L', 'Ranucci A', 'Titti F', 'Premrov MG', 'Garaci E']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Thymus Hormones)', '9H198D04WL (Thymic Factor, Circulating)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Species Specificity', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Thymic Factor, Circulating/*analysis', 'Thymus Hormones/*analysis']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Sep;43(9):4355-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conversely, whereas this enzyme activity is always undetectable in chronic or acute B-lymphoid leukemia, neutral maltase activity is expressed in mature B cells from normal subjects. The detection of higher neutral maltase activity in plasma cells from myelomas than in normal B cells supports the concept that the expression of neutral maltase activity is related to the stages of differentiation and maturation reached by lymphocytes of the B-cell lineage.

Statistical analysis showed an improved disease-free survival for the second remission group (p = 0.09). Patients transplanted in later remission or relapse had a similar survival. The improved survival in second remission resulted from a decreased relapse rate posttransplant, as the early mortality from nonleukemic causes was similar among the groups (p = 0.01). In the second remission patients, no characteristics of the initial leukemia were identified that significantly affected outcome. In the combined later remission and relapse group, poor prognosis posttransplant was associated with initial WBC greater than 20K, age at diagnosis older than 10, or initial remission duration less than or equal to 1 yr.

Of the patients grafted for AL in second remission or later, 3 of 6 AML and 6 of 12 ALL are alive. Severe GvHD was seen in 5 of 43 BMT between HLD identical siblings, in three of them combined with interstitial pneumonia. Thus the incidence of these two serious complications of allogeneic BMT has been drastically reduced with CyA compared to our previous experience with prophylactic methotrexate (MTX). 4 grafts were performed between HLA-haploidentical siblings. 3 of the 4 patients developed fatal GvHD. This implies that in this histocompatibility setting CyA alone is not sufficient. No problems were encountered in 3 syngeneic BMT. 12 leukemic relapses were observed. Relapse never occurred in ALL in first remission and never in CGL. 4 recurrences were seen in AML in first remission. All other relapses were in patients with AL grafted in stages other than first remission. In 86 successive patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) the following important advances were made: (1) it was shown that the majority of patients have sufficient hemopoietic stem cells and that after treatment with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) over 70% have long-lasting remissions, (2) the combined treatment with ALG and high dose prednisone increases the remission rates to 90% and in addition shortens the supportive care period significantly. These developments are of crucial importance for patients without an HLA-identical sibling, (3) success rates of marrow transplants between HLA-identical siblings could be increased from 36% with prophylactic MTX to 67% using CyA.","['Speck, B', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Nissen, C', 'Osterwalder, B', 'Signer, E', 'Jeannet, M']","['Speck B', 'Gratwohl A', 'Nissen C', 'Osterwalder B', 'Signer E', 'Jeannet M']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,0404401,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*surgery', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporins/therapeutic use', 'Graft Rejection/drug effects', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/drug effects', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1983/04/30 00:00,1983/04/30 00:01,['1983/04/30 00:00'],"['1983/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Schweiz Med Wochenschr. 1983 Apr 30;113(17):622-9.,,Knochenmarktransplantation bei Leukamie und aplastischer Anamie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the same follow-up period (1957 through 1979), 64 persons died of cancer, compared with an expected 64.3. Statistically significantly increased frequency of occurrence and mortality was found only for leukemia. The amount of cumulative gamma radiation exposure for 1957 ranged from 0 to 10,397 mrem as measured by individual personnel film badges. Although uncertainty remains about the exact amount of radiation exposure, the lack of a significant increase after 22 years in either the incidence of or the mortality from any other cancer and the apparent lack of a dose effect by unit lead to the consideration that the leukemia findings may be attributable either to chance, to factors other than radiation, or to some combination of risk factors possibly including radiation.","['Caldwell, G G', 'Kelley, D', 'Zack, M', 'Falk, H', 'Heath, C W Jr']","['Caldwell GG', 'Kelley D', 'Zack M', 'Falk H', 'Heath CW Jr']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,,IM,"['Follow-Up Studies', 'Gamma Rays', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Military Medicine/*history', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/history/mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk', 'United States']",1983/08/05 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1983/08/05 00:00'],"['1983/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1983/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,JAMA. 1983 Aug 5;250(5):620-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase staining of EDTA-separated epidermal sheets demonstrated dendritic cells with a distribution pattern and density comparable to that noted for anti-IAk staining. Tla-negative mouse strains such as A.TL, C3H/HeJ, and C57BL/6 did not show any staining of dendritic epidermal cells. Epidermal cell suspensions similarly contained 2-4% cells with discrete surface staining with anti-TL antibody. Capping was noted in these cells. Once again positive results were noted only in appropriate Tla-positive strains. Control staining was carried out in all cases on frozen sections of thymii from mice. Thymocytes in the cortical zones and some dendritic cells at the corticomedullary junction were stained.

The progenitors, at least in chronic myelogenous leukemia, are derived from the neoplastic pluripotent stem cell that also differentiates along lymphoid and myeloid pathways. In addition, we have demonstrated that the precursor for MSC is lacking both the Ia and CALLA determinants. Several antigenic and functional characteristics of the mature stromal cell population have also been identified. Stromal cells express CALLA, synthesize types I, III, and IV collagen, and may express factor VIII associated antigen. It is of interest that fibroblasts do not express factor VIII associated antigen, do not synthesize type IV collagen in measurable quantities, but do express CALLA [9]. Endothelial cells express factor VIII associated antigen, synthesize type IV collagen, but are not CALLA positive. Thus, MSC have some features in common with fibroblasts and others with endothelial cells. The unique characteristics of MSC are that they are transplantable and are derived from a common progenitor with other hematopoietic cells. These features clearly distinguish this cell population from fibroblasts, which are neither transplantable nor derived from the neoplastic clone in CML.","['Singer, J W', 'Keating, A']","['Singer JW', 'Keating A']",['eng'],"['CA 16448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Haematol Blood Transfus,Haematology and blood transfusion,101169459,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/physiopathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/physiopathology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-68761-7_67 [doi]'],ppublish,Haematol Blood Transfus. 1983;28:351-4. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-68761-7_67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dose-response studies revealed that a cervical carcinoma (HeLa), a melanoma (A375Ag5), and several mammary carcinoma cell lines (MCF-7, BT474, MDA-MB415, and T47D) were growth inhibited by this conditioned medium. We concluded, from the results of thymidine release assays and from experiments on reversibility, that inhibition was a cytostatic and not a cytolytic response. In contrast, THP-1 conditioned medium stimulated the growth of two mammary lines (ZR75-1 and HBL-100), a lung type II carcinoma (549), and a colon adenocarcinoma (SW48). Preliminary characterization showed that the inhibitory activity was stable to acid and urea treatment but was destroyed by trypsin and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Molecular sieve chromatography of acetic acid-extracted material separated the inhibitory and stimulatory components.","['Gaffney, E V', 'Tsai, S C', ""Dell'Aquila, M L"", 'Lingenfelter, S E']","['Gaffney EV', 'Tsai SC', ""Dell'Aquila ML"", 'Lingenfelter SE']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Terpenes)', '34807-41-5 (mezerein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', '*Diterpenes', 'Drug Synergism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*analysis/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*analysis', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', '*Terpenes']",1983/08/01 00:00,1983/08/01 00:01,['1983/08/01 00:00'],"['1983/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Aug;43(8):3668-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients had received a high dose chemotherapeutic remission-induction regimen consisting of daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, 6-thioguanine, prednisone, and vincristine, followed by one consolidation course of the same drugs at reduced doses and then monthly maintenance course of low-dose chemotherapy. The intensification therapy consisted of the same intensive chemotherapy regimen utilized for remission induction in place of the sixth and 12th monthly courses of postremission induction chemotherapy. Twenty-three of the 39 patients received intensification therapy, whereas 16 patients refused or were not offered such therapy for medical reasons and, therefore, received only monthly therapy. The median remission duration of the 23 patients who received intensification therapy was 157 weeks, and 9 remain in continuous first remission at 176-285 weeks. The remission duration of the 16 patients who did not receive intensification therapy was 73 weeks (P = 0.03). Kaplan-Meier estimates of remission duration and survival from time of remission computed by including the patients who either relapsed or received bone marrow transplantation before the time of intensification (6 months) revealed a median remission duration and survival of 100 and 172 weeks for patients receiving intensification compared to 37 and 72 weeks, respectively, for patients not receiving intensification therapy. Since results in patients not receiving intensification therapy are consistent with our previous results in patients receiving the same induction and consolidation regimens without intensification, this nonrandomized study suggests that intensification therapy prolongs remission duration and survival in adults with ANL.","['Glucksberg, H', 'Cheever, M A', 'Farewell, V T', 'Fefer, A', 'Thomas, E D']","['Glucksberg H', 'Cheever MA', 'Farewell VT', 'Fefer A', 'Thomas ED']",['eng'],"['CA 09319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Prognosis']",1983/07/15 00:00,1983/07/15 00:01,['1983/07/15 00:00'],"['1983/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19830715)52:2<198::aid-cncr2820520203>3.0.co;2-a [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1983 Jul 15;52(2):198-205. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19830715)52:2<198::aid-cncr2820520203>3.0.co;2-a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first objective of treatment is to achieve a complete clinical and hematological remission, since in the absence of such response the disease has a rapidly progressive and inevitably fatal outcome. Logistic regression analysis and the generation of models for predicting the probability of response for each patient have proven to be extremely useful techniques for evaluating new candidates for front-line treatment in acute leukemia. In prospective tests, such modeling procedures have proven to predict accurately for response. It is evident that this methodology will be highly effective for selecting treatment for individual patients and for detecting improved treatments for patients who respond poorly to conventional treatment. For patients who achieve complete remission, the duration of that remission can also be evaluated by logistic regression analysis. Variables which predict for duration of remission have proven to be different from those variables which predict for probability of response. In addition, variables which predict for prolonged remission--that is, beyond 2 and 3 years--have proven to be different from variables which predict for relapse in the first year of remission. Therefore, the models which estimate risk of relapse per unit of time at risk should prove most valuable for evaluating not only the choice of treatments to be used during remission, but the duration of treatment and the strategy of treatment, that is, whether intensive treatment or low-dose intermittent treatment should be chosen. Finally, the demonstration that a significant fraction of the patients in complete remission will have long term disease-free and treatment-free survival makes the identification of such patients even more important. Evaluation of innovative higher-risk strategies for treatment of the patient in remission should be offered primarily to patients who have a low probability of having already been cured with conventional treatment. Thus, the rapid evolution of effective treatment for adult acute leukemia over the last 15 years has necessitated the development of more precise and more effective methods for evaluating the effects of those treatments on patients with this disease.","['Freireich, E J']",['Freireich EJ'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glycopeptides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (pro-opiomelanocortin amino-terminal glycopeptide)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ADOAP protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Aging', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*methods', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Glycopeptides/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/therapy', '*Models, Biological', '*Peptide Fragments', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', '*Pro-Opiomelanocortin', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Regression Analysis', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1983;9(1):5-20.,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal DNA content as a marker of neoplastic disease was found in only 15% of 264 adult patients with acute leukemia (13% in AML, 26% in ALL/AUL). Alternative means of tumor cell detection in heterogeneous marrow samples include determination of nucleolar antigen density and double-stranded RNA content. Phenotypic characterization of leukemia subtypes can be afforded by RNA content analysis of acridine orange-stained cells, demonstrating significantly higher mean RNA content values in AML, compared to ALL/AUL. Cytokinetic parameters amenable to flow cytometric analysis include measurements of cell cycle compartment distribution by DNA content, of cycle traverse rate by BUdR-induced modification of fluorescence intensity of DNA specific dyes and of growth fraction employing the method of in situ DNA denaturation and subsequent acridine orange staining. Determination of cell cycle distribution and RNA content pretreatment and serially during remission induction in 82 patients demonstrated a significantly lower pretreatment biopsy S phase proportion in responding patients with AML compared to individuals failing treatment whereas an opposite trend was noted in patients with ALL/AUL. While of no prognostic impact pretreatment, serial determinations of the RNA content during the first chemotherapy induction course revealed significant differences between responding and failing patients with AML. Also, patients attaining remission demonstrated a rise in marrow biopsy S phase compartment size by day 10 to 14 of treatment, thus, predicting remission during marrow hypoplasia. We conclude that quantitative cytologic examination of marrow cells from patients with acute leukemia provides useful diagnostic and prognostic information that should aid in the stratification of patients with poor prognosis to receive new agents.","['Barlogie, B', 'Maddox, A M', 'Johnston, D A', 'Raber, M N', 'Drewinko, B', 'Keating, M J', 'Freireich, E J']","['Barlogie B', 'Maddox AM', 'Johnston DA', 'Raber MN', 'Drewinko B', 'Keating MJ', 'Freireich EJ']",['eng'],"['CA11520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*pathology', 'DNA/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1983;9(1):35-55.,58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast with the findings in the non-randomized comparison which led to this trial, no benefit of splenectomy was found in either respect. Four features recorded at presentation were found to be strongly related to prognosis; namely, spleen size, haemoglobin concentration, leucocyte count, and clinical grade. As a result of the high degree of correlation between these features, however, information on more than one allowed a prediction of prognosis that was only marginally better than that achieved by just one. Comparison with another large series illustrates the difficulty of discovering generally applicable 'staging' systems.

If delayed until Day 7, CyA prophylaxis was totally ineffective. Hooded rats bearing a syngeneic leukaemia were irradiated and reconstituted with allogeneic bone marrow. During the course of the ensuing graft-versus-host response (GVHR) leukaemia cells were eradicated from the spleens of the host animals.

Immunoperoxidase staining of the tissues failed to demonstrate trophozoites. This case demonstrates that elevated toxoplasma IFA titers may occur in patients at high risk for opportunistic infection but who do not manifest overt clinical toxoplasmosis.","['Peacock, J E Jr', 'Folds, J', 'Orringer, E', 'Luft, B', 'Cohen, M S']","['Peacock JE Jr', 'Folds J', 'Orringer E', 'Luft B', 'Cohen MS']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Intern Med,Archives of internal medicine,0372440,['0 (Antibodies)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies/analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*immunology', 'Male', 'Splenomegaly/etiology', 'Toxoplasma/*immunology', 'Toxoplasmosis/*diagnosis']",1983/06/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1983/06/01 00:00'],"['1983/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1983/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archinte.1983.00350060167025 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Intern Med. 1983 Jun;143(6):1235-7. doi: 10.1001/archinte.1983.00350060167025.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As originally described, it refers to the invasion of peripheral blood by poorly-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma. Blood involvement occurs in 10 to 70 percent of patients with poorly-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma, depending on the methods and criteria used to define leukemic phase, but it may have little impact on the clinical course of such patients. Second, lymphosarcoma cell leukemia can describe a variant of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, presenting clinically without lymphoma. Although not all hematologists recognize this as a distinct entity, others believe that such patients have a poorer prognosis than those with typical chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In the absence of a lymph node biopsy diagnostic of poorly-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma, the diagnosis of lymphosarcoma cell leukemia should be reserved for cases demonstrating immunologic features of poorly-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma, namely bright surface immunoglobulin immunofluorescence, normal capping, and low mouse red cell rosette formation. Finally, lymphosarcoma cell leukemia has been used to describe the invasion of blood by other types of lymphoma, including large cell, lymphoblastic, and Burkitt's lymphoma, although these are better designated as the particular lymphoma in leukemic phase. When abnormal cells appear in the blood samples of patients with lymphoma, acute myelogenous leukemia must also always be considered, particularly in patients who have received substantial prior chemotherapy or irradiation.","['Mintzer, D M', 'Hauptman, S P']","['Mintzer DM', 'Hauptman SP']",['eng'],['AM-07084/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/classification/diagnosis/*pathology']",1983/07/01 00:00,1983/07/01 00:01,['1983/07/01 00:00'],"['1983/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(83)91174-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(83)91174-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1983 Jul;75(1):110-20. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(83)91174-9.,83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DMSO-induced cells contained 1.5-2-fold the enzyme activity of HL60s and TPA-induced cell lysates demonstrated 5-14-fold the activity of uninduced HL60s. Induction of Cathepsin B synthesis was therefore associated with differentiation of the promyelocytes into cells of the monocyte/macrophage type, but not granulocyte-like cells.

Is there anything else? An example of tumour antigens not expressed anywhere in normal tissue is the set of tumour-specific transplantation antigens (TSTA) of murine chemically induced sarcomas. There is evidence that at least one TSTA specificity is retrovirus-derived, is carried on the envelope protein gp70, and probably arises by the recombination events that yield the diverse gp70s of the MCF strains of murine leukaemia viruses. Whether a similar mechanism can generate human tumour antigens depends on the yet unanswered question of whether human cells have retroviruses in their genomes capable of recombination. Aside from this, the only other mechanism known for antigen expression on tumours is via their oncogenes, which seem to make normal cell products. Such products, or secondary consequences of their production, were they normally expressed only at an early stage of development, would be candidates for 'fetal antigens'. While only the two mechanisms mentioned above seem the ready sources of 'tumour-associated antigens', it would be too early--in the face of ever more startling information about gene mobility and rearrangements--to think we have exhausted possible mechanisms for generating tumour antigens.","['Lennox, E S']",['Lennox ES'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Ciba Found Symp,Ciba Foundation symposium,0356636,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/9780470720776.ch6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ciba Found Symp. 1983;96:89-103. doi: 10.1002/9780470720776.ch6.,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using monoclonal antibodies and double marker assays we studied the phenotype of these cells. In thymus, over 90% of rosetting cells express antigens of immature thymocytes (HTA1, OKT6). A proportion of the rosetting cells shows in addition antigens of mature thymocytes (OKT3, UCHT1). These cells probably correspond to a stage of intrathymic maturation between common and mature thymocytes. Virtually all rosetting cells are T cells and express an antigen related to T cell activation (TAC) when lymphocytes are activated by mitogens like PHA or Con A. Few rosetting cells are Ia positive. Two other antigens (OKT9, OKT10) known to be associated with proliferating and immature cells, are found in variable proportions on rosetting cells. After stimulation with allogeneic lymphocytes, fewer rosettes are detected than after stimulation by mitogens. Cells activated by a soluble antigen (PPD) and forming rosettes with rabbit red blood cells have a helper phenotype (Leu3a positive). Screening of leukaemia cell samples revealed that only cells from patients with T-ALL form rosettes with rabbit red blood cells.

It differs from doxorubicin (DX) by the epimerization of the OH group in position 4' of the aminosugar moiety, and was synthesized in an effort to find agents with a superior therapeutic index to the parent compound doxorubicin (DX). 4'-epi-doxorubicin binds to DNA and inhibits nucleic acid synthesis and function. The antitumor activity of 4'-epi-DX in several experimental tumors (Leukemias L 1210, P 388, Gross Leukemia, Sarcoma 180 ascitic and solid, C3H/HE mammary carcinoma) is similar to that of DX. However, 4'-epi-doxorubicin has greater antitumor activity than doxorubicin in Lewis lung carcinoma, MS-2 sarcoma lung metastasis, and human melanoma in athymic mice. In chronic toxicity studies there were no qualitative differences between 4'-epi-DX and DX; quantitatively, however, 4'-epi-DX was less toxic. In different experimental models 4'-epi-DX has been shown to be less cardiotoxic than its parent compound. In chronic toxicity studies in the rabbit, histopathologic findings revealed the same pattern of cardiotoxicity for both drugs but less marked with 4'-epi-DX. Distribution studies in mice with tumors showed a lower concentration of 4'-epi-DX in the heart, spleen and kidneys; the hepatobiliary metabolism and excretion of 4'-epi-DX investigated in the rat, indicated that the new analogue was more extensively metabolized than the parent compound. Pharmacokinetics of 4'-epi-DX in humans showed a multiexponential decrease of plasma levels; the same pattern was observed for the metabolite 13-OH epidoxorubicinol but with lower concentrations than the unchanged drug. A high plasma clearance (0.9-1.41/min), a terminal half-life of about 30-40 hr and a large volume of distribution were the main pharmacokinetic characteristics of 4'-epi-DX. A reduction of the dose appears to be appropriate in patients with liver function impairment. Phase II studies with 4'-epi-DX have indicated that the drug produces a pattern of acute toxicity, including acute cardiac toxicity, qualitatively similar to that of DX at identical doses but quantitatively lower, with particular regard to leukopenia and gastrointestinal toxicity. The range of single active doses is between 60 and 90 mg/m2, the most frequently employed doses schedules being 75 or 90 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks. 4'-epi-DX has shown activity in a variety of tumors such as breast carcinoma, soft tissues sarcomas, NH lymphomas, leukemias, ovarian cancer and gastric cancer. Preliminary evidence of activity has been found in melanoma, rectal cancer and pancreatic cancer suggesting a broad spectrum of activity. As to chronic cardiac toxicity up to now only 2 mild to moderate and reversible CHF have been observed at doses of 1120 and 1235 mg/m2 in about 700 treated patients. Specific and comparative studies are in progress: preliminary findings from a randomized comparison of 4'-epi-DX vs DX in breast cancer indicated that 4'-epi-DX may have a lower cumulative cardiotoxicity.","['Ganzina, F']",['Ganzina F'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Treat Rev,Cancer treatment reviews,7502030,"['3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Dogs', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Epirubicin', 'Female', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Rabbits']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0305-7372(83)80029-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Treat Rev. 1983 Mar;10(1):1-22. doi: 10.1016/s0305-7372(83)80029-2.,68,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hybridomas were produced by the fusion of spleen cells from DBA/2 mice immunized with irradiated L1210 or L1210 subline cells and cells of a non-immunoglobulin-secreting BALB/c myeloma variant. Three clones producing antibodies reacting with L1210 or L1210 subline cells were used to study the antigenic expression of L1210 and L1210 subline cells. Monoclonal antibodies from anti-L1210 and anti-L1210 subline hybridomas exhibited a greater reactivity with L1210 subline cells than with L1210 cells in complement-dependent cytotoxicity, quantitative absorption, and membrane immunofluorescence experiments, thereby demonstrating a tumor-associated antigen shared by L1210 and the L1210 sublines and an increased expression of this antigen on subline cells. Cross-blocking tests of antibody binding demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies from anti-L1210 and anti-L1210 subline hybridomas recognized the same or very closely situated antigenic determinants on the tumor cell surface. Most syngeneic and allogeneic tumor cells used as controls failed to react with the anti-L1210 and anti-L1210 subline hybridoma antibodies. However, two syngeneic tumors, L5178Y and P388-D1, demonstrated a significant reaction with the monoclonal antibodies. In addition, several spontaneous mammary tumors from C3H/St and DBA/2Ha, both high-frequency mammary tumor strains, reacted in various degrees with anti-L1210 or anti-L1210 subline hybridoma antibodies in absorption tests and in immunofluorescence experiments. On the other hand, liver, kidney, and spleen from normal C3H/St mice, as well as mammary tumors from BALB/c and C3Hf, both low-frequency mammary tumor strains, did not demonstrate significant reactivity in similar experiments. Normal lactating mammary glands from high-frequency mammary tumor mouse strains reacted with the monoclonal antibodies, whereas lactating mammary glands from low-frequency mammary tumor mouse strains were negative by this method. Purified murine mammary tumor virus preparations reacted strongly with the monoclonal antibodies in solid-phase radioimmunoassays, whereas a purified murine leukemia virus preparation failed to do so in similar experiments. These results indicate that the tumor-associated antigen(s), differentially expressed on L1210 and L1210 subline cells, is related to an antigen which is associated with the murine mammary tumor virus.","['Rapp, L', 'Fuji, H']","['Rapp L', 'Fuji H']",['eng'],"['CA-26479/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26942/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cross Reactions', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Leukemia L1210/*immunology', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/immunology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA']",1983/06/01 00:00,1983/06/01 00:01,['1983/06/01 00:00'],"['1983/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Jun;43(6):2592-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The high dose cytolethal response appears non-specific occurring in all cell lines with every steroid tested. By contrast, the low dose (pharmacological) cytolethal response requires an active glucocorticoid and a sensitive HLCL. However, both high and low concentrations of steroid induce virtually identical morphological changes in dying cells and similar changes can be induced in cells killed by deliberate feed exhaustion. Although the morphological features in each case resemble apoptosis, the ""programmed"" physiological form of cell death, the intracellular events leading to cytolysis seem likely to differ. The earliest morphological changes presaging cell death comprise rounding up of cells and condensation of nuclear chromatin. Nuclear changes progress rapidly thereafter and appear to result from detachment of chromatin from the nuclear matrix. The low dose cytolethal response requires the continuous presence of glucocorticoid for periods in excess of 24h, prior to which cell growth appears unaffected. The constancy of this latent interval suggests glucocorticoids may influence some replication control mechanism unrelated initially to macromolecular biosynthesis.","['Blewitt, R W', 'Abbott, A C', 'Bird, C C']","['Blewitt RW', 'Abbott AC', 'Bird CC']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Steroids)', '5GMR90S4KN (Methylprednisolone Hemisuccinate)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Methylprednisolone/*analogs & derivatives', 'Methylprednisolone Hemisuccinate/*pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Steroids/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1983/04/01 00:00,1983/04/01 00:01,['1983/04/01 00:00'],"['1983/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1983.77 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1983 Apr;47(4):477-86. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1983.77.,,,PMC2011334,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our recent observations can be discussed from several points of view but leukemic blast cell reversibility is now a phenomenon with therapeutical applications. The phenomenon of malignant cells growth enhancement has been considered as an antibody mediated immune process. In a previous paper we have demonstrated in AKR mice the possibility of achieving the growth enhancement of lymphoblastic cells in mixed cultures with normal autologous or isologous splenic cells. Other investigations have been carried out by means of mixed cultures in human leukemias and malignant lymphomas. The intensity of blast-cell proliferation was followed up by comparing the number of colonies and TH3 incorporation in simple cultures with those in mixed cultures. The observations made in the 20 culture systems followed-up over 3-5 and 8-10 days proved the ""malignant cell growth enhancement"" by the immune mononuclear cells (lymphocytes and macrophages).","['Berceanu, S', 'Motoiu, I', 'Gociu, M']","['Berceanu S', 'Motoiu I', 'Gociu M']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Romania,Med Interne,Medecine interne,7506353,,IM,"['*Blood Cells', '*Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', 'Spleen/*cytology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Interne. 1983 Jan-Mar;21(1):43-52.,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemic cells of the HTLV-positive patients seem to be clonal expansions of single infected cells since the provirus(es) are found at the same sites in a given patient. In avian leukosis virus-induced B-cell lymphomas, the provirus very frequently integrates at several discrete sites in a common domain near the cellular gene, c-myc, that it activates and it has been speculated that the same would hold true for other chronic leukaemia viruses. We report here that cultured cells from two US patients with CTCL and fresh leukaemia cells of a Japanese patient with ATL contained an HTLV provirus integrated at the same site. In addition, a cord blood T-lymphocyte cell line established by co-cultivation with one of the two HTLV-positive CTCL cell lines also contained HTLV provirus contiguous with the same flanking cellular sequences.

The expression of F-antigen was also studied on transformed rat cell lines derived from an F-negative normal cell line, 3y1. Transformation of the 3y1 line by whole DNA or by the EcoRI-C fragment (0-16 map unit) but not by the Accl-H fragment (0-4.7 map unit) of adenovirus type 12 resulted in expression of F-antigen on the cell surface.

The colonies from bone marrow cells of an untreated acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patient were demonstrated to be of leukemic origin by cytogenetic analysis. Cells obtained from colonies of leukemic origin contained the human malignancy-associated nucleolar antigen (HMNA) as detected by indirect immunofluorescence. This nucleolar antigen was not present in marrow or peripheral blood cells or cells from colonies of marrow from hematologically normal individuals.

The median number of colonies obtained was 75 per 10(5) marrow cells from patients with AML. In 1/3 of the cases an increased number of colonies could be grown from marrow cell suspensions kept in liquid culture for 5 days. This is indicative of the proliferative capacity of the colony forming cell population.

En(a-) cells deficient in glycophorin A (alpha) and S-s-U- cells deficient in glycophorin B (delta) are relatively resistant to invasion, while trypsin treatment of S-s-U- cells, which removes most of the remaining sialoglycoprotein, renders these cells almost totally resistant to invasion. Parasites inside these glycophorin-deficient cells develop normally. Invasion of erythroid precursors in vitro by merozoites of P. falciparum parallels the appearance of glycophorins on the surface of these nucleated cells, even though parasites fail to develop inside them. However, another type of cell from an erythroleukaemic line (K562) which expresses glycophorins on its surface is resistant to invasion. Furthermore, the observed increased invasion of young cells as opposed to an older cell population is not related quantitatively to the presence of glycophorins on the cell surface. Thus, although the role of glycophorins is both specific and important in the invasion of cells by P. falciparum, it is clearly only part of a complex process.","['Pasvol, G', 'Jungery, M']","['Pasvol G', 'Jungery M']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Ciba Found Symp,Ciba Foundation symposium,0356636,"['0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbohydrates/pharmacology', 'Erythrocyte Aging', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/physiology', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Glycophorins/deficiency/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/physiopathology', 'Malaria/etiology', 'Plasmodium falciparum/*pathogenicity', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*physiology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/9780470715444.ch11 [doi]'],ppublish,Ciba Found Symp. 1983;94:174-95. doi: 10.1002/9780470715444.ch11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, no reactivity was seen with peripheral blood T lymphocyte or monocytes, or leukemia cells of non-B cell origin. An immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled cell surface proteins was attempted using the anti-B-CLL serum in the presence of Staphylococcus Aureus Cowan 1 (SaCl), and the precipitates were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). A membrane antigen with an apparent molecular weight of 76,000 daltons (P-76) was immunoprecipitated with the anti-B-CLL serum from the lysates of normal B lymphocyte, B-CLL cells and HCL cells. The antigen (P-76) is not composed of disulfide-linked subunits and has no structural relationship with HLA-DR (Ia-like) antigens or other known antigens.

Outcome was compared to that of 23 conventionally treated control patients in second ALL remission who presented to the same institution during the same time period but had no available transplant donor. The 15 BMT patients and 23 control patients had similar characteristics, with the exception that the BMT patients were significantly older at the time of ALL diagnosis (12.6 yr versus 5.7 yr, p = 0.01). BMT patients had a significantly increased chance of remaining disease-free for 36 mo from time on study (43% actuarial versus 5%, p = 0.004) and a greater overall survival rate at 48 mo (47% actuarial versus 9%, p = 0.27) than the conventionally treated patients. In all, 5 of the bone marrow transplant patients (33%) remain alive and free of disease 24-48 + mo from transplantation. Several pre- and posttransplant characteristics were analyzed to determine predictive factors for a successful BMT outcome for patients with ALL in second or subsequent remission. Significant risk factors for predicting leukemic relapse included initial white blood count (WBC) greater than 50,000/microliters at ALL diagnosis (100% relapse rate versus 37% for patients with lower WBCs, p = 0.001) and presence of any extramedullary disease pre-BMT (100% relapse rate versus 37% for patients without extramedullary disease, p = 0.03). All 5 disease-free BMT survivors had initial WBCs less than 50,000/microliters and no evidence of extramedullary disease pretransplantation. Maintenance chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and methotrexate was given to four patients starting 100 days after bone marrow transplantation. Use of maintenance chemotherapy was associated with a significantly increased chance of remaining disease free (100% of patients surviving leukemia-free versus 17% for patients not receiving maintenance chemotherapy, p = 0.02). Presence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) did not influence leukemia-free survival. These results confirm that intensive therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with ALL in second or subsequent remission who have a histocompatible sibling match. Furthermore, the data suggest that a controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance chemotherapy post-BMT for ALL patients is warranted.","['Woods, W G', 'Nesbit, M E', 'Ramsay, N K', 'Krivit, W', 'Kim, T H', 'Goldman, A', 'McGlave, P B', 'Kersey, J H']","['Woods WG', 'Nesbit ME', 'Ramsay NK', 'Krivit W', 'Kim TH', 'Goldman A', 'McGlave PB', 'Kersey JH']",['eng'],"['P01-CA15548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA25097/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/etiology', 'Quality of Life', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1983/06/01 00:00,1983/06/01 00:01,['1983/06/01 00:00'],"['1983/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85593-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1983 Jun;61(6):1182-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to transplant the recipients were exposed to a dose of total body irradiation that was large, but lower than that required to eliminate all hematopoietic precursors, such that GvL activity of the donor marrow would be necessary to avoid leukemic relapse. Total relapse within 60 days was observed when the syngeneic SJL/J donors were used. Transplantation either of the H-2b C57BL/10 or the H-2s B10.S marrow resulted in approximately 50% unrelapsed survival at 4 months. In contrast, only 26% unrelapsed survival was obtained with H-2b 129/J marrow.

Peptides generated by endopeptidases and purified by HPLC were subjected to semi-automated Edman degradation. Dipeptides obtained with dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The amino acid sequence of the first 16-residue segment of Rauscher p15 is identical to the sequence of Moloney p15 except for a single amino acid substitution (Gly-->Asp) at position 13. Both proteins were found to have an acylated NH(2) terminus. By mass spectroscopy, myristic acid [CH(3)(CH(2))(12)COOH] was found to be bound through an amide linkage to the NH(2)-terminal glycyl residue in both p15s. The results of liquid chromatography show that the NH(2)-terminal myristyl group greatly contributes to the strong binding of these modified proteins and peptides to hydrophobic surfaces. Because p15 is known to be derived from the NH(2)-terminal region of a precursor polyprotein Pr65(gag) by proteolytic cleavage in the assembled virus, it is suggested that myristylation in vivo takes place during the biosynthesis of Pr65(gag). Preliminary data indicate that such modification of gag precursor polyproteins may be common to mammalian retroviruses. The role of NH(2)-terminal myristyl acylation of Pr65(gag) in virus assembly and the possibility of similar NH(2)-terminal modifications of gag-related fusion proteins of transforming viruses are discussed.","['Henderson, L E', 'Krutzsch, H C', 'Oroszlan, S']","['Henderson LE', 'Krutzsch HC', 'Oroszlan S']",['eng'],['N01-CO-75380/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Myristic Acids)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0I3V7S25AW (Myristic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.15.- (dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase)']",IM,"['Acylation', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Endopeptidases', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', '*Genes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Glycosaminoglycans/genetics', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Myristic Acid', 'Myristic Acids/*analysis', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Rauscher Virus/*genetics', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.80.2.339 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1983 Jan;80(2):339-43. doi: 10.1073/pnas.80.2.339.,,,PMC393372,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term results of two trials.,81-92,"Eighty-eight children younger than 15 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were treated with two similar protocols. Both regimens consist of multidrug combinations, with CNS prophylaxis. Sixty-four patients were enrolled on first protocol 0171 with vincristine and prednisone induction therapy. After remission induction patients were randomized on two arms: regimen A which consists of intensive courses of methotrexate with vincristine and prednisone reinductions and administration of cyclophosphamide. Regimen B is similar to regimen A, only courses of methotrexate are alternated with courses of 6-mercaptopurine during consolidation and intensification therapy. In maintenance phase both regimens have daily administration of 6-mercaptopurine and twice weekly administration of methotrexate, with vincristine and prednisone reinductions. The second protocol 0276/A is similar to regimen B of protocol 0171, but L-asparaginase is administered in the end of induction phase and total duration of therapy since induction of complete remission is prolonged from 2.5 to 4 years. Complete remission rate ranged from 92 to 96% in the patients achieving complete remission. In protocol 0171 actuarial proportion of children alive in complete remission for more than 10 years is 60% at present. The actual median survival of all children treated with protocol 0171 is 46+ months and actual median duration of complete remission is 43+ months. There was no significant difference between patients treated with methotrexate alone and those treated with combination of methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine during consolidation and intensification phase. In protocol 0171 the relapse rate was 28% and the death rate in complete remission was 15%. More than 70% of complete responders in protocol 0276 is in continuous complete remission from 2+ to 57+ months, relapse rate is only 4% at present and the death rate in complete remission is 9% in this protocol.","['Cap, J', 'Koza, I', 'Misikova, Z', 'Foltinova, A', 'Strbakova, E']","['Cap J', 'Koza I', 'Misikova Z', 'Foltinova A', 'Strbakova E']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Random Allocation', 'Recurrence']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1983;30(1):81-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A report of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Gene-Tox Program.,283-385,"The literature on cell transformation by chemical carcinogens has been critically reviewed. This subject is highly relevant to carcinogenesis in vivo, because the phenotypic changes that are collectively referred to as cell transformation usually involve the acquisition of tumorigenicity on inoculation into suitable rodent hosts. The systems chosen for review fall into 3 categories: cell strains (cells with a limited lifespan); cell lines (cells with an unlimited lifespan); and oncogenic viral-chemical interactions involving cells (Fischer rat embryo cells expressing an endogenous retrovirus, mouse embryo cells expressing the AKR leukemia virus, chemical enhancement of a simian adenovirus, SA7 transformation of Syrian hamster or rat embryo cells). Of the entire literature reviewed, 117 papers have been accepted for data abstraction by pre-defined criteria; these include 41 references to cell strains, 40 in cell lines, and 38 in viral-chemical interactions including cells. Because different systems have been reviewed, it would be meaningless to group all the compounds. The overall summary of the systems is as follows (many compounds have been tested in more than one system and, hence, are duplicated in these totals). (Chart: see text) In general, there is a reasonably good correlation between the results of the cell transformation systems and in vivo carcinogenesis. However, the many deficiencies of the EPA Merged Carcinogen List preclude definitive comparisons. Moreover, a number of 'false negatives' were obtained in systems that did not employ external metabolic activation. Further validation of all systems is required, but it seems very probable that several cell transformation systems will become valuable in assaying (with reasonable time and cost) the carcinogenic potential of environmental chemicals.","['Heidelberger, C', 'Freeman, A E', 'Pienta, R J', 'Sivak, A', 'Bertram, J S', 'Casto, B C', 'Dunkel, V C', 'Francis, M W', 'Kakunaga, T', 'Little, J B', 'Schechtman, L M']","['Heidelberger C', 'Freeman AE', 'Pienta RJ', 'Sivak A', 'Bertram JS', 'Casto BC', 'Dunkel VC', 'Francis MW', 'Kakunaga T', 'Little JB', 'Schechtman LM']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Carcinogens', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cocarcinogenesis', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', '*Government Agencies', 'Mutagenicity Tests/methods', 'Retroviridae/growth & development', 'United States', '*United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Virus Activation']",1983/04/01 00:00,1983/04/01 00:01,['1983/04/01 00:00'],"['1983/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-1110(83)90036-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1110(83)90036-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1983 Apr;114(3):283-385. doi: 10.1016/0165-1110(83)90036-2.,250,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Model for immunodeficiency.,4226-31,"From human CCRF-CEM T-cells growing in continuous culture, we have selected, isolated, and characterized a clonal cell line, APHID-D2, with altered ribonucleotide reductase activity. In comparative growth rate experiments, the APHID-D2 cell line is less sensitive than the parental cell line to growth inhibition by deoxyadenosine in the presence of 10 microM erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine, an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase. The APHID-D2 cell line has elevated levels of all four dNTPs. The resistance of the APHID-D2 cell line to growth inhibition by deoxyadenosine and the abnormal dNTP levels can be explained by the fact that the APHID-D2 ribonucleotide reductase, unlike the parental ribonucleotide reductase, is not normally sensitive to inhibition by dATP. These results suggest that the allosteric site of ribonucleotide reductase which binds both dATP and ATP is altered in the APHID-D2 line. The isolation of a mutant clone of human T-cells which contains a ribonucleotide reductase that has lost its normal sensitivity to dATP and which is resistant to deoxyadenosine-mediated growth inhibition suggests that a primary pathogenic target of accumulated dATP in lymphocytes from patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency may be the cellular ribonucleotide reductase.","['Waddell, D', 'Ullman, B']","['Waddell D', 'Ullman B']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Deoxyguanosine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/deficiency', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology', 'Models, Biological', 'Phenotype', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology']",1983/04/10 00:00,1983/04/10 00:01,['1983/04/10 00:00'],"['1983/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)32610-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1983 Apr 10;258(7):4226-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blocking occurred at the level of the effector cells and in the presence of subsaturating concentrations of antibody. Both reagents also inhibited lysis of K562 cells, mediated by natural killer cells. These blocking effects differ from the inhibitory effects of monoclonal anti-HLA ABC and anti-suppressor cytotoxic T cell antibodies which inhibit only HLA-restricted lysis when present in saturating amounts.

Both concanavalin A- and antigen-induced lymphokines showed the differentiation-inducing factor (D factor) activity. However, macrophage migration inhibitory factor/ macrophage activation factor (MIF/MAF) purified by an immunoadsorbent column with anti-MIF antibody had no such an activity. The D-factor activity was detected in the lymphokine preparation that was not retained on the immunoadsorbent column. In contrast, colony-stimulating factor (CSF) was adsorbed to the immunoadsorbent column, and could be recovered in the purified MIF/MAF preparation. These findings suggest that the molecular entity of D factor is distinct from MIF/ MAF and CSF. A culture supernatant of guinea pig peritoneal macrophages activated with MIF/ MAF (CSF) exhibited strong D-factor activity. However, the supernatant possessed rather reduced CSF activity as compared to that of the original MIF/MAF (CSF) preparation.

These results suggest that tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycoprotein biosynthesis, might be able to alter tumor cell growth and immunogenicity provided that host liver toxicity is diminished.","['Morin, M J', 'Bernacki, R J']","['Morin MJ', 'Bernacki RJ']",['eng'],['CA 13038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'N08U5BOQ1K (Glucosamine)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Glucosamine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Immune Tolerance/radiation effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mannose/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Protein Precursors/biosynthesis', 'Tunicamycin/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1983/04/01 00:00,1983/04/01 00:01,['1983/04/01 00:00'],"['1983/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Apr;43(4):1669-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dose-response was well fitted by the expression aD2e-lambda D (D = dose) in agreement with induction at the cellular level in proportion to D2 over the whole dose range 0.25-6.0 Gy. The factor e-lambda D accounts for the inescapable concomitant inactivating action of the inducing irradiation.

Occurrence in recipients of bone marrow transplants.,281-8,"Nosocomial pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 occurred in five patients after bone marrow transplantation for hematologic malignancies. Two patients died as a result of the infection despite treatment with erythromycin. Serologic screening revealed no other cases of Legionnaires' disease in 40 consecutive recipients of bone marrow transplants, giving a frequency of infection of 13 percent. These five cases represent 23 percent of the pneumonia occurring in this group of patients. Patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation are highly susceptible to infectious complications.

Satake, P. N. McMillan, and R. B. Luftig (1981), Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 78, 6266). gp70, one of the two env gene products, exhibited a multiple-dot fluorescent pattern on the external surface of infected cells, while p30, one of the gag gene products, exhibited a diffuse fluorescence pattern which was apparently derived from Pr65gag molecules associated with the cytoplasmic face of the cell membrane. We have now examined the membrane fluorescence patterns of p15E, the other env gene product, as well as p15, p12, and p10, the other gag gene products. In these studies, both multivalent and monoclonal antibodies as well as fluorescein- and rhodamine-conjugated probes were used. We found that: (i) each of the env gene products, gp70 and p15E, exhibited characteristic and distinctive multiple-dot staining patterns. Further, each protein was labeled on intact cells with 125I-protein A plus homologous antiserum, confirming that both gp70 and p15E had externally exposed antigenic determinants. (ii) Among the gag gene products, p15 exhibited a different membrane fluorescence pattern than the diffuse pattern seen with p30, p12, and p10. The p15 pattern had an additional multiple-dot component. (iii) By double immunofluorescence we observed that the p15E and p15 multiple-dot patterns were superimposable at the same loci on infected cells. These three results suggest, first, that the cleavage of gp70 and p15E occurs prior to the arrival of the env polyprotein precursor at the cell surface and, second, there is an association between p15E and p15 antigenic determinants at the cell membrane. This latter association between an env and a gag gene product may be important for viral assembly.","['Satake, M', 'Luftig, R B']","['Satake M', 'Luftig RB']",['eng'],['CA-28077/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*immunology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Formaldehyde', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Staphylococcal Protein A', 'Viral Envelope Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/analysis/*immunology']",1983/01/30 00:00,1983/01/30 00:01,['1983/01/30 00:00'],"['1983/01/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/30 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(83)90343-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1983 Jan 30;124(2):259-73. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(83)90343-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efficacy of passive serum therapy of Friend leukemia virus-induced disease in immunocompromised mice.,311-22,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the passive therapy of Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV)-induced disease with chimpanzee anti-F-MuLV serum is accompanied by the development of host antiviral humoral and cellular immunity, the latter measurable in adoptive transfer protocols and by the ability of serum-protected mice to resist virus rechallenge. The present study was designed to further examine the contribution of various compartments of the host immune system to serum therapy itself, as well as to the acquired antiviral immunity that develops in serum-protected mice, through the use of naturally immunocompromised animals [e.g., nude athymic mice and natural killer (NK)-deficient beige mutant mice] or mice treated with immunoabrogating agents such as sublethal irradiation, cyclophosphamide [Cytoxan (Cy)], cortisone, and 89Sr. The studies in nude mice indicate that while mature T-cells are not needed for effective serum therapy, they do appear to be necessary for the long-term resistance of serum-protected mice to virus rechallenge and for the generation of the cell population(s) responsible for adoptive transfer of antiviral immunity. Furthermore, this acquired resistance is not due to virus neutralization by serum antibodies since antibody-negative, Cy-treated, serum-protected mice still reject the secondary virus infection. Lastly, while the immunocompromise systems examined did effect various host antiviral immune responses, none of them, including the NK-deficient beige mutation, significantly diminished the efficacy of the passive serum therapy of F-MuLV-induced disease.","['Genovesi, E V', 'Livnat, D', 'Collins, J J']","['Genovesi EV', 'Livnat D', 'Collins JJ']",['eng'],['5T32CA-09111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Strontium Radioisotopes)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'V27W9254FZ (Cortisone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cortisone/pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Strontium Radioisotopes', 'Tumor Virus Infections/therapy', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1983/02/01 00:00,1983/02/01 00:01,['1983/02/01 00:00'],"['1983/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1983 Feb;70(2):311-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antiserum was tested for possible inhibition of monocyte killing of three tumour cell lines--L929, K562 and A549. Inhibition was complete with L929, partial with K562 and insignificant with A549. Thus the contribution of the cytotoxin to monocyte killing of tumour cells depends upon the tumour line under test.

Cytotoxin could be quantitatively removed from monocyte supernatants by Sepharose-bound, anticytotoxin antibody.

Criteria for the common type were developed and, in general, confirm previous studies. However, the importance of evaluating nuclear cytology and mitotic rate are stressed. Organ infiltration by chronic lymphocytic leukemia should be excluded by the absence of an absolute peripheral lymphocytosis. In addition to the ten cases presented, the literature on 175 previous cases is summarized. GPL is estimated to account for 10-15% of all gastric lymphoid tumors. In comparison to gastric lymphoma, GPL is usually smaller in size and occurs a decade earlier on the average. Since an associated focal lymphoma was documented in an additional five cases, this study proposes that pseudolymphoma be considered a precursor lesion with malignant potential. Extensive pathologic sampling and total surgical excision are recommended.","['Brooks, J J', 'Enterline, H T']","['Brooks JJ', 'Enterline HT']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia/pathology', 'Intestine, Small/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology/surgery', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitotic Index', 'Stomach/pathology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery']",1983/02/01 00:00,1983/02/01 00:01,['1983/02/01 00:00'],"['1983/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19830201)51:3<476::aid-cncr2820510320>3.0.co;2-s [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1983 Feb 1;51(3):476-86. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19830201)51:3<476::aid-cncr2820510320>3.0.co;2-s.,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to reduce these failures, we investigated the use of a radiolabeled antiglobulin technique for platelet crossmatching. The principle of the test is that of an indirect Coombs test using 125I labeled goat anti-human IgG. Incompatibility is determined by calculating a radioactivity antiglobulin test (RAGT) index. Using this technique, we performed 89 crossmatches on 19 leukemic or aplastic patients who were refractory to random donor platelets and receiving varying degrees of HLA-matched platelets. Effectiveness of the transfusion was assessed from the posttransfusion corrected platelet count increment (CCI) determined at 1 and 20 hr. When the RAGT index was 1.9 or less, the mean CCI at 1 lhr was 17,570 +/- 7003/cu mm, n = 55. When the RAGT index was 2.0 or greater, the mean CCI was 4237 +/- 4100/cu mm, n = 34. At 20 hr when the RAGT index was 1.9 or less, the mean CCI was 8722 +/- 3143/cu mm, n = 33, and when the index was 2.0 or greater, the mean CCI was 571 +/- 1286/cu mm, n = 23. Using this technique, one false negative resulted. Nine positive crossmatches with good increments at 1 hr were found; at 20 hr, however, the survival of these units was zero.

In rats, both at an early stage of disease and in an advanced stage after remission-induction with 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, treatment with cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg i.p.) followed by either acute, unfractionated TBI (900 centigrays) or fractionated TBI (200 centigrays for seven doses; 450 centigrays for three doses) achieved cure in 90 to 100% and 75% of the animals, respectively. The remaining rats died from treatment-related toxicity despite isologous bone marrow transplantation. Applying the cyclophosphamide-TBI treatment regimens in advanced stage leukemia (tumor load, 5 X 10(9) cells) resulted in death from leukemia relapse in the majority of rats (71%). From the increase in life span after treatment, it was deduced that a 9-log leukemic cell kill was achieved at the most. There was no significant difference between the regimens using fractionated or unfractionated TBI. Toxicity-related deaths occurred mainly in the TBI group receiving 450 centigrays for three doses (38%). In another approach, (repeated) low-dose cyclophosphamide was given subsequent to high-dose cyclophosphamide-TBI treatment applied in advanced stage leukemia. This proved to be effective in eradicating residual leukemia in 80 to 90% of the rats without destroying the bone marrow graft. In general, the outcome of the various treatment regimens was predictable through accurate information on the tumor load at various stages of disease. The major obstacle in extrapolating the present experimental results to clinical practice is the lack of similar quantitative data in human leukemia.","['Hagenbeek, A', 'Martens, A C']","['Hagenbeek A', 'Martens AC']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Jan;43(1):408-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of them are localized near the breakpoints of specific chromosomal aberrations occurring in various neoplasms, as for example the Philadelphia translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11), in chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML). Recently, we localized the human c-abl oncogene to chromosome region 9q34 and demonstrated a translocation of this gene to the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1,22q-) in various forms of Ph1-positive, but not Ph1-negative, chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML). Another human oncogene, c-sis, is located on chromosome 22 and was recently reported to be transferred to chromosome 9q+ in one CML patient. We have now studied 2 CML patients with classic and variant types of Ph1 translocation, one Ph1-negative case, and a healthy control using in situ hybridization of a c-sis probe to metaphase chromosomes. These studies show that c-sis: (1) is localized to region 22q12.3-q13.1, far away from the breakpoint region 22q11 in CML, (2) segregates with the translocated part of chromosome 22 to different chromosomes in Ph1-positive patients, and (3) remains on chromosome 22 in the Ph1-negative case. Therefore, these data give no support for an active role of the c-sis gene in the generation of CML. Thus, if either of these two oncogenes is involved in the development of Ph1-positive CML, c-abl appears to be the more important one.","['Bartram, C R', 'de Klein, A', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Grosveld, G', 'Heisterkamp, N', 'Groffen, J']","['Bartram CR', 'de Klein A', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Grosveld G', 'Heisterkamp N', 'Groffen J']",['eng'],['CO-75380/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Oncogenes', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84489-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 Jan;63(1):223-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is proposed that chromosomal rearrangements play a central role in human neoplasia and may exert their effects through related genomic mechanisms.

These mutants also accumulated intracellular core protein precursor, Pr65gag, at 39 degrees, the nonpermissive temperature. At 39 degrees, virions released from cells infected with the various ts mutants also contained elevated levels of Pr65gag relative to virions released at 33 degrees, the permissive temperature. Detergent extraction of pulse-labeled cells with Nonidet P-40 (NP-40) generated an NP-40-insoluble cytoskeleton-enriched fraction. Reextraction of this fraction with deoxycholate followed by gel electrophoresis of solubilized, immunoprecipitated viral proteins showed that in Moloney MuLV (Mo-MuLV) ts3-infected cells, and in Rauscher MuLV (R-MuLV) ts17- and ts24-infected cells, increased amounts of intracellular viral Pr65gag rapidly become associated with the cytoskeleton-enriched fraction during pulse labeling at nonpermissive temperature. Furthermore, examination of cell extracts from chase-incubated cells infected with these ts mutants revealed that Pr65gag accumulated in the cytoskeleton-enriched fraction at 39 degrees but not at 33 degrees. During steady-state labeling, as much as half of the intracellular Pr65gag becomes associated with the cytoskeleton-enriched fraction (i.e., is not solubilized by NP-40) at 39 degrees. At permissive temperature only 10-15% of the intracellular Pr65gag is cytoskeleton associated. In contrast, cells infected with R-MuLV ts25 or ts26 showed little or no preferential localization of Pr65gag in the cytoskeleton-enriched cell fraction during a short pulse at 39 degrees, but Pr65gag accumulated in both the NP-40-soluble and -insoluble fractions during a chase incubation relative to the condition at 33 degrees.

BALB/Mo and V+ Bc1 mice showed accelerated lymphoma development; similar results were obtained in BALB/Mo mice receiving one or two doses of urethane transplacentally. Lung adenomas developed with shorter latency and higher incidence in BALB/Mo mice given urethane at birth; however, significant differences in the incidence of lung adenomas in BALB/Mo mice were found only in two experiments. Additional short-term experiments were carried out to investigate the mechanism of the higher susceptibility to sister chromatid exchange induction observed in BALB/Mo lymphocytes. It was found that BALB/Mo spleen lymphocytes incubated with cordycepin, an antiviral antibiotic, with or without mitomycin C treatment, showed reduction in both M-MuLV synthesis and sister chromatid exchange frequency, and the latter values were similar to those seen in control cultures. These data suggest that the integration of M-MuLV proviral DNA into the host genome is per se not sufficient to increase the susceptibility to carcinogenic stimuli, but that other events, such as viral gene expression and amplification, are most likely required for the chemical-viral synergistic effect to occur.","['Chieco-Bianchi, L', 'Aldovini, A', 'Ronchese, F', 'De Rossi, A', 'Majone, F', 'Montaldi, A', 'Levis, A G']","['Chieco-Bianchi L', 'Aldovini A', 'Ronchese F', 'De Rossi A', 'Majone F', 'Montaldi A', 'Levis AG']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Toxicol Pathol,Toxicologic pathology,7905907,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '3IN71E75Z5 (Urethane)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Adenoma/*chemically induced/microbiology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', '*Cocarcinogenesis', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Lung Neoplasms/*chemically induced/microbiology', 'Lymphoma/*chemically induced/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/microbiology/ultrastructure', 'Urethane/toxicity']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/019262338401200410 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Pathol. 1984;12(4):361-8. doi: 10.1177/019262338401200410.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antibodies, BL13 and BL14, were found to be specific for B cells, since they did not react on red cells, platelets, granulocytes, monocytes or T lymphocytes. BL14-associated antigen was present on most of the circulating and tissular B cells, whereas that detected by BL13 was mainly restricted to a subpopulation preferentially homed in germinal centers of secondary follicles of lymph nodes and tonsils, which did not circulate under normal conditions and disappeared once B cells were activated by mitogens. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that BL13 precipitated an antigen of approximately 160,000 d. Pathological studies confirmed the specificity of BL13 and BL14 antibodies for B lymphocytes, since they never reacted with non-B malignancies. BL14 bound to nearly all malignant B-cell proliferations except very immature and plasmacytoma cells. In contrast, BL13 was always found to be negative on acute lymphocytic leukaemias, prolymphocytic leukaemias, hairy cell leukaemias and plasma cells, whereas it detected 40-50% of chronic lymphocytic leukaemias and Burkitt or non-Burkitt lymphomas.

DNA from cell lines without any detectable levels of IgM mu exhibited embryonic as well as rearranged JH genes, whereas cells expressing IgM possess, in addition, productive and non-productive light chain gene rearrangements. The most terminally differentiated cell possesses JH and CK rearrangement associated with the synthesis of mu and kappa chains. Presumably the cells with rearranged JH and CK genes without immunoglobulin synthesis represent a developmental transition. We conclude that cells transformed by R-MuLV belonged to five step-wise compartments of B cell development. Our findings implicate definite sequential events of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and expression during B cell development.","['Balachandran, R', 'Reddy, E P', 'Dunn, C Y', 'Aaronson, S A', 'Swan, D C']","['Balachandran R', 'Reddy EP', 'Dunn CY', 'Aaronson SA', 'Swan DC']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*microbiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Genes', 'Immunoglobulins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Oncogenes', 'Rauscher Virus/*genetics', 'Virus Replication']",1984/12/20 00:00,1984/12/20 00:01,['1984/12/20 00:00'],"['1984/12/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/20 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1984 Dec 20;3(13):3199-207.,,,PMC557838,,,,,,,,,,,,

This variation is restricted to T-cell tumors. Plasmacytomas bearing the specific translocation t(12;15) show a normal early replication banding pattern of chromosome 15. In T-cell tumors all three chromosomes 15 of one cell are of the same variant banding type. In hybrids between tumor and nontumor cells, the number of cells expressing the variant early replication banding pattern is related to the degree of malignancy. Chromosomes 15 in one cell never expressed the variant and the normal banding pattern simultaneously. All five to six chromosomes 15 from one hybrid cell are of the same banding type irrespective of their parental origin. With respect to the type of early replication banding pattern, there is complete reversibility; tumor-parent-derived chromosomes 15 change to normal, and normal-parent-derived chromosomes 15 change to tumor.","['Somssich, I E', 'Spira, J', 'Hameister, H', 'Klein, G']","['Somssich IE', 'Spira J', 'Hameister H', 'Klein G']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Chromosoma,Chromosoma,2985138R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Hybrid Cells/*cytology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/pathology', 'Metaphase', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00286483 [doi]'],ppublish,Chromosoma. 1984;91(1):39-45. doi: 10.1007/BF00286483.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients had abnormal clones in 30-100% of the cells analysed. Chromosomes more frequently involved were Nos. 1, 3, 6, 11, 12, 13 and 14. The most common abnormality was a marker 14q+ (breakpoint 14q32) seen in 17 cases; trisomy 12 was observed in seven cases. A clinical scoring system was used to investigate the correlation of chromosome abnormalities with prognosis. The group with 14q+ was often associated with features of progressive disease, namely; prolymphocytoid or Richter transformation, refractoriness to therapy, high WBC and advanced staging. A significant difference in survival was observed between patients with 14q+ and the rest: median survival from diagnosis being 45 months and over 64 months, respectively (P less than 0.05); when survival was calculated from the time of chromosome analysis the values were 8 months and more than 41 months, respectively (P less than 0.01). It is suggested that 14q+ is acquired during the evolution of CLL and that this development may be a key event in the clinical progression of B-CLL.

Karyologic analysis of this cell line indicates that it carries an 8;14 and a 14;18 chromosome translocation, which are characteristic of Burkitt lymphoma and of follicular lymphoma, respectively. This cell line is Epstein-Barr virus antigen-negative, reacts with monoclonal antibodies specific for B cells, and contains rearranged immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes, but does not express human immunoglobulins. In this cell line, both mu heavy chain constant (C mu) loci are rearranged within the joining (JH) DNA segment. One of the JH segments on one of the 14q+ chromosomes is rearranged with a segment of chromosome 8, where the c-myc oncogene resides, while the other is rearranged with a segment of chromosome 18 where a putative oncogene, which we have called bcl-2, is located. The c-myc oncogene, which is translocated to one of the 14q+ chromosomes, is in its germ-line configuration more than 14 kilobases away from both the JH segment and the heavy chain enhancer that is located between the JH and mu switch region. Based on these findings, we propose a model of some aspects of B-cell oncogenesis according to which B-cell neoplasms carrying translocations involving the heavy chain loci on both human chromosomes 14 are the result of a multiple step process.","['Pegoraro, L', 'Palumbo, A', 'Erikson, J', 'Falda, M', 'Giovanazzo, B', 'Emanuel, B S', 'Rovera, G', 'Nowell, P C', 'Croce, C M']","['Pegoraro L', 'Palumbo A', 'Erikson J', 'Falda M', 'Giovanazzo B', 'Emanuel BS', 'Rovera G', 'Nowell PC', 'Croce CM']",['eng'],"['CA16685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36521/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosomes, Human, 13-15', '*Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics/immunology', 'Oncogenes', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.81.22.7166 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1984 Nov;81(22):7166-70. doi: 10.1073/pnas.81.22.7166.,,,PMC392098,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial experiments examined the in vivo growth of adoptively transferred T cells previously cultured long term with IL-2, since in vitro such long-term cultured T cells are exquisitely dependent on exogenous IL-2 for proliferation and survival. To identify and quantify donor T cells in vivo, experiments were performed with donor and host mice congenic for the T cell marker Thy 1. Host mice receiving congenic long-term cultured immune T cells were inoculated daily with purified IL-2 beginning on the day of cell transfer, and donor T cells within host ascites, spleen, and lymph nodes were enumerated at selected points in time. The experiments demonstrated that exogenous IL-2 induced in vivo growth of long-term cultured T cells proportional to the dose of IL-2 administered. Similar IL-2 regimens induced the in vivo growth and augmented the function of donor T cells that had been activated to express IL-2 receptors in vitro by 5-day culture with antigen but had not been cultured with exogenous IL-2. Thus, prior adaptation to growth with exogenous IL-2 in vitro is not necessary to render T cells responsive to IL-2 in vivo. In contrast to long-term cultured T cells in vivo (which died rapidly in vivo without exogenous IL-2), noncultured donor T cells proliferated in vivo in response to antigen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Cheever, M A', 'Thompson, J A', 'Kern, D E', 'Greenberg, P D']","['Cheever MA', 'Thompson JA', 'Kern DE', 'Greenberg PD']",['eng'],"['CA00791/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Response Mod,Journal of biological response modifiers,8219656,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Response Mod. 1984 Oct;3(5):462-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With this assay, we showed first that CALLA was released in culture fluids from NALM-1 and Daudi cell lines but was absent from culture fluids from CALLA negative cell lines. Then, we found that the sera of 34 out of 42 patients (81%) with untreated common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (c-ALL) contained higher CALLA levels than any of the 42 serum samples from healthy controls. The specificity of these results was further demonstrated by testing in parallel the sera from 48 patients with CALLA negative leukemias, including 26 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 12 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and 10 acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL). All of these sera gave negative results, except for one patient with AUL, who had a significantly elevated circulating CALLA level, and one patient with AML, who had a borderline CALLA level, 3 SD over the mean of the normal sera. Preliminary results suggest that circulating CALLA is associated with membrane fragments or vesicles, since the total CALLA antigenic activity was recovered in the pellet of the serum samples centrifuged at 100,000 g. In addition, the CALLA-positive pellets contained an enzyme considered as a membrane marker, 5'-nucleotidase.

A majority of differentiated (DMSO- or retinoic acid-treated) but not undifferentiated cells formed rosettes with C3b-coated erythrocytes and were morphologically mature granulocytes. HL-60 cells were surface- or biosynthetically labeled and then solubilized in 1% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of multiple protease inhibitors. The C3bR was isolated either by immunoprecipitation with anti-C3bR antibodies or by affinity chromatography with hemolytically inactive components in which the internal thioester bond within the alpha-chain was cleaved (iC3)- or iC4-Sepharose. Autoradiographs of NaDodSO4-polyacrylamide gels indicated that the surface-labeled C3bR on the differentiated cells had an Mr of 210,000 (nonreduced) or 240,000 (reducing conditions). The bulk (approximately 85%) of the radiolabeled material that was isolated from biosynthetically labeled cells co-migrated with the surface-labeled band. A small fraction (approximately 15%) of the biosynthetically labeled material that was isolated by affinity chromatography or immunoprecipitation had an Mr of 188,000, which did not correspond to any surface-labeled band. This putative precursor molecule was characterized by pulse-chase experiments and by analysis of its carbohydrate. In pulse-chase (15-min pulse) studies of differentiated cells, only the 188,000-mol wt molecule was detected at 0 h. By 2 h, greater than 80% of counts had chased from the 188,000 to the 210,000-mol wt molecule. Treatment of these two molecules with endoglycosidases indicated that the 188,000-mol wt molecule possessed high mannose oligosaccharides, while the mature C3bR had complex oligosaccharides. We conclude from these data that the 188,000-mol wt molecule is a precursor of the C3b receptor of HL-60 cells. Other experiments indicated that the half-maximal time for newly synthesized receptor to attain an Mr of 210,000 was 45 min, and that the t1/2 for the disappearance of the receptor on the surface of differentiated HL-60 cells in tissue culture was approximately 10 h. The ability to observe the induction of the C3b receptor as the HL-60 cell line differentiates is an instructive model system to study the biosynthesis of a human integral membrane receptor glycoprotein.","['Atkinson, J P', 'Jones, E A']","['Atkinson JP', 'Jones EA']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Complement C4)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '80295-43-8 (Complement C3b)', '80295-50-7 (Complement C4b)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Complement C3b/metabolism', 'Complement C4/metabolism', 'Complement C4b', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mannose/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Complement/*biosynthesis', 'Rosette Formation']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI111581 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1984 Nov;74(5):1649-57. doi: 10.1172/JCI111581.,,,PMC425342,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was also obvious when T and B cells, both with a single leading lamellipodium, were compared.

Here we report that VEP13 also reacts with the majority of interferon (IFN) activated NK cells. By contrast cytotoxic activity of unstimulated monocytes and cytotoxic T cells directed against allogeneic lymphocytes were unaffected by VEP13 plus complement treatment. Thus among the major types of cytotoxic cells VEP13 selectively reacts with NK cells and hence can be employed to identify these cells. We therefore used VEP13 in complement-dependent lysis and FACS separation to analyse NK cells involved in enhanced killing of fresh leukaemia cells. Spontaneous cell-mediated lysis of human leukaemia cells was enhanced in two ways: (a) effector cells were pre-treated with beta-IFN and (b) leukaemia cells were pre-treated with a pulse of actinomycin D. In complement-dependent lysis VEP13 removed all NK cell activity of IFN activated PBM against untreated and against ActD pre-treated leukaemia cells. FACS separation of VEP13 positive cells further supported this finding, in that all activity of IFN activated NK cells against actinomycin D pre-treated targets was found in the VEP13 positive fraction. Thus enhanced killing of fresh human leukaemia cells appears to be mediated VEP13 positive NK cells which are distinct from cytotoxic T cells and cytotoxic monocytes.","['Ziegler-Heitbrock, H W', 'Futterer, A', 'Rumpold, H', 'Kraft, D', 'Munker, R', 'Riethmuller, G']","['Ziegler-Heitbrock HW', 'Futterer A', 'Rumpold H', 'Kraft D', 'Munker R', 'Riethmuller G']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens/*analysis', 'Cell Separation', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1984 Nov;58(2):470-7.,,,PMC1577081,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ia like antigen negative, null cell type acute lymphocytic leukaemia (Ia- null ALL) are Tp40+, suggesting that this type of ALL belongs to a T cell lineage. T cell ALL (T-ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) were both Tp40+, Ts32+, TsA+ and a half of the cases were Tp120+, but the expression of Tp40 was stronger on LL cells.

Incubation of normal peripheral blood T-cells, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells with an excess of T101 at 37 degrees induced modulation of the T65 antigen. When assayed by indirect immunofluorescence, a change in cellular reactivity with T101 was seen after 1 hr. After 24 hr, normal T-cells showed a 94 +/- 4% (S.D.) decrease in fluorescence, compared to an 82 +/- 6% decrease for chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and a 56 +/- 4% decrease for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells. When T101 was removed from the culture, the cells reexpressed T65. Modulation was inhibited by cold temperatures, suggesting that it is energy dependent. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or T-cell lymphoma have received 24-hr infusions of 3 to 500 mg T101 in therapeutic trials. After infusion, in vivo binding of T101 was observed in 39 of 43 treatments not associated with endogenous host anti-T101 antibodies. T65-target cells were seen in all 39 treatments associated with in vivo bound T101, suggesting that modulation had occurred. When cultured in vitro for 24 hr, these cells reexpressed T65. In vivo, reexpression of T65 occurred following disappearance of the serum T101 titer. The extent and duration of in vivo modulation were related to both the T101 dose and the tumor burden. These data suggest that the rapid rate of antigenic modulation may prevent potential target cell destruction by antibody-mediated cytotoxicity. However, if the process of modulation involves internalization of the antibody:antigen complex, it would be an advantage for the use of cytotoxic immunoconjugates.","['Shawler, D L', 'Miceli, M C', 'Wormsley, S B', 'Royston, I', 'Dillman, R O']","['Shawler DL', 'Miceli MC', 'Wormsley SB', 'Royston I', 'Dillman RO']",['eng'],['N01-CM-07444/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunotherapy', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Skin Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Temperature']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Dec;44(12 Pt 1):5921-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mean value of NK activity of B-CLL T-lymphocytes, tested against the K562 cell line, was significantly depressed (P less than 0.01) in the 20 cases studied, compared with that of normal T-cells. Incubation with human leucocyte interferon produced an increase (P less than 0.05) in NK activity, although the mean value was still significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than that obtained with normal T-cells. Furthermore, the formation of effector-target conjugates was significantly lower (P less than 0.01) among B-CLL T-cells compared with normal T-lymphocytes. Despite the reduced NK functions observed in the majority of B-CLL patients, the capacity of T-cells to react with the monoclonal antibody (MoAb) Leu-7 (HNK-1 clone), assessed in 60 patients, was significantly higher (P less than 0.001) in B-CLL than in normal blood (mean 24% +/- 10.6 SD v 9% +/- 4.2), irrespective of the clinical stage of the disease. These findings suggest that the reduced cytotoxic ability of B-CLL T-lymphocytes may be due either to an expanded population of immature T-cells which already express a cytotoxic-like phenotype (E+, OKT3+, HNK-1+) but which lack adequate cytotoxic functions, or, alternatively, to an intrinsic defect of the natural effectors present within the T-cell population of B-CLL. The T-cell functional abnormalities documented in this study, together with other defective functions previously described, may be implicated in some of the complications frequently associated with B-CLL, particularly the high incidence of secondary neoplasms. There is growing evidence that natural cytotoxicity may play a major role in the immune surveillance system, both against tumour cells and virus-infected cells (Herberman & Ortaldo, 1981). Natural killer (NK) cells are a morphologically homogeneous population of large granular lymphocytes with azurophilic granules in the cytoplasm (Timonen et al, 1981), which are non-adherent and express receptors for the Fc portion of IgG. About 50% of these cells form rosettes with sheep red blood cells (E-rosettes) (West et al, 1977).

The clinical course was chronic in most, and splenic enlargement the main clinical finding; skin involvement and lymphadenopathy were rare. The mean lymphocyte count at presentation was 8 X 10(9)/1 (range 0.75-24 X 10(9)/1). Nineteen of these patients showed some form of cytopenia (18 neutropenia, two red cell aplasia, eight thrombocytopenia) and one had hypogammaglobulinaemia. Seven patients had long-standing arthropathy serologically proven to be rheumatoid arthritis and these had previously been considered to have Felty's syndrome. Five of the group have died (three with an aggressive course), but most have remained stable for prolonged periods with a slow increase in peripheral lymphocyte count and marrow infiltration. Spontaneous regression was never observed but in two patients a prolonged remission was achieved by chemotherapy. The lymphocytes were morphologically and phenotypically homogeneous at presentation and remained so post-splenectomy; they contained azurophilic granules, stained with acid phosphatase but weakly or not at all with alpha napthyl acetate esterase. Membrane phenotyping shows the majority of the cells to be E+, Fc gamma+, OKT3+, OKT8+. Most cells do not stain with OKT1-like reagents and a significant number express HLA-Dr. From these and other reported cases it is clear that this condition represents a distinct entity resulting from the expansion of a subset of cytotoxic/suppressor T cells--the question of the benign or neoplastic nature of the disease remains open. Using T cell-specific antisera and E-rosetting techniques, a small percentage of CLL cases have been shown to be of T-cell origin (TCLL) (Dickler et al, 1973; Lille et al, 1973). Estimates of the percentage vary but in most series T-CLL has been diagnosed in less than 5% (Brouet & Seligmann, 1981), and this is supported by date from the M.R.C.

Amongst the published reports of T-CLL a variety of clinical and morphological entities have been described including T prolymphocytic leukaemia (TPLL) (Brouet et al. 1975) and adult T cell disease in Japanese (Uchiyama et al, 1977) and West Indian Caribbean groups (ATLL) (Catovsky et al, 1982).

The gonadal duct system itself was not invaded. In contrast to an earlier histopathological study with this leukaemia, meningeal invasion has also been encountered during routine passage. Furthermore, subsequent to remissions induced by carmustine (BCNU), relapse could occur as long as 80 days after the 20 day end point in control animals. This was associated with extensive infiltration of the meninges as well as in the male gonadal interstitium, the proximal epididymis being particularly vulnerable. Two doses of carmustine at intervals of one week could eradicate the disease even during the phase of logarithmic growth of the leukaemic cells, this result depending upon the level of treatment and time of dosing post-inoculation with leukaemic cells. Females carrying the disease were shown to be more readily cured than males, probably related to entry of leukaemia cells into the gonadal interstitium. This T-cell leukaemia appears to be an excellent model for the study and prospective chemotherapy of testicular relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Jackson, H', 'Jackson, N C', 'Bock, M', 'Lendon, M']","['Jackson H', 'Jackson NC', 'Bock M', 'Lendon M']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,['U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Carmustine/therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sex Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*pathology']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1984.228 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1984 Nov;50(5):617-24. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1984.228.,,,PMC1976988,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of the cell populations secreted IgM (17/24 patients), identified as pentameric in three cases examined, and free monotypic light chains (23/24 patients) of the same type as the surface Ig. Secretion of IgD (6/21 patients) and IgG (3/21 patients) was found less frequently. The amounts of Ig secreted were variable and there was no significant difference in the patterns of secretion of cells from NHL patients when compared to previous studies of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), nor was there any clear correlation with the histological type. For four of the patients, anti-idiotypic antibody was produced and was used to demonstrate the idiotypic nature of the secreted Ig, and also to show its presence in the serum. The level of idiotypic IgM was measured in one patient during chemotherapy and appeared to correlate well with disease. Such idiotypic Ig must be taken into account when planning treatment of B cell neoplasms with antiidiotypic antibody since it could act as a block to antibody attack. Assessment of the ability of tumour cells to secrete Ig in vitro provides a useful preliminary screen when choosing such patients since a high secretion rate together with extensive disease could lead to unacceptable levels of serum idiotypic Ig.","['Stevenson, F K', 'Gregg, E O', 'Smith, J L', 'Stevenson, G T']","['Stevenson FK', 'Gregg EO', 'Smith JL', 'Stevenson GT']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin D/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulins/*biosynthesis', 'Lymph Nodes/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/biosynthesis']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1984.224 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1984 Nov;50(5):579-86. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1984.224.,,,PMC1976976,,,,,,,,,,,,

The receptor was identified and characterized in mouse and man by using monoclonal antibodies to receptor idiotypes, and consists of two disulphide-linked polypeptides, and acidic alpha-chain and a neutral to slightly basic beta-chain. Peptide maps have shown that, like immunoglobulin, both chains vary for receptors of different specificities. T-cell-derived cDNA clones have recently been identified in mouse and man encoding immunoglobulin-like molecules. These were identified as derived from beta-chain genes through a partial N-terminal protein sequence of the beta-chain isolated from a human T-cell tumour. We have now purified the alpha- and beta-chains of the receptor of the human T-cell leukaemia line HPB-MLT, and have determined the amino acid sequence of several tryptic peptides derived from each chain. Our results further confirm that the previously reported cDNA clones encode beta-chains. The sequence of the alpha-chain peptides identify this as another immunoglobulin-like polypeptide chain. Particularly striking was an alpha-chain peptide with high homology to the conserved portion of the immunoglobulin J segment and T-cell receptor beta-chains.

In addition, T cells can kill target cells through non-MHC antigens, for example, virally infected cells, if the target and effector cells express the same MHC class I antigens. Consequently, quantitative and/or qualitative variations in the expression of the H-2/HLA antigens on the target cells could interfere with MHC-restricted immune reactions. We have reported that the AKR leukaemia cell line K36.16, a subline of K36 (ref. 3), on which the H-2Kk antigen cannot be detected, is resistant to T-cell lysis and grows very easily in AKR mice. Other AKR tumour cell lines, like 369, which have a relatively large amount of H-2Kk on their surface, are easily killed by T cells in vitro and require a much larger inoculum to grow in vivo. Monoclonal antibodies against H-2Kk, but not against H-2Dk, prevented the killing by T cells. This suggests that some tumour cells grow in vivo because tumour-associated antigen(s) cannot be recognized efficiently by the host's immune system, due to the absence of MHC molecules which would function as restriction elements for T-cell cytotoxicity. We have tested this hypothesis by introducing the H-2Kk gene into the H-2Kk-deficient AKR tumour cell line K36.16 and have now demonstrated directly the biological relevance of H-2Kk antigen expression in the regulation of the in vivo growth of this tumour cell line.","['Hui, K', 'Grosveld, F', 'Festenstein, H']","['Hui K', 'Grosveld F', 'Festenstein H']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Genes', '*Graft Rejection', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Plasmids', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1984/10/25 00:00,1984/10/25 00:01,['1984/10/25 00:00'],"['1984/10/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/25 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/311750a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1984 Oct 25-31;311(5988):750-2. doi: 10.1038/311750a0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
